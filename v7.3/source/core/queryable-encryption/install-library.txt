MongoDB uses one of two libraries for translating queries into
encrypted queries, and for encrypting and decrypting data. The latest is
the {+shared-library+}.


Before You Start
----------------

Follow the preceding tasks to :ref:`install a {+qe+} compatible driver
and dependencies <qe-install>` before continuing.

Choose a Library
----------------

.. _qe-reference-shared-library:

{+shared-library+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+shared-library+} is a **dynamic library** that enables your client
application to perform automatic encryption. A dynamic library is a set
of functionality accessed by an application at runtime rather than
compile time. The {+shared-library+} performs the following tasks:

- Reads the :ref:`{+enc-schema+} <qe-encryption-schema>` to determine which fields to encrypt or decrypt
- Prevents your application from executing unsupported operations on
  encrypted fields

The {+shared-library+} *does not* do any of the following:

- Perform data encryption or decryption
- Access the encryption key material
- Listen for data over the network

The {+shared-library+} is a preferred alternative to ``mongocryptd`` and doesn't require you to start another process to perform automatic encryption.

.. _qe-reference-mongocryptd:
.. _qe-mongocryptd:

mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Use the {+shared-library+}

   If you are starting a new project, use the {+shared-library+}. The
   {+shared-library+} replaces ``mongocryptd`` and does not require 
   you to start a new process.

``mongocryptd`` is installed with `MongoDB Enterprise
Server <{+enterprise-download-link+}>`__.

When you create a MongoDB client with {+in-use-encryption+}, the 
``mongocryptd`` process starts automatically by default.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+shared-library+}
      :tabid: {+shared-library+}

      .. _qe-csfle-shared-library-download:
      
      To download the {+shared-library+} from the `MongoDB Download
      Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise>`__, 
      select the version and platform, then the library.

      .. tip::

         To view an expanded list of available releases and packages, see
         `MongoDB Enterprise Downloads <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise/releases>`__.

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step::
            
            In the :guilabel:`Version` dropdown, select ``{+shared-library-version-drop-down+}``.
            
         .. step::
            
            In the :guilabel:`Platform` dropdown, select your platform.

         .. step::

            In the :guilabel:`Package` dropdown, select ``crypt_shared``.

         .. step::
            
            Click :guilabel:`Download`.
      
      .. _qe-csfle-configure-shared-library:
      
      To configure how your driver searches for the {+shared-library+},
      use the following parameters:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1
         :widths: 30 70

         * - Name
           - Description

         * - cryptSharedLibPath
           - Specifies the absolute path to the {+shared-library+}
             package, {+shared-library-package+}.

             *Default*: ``undefined``

         * - cryptSharedLibRequired
           - Specifies if the driver must use the {+shared-library+}. If
             ``true``, the driver returns an error if the
             {+shared-library+} is unavailable. If ``false``, the driver
             performs the following sequence of actions:
             
             #. Attempts to use the {+shared-library+}.
             #. If the {+shared-library+} is unavailable, the driver
                attempts to start and connect to ``mongocryptd``.

             *Default*: ``false``

      To view an example demonstrating how to configure these
      parameters, see the :ref:`Quick Start <qe-quick-start-shared-lib>`.

   .. tab:: mongocryptd
      :tabid: mongocryptd

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step::

            Install ``mongocryptd``:

            .. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-csfle-install-mongocryptd.rst

         .. step::

            Configure the library:

            .. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-csfle-configure-mongocryptd.rst

            Examples

Next Steps
----------

After installing a library, :ref:`create a {+cmk-long+} <qe-create-cmk>`
in your {+kms-long+} of choice.
