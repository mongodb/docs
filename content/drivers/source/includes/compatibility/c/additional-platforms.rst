Other platforms and toolchains are not tested, but we expect similar versions
of the preceding platforms to work. If you encounter a platform or toolchain that you
expect to work and find that it does not, please open a Jira issue describing the
problem, or open a `GitHub Pull Request
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/pulls>`__ to fix it.

.. important::

   Simple pull requests to fix unsupported platforms are welcome, but will be
   considered on a case-by-case basis. Merging a pull request to fix libraries on an
   unsupported platform does not imply full support for that platform.
