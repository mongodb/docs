  calculate the distance. This option is useful when a location field
  contains multiple locations. To specify a field within an

   The minimum distance from the center point that the documents can
   be. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall outside
   the specified distance from the center point.

   Specify the distance in meters for GeoJSON data and in radians for
   legacy coordinate pairs.
