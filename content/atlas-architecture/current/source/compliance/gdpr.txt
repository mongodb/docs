The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of regulations 
that the European Union (EU) adopted to govern how organizations 
collect, store, process, share, and protect personal data in the EU.

Under the GDPR, a data processor is an entity that processes personal 
data on behalf of a data controller. |service-fullname| acts as a data 
processor when data controllers use |service-fullname| to store and 
manage personal data. In this context, you or your end customers 
are data controllers. A data subject is any individual whose 
personal data MongoDB processes on your behalf.

We understand that GDPR compliance is a shared responsibility between 
|service-fullname|, you, and your end customers. |service-fullname| 
provides multiple features that can support you with GDPR compliance.

Data Subject Rights
-------------------

Under GDPR, data subjects have certain rights over their data. These 
include the rights to access their data, receive it in a usable format, 
correct inaccuracies, or request deletion when appropriate.

Right to Erasure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under GDPR, the right to erasure, also known as the right to be 
forgotten, allows a data subject to request the deletion of their 
personal data.

The following |service-fullname| features support compliance in this 
area:

- :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption` including:
  
  - :manual:`Client-Side Field-Level Encryption </core/csfle/>`
  
  - :manual:`Queryable Encryption <l/core/queryable-encryption/>`

- :atlas:`Data interaction </atlas-ui/>` including deletion.

Rights of Access, Portability, and Rectification Rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |service-fullname| features support compliance in this 
area:

- :atlas:`Readable documents </atlas-ui/triggers/functions/read/>`.
- :atlas:`Queryable documents </atlas-ui/query/filter/>`.
- Ability to :atlas:`create, view, update, and delete documents 
  </atlas-ui/documents/>`.
- Ability to :atlas:`query, filter, and retrieve arrays of objects 
  </atlas-search/return-scope/>`.
- Tools for managing your |service-fullname| clusters like the 
  :atlascli:`Atlas CLI </command/atlas/>` ``atlas`` commands.
- Ability to use :driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>` to find documents.

Data Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under GDPR, personal data should generally be stored only for as long 
as it is needed to fulfill the purpose it was collected for.

The following |service-fullname| features support compliance in this 
area:

- :manual:`Data expiration </tutorial/expire-data/>`.
- :atlas:`Backup policies 
  </backup/cloud-backup/configure-backup-policy/>` including snapshot 
  retention time settings.

Securing Personal Data
----------------------

Under GDPR, data controllers and processors are expected to implement 
appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect 
personal data. |service-fullname| can help you to do this through a 
range of security features, including the following features.

Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~

Effective encryption is recognized as one of the most important means 
of securing personal data.

- :ref:`Data encryption <arch-center-data-encryption>` including 
  encryption in transit (TLS), encryption at rest 
  (AES-256, BYOK, CMK, KMS, or TDE), and encryption in use 
  (CSFLE, random encryption, or queryable encryption).

Access Control and Network Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help you implement strong access and authentication controls, and 
robust network security measures, see:

- :ref:`Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>` including UI, 
  database, API, federated, AWS IAM roles, multi-factor, X.508 client 
  certificates, SCRAM passwords, API keys, and secrets management.
- :ref:`Authorization <arch-center-authorization-recs>` including RBAC, 
  pre-defined roles, federated identity providers, and just-in-time 
  access.
- :ref:`Network Security <arch-center-network-security>` including TLS, 
  IP access lists, firewall configuration, private endpoints, and 
  network isolation.

Alerting, Auditing, and Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help you maintain a variety of audit logs and records of processing 
activities that track how personal data is accessed, used, modified, or 
shared, see:

- :ref:`Auditing <arch-center-auditing>` including database auditing, 
  filters, and events.
- :ref:`Monitoring and Alerts <arch-center-monitoring-alerts>`.
- :atlas:`Stream Processing </atlas-stream-processing/>`.

Incident Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To help you maintain an incident response framework that enables you to 
identify, assess, and mitigate risks to personal data, see:

- :atlas:`Third-Party Integrations 
  </tutorial/third-party-service-integrations/>` including Datadog, 
  Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Prometheus, and others.

High Availability and Resilience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help you design systems with high availability and resilience to 
ensure that personal data remains accessible and recoverable, see:

- :ref:`High Availability <arch-center-high-availability>` including 
  database replication and automatic failover.
- :ref:`Disaster Recovery <arch-center-dr>` including recovery point 
  objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO).
