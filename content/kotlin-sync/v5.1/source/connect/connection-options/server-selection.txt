Overview
--------

All MongoDB drivers follow a defined algorithm when selecting a server to read or write
from. By using the ``ClusterSettings`` property of a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, you can
customize this algorithm to choose the server that works best for your application.

.. important::

   Customizing the server selection algorithm might have unintended consequences,
   such as degraded read or write performance.

Server Selection Algorithm
--------------------------

When the {+driver-short+} executes a read operation, it performs the following steps,
in order, to select a MongoDB deployment:

1. Selects all servers from the list of known servers suitable for the requested
   operation, barring those that the driver considers unavailable or problematic

   1. For reads, selects all servers that match the active read preference

   #. For writes, selects all writeable servers

#. Calls the user-defined server-selector function, if the user provides one, and passes in
   the list from the previous step

#. Applies the ``localThreshold`` connection setting to the list of
   servers returned from the function

#. Selects at most two random servers from the list of servers that match the
   preceding criteria, then selects the server with fewer outstanding concurrent operations

When the {+driver-short+} executes a write operation, it begins by selecting all writeable
servers from the list of known servers, not just those that match the active read preference.
The remaining steps are identical to the preceding list.

To learn more about the MongoDB server selection algorithm, see
:manual:`Server Selection Algorithm </core/read-preference-mechanics/>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

Implement Custom Server Selection Logic
---------------------------------------

You can implement your own custom server selection logic by creating a class that
implements the ``ServerSelector`` interface. The following
example shows a simple custom server selection class that selects servers with a ``type``
value of ``ServerType.REPLICA_SET_SECONDARY``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/ServerSelection.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-custom-selector
   :end-before: // end-custom-selector

Use the ``applyToClusterSettings()`` method to pass an instance of this class to your
``MongoClientSettings``. The following example shows how to create
a ``MongoClient`` with an instance of the custom server selector class from the preceding example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/ServerSelection.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-selector
   :end-before: // end-selector
   :dedent:

Use Settings to Configure Server Selection
------------------------------------------

You can specify the following server selection settings in your ``MongoClient`` object or
in your connection URI:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``localThreshold``
     - | The latency window for server eligibility. If a server's round trip takes longer
       | than the fastest server's round-trip time plus this value, the server isn't
       | eligible for selection. You can specify this setting to a ``ClusterSettings`` object
         in addition to the connection URI.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``Integer``
       | **Default**: 15 milliseconds
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``localThresholdMS=0``
       
   * - ``readPreference``
     - | The client's default read-preference settings. For more information on read preference
         options, see :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
         You can specify this setting to a ``MongoClientSettings`` object in addition to the
         connection URI.
       |
       | **Data Type**: `ReadPreference <{+core-api+}/ReadPreference.html>`__
       | **Default**: ``ReadPreference.primary()``
       | **Connection URI Example**:

       .. code-block:: none
          :copyable: false

          readPreference=primaryPreferred
          &maxStalenessSeconds=90
          &readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1

   * - ``serverSelectionTimeout``
     - | The length of time the driver tries to select a server before timing out.
         You can specify this setting to a ``ClusterSettings`` object in addition to the 
         connection URI.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``Long``
       | **Default**: 30 seconds
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS=15000``
