The {+intellij-full+} validates database references in your Java driver or 
Spring Criteria code to ensure that the specified database, collection, or field 
exists in the server.

If you reference a field, collection, or database name that isn't in 
your data source, the plugin shows a warning that indicates the reference 
doesn't exist.

To resolve the warning:

- Ensure that you're connected to the correct data source in the Connections 
  Toolbar.

- Check that you're referencing the correct database and collection in your 
  code. 
  
- Verify that your database or collection contains the field you are trying to 
  reference.

Non-existent Field Name 
------------------------

If you reference a field name that doesn't exist in the collection, the 
{+intellij-short+} raises the following warning: 

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false 

   Field <fieldName> does not exist in collection <collectionName>.

Non-existent Collection Name 
----------------------------

If you reference a collection name that doesn't exist in the database, the 
{+intellij-short+} raises the following warning: 

.. code-block:: none 
   :copyable: false 

   Cannot resolve <collectionName> collection in <dbName> database in the 
   connected data source.

Non-existent Database Name
--------------------------

If you reference a database that doesn't exist in the data source, the 
{+intellij-short+} raises the following warning: 

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Cannot resolve <dbName> database reference in the connected data source. 

Example
-------

The following example references the ``sample_mflix`` database, which contains 
data on movies and movie theaters, from the :ref:`Atlas sample datasets 
<sample-mflix>`.

The sample code attempts to call a ``restaurant_name`` collection:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   public List<Document> getHundredYearOldMovies() {
        return client.getDatabase("sample_mflix")
            .getCollection("restaurant_name")
            .find(Filters.eq("year", 1924))
            .into(new ArrayList<>());
    }

Because the collection doesn't exist in the ``sample_mflix`` database, the 
{+intellij-short+} raises a warning that the collection cannot be resolved:

``Cannot resolve "restaurant_name" collection in "sample_mflix" database in the 
connected data source.``

To resolve the warning, reference a collection that exists in the 
``sample_mflix`` database: 

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   public List<Document> getHundredYearOldMovies() {
        return client.getDatabase("sample_mflix")
            .getCollection("movies")
            .find(Filters.eq("year", 1924))
            .into(new ArrayList<>());
    }
