.. introduction::
    
   Develop lightweight Javascript or TypeScript applications backed by a 
   `MongoDB's Atlas cloud database <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/>`__. 
   Developer integrations like Prisma and Mongoose support your MERN and 
   MEAN stack applications. MongoDB's Node.js driver is written in 
   TypeScript and offers all the quality-of-life improvements modern 
   developers expect, such as predictability, better readability, rich IDE 
   support, and strong type safety.
