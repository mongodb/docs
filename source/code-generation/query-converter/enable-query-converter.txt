You can use Query Converter to convert SQL statements, views, and 
stored procedures to MongoDB syntax. Query Converter considers the 
mapping rules and schema transformations defined in your project when 
converting your SQL code.

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you can use Query Converter, you must sign in to your Atlas
account in Relational Migrator. For details, see :ref:`rm-atlas-log-in`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the Query Converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Read the user agreement

   .. step:: (Optional) Review telemetry preferences

      Telemetry data about source and converted queries is 
      temporarily stored by MongoDB to improve Query Converter. If you don't want your data stored, you can opt out:

      .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-query-converter.rst

   .. step:: Enable Query Converter

      Click :guilabel:`Start Using Query Converter`. 
      The :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane is displayed.
