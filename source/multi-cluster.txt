   :description: Deploy MongoDB replica sets that span two or more Kubernetes clusters in a single region across more than one zone, or in more than one region and zone.

.. important::

   You can deploy |k8s-op-full| to manage MongoDB deployments that span two
   or more |k8s| clusters. The |k8s-op-short| supports deploying only
   replica sets across two or more |k8s| clusters. Deploying sharded
   clusters across two or more |k8s| clusters is not supported.

:ref:`multi-cluster-prereqs`
  Set up |gke| clusters, install tools, set the deployment's scope,
  install the |kubectl-mongodb| and check connectivity across member clusters.

:ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`
  Deploy a MongoDB replica set across three |k8s| member clusters, using
  |gke| and a service mesh.

:ref:`multi-cluster-deploy-replica-set`
