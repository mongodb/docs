To use the |mdb-shell|, you must have a MongoDB deployment to connect
to. 

- For a free cloud-hosted deployment, you can use
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.

- To learn how to run a local MongoDB deployment, see
  :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>`.
