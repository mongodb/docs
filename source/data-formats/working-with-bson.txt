Overview
--------
In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to store and interact
with BSON data by using the ``bsoncxx`` library.  

BSON Data Format 
----------------

MongoDB uses the **BSON**, or Binary JSON, data format to store documents and
make remote procedure calls. This data format includes all JSON data structure types
and supports additional types, including dates, different-sized integers, ``ObjectId``
values, and binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the :manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types/>`
page in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 

.. note::
   
   Avoid adding duplicate keys to BSON documents. Although the `BSON specification <https://bsonspec.org/>`__ 
   allows duplicate keys, they can cause unexpected behavior in {+mdb-server+}.

BSON Values and Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many {+driver-short+} methods accept a BSON document as an argument.
The ``bsoncxx`` library provides two data types that you can use to represent
a BSON document: ``bsoncxx::document::value`` and ``bsoncxx:document::view``. 

A ``document::value`` object represents a BSON document that owns its
underlying buffer of data. When you pass a ``document::value`` object
to a {+driver-short+} method, the method receives a copy of the BSON document
data. When a ``document::value`` object goes out of scope, its underlying buffer is freed.

.. tip::

   You can convert builder types to ``document::value`` types by calling helper
   methods on the builder. To learn more about the builder types, see the :ref:`cpp-bson-builders`
   section in this guide.

A ``document::view`` object provides a non-owning view into a ``document::value``.
This type allows you to read and interact with the contents of a BSON
document without owning the document's underlying data. When you pass a ``document::view``
object to a {+driver-short+} method, the method can use data from the underlying document
without copying it. You can create a view by calling the ``view()`` method on a ``document::value``
object. 

.. tip::
   
   To avoid excess copying, we recommend passing documents by view
   if possible.

Some {+driver-short+} methods accept arguments of type ``document::view_or_value``. You
can pass either a ``document::view`` or ``document::value`` object to these methods. You
must pass ``document::value`` arguments by `rvalue <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category#rvalue>`__
reference to transfer ownership of the document to the method.

.. important:: 

   A ``document::view`` must not outlive any ``document::value`` that it references.
   If a ``document::view`` uses a ``document::value`` after its underlying buffer
   is freed, the view will contain a dangling pointer. Accessing a dangling pointer
   can cause application crashes, corrupted data, and other unpredictable behavior.

.. _cpp-bson-builders: 

Build a BSON Document 
---------------------

This section shows how to use the following interfaces to create a
BSON document:  

- :ref:`List Builder <cpp-bson-list>`
- :ref:`Basic Builder <cpp-bson-basic>`
- :ref:`Stream Builder <cpp-bson-stream>`

.. _cpp-bson-list:

List Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``builder::list`` interface is a JSON-like builder for constructing documents and arrays. 
To create a BSON document by using the list builder, construct a ``bsoncxx::builder::list``
object, passing a list of key-value pairs to the constructor. The list builder creates a
BSON document if the key-value list fulfills the following requirements:

- The list has an even number of elements.
- Each key is a ``string`` type and each value is a ``bson_value::value`` type or is
  implicitly convertible to one.

If the preceding requirements are not met, the list builder creates an array. 

This example uses the list builder to perform the following actions:

- Build a document 
- Build an array
- Convert the builder document to a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` object

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-bson-list
    :end-before: end-bson-list

.. _cpp-bson-basic:

Basic Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``builder::basic`` interface is a builder-style interface for constructing a BSON document. 
To create a BSON document by using the basic builder, specify your document's data in a list of
key-value pair objects. You can create these key-value pair objects by passing a key and value
to the ``builder::basic::kvp()`` method. The key must be a ``string`` type, and
the value must be a ``bson_value::value`` type or implicitly convertible to one. 

You can use the basic builder's ``make_document()`` method to create a document and
convert it to a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` in a single statement, as shown in the
following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-bson-make-document
    :end-before: end-bson-make-document

Alternatively, you can create a BSON document across multiple statements
by appending key-value pairs to a basic builder object. This 
example uses the basic builder to perform the following actions:

- Initialize a ``builder::basic::document`` object
- Store data in the document by using the ``append()`` method
- Convert the builder document to a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` object

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-bson-append
    :end-before: end-bson-append

.. _cpp-bson-stream:

Stream Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   We recommend using the :ref:`basic builder <cpp-bson-basic>` instead 
   of the stream builder. 
   
   To properly append each new value, a stream builder must keep track
   of the state of the current document. You cannot reuse the initial
   stream builder after this state changes. As a result, all intermediate
   values must be stored in new variables if you build a document
   across multiple statements. Due to this complexity, use of the stream
   builder is discouraged.

The ``builder::stream`` interface is a streaming interface for constructing
complex BSON objects. To create a BSON document by using the stream builder,
initialize a ``builder::stream::document`` object. Then, you can use the ``<<``
operator to stream keys and values into your builder. 

The following code shows how to use the stream builder to perform the
following actions:

- Build a document
- Convert the document to a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` object

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-bson-stream
    :end-before: end-bson-stream

You can also convert the stream to a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` by using the
``builder::stream::finalize`` token, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-bson-stream-finalize
    :end-before: end-bson-stream-finalize

.. _cpp-bson-print:

Print a BSON Document
---------------------

BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON documents that is not human-readable.
To preview the contents of a BSON document in a human-readable format, you can use the 
``bsoncxx::to_json()`` method to convert your document to extended JSON format.  

Extended JSON format is an extension of standard JSON that includes string representations of BSON data types. 
To learn more, see the :manual:`MongoDB Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`
guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The ``bsoncxx::to_json()`` method accepts a ``bsoncxx::document::view`` of the BSON document
you want to convert. This method returns an ``std::string`` object representing your BSON
document in extended JSON format. 

The following code shows how to convert a BSON document to extended JSON format and print the results: 

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/data-formats/bson.cpp
      :start-after: start-bson-print
      :end-before: end-bson-print
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:
   
   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      { "title" : "Screenwriting", "department" : "English" }
