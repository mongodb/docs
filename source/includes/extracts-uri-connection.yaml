   You can connect to your |service| cluster using its
   :manual:`connection string URI </reference/connection-string/>`. In
   the connect dialog box perform the following steps:

   a. Click :guilabel:`Drivers`.
   #. Copy the connection string found in step 1.
   #. Replace **PASSWORD** with the password for the root user, and
      **DATABASE** with the name of the database to which you wish to connect.

      .. important::

         You must escape any instances of the ``@`` character in the
         provided ``<PASSWORD>``. For example, ``p@ssword`` should be
         ``p%40ssword``.

   This connection string is specified to :binary:`{{program}}` in the
   ``--uri`` option.

   When using ``{{parameter}}``, if the |service| cluster is a replica
   set you must also retrieve the replica set name. For example:

   .. code-block:: none
