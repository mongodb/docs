Overview
--------
 
Atlas users provide access to Atlas groups. You can create a new user in
a group to give access to that group. You can later give the user access
to additional groups. When you create a user, you assign the user a role
in the group. A role determines the actions the user can perform and the
data the user can access. 

The roles available in |service| are :guilabel:`Owner` and :guilabel:`Read Only`. The :ref:`Add/Invite User <atlas_add_users>` UI provides details on the roles available and their access levels.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB users.  MongoDB users have
   access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users access to the
   |service| application itself.

Add Users

View Users
----------

To view users, click :guilabel:`Users`. The page lists users who have
access to your |service| group, their role, date created, last login, timezone, and available actions.  The page also lists any invitations to join the group  waiting for a reply, as well as any requests from users who want to join the group. A user can request to join a group when first registering for |service|.

View Invitations
----------------

When you invite a user to join a group, |service| sends an email to the
prospective new user. To view invitations sent but not yet accepted, click :guilabel:`Users`. 

The page lists any users with pending invitations below users who have already joined. The role appears as :guilabel:`--invite sent--`. To cancel an invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove Users
------------

.. note::

   |service| prevents you from deleting the last user in a group. You      must instead :guilabel:`close the group` by accessing                   :guilabel:`Settings > Billing/Subscriptions`. Closing the group         will delete the group's users.
    
   |service| also prevents you from deleting the last user with the        :guilabel:`Owner` role from the group. You must first assign the        role to at least one other user before deleting the original user.

.. _atlas-assign-roles-to-users:

Assign Roles to Users
---------------------

Assign roles to |service| users to limit the actions they can perform and the data they can view.  The roles available in |service| are :guilabel:`Owner` and :guilabel:`Read Only`.

To assign roles to users in a group, you must have the :guilabel:`Owner` role in the group. The user who creates a group automatically has the :guilabel:`Owner` role.

To assign roles inside of |service|, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Users`. Click the user's gear icon and select
:guilabel:`Edit User`. Choose the appropriate role based on the descriptions below the form and click :guilabel:`Save` to apply the role.
