Overview
--------

A global alert applies the same
:doc:`alert configuration </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>` to
multiple projects at once. When an alert condition occurs, |onprem|
sends notification only to the affected project. |onprem| sends
notification at regular intervals until you
:ref:`resolve <resolved-alert>` or :ref:`cancel <cancelled-alert>`
the alert.

If you acknowledge a global alert, |onprem| sends no further
notifications to the alertâ€™s distribution list until the
acknowledgement period has passed or until the alert resolves. If the
alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |onprem| sends a
notification of the resolution.

To access global alerts you must have the
:authrole:`Global Owner` role or :authrole:`Global Monitoring Admin` role.

.. note:: Default Global Alerts

   When |onprem| starts, it creates
   :ref:`default global alert configurations <default-global-alerts>`.
   If you delete a default global alert configuration, |onprem|
   recreates it when the application restarts.

   If you don't want to receive alerts from a default global alert
   configuration, you must
   :ref:`disable that global alert configuration <disable-enable-global-alert>`.

Default Global Alerts
---------------------

Each time |onprem| starts, it creates global alert
configurations for the following conditions:

- Blockstore jobs have reached a high number of retries

- Sync slice transfer has not progressed in more than 60 minutes

- Inconsistent cluster snapshot count is above 5

- Backup is down

- Backup has too many conf call failures

- No daemon is available to take a queryable restore job

- Inconsistent backup configuration has been detected

- Backup requires a resync

- Replica set has a late snapshot

- Backup is in an unexpected state

- Backup has reached a high number of retries

- Backup could not be assigned to a backup daemon

If you do not want to receive alerts from a default global alert 
configuration, you must :ref:`disable that global alert configuration <disable-enable-global-alert>`.
