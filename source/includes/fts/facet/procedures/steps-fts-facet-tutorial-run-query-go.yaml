title: "Run an |fts| facet query that groups the genre and year fields
       into buckets."
content: |

  a. Create a file named ``facet-query.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the
     ``facet-query.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:
      
     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following searchMeta clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.

     You can run this query using :pipeline:`$searchMeta` or using
     :pipeline:`$search` with the ``SEARCH_META`` aggregation variable. 

     .. tabs:: 

        .. tab:: $searchMeta 
           :tabid: search-meta-pipeline

           .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/facet/tutorial.go
              :language: go
              :linenos:
              :dedent:
              :emphasize-lines: 15

        .. tab:: $search with $$SEARCH_META
           :tabid: search-meta-variable

           .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/facet/tutorial-variable.go
              :language: go
              :linenos:
              :dedent:
              :emphasize-lines: 15

  #. .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the following command to query your collection:
  
     .. io-code-block::
        :copyable: true

        .. input::
           :language: bash

           go run facet-query.go

        .. output::
           :language: none
           :visible: true
