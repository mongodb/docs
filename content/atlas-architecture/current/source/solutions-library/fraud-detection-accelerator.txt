Solutions Overview
------------------
Financial services organizations face growing risks from cybercriminals. High-profile
hacks and fraudulent transactions undermine faith in the industry. As technology evolves,
so do the techniques employed by these perpetrators, making the battle against fraud a
perpetual challenge. Existing fraud detection systems often grapple with a critical
limitation: relying on stale data. The newest tactics often can be seen in the data.
That's where the power of operational data comes into play.

By harnessing `real-time data
<https://www.mongodb.com/basics/real-time-analytics-examples>`__, fraud detection models
can be trained on the most accurate and relevant clues available. |service-fullname|, a highly
scalable and flexible developer data platform, coupled with Amazon SageMaker Canvas, an
advanced `machine learning <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/machine-learning>`__ tool,
presents a groundbreaking opportunity to revolutionize fraud detection. By harnessing
operational data and leveraging the power of real-time insights, financial institutions
can fortify their defenses against cybercriminals who seek to exploit vulnerabilities for
illicit gains. |service-fullname| proves its strength as an operational data store,
accommodating high-volume transactional data with exceptional performance and flexibility.
Meanwhile, Amazon SageMaker Canvas empowers business analysts to leverage AI/ML solutions
effortlessly, providing a no-code platform that brings the power of advanced analytics to
their fingertips.

Challenges with Legacy Fraud Systems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Incomplete data visibility from legacy systems:** Lack of access to relevant data
  sources hampers fraud pattern detection. 

- **Latency issues in fraud prevention systems:** Legacy systems lack real-time
  processing, causing delays in fraud detection.

- **Difficulty in adapting legacy systems:** Inflexibility hinders the adoption of
  advanced fraud prevention technologies. 

- **Weak security protocols in legacy systems:** Outdated security exposes vulnerabilities
  to cyber attacks. 

- **Operational challenges due to technical sprawl:** Diverse technologies complicate
  maintenance and updates. 

- **Lack of collaboration between teams:** Siloed approach leads to delayed solutions and
  higher overhead.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------
Below, you will find the architecture used to build this fraud solution. The architecture
includes an end-to-end solution for detecting different types of fraud in the banking
sector, including card fraud detection, identity theft detection, account takeover
detection, money laundering detection, consumer fraud detection, insider fraud detection,
and mobile banking fraud detection to name a few.

The architecture diagram illustrates model training and near real-time inference. The
operational data stored in `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database>`__ is
written to the `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__ bucket using the Triggers
feature in {+atlas-app-services+}. Thus stored, data is used to create and train the
model in `Amazon SageMaker Canvas <https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/>`__. The SageMaker
Canvas stores the metadata for the model in the |s3| bucket and exposes the model endpoint
for inference.

Data Model Approach
-------------------
The data is divided into two separate files: one containing identity information and the
other containing transaction data. These files are connected through the TransactionID.
It's important to note that not every transaction includes associated identity details.

Based on the above two datasets, we prepare a test join on the TransactionID, adding the
target column as Fraud.

Building the Solution
---------------------
The detailed step-by-step guide to build this solution can be found in this `Github repo
<https://github.com/mongodb-partners/Frauddetection_with_MongoDBAtlas_and_SageMakerCanvas/blob/main/README.md>`__.
Below you will find an overview of those steps taken:

1. Set up the `S3 bucket
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html>`__
   to which the |service-fullname| data needs to be exported.
2. `Set up
   <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/clusters/mongodb-cluster-setup#:~:text=about%20storage%20capacity.-,Creating,-a%20MongoDB%20Cluster>`__
   an |service-fullname| Cluster.
3. Set up {+atlas-app-services+}.
4. Set up the `Amazon SageMaker
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html>`__ domain.

MongoDB Atlas as the Operational Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MongoDB Atlas developer data platform is an integrated suite of data services centered
on a `cloud database <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud-database>`__ designed to accelerate
and simplify how developers build with data. Its ability to handle large amounts of data
in a flexible schema empowers financial institutions to effortlessly capture, store, and
process high-volume transactional data in real-time. This means that every transaction,
every interaction, and every piece of operational data can be seamlessly integrated into
the fraud detection pipeline, ensuring that the models are continuously trained on the
most current and relevant information available. With MongoDB Atlas, financial
institutions gain an unrivaled advantage in their fight against fraud, unleashing the full
potential of operational data to create a robust and proactive defense system.

Amazon SageMaker Canvas as an AI/ML Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amazon SageMaker Canvas revolutionizes the way business analysts leverage AI/ML solutions
by offering a powerful no-code platform. Traditionally, implementing AI/ML models required
specialized technical expertise, making it inaccessible for many business analysts.
However, SageMaker Canvas eliminates this barrier by providing a visual point-and-click
interface to generate accurate ML predictions for classification, regression, forecasting,
natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV). SageMaker Canvas empowers
business analysts to unlock valuable insights, make data-driven decisions, and harness the
power of AI without being hindered by technical complexities. It boosts collaboration
between business analysts and data scientists by sharing, reviewing, and updating ML
models across tools. It brings the realm of AI/ML within reach, allowing analysts to
explore new frontiers and drive innovation within their organizations.
