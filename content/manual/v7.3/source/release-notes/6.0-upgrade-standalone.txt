The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version |oldversion| to |newversion|.

.. include:: /includes/upgrade-guidance-checklists.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: :ref:`downgrading <6.0-downgrade-standalone>`

Prerequisites
-------------

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to |oldfcv|. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "5.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Consider Converting to Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to upgrading, consider
:doc:`converting your standalone deployment to a replica set
</tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`. Replica sets are the
recommended deployment configuration for MongoDB.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Procedure
-----------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

      To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use 
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the instance and run the 
      following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

   .. step:: Replace the |oldversion| binaries with the |newversion| binaries.

      Ensure that the |oldseries| binaries are in your System PATH. To 
      confirm your binary version, run the following command:
    
      .. code-block:: bash
 
         mongod --version

      The command output should indicate a |oldseries| release.

   .. step:: Enable backwards-incompatible |newversion| features.
   
      .. include:: /includes/upgrade-enable-features.rst

      .. tip::

         .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst
   
      Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command 
      against the ``admin`` database:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "6.0" } ) 

      This command must perform writes to an internal system 
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete          
      successfully, you can safely retry the command as the operation
      is idempotent.

Additional Upgrade Procedures
-----------------------------

- To upgrade a replica set, see :ref:`6.0-upgrade-replica-set`.
- To upgrade a sharded cluster, see :ref:`6.0-upgrade-sharded-cluster`.
