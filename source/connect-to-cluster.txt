|service| provides details to connect a :program:`mongo` shell to a
cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

- TLS/SSL
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service|
   cluster. If using the :program:`mongo` shell, ensure that you have
   downloaded the binary with TLS/SSL support. To download the binary,
   see `<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_.


- Whitelist
   To access a cluster you must connect from an IP address on the
   cluster's whitelist. If you have not done so, :ref:`add your IP
   address to the whitelist <add-to-whitelist>`. You can also add an IP
   address to the whitelist when retrieving connection information.

Connect to Your Cluster
-----------------------

To view connection specification details for a cluster, go to the
:guilabel:`Clusters` view.
