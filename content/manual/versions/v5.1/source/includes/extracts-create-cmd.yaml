  If the deployment enforces 
  :ref:`authentication/authorization <authentication>`, 
  {{operation}} requires the following privileges:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - Task

       - Required Privileges
     
     * - Create a non-capped collection

       - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database, **or**

         :authaction:`insert` on the collection to create

     * - Create a :ref:`capped collection <manual-capped-collection>`

       - :authaction:`convertToCapped` for the collection


         :authaction:`createCollection` on the database

     * - Create a :ref:`view <3.4-reference-views>`

       - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database.

         However, if the user has the :authaction:`createCollection` on
         the database *and* :authaction:`find` on the view to create,
         the user must *also* have the following additional permissions:

         - :authaction:`find` on the source collection or view.

         - :authaction:`find` on any other collections or views
           referenced in the ``pipeline``, if any.

  A user with the :authrole:`readWrite` built in role on the database
  has the required privileges to run the listed operations. Either
  :doc:`create a user </tutorial/create-users>` with the required role
  or :ref:`grant the role to an existing user
  <modify-existing-user-access>`.
