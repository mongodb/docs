   Download the appropriate version of ``mongosh`` for your operating
   system. MongoDB also provides versions of ``mongosh`` that use your
   system's OpenSSL installation.
   
   See the `MongoDB Download Center
   <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell?jmp=docs>`__.

title: "Extract the files from the downloaded archive."
ref: extract-archive-generic-linux
level: 4
content: |
   Go to the directory that contains the ``.tgz`` archive, then unpack
   the archive. 
   
   The name of the ``.tgz`` package varies depending on the version you
   downloaded. Replace the ``.tgz`` package name in the following
   command with the name of the package you downloaded and run the
   command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongosh-{+version+}-linux-x64.tgz


   The extracted archive has a ``bin`` folder that contains two files,
   ``mongosh`` and ``mongosh_crypt_v1.so``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download, or if you extract the archive without using the ``tar``
   command, you may need to make the binary executable.
   
   To make the binary executable, run the following command in the
   directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh
