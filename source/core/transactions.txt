.. versionadded:: 4.0

In MongoDB, an operation on a single document is atomic. Because you can
use embedded documents and arrays to capture relationships between data
in a single document structure instead of normalizing across multiple
documents and collections, this single-document atomicity obviates the
need for multi-document transactions for many practical use cases.

However, for situations that require atomicity for updates to multiple
documents or consistency between reads to multiple documents, MongoDB
provides the ability to perform multi-document transactions against
replica sets. Multi-document transactions can be used across multiple
operations, collections, databases, and documents. Multi-document transactions
provide an "all-or-nothing" proposition. When a transaction commits,
all data changes made in the transaction are saved. If any operation in
the transaction fails, the transaction aborts and all data changes made
in the transaction are discarded without ever becoming visible. Until a
transaction commits, no write operations in the transaction are visible
outside the transaction.

Transactions and Replica Sets
-----------------------------

Multi-document transactions are available for replica sets only.
Transactions for sharded clusters are scheduled for MongoDB 4.2
[#upcoming]_.

.. [#upcoming]

   .. include:: /includes/fact-upcoming.rst

Feature Compatibility Version (FCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) of all members of the replica
set must be ``4.0`` or greater. To check the fCV for a member, connect
to the member and run the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

For more information on fCV, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Storage Engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-document transactions are only available for deployments that use
WiredTiger storage engine.

Multi-document transactions are not available for deployments that use
in-memory storage engine or the deprecated MMAPv1 storage engine.

Transactions and Operations
---------------------------

For transactions:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-crud.rst

Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
dropping a collection or an index, are not allowed in multi-document
transactions. For example, a multi-document transaction cannot include
an insert operation that would result in the creation of a new
collection. See :ref:`transactions-ops-restricted`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-catalog-tip.rst

For multi-document transactions:

.. include:: /includes/table-transactions-operations.rst

.. _transactions-ops-count:

Count Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a count operation within a transaction, use the
:pipeline:`$count` aggregation stage or the :pipeline:`$group` (with a
:group:`$sum` expression) aggregation stage.

MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features provide a
collection-level API ``countDocuments(filter, options)`` as a helper
method that uses the :pipeline:`$group` with a :group:`$sum`
expression to perform a count.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-restrictions.rst

Transactions and Security
-------------------------

- If running with :doc:`access control </core/authorization>`, you must
  have privileges for the :ref:`operations in the transaction
  <transactions-operations>`. [#username-external]_

- If running with :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>`, operations in an
  aborted transaction are still audited.

.. [#username-external]

   If using ``$external`` authentication users (i.e. Kerberos, LDAP,
   x.509 users), the usernames cannot be greater than 10k bytes.

Transactions and Sessions
-------------------------

Transactions are associated with a session. That is, you start a
transaction for a session. At any given time, you can have at most one
open transaction for a session.

.. important::

   When using the drivers, you **must** pass the session to each
   operation in the transaction.

If a session ends and it has an open transaction, the transaction
aborts.


.. _transactions-drivers:

Transactions and MongoDB Drivers
--------------------------------

Clients require MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 4.0.

.. include:: /includes/list-4.0-drivers.rst

.. important::

   To associate read and write operations with a transaction, you
   **must** pass the session to each operation in the transaction. For
   examples, see :ref:`transactions-retry`.

Transactions and the ``mongo`` Shell
------------------------------------

The following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods are available for
transactions:

- :method:`Session.startTransaction()`

- :method:`Session.commitTransaction()`

- :method:`Session.abortTransaction()`

.. _transactions-retry:

Transactions and Retryable Writes
---------------------------------

.. admonition:: Highly Available Applications
   :class: important

   Regardless of the database system, whether MongoDB or relational
   databases, applications should take measures to handle errors during
   transaction commits and incorporate retry logic for transactions.

Retry Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The individual write operations inside the transaction are not
retryable, regardless of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is set to
``true``.

If an operation encounters an error, the returned error may have an
``errorLabels`` array field. If the error is a transient error, the
``errorLabels`` array field contains ``"TransientTransactionError"`` as
an element and the transaction as a whole can be retried.

For example, the following helper runs a function and retries the
function if a ``"TransientTransactionError"`` is encountered:

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-transactions-retry-1.rst

Retry Commit Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commit operations are :doc:`retryable write operations
</core/retryable-writes>`. If the commit operation operation encounters
an error, MongoDB drivers retry the operation a single time regardless
of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is set to ``true``.

If the commit operation encounters an error, MongoDB returns an error
with an ``errorLabels`` array field. If the error is a transient commit
error, the ``errorLabels`` array field contains
``"UnknownTransactionCommitResult"`` as an element and the commit
operation can be retried.

In addition to the single retry behavior provided by the MongoDB
drivers, applications should take measures to handle
``"UnknownTransactionCommitResult"`` errors during transaction commits.

For example, the following helper commits a transaction and retries if
a ``"UnknownTransactionCommitResult"`` is encountered:

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-transactions-retry-2.rst

Retry Transaction and Commit Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Incorporating logic to retrying the transaction for transient errors
and retrying the commit, the full code example is:

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-transactions-retry-3.rst

Atomicity
---------

Multi-document transactions are atomic:

- When a transaction commits, all data changes made in the transaction
  are saved and visible outside the transaction. Until a transaction
  commits, the data changes made in the transaction are not visible
  outside the transaction.

- When a transaction aborts, all data changes made in the transaction
  are discarded without ever becoming visible. For example, if any
  operation in the transaction fails, the transaction aborts and all
  data changes made in the transaction are discarded without ever
  becoming visible.

Read Preference
---------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-pref.rst

.. _transaction-options:

Transaction Options (Read Concern/Write Concern)
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.startTransaction( {
      readConcern: { level: <level> },
      writeConcern: { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> } 
   } );

.. _txn-read-concern:

Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-document transactions support read concern
:readconcern:`"snapshot"`, :readconcern:`"local"`, and
:readconcern:`"majority"`:

- For :readconcern:`"local"` and :readconcern:`"majority"` read
  concern, MongoDB may sometimes substitute a stronger read concern.

- For :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern, if the transaction
  commits with :ref:`write concern "majority"
  <transactions-write-concern>`, transaction operations are guaranteed
  to have read majority-committed data. Otherwise, the
  :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees that
  read operations read majority-committed data.

- For :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern, if the transaction
  commits with :ref:`write concern "majority"
  <transactions-write-concern>`, the transaction operations are
  guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of majority committed data.
  Otherwise, the :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern provides no
  guarantee that read operations used a snapshot of majority-committed
  data.

You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
individual operation level.  The operations in the transaction will use the
transaction-level read concern. Any read concern set at the collection
and database level is ignored inside the transaction. If the
transaction-level read concern is explicitly specified, the client
level read concern is also ignored inside the transaction.

You can set the transaction :doc:`read concern
</reference/read-concern>` at the transaction start.

If unspecified at the transaction start, transactions use the
session-level read concern or, if that is unset, the client-level read
concern.

.. _transactions-write-concern:

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You set the write concern at the transaction level, not at the
individual operation level. At the time of the commit, transactions use
the transaction level :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
to commit the write operations. Individual operations inside the
transaction ignore write concerns. Do not explicitly set the write
concern for the individual write operations inside transactions.

You can set the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>` for the
transaction commit at the transaction start.

- If unspecified at the transaction start, transactions use the
  session-level write concern for the commit or, if that is unset, the
  client-level write concern.

- Write concern :writeconcern:`w: 0 <\<number\>>` is not supported
  for transactions.

- If you commit using :writeconcern:`w: 1 <\<number\>>` write concern,
  your transaction can be :doc:`rolled back if there is a failover
  </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

- If the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern "majority"
  <transactions-write-concern>` and has specified read concern
  :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern, transaction operations are
  guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of majority-committed data.
  Otherwise, the :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern provides no
  guarantees that read operations used a snapshot of majority-committed
  data.

- If the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern "majority"
  <transactions-write-concern>` and has specified read concern
  :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern, transaction operations are
  guaranteed to have read majority-committed data. Otherwise, the
  :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees that
  read operations read majority-committed data.


Transactions and Locks
----------------------

By default, transactions waits ``5`` milliseconds to acquire locks
required by the operations in the transaction. If the transaction
cannot acquire its required locks within the ``5`` milliseconds, the
transaction aborts.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-catalog-tip.rst

You can use the :parameter:`maxTransactionLockRequestTimeoutMillis`
parameter to adjust how long transactions wait to acquire locks.

You can also use operation-specific timeout by setting
:parameter:`maxTransactionLockRequestTimeoutMillis` to ``-1``.

Transactions release all locks upon abort or commit.
