.. method:: db.collection.findAndModify

   The :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` method atomically
   modifies and returns a single document. By default, the returned
   document does not include the modifications made on the update. To
   return the document with the modifications made on the update, use
   the ``new`` option. The :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` method is a shell
   helper around the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command.

   .. code-block:: none

      db.collection.findAndModify( {
                                     query: <document>,
                                     sort: <document>,
                                     remove: <boolean>,
                                     update: <document>,
                                     new: <boolean>,
                                     fields: <document>,
                                     upsert: <boolean>
                                 } );

   The :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()` method takes a document
   parameter with the following subdocument fields:

   :field document query:

          Optional. Specifies the selection criteria for the
          modification. The ``query`` field employs the same
          :ref:`query selectors <query-selectors>` as used in the
          :method:`db.collection.find()` method. Although the query may
          match multiple documents,
          :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` will only select one
          document to modify.

   :field document sort:

          Optional. Determines which document the operation will modify
          if the query selects multiple documents.
          :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` will modify the
          first document in the sort order specified by this argument.

   :field boolean remove:

          Optional if ``update`` field exists. When ``true``, removes
          the selected document. The default is ``false``.

   :field document update:

          Optional if ``remove`` field exists. Performs an update of
          the selected document. The ``update`` field employs the same
          :ref:`update operators <update-operators>` or ``field: value``
          specifications to modify the selected document.

   :field boolean new:

          Optional. When ``true``, returns the modified document rather
          than the original. The
          :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` method ignores the
          ``new`` option for ``remove`` operations. The default is
          ``false``.

   :field document fields:

          Optional. A subset of fields to return. The ``fields``
          document specifies an inclusion of a field with ``1``, as in
          the following:

          .. code-block:: javascript

             fields: { <field1>: 1, <field2>: 1, ... }

          See :ref:`projection <read-operations-projection>`.

   :field boolean upsert:

          Optional. Used in conjunction with the ``update`` field. When
          ``true``, :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` creates a
          new document if the ``query`` returns no documents. The
          default is ``false``.

   The :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` method returns either:

   - the pre-modification document or,

   - if the ``new: true`` option is set, the modified document.

   .. note::

      - If no document is found for the ``update`` or ``remove``, the
        method returns ``null``.

      - If no document is found for an ``upsert``, which means the
        command performs an insert, and ``new`` is ``false``, **and**
        the ``sort`` option is **NOT** specified, the method returns
        ``null``.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.2
           Previously returned an empty document ``{}``. See :ref:`the
           2.2 release notes <2.2-findandmodify-returns-null>` for more
           information.

      - If no document is found for an ``upsert``, which means the
        command performs an insert, and ``new`` is ``false``, **and** a
        ``sort`` option is specified, the method returns an empty
        document ``{}``.

   Consider the following examples:

   - The following method updates an existing document in the people
     collection where the document matches the query criteria:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.people.findAndModify( {
            query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
            sort: { rating: 1 },
            update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
        } )

     This method performs the following actions:

     #. The ``query`` finds a document in the ``people`` collection
        where the ``name`` field has the value ``Tom``, the ``state``
        field has the value ``active`` and the ``rating`` field has a
        value :operator:`greater than <$gt>` 10.

     #. The ``sort`` orders the results of the query in ascending order.
        If multiple documents meet the ``query`` condition, the method
        will select for modification the first document as ordered by
        this ``sort``.

     #. The update :operator:`increments <$inc>` the value of the
        ``score`` field by 1.

     #. The method returns the original (i.e. pre-modification) document
        selected for this update:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           {
             "_id" : ObjectId("50f1e2c99beb36a0f45c6453"),
             "name" : "Tom",
             "state" : "active",
             "rating" : 100,
             "score" : 5
           }

        To return the modified document, add the ``new:true`` option to
        the method.

        If no document matched the ``query`` condition, the method
        returns ``null``:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           null

   - The following method includes the ``upsert: true`` option to
     insert a new document if no document matches the ``query``
     condition:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.people.findAndModify( {
            query: { name: "Gus", state: "active", rating: 100 },
            sort: { rating: 1 },
            update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
            upsert: true
          } )

     If the method does **not** find a matching document, the method
     performs an upsert. Because the method included the ``sort``
     option, it returns an empty document ``{ }`` as the original
     (pre-modification) document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { }

     If the method did **not** include a ``sort`` option, the method returns
     ``null``.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        null

   - The following method includes both the ``upsert: true`` option and
     the ``new:true`` option to return the newly inserted document if a
     document matching the ``query`` is not found:

     .. code-block:: none

        db.people.findAndModify( {
            query: { name: "Pascal", state: "active", rating: 25 },
            sort: { rating: 1 },
            update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
            upsert: true,
            new: true
          }
        )

    The method returns the newly inserted document:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       {
         "_id" : ObjectId("50f49ad6444c11ac2448a5d6"),
         "name" : "Pascal",
         "rating" : 25,
         "score" : 1,
         "state" : "active"
       }

   When :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` includes the ``upsert:
   true`` option **and** the query field(s) is not uniquely indexed, the
   method could insert a document multiple times in certain
   circumstances. For instance, if multiple clients each invoke the
   method with the same ``query`` condition and these methods complete
   the ``find`` phase before any of methods perform the ``modify``
   phase, these methods could insert the same document.

   Consider an example where no document with the name ``Andy`` exists
   and multiple clients issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.findAndModify(
                               {
                                 query: { name: "Andy" },
                                 sort: { rating: 1 },
                                 update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
                                 upsert: true
                               }
                             )

   If all the methods finish the ``query`` phase before any command
   starts the ``modify`` phase, **and** there is no unique index on the
   ``name`` field, the commands may all perform an upsert. To prevent
   this condition, create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on
   the ``name`` field. With the unique index in place, the multiple
   methods would observe one of the following behaviors:

   - Exactly one :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` would
     successfully insert a new document.

   - Zero or more :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` methods
     would update the newly inserted document.

   - Zero or more :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` methods
     would fail when they attempted to insert a duplicate. If the
     method fails due to a unique index constraint violation, you can
     retry the method. Absent a delete of the document, the retry
     should not fail.

   .. warning::

      - When using :dbcommand:`findAndModify` in a :term:`sharded
        <sharding>` environment, the ``query`` must contain the
        :term:`shard key` for all operations against the shard cluster.
        :dbcommand:`findAndModify` operations issued against
        :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances for non-sharded collections
        function normally.
