Use Cases
---------

Moving unsharded collections to any shard can:

- Optimize performance on larger, complex workloads. 
- Achieve better resource utilization.
- More evenly distribute data across shards.

Consider the following scenarios: 

- A company runs an e-commerce platform with several unsharded collections, such 
  as ``products``, ``orders``, and ``users`` on a single shard. The ``orders`` 
  collection begins to grow significantly larger than the others, which causes 
  performance issues on the shard. To improve performance and balance the load 
  across the cluster, the administrator can use the ``moveCollection`` command 
  to move the smaller ``products`` and ``users`` collections to a different 
  shard.

- A global application stores user data in three separate unsharded collections 
  for users located in North America, Europe, and Asia on one shard. To reduce 
  latency for users, an administrator can move these collections to a shard 
  located in each respective region in the same cluster.

- An application frequently performs :pipeline:`$lookup` operations between 
  two unsharded collections, ``orders`` and ``customers``, that reside on 
  different shards. To improve query performance, a database administrator can 
  move both collections to the same shard. 

Get Started

Access Control 
--------------

To move unsharded collections on a deployment that enforces authentication, you 
must authenticate as a user with at least the :authrole:`enableSharding` role.
