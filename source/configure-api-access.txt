To access the API, you must generate your own :ref:`API key <atlas-api-key>`.

To access whitelisted API operations, you must configure your :ref:`API
whitelist <whitelist-for-api-operations>` with the IP addresses you will use
when issuing the whitelisted commands. You also must have the ``Owner`` role
to issue whitelisted commands.

For a description of the |service| API's principles and conventions, see the
:doc:`/api`.

Provide Access to Whitelisted API Operations
--------------------------------------------

Address-based whitelists protect certain API operations. Only client requests
that originate from a whitelisted IP address are permitted to perform the
operations. To perform whitelisted operations, you must create add at least
one address to your whitelist.

Users have their own whitelists and own API keys. When you issue an API call,
you must use an API key from your user account and must issue the command from
an address on your user account's whitelist. You cannot use your key to issue
a whitelisted API request from an address on another user's whitelist, unless,
of course, you've added that address to your own whitelist.

On the :doc:`resources </reference/api-resources>` pages in this guide,
whitelisted operations are marked as such.

1. On the upper-right hand corner, click on your user name and select
   :guilabel:`Account`.  Click on :guilabel:`Public API Access`.

2. In the :guilabel:`API Whitelist` section, click :guilabel:`Add`.

3. Enter an IP address or CIDR range. To add multiple entries to your
   whitelist, repeat this step. If you leave your whitelist empty, you
   have no access to whitelisted operations.

   You can enter any of the following:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Entry

        - Grants

      * - An IP address

        - Access to whitelisted operations from that address.

      * - A CIDR-notated range of IP addresses

        - Access to whitelisted operations from those addresses.

      * - ``0.0.0.0/0``

        - Unrestricted access to whitelisted operations.

Delete an Address from the API Whitelist
----------------------------------------

1. On the upper-right hand corner, click on your user name and select
   :guilabel:`Account`.  Click on :guilabel:`Public API Access`.

2. In the :guilabel:`Whitelist` section, click the address's :guilabel:`gear icon`
   and select :guilabel:`Delete`.
