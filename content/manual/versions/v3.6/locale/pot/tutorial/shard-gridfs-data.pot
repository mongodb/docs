msgid "Most deployments will not need to shard the ``files`` collection. The ``files`` collection is typically small, and only contains metadata. None of the required keys for GridFS lend themselves to an even distribution in a sharded situation. If you *must* shard the ``files`` collection, use the ``_id`` field possibly in combination with an application field."
