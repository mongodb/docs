msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB."
