  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the project whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` modal under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of your client on the list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address.
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
  
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| project being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.
