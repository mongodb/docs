MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the {+driver-short+} for use with a specific version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version of the 
{+driver-long+} for use with a specific version of C.

The first column lists the driver version.

Platform Compatibility
----------------------

This section includes version compatibility information about platforms and
toolchains that are supported by the {+driver-short+}.

Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operating systems are continually tested with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :align: left

  * - Operating System
    - Notes

  * - Debian
    - Versions 9.2, 10.0, and 11.0
  * - RHEL
    - Versions 7.0, 7.1, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3. RHEL derivatives
      (for example, CentOS, Rocky Linux, or AlmaLinux) of the same release version are
      supported. Fedora is also supported, but not continually tested.
  * - Ubuntu
    - Versions 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04. Subsequent minor releases
      are also supported. Ubuntu 22.04 and newer is not yet tested. Ubuntu
      derivatives based on supported Ubuntu versions are also supported.
  * - Arch Linux
    -
  * - macOS
    - Version 11.0
  * - Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2016
    - Windows variants of the same generation are supported


Compilers
~~~~~~~~~

The following compilers are continually tested with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :align: left

  * - Compiler
    - Notes
  * - Clang
    - Versions 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0. Newer versions
      are also supported, as well as the corresponding Apple Clang releases.
  * - GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
    - Versions 4.8, 5.4, 6.3, 7.5, 8.2, 8.3,
      9.4, and 10.2. The MinGW-w64 GCC is also tested and supported.
  * - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
    - Tested with MSVC 14.x (Visual Studio 2015) and 15.x (Visual Studio
      2017). Newer MSVC versions are supported but not yet tested.

Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following CPU architectures are continually tested with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :align: left
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Architecture
    - Notes
  * - x86 (32-bit)
    - Tested only on Windows
  * - x86_64 (64-bit x86)
    - Tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * - ARM / aarch64
    - Tested on macOS and Linux
  * - Power8 (ppc64le)
    - Tested only on Linux
  * - zSeries (s390x)
    - Tested only on Linux

Additional Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other platforms and toolchains are not tested, but we expect similar versions
of the preceding platforms to work. If you encounter a platform or toolchain that you
expect to work and find that it does not, please open an issue describing the
problem, or open a `GitHub Pull Request <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/pulls>`__ to fix it.

.. important::
  
   Simple pull requests to fix unsupported platforms are welcome, but will be
   considered on a case-by-case basis. The acceptance of a pull request to fix the
   libraries on an unsupported platform does not imply full support of that
   platform.
