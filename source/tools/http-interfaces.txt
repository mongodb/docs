HTTP Interfaces
---------------

Sleepy Mongoose (Python)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Sleepy Mongoose <http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/02/22/sleepy-mongoose-a-mongodb-rest-interface/>`_
is a full featured HTTP interface for MongoDB.

HTTP Console
------------

MongoDB provides a simple http interface listing information of interest
to administrators. This interface may be accessed at the port with
numeric value 1000 more than the configured :program:`manual:mongod` port. The default
port for the http interface is ``28017``. To access the http interface an
administrator may, for example, point a browser to
``http://localhost:28017`` if :program:`manual:mongod` is running with the default port on the
local machine.

Here is a description of the informational elements of the http
interface:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **element**
     - **description**
   * - db version
     - database version information
   * - git hash
     - database version developer tag
   * - sys info
     - :program:`manual:mongod` compilation environment
   * - dblocked
     - indicates whether the primary :program:`manual:mongod` mutex is held
   * - uptime
     - time since this :program:`manual:mongod` instance was started
   * - assertions
     - any software assertions that have been raised by this :program:`manual:mongod` instance
   * - replInfo
     - information about replication configuration
   * - currentOp
     - most recent client request
   * - # databases
     - number of databases that have been accessed by this :program:`manual:mongod` instance
   * - curclient
     - last database accessed by this :program:`manual:mongod` instance
   * - Cursors
     - describes outstanding client cursors
   * - master
     - whether this :program:`manual:mongod` instance has been designated a master
   * - slave
     - whether this :program:`manual:mongod` instance has been designated a slave
   * - initialSyncCompleted
     - whether this slave or repl pair node has completed an initial
       clone of the :program:`manual:mongod` instance it is replicating
   * - DBTOP
     - Displays the total time the :program:`manual:mongod` instance has devoted to each
       listed collection, as well as the percentage of available time
       devoted to each listed collection recently and the number of
       reads, writes, and total calls made recently
   * - dt
     - Timing information about the primary :program:`manual:mongod` mutex

HTTP Console Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If security is configured for a :program:`manual:mongod` instance,
authentication is required for a client to access the http interface
from another machine.

.. note:: While MongoDB Enterprise does support Kerberos authentication,
   Kerberos is not supported in HTTP Console in any version of
   MongoDB.

Simple REST Interface
---------------------

The :program:`manual:mongod` process includes a simple REST interface, with no support for
insert/update/remove operations, as a convenience – it is generally used
for monitoring/alerting scripts or administrative tasks. For full REST
capabilities we recommend using an external tool such as
`Sleepy.Mongoose <http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/02/22/sleepy-mongoose-a-mongodb-rest-interface/>`_.

**v1.4+**: This interface is disabled by default. Use ``--rest`` on the
command line to enable.

To get the contents of a collection (note the trailing slash):

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/

To add a limit:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?limit=-10

To skip:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?skip=5

To query for ``{a : 1}``:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?filter_a=1

Separate conditions with an ``&``:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?filter_a=1&limit=-10

Same as ``db.$cmd.findOne({listDatabase:1})`` on the ``admin`` database
in the shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://localhost:28017/admin/$cmd/?filter_listDatabases=1&limit=1

To count documents in a collection:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://host:port/db/$cmd/?filter_count=collection&limit=1

JSON in the simple REST interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simple ReST interface uses strict JSON (as opposed to the shell,
which uses Dates, regular expressions, etc.). To display non-JSON types,
the web interface wraps them in objects and uses the key for the type.
For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   # ObjectIds just become strings
   "_id" : "4a8acf6e7fbadc242de5b4f3"

   # dates
   "date" : { "$date" : 1250609897802 }

   # regular expressions
   "match" : { "$regex" : "foo", "$options" : "ig" }

The code type has not been implemented yet and causes the DB to crash if
you try to display it in the browser.

See :manual:`Mongo Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>`
for details.

Replica Set Admin UI
--------------------

The :program:`manual:mongod` process includes a simple administrative UI for checking the
status of a replica set.

To use, first enable ``--rest`` from the :program:`manual:mongod` command line. The rest port
is the db port plus 1000 (thus, the default is ``28017``). Be sure this port
is secure before enabling this.

Then you can navigate to ``http://<hostname>:28017/`` in your web
browser. Once there, click Replica Set Status
(`/_replSet <http://127.0.0.1:28017/_replSet>`_) to move to the Replica
Set Status page.
