.. method:: Session.startTransaction(<options>)

   Starts a :ref:`multi-document transaction <transactions>`
   associated with the session. At any given time, you can have at most
   one open transaction for a session.

   .. include:: /includes/transaction-support

   .. important::

      Within a transaction, you can only specify read and write (CRUD)
      operations on **existing** collections. For example, a
      multi-document transaction cannot include an insert operation
      that would result in the creation of a new collection.

   The :method:`Session.startTransaction()` method can take a document
   following options:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { readConcern: { level: <level>}, writeConcern: { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> } }

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Option
        - Description

      * - ``readConcern``

        - *Optional.* A document that specifies the :ref:`read concern
          <read-concern>` for all operations in the transaction,
          overriding operation-specific read concern.

          You can specify one of the following read concern levels:

          - :readconcern:`"snapshot"`

          - :readconcern:`"local"`

          - :readconcern:`"majority"`
          
          For :readconcern:`"local"` and :readconcern:`"majority"` read
          concern, MongoDB may sometimes substitute a stronger read
          concern.

      * - ``writeConcern``
      
        - *Optional*. A document that specifies the :ref:`write concern
          <write-concern>` for the transaction. This write concern
          applies to the transaction commit and abort operations.

          The operations within the transaction use :writeconcern:`"w:
          1" <\<number\>>`, overriding operation-specific write concern.

          If you commit using :writeconcern:`"w: 1" <\<number\>>` write
          concern, your transaction can be rolled back during the
          :doc:`failover process </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

          For MongoDB Drivers, transactions use the client-level write
          concern as the default.

Behavior
--------

Operations Supported within a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If running with :doc:`access control </core/authorization>`, you
   must have privileges for the :ref:`operations in the transaction
   <transactions-operations>`.

For :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-crud.rst

.. include:: /includes/table-transactions-operations.rst

Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
dropping a collection or an index, are not allowed in multi-document	
transactions. For example, a multi-document transaction cannot include	
an insert operation that would result in the creation of a new	
collection. See :ref:`transactions-ops-restricted`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-restrictions-info.rst


Read Preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Transactions </core/transactions>` support read preference
:readmode:`primary`.

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

While the transaction is open, no data changes made by operations in
the transaction is visible outside the transaction:

- When a transaction commits, all data changes made in the transaction
  are saved and visible outside the transaction. That is, a transaction
  will not commit some of its changes while rolling back others.

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-committed-visibility.rst

- When a transaction aborts, all data changes made by the writes in the
  transaction are discarded without ever becoming visible and the
  transaction ends.


Example
-------

Consider a scenario where as changes are made to an employee's record
in the ``hr`` database, you want to ensure that the ``events``
collection in the ``reporting`` database are in sync with the ``hr``
changes. That is, you want to ensure that these writes are done as a
single transaction, such that either both operations succeed or fail.

The ``employees`` collection in the ``hr`` database has the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af0776263426f87dd69319a"), "employee" : 3, "name" : { "title" : "Mr.", "name" : "Iba Ochs" }, "status" : "Active", "department" : "ABC" }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af0776263426f87dd693198"), "employee" : 1, "name" : { "title" : "Miss", "name" : "Ann Thrope" }, "status" : "Active", "department" : "ABC" }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af0776263426f87dd693199"), "employee" : 2, "name" : { "title" : "Mrs.", "name" : "Eppie Delta" }, "status" : "Active", "department" : "XYZ" }

The ``events`` collection in the ``reporting`` database has the
following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af07daa051d92f02462644a"), "employee" : 1, "status" : { "new" : "Active", "old" : null }, "department" : { "new" : "ABC", "old" : null } }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af07daa051d92f02462644b"), "employee" : 2, "status" : { "new" : "Active", "old" : null }, "department" : { "new" : "XYZ", "old" : null } }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5af07daa051d92f02462644c"), "employee" : 3, "status" : { "new" : "Active", "old" : null }, "department" : { "new" : "ABC", "old" : null } }

The following example opens a transaction, updates an employee's status
to ``Inactive`` in the ``employees`` status and inserts a corresponding
document to the ``events`` collection, and commits the two operations
as a single transaction.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Runs the txnFunc and retries if TransientTransactionError encountered

   function runTransactionWithRetry(txnFunc, session) {
       while (true) {
           try {
               txnFunc(session);  // performs transaction
               break;
           } catch (error) {
               // If transient error, retry the whole transaction
               if ( error.hasOwnProperty("errorLabels") && error.errorLabels.includes("TransientTransactionError")  ) {
                   print("TransientTransactionError, retrying transaction ...");
                   continue;
               } else {
                   throw error;
               }
           }
       }   
   }

   // Retries commit if UnknownTransactionCommitResult encountered

   function commitWithRetry(session) {
       while (true) {
           try {
               session.commitTransaction(); // Uses write concern set at transaction start.
               print("Transaction committed.");
               break;
           } catch (error) {
               // Can retry commit
               if (error.hasOwnProperty("errorLabels") && error.errorLabels.includes("UnknownTransactionCommitResult") ) {
                   print("UnknownTransactionCommitResult, retrying commit operation ...");
                   continue;
               } else {
                   print("Error during commit ...");
                   throw error;
               }
          }
       }
   }

   // Updates two collections in a transactions

   function updateEmployeeInfo(session) {
       employeesCollection = session.getDatabase("hr").employees;
       eventsCollection = session.getDatabase("reporting").events;

       session.startTransaction( { readConcern: { level: "snapshot" }, writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } );

       try{
           employeesCollection.updateOne( { employee: 3 }, { $set: { status: "Inactive" } } );
           eventsCollection.insertOne( { employee: 3, status: { new: "Inactive", old: "Active" } } );
       } catch (error) {
           print("Caught exception during transaction, aborting.");
           session.abortTransaction();
           throw error;
       }

       commitWithRetry(session);
   }

   // Start a session.
   session = db.getMongo().startSession( { readPreference: { mode: "primary" } } );

   try{
      runTransactionWithRetry(updateEmployeeInfo, session);
   } catch (error) {
      // Do something with error
   } finally {
      session.endSession();
   }
