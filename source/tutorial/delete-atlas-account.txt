To delete your |service| account, you must ensure that you have no:

- Outstanding invoices
- Active clusters
- Projects  
- Organizations


This document walks you through deleting your 
|service| account.



Delete All Projects
-------------------

.. admonition:: Prerequisites
   :class: important

   To delete a project for an organization:

   - You must either have the ``Owner`` role for the project or have the ``Organization 
     Owner`` role for the project's organization.

   - The project must have no outstanding invoices.

   - The project must have no active clusters.


Check Project Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn how to view your project's invoices, see `View or Download Your Current Invoices
<https://docs-staging.atlas.mongodb.com/tahiya.chowdhury/
DOCSP-8745/billing.html#view-or-download-your-invoices>`__. 


Terminate All Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

To terminate an |service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| executes the terminate operation after completing any
in-progress deployment changes.


Delete a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a project for an organization either from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

   - id: projects-view

     name: "Delete from Projects view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project.rst

   - id: project-setting-view

     name: "Delete from Project Setting view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project-from-settings.rst


Delete All Organizations
------------------------

.. important::

   To delete an organization, you must have :authrole:`Organization
   Owner` role for the organization.

   You cannot delete an organization that has active projects. You must
   delete the organization's projects before you can delete the
   organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-organization.rst

Email Atlas Support to Finalize Deletion Process
------------------------------------------------

Once you delete all active clusters, projects, and organizations, you
will no longer be billed for any |service| activity and will no longer
receive |service| alerts.

To finalize the deletion process, send an email to the |service| support
team at cloud-account-support@mongodb.com. In the email, use the subject
line :guilabel:`Request for Atlas Account Deletion`.

For security purposes, you must send the email from the same email
address associated with the |service| account you want to delete.

.. important::
   
   You cannot reuse the email address that is associated with the 
   deleted account to create a new |service| account.
