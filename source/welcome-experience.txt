through the Welcome Experience. Refer to the following sections for
information on the possible paths that the Welcome Experience offers:

- :ref:`Connect Your Data Sources <welcome-connect-data>`

- :ref:`Explore with Sample Data <welcome-explore-data>`

- :ref:`welcome-skip-to-dashboards`

|service| clusters to |charts| and visualize your data.

  existing |service| cluster, you can :ref:`Explore Charts with Sample
  Data <welcome-explore-data>`.

other dashboards.

   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back
   through the :ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page. 

.. _welcome-skip-to-dashboards:

Skip to Shared Data Sources or Dashboards
-----------------------------------------

If you have already been granted access to data sources or dashboards
prior to completing the welcome experience, you can bypass the welcome
experience and immediately begin viewing your shared data sources and
dashboards.

To exit the welcome experience and begin exploring your shared
data sources and dashboards, click
:guilabel:`Skip selection and view` at the bottom of the welcome
experience view.
