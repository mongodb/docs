  You can download the dataset from the following URL.

  .. container:: admonition

     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json

  For example, the following command uses the ``wget`` utility to
  download the file:

  .. code-block:: shell

     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json

  Take note of the full path to where you download the file. You must 
  provide this to ``mongoimport`` later in this procedure.

  The :guilabel:`Data Import and Export Tools` section of the 
  :guilabel:`Command Line Tools` tab displays a copyable template with 
  the minimum required options for connecting ``mongoimport`` to your 
  |service| cluster. 
  
  The template includes placeholder values for certain options. Copy
  and paste the template into your preferred text editor and make the
  following modifications:
  
  - ``<PASSWORD>`` - replace this with the password for the user 
    specified in ``--username``. The template includes a MongoDB user
    for the project as the ``--username``. If you want to authenticate 
    as a different user, replace the value of ``--username`` and 
    specify the password for that user in ``--password``.

  - ``<DATABASE>`` - replace this with ``guidebook``
  - ``<COLLECTION>`` - replace this with ``restaurants``
  - ``<FILETYPE>`` - replace this with ``json``
  - ``<FILENAME>`` - replace this with the path to ``primer-dataset.json``.

  .. important::

     Ensure that the host where you are running ``mongoimport``
     is in the project :ref:`IP whitelist <security-ip-whitelist>`.

     To review your project whitelist, click :guilabel:`Security`
     from the |service| projects view, then click
     :guilabel:`IP Whitelist`. For complete documentation on managing 
     your project whitelist, see :ref:`security-ip-whitelist`.

  Paste the completed template into your terminal or shell environment
  and execute it. Your template should resemble the following
  command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongoimport --host example/00.example.net:27017,01.example.net:27017,02.example.net:27017 \
       --ssl --username admin --password myRealPassword --authenticationDatabase admin \
       --db guidebook --collection restaurants \
       --type json --file /path/to/primer-dataset.json
