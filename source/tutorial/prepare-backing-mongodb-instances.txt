Overview
--------

Before you install |onprem| you must deploy the supporting databases first.
These are called :term:`backing databases`. |mms| cannot deploy or manage
these databases. These databases include the :ref:`mms-application-database`
and the :term:`backup database <Backup Database>`. You must deploy an
application database. It holds |onprem| operational data. You may deploy a
:term:`backup database <Backup Database>` if you want to use the |onprem|
:doc:`backup feature </core/backup-overview>`. This database stores
:term:`oplog` data, temporary sync data, and, depending on your configuration,
your :term:`snapshots <snapshot>`.

These databases run on dedicated MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.
If you use  
:doc:`multiple backup databases </tutorial/configure-backup-high-availability>`, 
you must configure one replica set for each backup database.
The replica set for each database must be dedicated to that database only and
*must store no other data*.

The :term:`backing databases` must run on independent :term:`replica sets
<replica set>` on independent storage volumes. Running regular backups, a
backup database could fill a volume. If the application database cannot write
to a volume, |onprem| stops. Proper storage setup reduces the risk of |onprem|
failures.

.. note::

   |mms| cannot deploy or manage the |mms| :term:`backing databases`.

Considerations
--------------

Replica Set Topology
++++++++++++++++++++

Each :term:`backing database <backing databases>` :term:`replica set` should
include three data-bearing members for high availability. If you lack storage
capacity for three data-bearing members, the third member of a backing
database may be an :term:`arbiter`.

For the |onprem| :term:`application database`, you may run one member of the
replica set on the same host as |onprem|.

.. admonition:: Backing Databases with fewer than three data-bearing members
   :class: important

   When writing to its :term:`backing databases`, |onprem| uses the
   :guilabel:`Replica Acknowledged` (``w:2``) :manual:`write concern
   </reference/write-concern>`. This write concern reports a write as
   successful *only* after the primary *and* one secondary acknowledge that
   write. This means that if a backing database loses one of the two data-
   bearing members, MongoDB stops write operations.

Prerequisites
-------------

Replica Set Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :term:`replica sets <replica set>` that host the |onprem| :term:`backing databases` must:

Use Dedicated Databases
  The :term:`replica sets <replica set>` must store data to support |onprem|
  metadata *only*. They must store *no other data*.

Use a Compatible MongoDB Version
  .. include:: /includes/fact-compatible-mongodb-versions.rst

Use the WiredTiger Storage Engine for the Application Database
  Use :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` for the |onprem|
  application database.

Use the Appropriate Storage Engine for the Backup Database
  For backup database configuration options, see :ref:`selecting a Storage
  Engine for Backup <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.

Enable JavaScript for the Databases through the Configuration File
  Set the MongoDB :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` option to ``true``,
  which is the default. The |application| uses the 
  :manual:`$where </reference/operator/query/where>` query and
  requires this setting be enabled on the |onprem| 
  :term:`application database`.

Use Queries that Do Not Require Indexes
  Do *not* run the :term:`backing databases` with the MongoDB
  :parameter:`--notablescan` :manual:`parameter </reference/parameters>` set.
  When set, this parameter specifies that all queries must use indexes.

.. _backing-instances-security:

Replica Set Security
++++++++++++++++++++

Secure the Connection to the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>`
  Ensure that connections from |onprem| to your :term:`backing databases` are
  secure. Configure these databases to accept connections from |onprem| that
  :ref:`only use SSL <configure-ssl-backing>`.

Configure an :term:`Authentication Mechanism <authentication mechanism>` for the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>`
  Limit access to your backing databases to specific MongoDB users
  using an authentication mechanism. To configure your backing
  databases to use authentication, see :ref:`configure-auth-backing`.

Configure the |mms| User that Accesses the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>` with Only Needed Roles
  Set these users to have the :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` and
  :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase` roles. If a backing database is a sharded
  cluster, add :authrole:`clusterAdmin`, otherwise add
  :authrole:`clusterMonitor`.

.. _backing-instances-prerequisites:

Host Configuration
++++++++++++++++++

The hosts that run the :term:`replica sets <replica set>` must meet the
following requirements for:

Hardware
  The hosts must meet :ref:`mms-application-database-specifications` or
  :ref:`backup-database-specifications` depending on which database
  the host runs. If a host serves other |onprem| components in
  addition to the database, you must sum the hardware requirements for
  each component to determine the requirements for the host.

System Configuration
  The hosts must be configured according to the requirements given in the
  :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes </administration/production-notes>` except
  where explicitly contradicted in this tutorial. The Production Notes include
  information on ulimits, NUMA, and other configuration options.

Networking
  Network security must allow the needed ports described in :doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`.
  The appropriate inbound and outbound firewall rules for each host must allow
  access to the required ports.

:abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` and CentOS 6 hosts only

Deploy Backing Databases
------------------------

To deploy MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>` to host the |onprem|
:term:`backing databases`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-backing-dbs.rst

Next Steps
----------

- When you install |onprem|, you must set the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  setting to connect to the :term:`replica set` you created for the
  application database in this tutorial.

- If you enable backup for your |onprem| deployment, you must :doc:`configure
  the oplog store </tutorial/manage-oplog-storage>` to use the replica set
  that you created for the backup database in this tutorial. If you *also*
  choose to use a :term:`blockstore` or :term:`S3 snapshot store <S3 Snapshot
  Store>` to store your :term:`snapshots <snapshot>`, you must :manual:`deploy
  one Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` for each :doc:`blockstore
  </tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage>` or :doc:`S3 blockstore
  </tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage>` metadata database.
