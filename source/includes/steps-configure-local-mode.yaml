  a. Click :guilabel:`Admin` in the upper right corner to open system
     administration.

  #. From the :guilabel:`General` tab, click
     :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Miscellaneous` tab at the top of the page.

  #. In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Version Management` section, select the 
     following settings:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 30 70
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Option
          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Installer Download Source`

          - Select :guilabel:`local`.

            All necessary installers are downloaded from |onprem|
            Application Servers. {+mdbagent+} hosts do not need an
            internet connection.

            An |onprem| administrator provides installers from the
            :dl:`MongoDB Download Center <enterprise>` into the
            :setting:`Versions Directory`. |onprem| serves them to
            {+mdbagent+} hosts. The Version Manifest must be
            updated manually.
            No hosts in the deployment require an internet connection.

        * - :guilabel:`Versions Directory`
          - Accept the plaform default value unless you need to
            change it to meet a requirement for your environment.

            The default locations for the :setting:`Versions Directory`
            depend on your |onprem| host platform:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 30 70

               * - Platform
                 - Versions Directory Default Path

               * - RHEL, Ubuntu
                 - ``/opt/mongodb/mms/mongodb-releases``

               * - Linux Archive
                 - ``<userSelected>/mongodb-releases``

               * - Windows
                 - ``C:\MMSData\MongoDBReleases``

            The |application| expects the MongoDB binaries to be
            stored in this directory on every |onprem| host.

        * - :guilabel:`Backup Versions Auto Download`
          - Select ``true`` unless your :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon>` and
            |application| run on different platforms (chip
            architectures, operating systems, or operating system
            versions). If they run on separate platforms, select
            ``false``.

        * - :guilabel:`Backup Versions Auto Download Enterprise Builds`
          - Select ``true`` if you want the Backup Daemon to download
            MongoDB Enterprise builds as well as MongoDB Community
            builds.

        * - :guilabel:`Required Module for Backup`
          - Select which build of MongoDB you want the
            :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon>` to use for the :opsmgr:`head database </reference/glossary/#term-head-database>`.
            Select :guilabel:`Enterprise Required` if you want the 
            Backup Daemon to download only MongoDB Enterprise builds.

stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: download-binaries
content: |

   Using a computer connected to the Internet, go to the
   :dl:`MongoDB Download Center <enterprise>` and download the MongoDB
   binary archives for the appropriate platforms and versions.

   Binaries are stored as compressed archives (``TGZ`` for all platforms except Windows,  and ``ZIP`` for Windows).

   .. note::

      If you download a binary archive using Microsoft Edge, the
      archive downloads with a ``.gz`` extension instead of a ``.tgz``
      extension. Change this file extension to ``.tgz`` before continuing.

   If you do not have a list of which versions you require, return to
   the :guilabel:`Prerequisites` section of this tutorial and review
   the :guilabel:`Determine which Binaries to Store Locally and Download` section.

title: "Populate all |onprem| hosts with the necessary MongoDB binaries and archives."
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: populate-with-binaries
content: |

  On *all* your |onprem| hosts, copy all of the archived binaries (in ``TGZ``
  for all platforms other than Windows, or ``ZIP`` for Windows) for
  :dl:`MongoDB Server <enterprise>` and
  :dl:`MongoDB Database Tools <database-tools>` into the
  :setting:`Versions Directory`. Include each platform and version of
  these binaries that you plan to support.

  :setting:`This directory <Versions Directory>` stores all of the
  archived and extracted binaries. |onprem| needs these binaries in the ``TGZ``
  or ``ZIP`` formats to install and upgrade MongoDB deployments and tools.

title: "Ensure that the |mms| Linux user can read files in the Versions Directory. (Linux only)"
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: mongodb-mms-as-owner
optional: true
content: |

  On a Linux platform, the ``mongodb-mms`` user needs the read
  permissions to the :setting:`Versions Directory`.

  a. Change ownership of all files and  directories in the Versions
     Directory to ``mongodb-mms``.

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable:

        sudo chown -R mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*

  b. Change permissions on all the files under the
     Versions Directory to allow the:

     - **Owner** to read and write them
     - **Group** to read them

     When you set these permissions, |onprem| can read and extract the
     archived binaries. Do not remove the execute permission from any
     directories under the
     :setting:`Versions Directory`. If you did, the
     :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon>` cannot access any files inside those
     directories.

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable:

        sudo chmod -R 640 <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*.tgz \
          <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*.zip

  If these steps were successful, the resulting list of the
  :setting:`Versions Directory` should look similar to the following example.
  This example may not reflect the list of currently supported versions.

  .. code-block:: sh

  Repeat these steps on each |onprem| host.
