.. note:: 
   
   When updating the replica configuration object, address all members
   of the set using the index value in the array. The array index
   begins with ``0``. Do not confuse this index value with the value
   of the :data:`_id <members[n]._id>` field in each document in the
   :data:`members <rs.conf.members>` array.
         
   The :data:`_id <members[n]._id>` rarely corresponds to the array
   index.
