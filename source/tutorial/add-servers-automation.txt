Provision Servers for Automation
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| can automate operations for the MongoDB processes running on your
servers. |mms| can both discover existing processes and deploy new ones.

.. only:: onprem

   When you provision servers for Automation they are also provisioned for
   Monitoring. To provision servers for Automation, install the Automation
   Agent on each server.

.. only:: cloud

   When you provision servers for Automation they are also provisioned for
   Monitoring. To provision servers for Automation, either install the
   Automation Agent on each server or use |mms| :doc:`auto-provisioning
   </tutorial/provision-cloud-servers>`, which automatically installs the
   Automation Agent to each provisioned server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can provision servers for automation you must meet the
following prerequisites.

Server Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each server must meet the following requirements.

- At least 10 GB of free disk space plus whatever space is necessary to
  hold your MongoDB data.

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, we recommend at
  least an ``m3.medium`` instance.

MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the Automation Agent. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
Automation Agent.

.. include:: /includes/steps/automation-agent-install.rst

Next Steps
----------

Once you have installed the agent to all your servers, you can deploy your
first :doc:`replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`, :doc:`cluster
</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`, or :doc:`standalone
</tutorial/deploy-standalone>`.
