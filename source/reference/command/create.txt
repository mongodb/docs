Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: create

   Explicitly creates a collection. :dbcommand:`create` has the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { create: <collection_name>,
        capped: <true|false>,
        autoIndexId: <true|false>,
        size: <max_size>,
        max: <max_documents>,
        flags: <0|1>
      }

   :dbcommand:`create` has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/create-field.rst

   For more information on the ``autoIndexId`` field in versions before
   2.2, see :ref:`2.2-id-indexes-capped-collections`.

   The :method:`db.createCollection()` method wraps the
   :dbcommand:`create` command.

Considerations
--------------

The :dbcommand:`create` command obtains a write lock on the
affected database and will block other operations until it has
completed. The write lock for this operation is typically short
lived. However, allocations for large capped collections may take
longer.

Example
-------

To create a :term:`capped collection` limited to 64 kilobytes, issue
the command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: "collection", capped: true, size: 64 * 1024 } )
