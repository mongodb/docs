If you need to change the hostname of a replica set member without
changing the configuration of that member or the set, you can use the
operation outlined in this tutorial. For example if you must
re-provision systems or rename hosts, you can use this pattern to
minimize the scope of that change.

Operation
---------

To change the hostname for a replica set member modify the
:rsconf:`members[n].host` field. The value of
:rsconf:`members[n]._id` field will not change
when you reconfigure the set.

See :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` and
:method:`rs.reconfig()` for more information.

.. note::

   Any replica set configuration change can trigger the current
   :term:`primary` to step down, which forces an :ref:`election
   <replica-set-elections>`. During the election, the current shell
   session and clients connected to this replica set disconnect,
   which produces an error even when the operation succeeds.

Example
-------

To change the hostname to ``mongo2.example.net`` for the replica set
member configured at ``members[0]``, issue the following sequence of
commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].host = "mongo2.example.net"
   rs.reconfig(cfg)
