  Can |onprem| monitor itself?
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  Yes. You can use |onprem| to monitor the :doc:`backing MongoDB
  instances </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`
  that hold data for |onprem| and the Backup Daemon. Create a
  separate :doc:`project </tutorial/manage-projects>` for the backing
  instances.

  You **cannot**, however, use |onprem| to backup or automate the backing
  instances.

  |onprem| also provides built-in basic monitoring of all backing
  databases through :doc:`system alerts </core/system-alerts>`.

  How can I use Backup if Backup jobs fail to bind?
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The most common reason that jobs fail to bind to a Backup Daemon is
  because no daemon has space for a local copy of the backed up replica
  set.

  To increase capacity so that the backup job can bind, you:

  - Can add an additional backup daemon.

  - Can't use :opsmgr:`head databases </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`.

  How do I resolve ``applyOps`` errors during backups?
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  If you notice *consistent* errors in ``applyOps`` commands in your
  Backup logs, it *may* indicate that the daemon has run out of space.

  To increase space on a daemon to support continued operations, you:

  - Can increase the size of the file system that holds the
    ``head directory``.

  - Can't use :opsmgr:`head databases </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`.

  This alert indicates only that the |mms| server can connect to the
  :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` that it is monitoring. It does not diagnose
  whether your host is exposed to the public, despite the alert
  message. This alert occurs if you configured a setting called
  :guilabel:`Exposed DB Host Check`, which is a setting used with
  |cloud|.
