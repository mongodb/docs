Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system
snapshots to capture a copy of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. An
alternate procedure uses :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create binary
database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the
alternate procedure.

See :doc:`/core/backups` and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for complete
information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded clusters in
particular.

Considerations
--------------

Balancing
~~~~~~~~~

It is *essential* that you stop the balancer before capturing a
backup.

If the balancer is active while you capture backups, the backup
artifacts may be incomplete and/or have duplicate data, as :term:`chunks
<chunk>` may migrate while recording backups.

Precision
~~~~~~~~~

In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup
up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each
shard in the cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can improve the quality
of the backup while minimizing impact on the cluster by taking the
backup from a secondary member of the replica set that provides each
shard.

Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the journal and data files are on the same logical volume, you can
use a single point-in-time snapshot to capture a valid copy of the data.

If the journal and data files are on different file systems, you must
use :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnLock()` to capture
a valid copy of your data.
