A reference page provides quick information to experienced users of a
product. Reference pages may describe the use of a method, operator, or
database command. Release notes are another example of reference page.

Usually, the title of a reference page is the name of the command, operator, or 
method it describes.

Definition
----------

A reference page begins with a brief introduction summarizing its
contents, often called a short description. The short description
explains a little about how the reference material is used, and may link
to a concept or task page.

Compatibility 
-------------

Optional. 

A list of MongoDB editions that support the referenced method, operator, 
or database command: 

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`_: The fully managed service 
  for MongoDB deployments in the cloud

.. note:: 

   If Atlas supports the command or functionality, specify a level of 
   compatibility such as one of the following: 

   - Available in all clusters 
   - Available only in certain clusters 
   - Available in no clusters

   To see an example, see `aggregate Compatibility <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.3/reference/command/aggregate/#compatibility>`__.

- `MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`_: 
  The subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDB

- `MongoDB Community <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>`_: The 
  source-available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDB

.. tip:: 

   On the MongoDB Server documentation, you can use the following includes for 
   the list of supported MongoDB editions:

   - ``.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst``
   - ``.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst``

   On the MongoDB Drivers documentation, you can use 
   ``.. sharedinclude:: dbx/platform-support/atlas-connect-compatible-deployment.rst``.

Behaviors
---------

Optional. 

Behaviors should apply only to the operator described on this page. 

Examples
--------

Optional.

This section could contain examples of the most common use cases. Use
includes for Reference and Task page examples, so we write the examples
once, present them consistently throughout the documentation, and can
update them easily.

If an example is shared between task and reference, you should write it
as an include.
