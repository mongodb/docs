  The |html| code which appears in the modal window shows the parameters
  which are required to share a chart with authentication enabled, but
  it is not usable as-is. Continue with the subsequent steps to
  enable authenticated access.

ref: go-to-admin-settings

  Click the :guilabel:`Charts Settings` link below the HTML code
  snippet in the modal window.

  .. note::

     You must be a :ref:`Project Owner <dashboard-permissions>` to
     access the :guilabel:`Charts Settings` page. For users with the
     Project Owner role, the :guilabel:`Charts Settings` link appears
     in the top right corner of the |charts| UI. As a non-admin user,
     you can still use embedded charts, but you will need to ask a
     Project Owner for a key.

title: Generate an embedding key.
ref: generate-key
level: 4
content: |

  Click the :guilabel:`Generate New Key` button to create a new
  embedding key. Store the key in a safe place.

  .. warning::

     If you generate a new key, any previous keys become invalid.
     Ensure that all the existing shared charts that use the old key
     are updated to use the new key.

title: Create the server-side code necessary for a verified
       signature.
ref: server-side-code
level: 4
content: |
  Generating a verified signature to accompany data requests from shared
  charts with authentication enabled requires server-side code. The
  verified signature creates a payload by generating a
  :wikipedia:`HMAC </HMAC>` from your embedding key, a timestamp, and
  identifying data from your chart. The verified signature is valid for
  a limited time period specified in your server-side code.

  Code examples demonstrating how to generate a verified
  signature are available for the following languages and platforms:

  - :gh:`Node.js </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/node>`
  - :gh:`C# </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/c-sharp>`
  - :gh:`Java </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/java>`
  - :gh:`Python </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/python>`
  - :gh:`MongoDB Stitch </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/stitch>`
