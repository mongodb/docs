  localhost:27017
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     If you use IPv6 and use the ``<address>:<port>`` format, you must
     enclose the portion of an address and port combination in

     **Version 3.2 and earlier:** For TLS/SSL connections (``--ssl``) to
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`, if the {{program}} runs without the

     to expired :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
     well as to foreign processes posing as valid :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. Ensure that you *always* specify the

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Use the {{role}} option only if the
  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a passphrase. See
  :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - ``synchronous``

       - The {{program}} uses synchronous networking and manages its
         networking thread pool on a per connection basis. Previous
         versions of MongoDB managed threads in this way.

     * - ``adaptive``

       - The {{program}} uses the new experimental asynchronous
         networking mode with an adaptive thread pool which manages
         threads on a per request basis. This mode should have more
         consistent performance and use less resources when there are
         more inactive connections than database requests.

         .. important::

            Using ``adaptive`` requires {{option}} set to
            ``asio``.
