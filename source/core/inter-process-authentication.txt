In most cases, :term:`replica set` and :term:`sharded cluster`
administrators do not have to keep additional considerations in mind
beyond the normal security precautions that all MongoDB administrators
must take. However, ensure that:

- Your network configuration will allow every member of the replica
  set to contact every other member of the replica set.

- If you use MongoDB's authentication system to limit access to your
  infrastructure, ensure that you configure a
  :setting:`keyFile` on all members to permit authentication.

For most instances, the most effective ways to control access and to
secure the connection between members of a :term:`replica set` depend
on network-level access control. Use your environment's firewall and
network routing to ensure that traffic *only* from clients and other
replica set members can reach your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. If
needed, use virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure secure
connections over wide area networks (WANs.)

Enable Authentication in Replica Sets and Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.8
   Added support authentication in replica set deployments.

.. versionchanged:: 1.9.1
   Added support authentication in sharded replica set deployments.

MongoDB provides an authentication mechanism for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances connecting to replica sets. These instances
enable authentication but specify a shared key file that serves as a
shared password.

To enable authentication, add the following option to your configuration
file:

.. code-block:: cfg

   keyFile = /srv/mongodb/keyfile

.. note::

   You may chose to set these run-time configuration options using the
   :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>` (or :option:`mongos --keyFile`)
   options on the command line.

Setting :setting:`keyFile` enables authentication and specifies a key
file for the replica set members to use when authenticating to each
other. The content of the key file is arbitrary but must be the same
on all members of the replica set and on all :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances that connect to the set.

The key file must be between 6 and 1024 characters and may only
contain characters in the base64 set. The key file must not have group
or "world" permissions on UNIX systems. See
:doc:`/tutorial/generate-key-file` for instructions on generating a
key file.
