Restore a Cluster
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled snapshot or from a
selected point between snapshots. For replica sets, you can restore
from selected points in time. For sharded clusters you can restore from
checkpoints between snapshots. For information on backup,
:doc:`/backup-cluster`.

Restore a Cluster
-----------------

To restore a cluster, go to :guilabel:`Backup` view. In the
:guilabel:`Overview`, hover over the :guilabel:`Status` field of the
cluster backup to display the :guilabel:`Restore` button. Click the
:guilabel:`Restore` button or click the ellipsis button under
:guilabel:`Options` and select :guilabel:`Restore`.

Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

- download your backup data via HTTPS or SCP [#scp]_ and restore
  manually or

- have |service| restore to a selected cluster. |service| can only
  restore to same cluster or another cluster with the same topology in
  the same |service| group.

.. warning::
   Restore requires **downtime** for the target cluster.

.. [#scp] 
   To use SCP, go to :guilabel:`Settings`, :guilabel:`Group Settings`
   and create a :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores`.
