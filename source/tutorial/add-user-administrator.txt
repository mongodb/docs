==================================================
Create an Administrator with Superuser Credentials
==================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A MongoDB superuser is a user with either the
:authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role. The user
with either of these roles can create and modify any other users and can
assign them any privileges. The user also can grant *itself* any
privileges. In production deployments, this user should have *no other
roles* and should only administer users and privileges.

This should be the first user created for a MongoDB deployment. This
user can then create all other users in the system.

.. important:: The :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` user can grant
   itself and any other user full access to anything. The credentials to
   log in as this user should be carefully controlled.

.. important:: A user with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` is not 
   the same as the traditional ``root`` superuser in that this role does 
   not enable the user to read/insert data in the database or perform 
   database-related operations.

Create a ``UserAdmin`` Superuser
---------------------------------

1. Connect to the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` by either:

   - Authenticating as an existing user with the :authrole:`userAdmin`
     or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role.

   - Authenticating using the :ref:`localhost exception
     <localhost-exception>`. When creating the first user in a
     deployment, you must authenticate using the :ref:`localhost exception
     <localhost-exception>`.

#. Switch to the ``admin`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db = db.getSiblingDB('admin')

#. Add the user with either the :authrole:`userAdmin` role or
   :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role, and only that role, by issuing
   a command similar to the following, where ``<username>`` is the
   username and ``<password>`` is the password:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.addUser( { user: "<username>",
                    pwd: "<password>",
                    roles: [ "userAdminAnyDatabase" ] } )

.. _localhost-exception:

Authenticate with Full Administrative Access via Localhost
----------------------------------------------------------

If there are no users for the ``admin`` database, you can connect with
full administrative access via the localhost interface. This bypass
exists to support bootstrapping new deployments. This approach is
useful, for example, if you want to run :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` with authentication before creating your first user.

To authenticate via localhost, connect to the :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` from a client running on the same system. Your
connection will have full administrative access.

To disable the localhost bypass, set the
:parameter:`enableLocalhostAuthBypass` parameter using
:setting:`setParameter` during startup:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongod --setParameter mongod enableLocalhostAuthBypass=1

.. note:: 

   For versions of MongoDB 2.2 prior to 2.2.4, if :program:`mongos` is
   running with :setting:`keyFile`, then all users connecting over the
   localhost interface must authenticate, even if there aren't any users
   in the ``admin`` database. Connections on localhost are not correctly
   granted full access on sharded systems that run those versions.

   MongoDB 2.2.4 resolves this issue.

.. note::

   In version 2.2, you cannot add the first user to a sharded cluster
   using the ``localhost`` connection. If you are running a 2.2
   sharded cluster and want to enable authentication, you must deploy
   the cluster and add the first user to the ``admin`` database before
   restarting the cluster to run with :setting:`keyFile`.
