Overview
--------

On this page, you can find a list of features that
{+django-odm+} does not support. You can also find features
currently planned for the General Availability (GA) and post-GA
releases. We will prioritize these upcoming features
based on user demand, and you can request support
for a feature by leaving a suggestion on the `Drivers Feedback Forum
<https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924286-drivers?category_id=370732>`__.

Feature Limitations
-------------------

In this section, you can learn about the following
types of unsupported {+framework+} and MongoDB features:

- :ref:`django-limitations-database`
- :ref:`django-limitations-models`
- :ref:`django-limitations-query`
- :ref:`django-limitations-management`
- :ref:`django-limitations-migration`
- :ref:`django-limitations-async`
- :ref:`django-limitations-data`
- :ref:`django-limitations-performance`

.. _django-limitations-database:

Unsupported Database Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following database variables are not supported by {+django-odm+}:

- ``ATOMIC_REQUESTS``
- ``AUTOCOMMIT``
- ``CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS``
- ``TIME_ZONE``

.. _django-limitations-models:

Model Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following limitations apply to models in {+django-odm+}:

- {+django-odm+} enforces a one-to-one mapping between a Django model and a
  MongoDB collection. Because of this, multiple models cannot share the same collection.

Indexes
```````

{+django-odm+} does not support the following index functionalities:

- Creating ``$vectorSearch`` and ``$search`` indexes through the Django
  Indexes API
- Creating geospatial indexes through the Django Indexes API
- Updating indexes in ``EmbeddedModelFields`` after model creation

To learn how to run unsupported database operations by operating directly on
your ``MongoClient`` instance, see :ref:`django-client-operations`  in the
Perform Raw Database Queries guide.

.. _django-limitations-models-fields:

Fields
``````

{+django-odm+} has the following limitations on the specified field types:

- ``ArrayField``

  - {+django-odm+} does not support ``ArrayField`` polymorphism.
  - {+django-odm+} does not support nesting an ``EmbeddedModelField`` within an ``ArrayField``.

- ``EmbeddedModelField``

  - ``EmbeddedModel`` schema changes do not register after creation.
  - Embedded documents cannot take Django foreign keys.
  - {+django-odm+} does not support arbitrary or untyped embedded model
    fields. You must derive all fields from a ``EmbeddedModel`` class.

- ``JSONField``

  - {+django-odm+} cannot distinguish between a JSON and a SQL ``null`` value.
    Queries that use ``Value(None, JSONField())`` or the ``isnull`` lookup
    return both JSON and SQL ``null`` values.
  - Some queries with ``Q`` objects, such as ``Q(value__foo="bar")``, might
    not work as expected.
  - Filtering for ``None`` values incorrectly returns objects in which a field
    does not exist.

- ``DateTimeField``

  - {+django-odm+} does not support microsecond granularity for
    ``DateTimeField``.

- ``DurationField``

  - ``DurationField`` stores milliseconds rather than microseconds.

- ``ForeignKey``

  - When possible, you should use an ``EmbeddedModelField`` instead of a
    ``ForeignKey`` field to avoid using ``$lookup`` operations. An
    ``EmbeddedModelField`` emulates a MongoDB embedded document and performs
    better than a ``ForeignKey`` field. To learn more about how to reduce
    ``$lookup`` operations, see the :atlas:`Reduce $lookup Operations
    </schema-suggestions/reduce-lookup-operations/>` guide in the Atlas
    documentation.
  - Performance of `CASCADE deletes <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CASCADE>`__ 
    on a ``ForeignKey`` field is not as performant as using an
    ``EmbeddedModelField``.

The following field types are unavailable in {+django-odm+}:

- ``GeneratedField``
- ``AutoField``
- ``BigAutoField``
- ``SmallAutoField``

.. _django-limitations-query:

Querying Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} does not support the following ``QuerySet`` API methods:

- ``distinct()``
- ``dates()``
- ``datetimes()``
- ``prefetch_related()``
- ``extra()``

{+django-odm+} does not support ``QuerySet.delete()`` and ``update()`` queries
that span multiple collections.

Geospatial Queries
``````````````````

- {+django-odm+} does not support ``GeoDjango``.
- {+django-odm+} does not have any Django lookup operators for MongoDB-specific
  geospatial queries.

Aggregation Operators
`````````````````````

{+django-odm+} does not contain any custom Django field lookups for the MongoDB
aggregation framework. Instead, use the ``raw_aggregate()`` method. For more
information on the ``raw_aggregate()`` method, see
the :ref:`django-raw-queries` guide.

.. TODO: Link to aggregation

Database Functions
``````````````````

{+django-odm+} does not support the following database functions:

- ``Chr``
- ``ExtractQuarter``
- ``MD5``
- ``Now``
- ``Ord``
- ``Pad``
- ``Repeat``
- ``Reverse``
- ``Right``
- ``SHA1``, ``SHA224``, ``SHA256``, ``SHA384``, ``SHA512``
- ``Sign``

The ``tzinfo`` parameter of the ``Trunc`` database functions doesn't work
properly because MongoDB converts the result back to UTC.

.. _django-limitations-management:

Django Management Command Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} does not support the following Django management commands:

- ``createcachetable``
- ``inspectdb``
- ``optimizemigration``
- ``sqlflush``
- ``sqlsequencereset``

.. _django-limitations-migration:

Migration Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- {+django-odm+} does not support enforced schema validation. To learn how to
  enforce schema validation in your application, see the :manual:`Specify JSON
  Schema Validation </core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/>` guide in the
  {+mdb-server+} manual.
- {+django-odm+} does not support `DDL Transactions
  <{+django-docs+}/topics/migrations/#transactions>`__.
- {+django-odm+} does not support the ``migrate --fake-initial`` command.

.. _django-limitations-async:

Asynchronous Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} has not been tested for support of the asynchronous functionality of
the Django API.

.. _django-limitations-data:

Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} does not have a custom ``Field`` class for the ``BSONRegExp``
data type. Instead, use the ``CharField`` class.

.. _django-limitations-performance:

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

The engineering team is prioritizing feature development for the Public Preview
release of {+django-odm+}. Because of this, you might notice performance
limitations with certain workloads. If you encounter any performance issues,
please report them as shown in the :ref:`Issues & Help <django-issues-and-help>`
guide. You can also share your feedback on the `Drivers Feedback Forum
<https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924286-drivers?category_id=370732>`__.
