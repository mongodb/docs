Manage Indexes in Data Explorer
===============================

.. meta::
   :description: Manage indexes on your collections using the Data Explorer in Cloud Manager, including creating, viewing, and dropping indexes.

You can use the :guilabel:`Data Explorer` to manage indexes on your
collections.

Access Data
-----------

.. include:: /includes/fact-access-de.rst

Required Roles
--------------

To :ref:`create <de-create-an-index>` or
:ref:`drop indexes <de-drop-an-index>`, you must have access provided
by at least one of the following roles:

- :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner`

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin`

Considerations
--------------

By default, you can have up to three concurrent non-rolling index 
builds. To learn more, see :manual:`Maximum Concurrent Index Builds
</core/index-creation/#maximum-concurrent-index-builds>`.

If you select to build indexes in a rolling fashion, you must ensure 
the following:

- Request rolling index builds and non-rolling index builds 
  sequentially and not simultaneously. Wait for a currently executing 
  index build to complete before you request another index 
  build.

- If you need to request multiple rolling index builds, wait for the 
  currently executing rolling index build to complete before you 
  request another rolling index build.

To track rolling index builds, see the :ref:`Activity Feed 
<get-activity-feed>`.

For aborted rolling index builds, you must run :dbcommand:`listIndexes` 
on each node to verify that the cancelled index no longer exists. 
Otherwise, the cluster might remain in an inconsistent state.

.. _de-view-indexes:

View Indexes
------------

From the :guilabel:`Collections` tab, you can view index information
for a collection. To view index information for a collection:

.. include:: /includes/steps/data-explorer-indexes.rst

.. _data-explorer-create-an-index:

Create an Index
---------------

.. tip::

   When you create indexes, keep the ratio of reads to writes on the
   target collection in mind. Indexes come with a performance cost, but
   are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data sets.
   To learn more about indexing strategies, see
   :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>`.

To create an index for a collection through the :guilabel:`Data Explorer`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/data-explorer-create-index.rst

.. _de-drop-an-index:

Drop an Index
-------------

To drop an index from a collection through the :guilabel:`Data
Explorer`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/data-explorer-drop-index.rst

.. note::

   You cannot delete the ``_id`` index.
