28 June 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrades to Java 21 to enable SIMD instructions. SIMD increases the
  amount of parallelism the CPU can do during vector comparisons. In our
  testing, we observed a 2x decrease in query latency due to improved
  vector similarity comparison speed. You will see similar improvements
  in the indexing speed.
