         Iterate the results and print them to the console. Operations like
         this are **asychronous** in the MongoDB Node.js
         driver by default, meaning the Node.js runtime doesn't block other
         operations while waiting for them to finish execution.

         In order to simplify the operation, you specify the ``await``
         keyword, which **will** cause the runtime to wait for the operation.
         This is often easier than specifying a callback, or chaining
         a promise.

         For more information, see the `Promise and Callbacks guide <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/promises/>`__.

         In the code snippet above you may have noticed the code that
         iterates the results and prints them to the command line:

         .. code-block:: python

            async for doc in cursor:
                print(doc)
