Build Charts

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Charts provide visual representations of the data in your
:doc:`data source <data-sources>`. A chart maps to a *single*
data source, and can display correlations between several fields in the
data. Charts reside inside :doc:`dashboards </dashboards>`. You must
add a :doc:`data source </data-sources>` and create a :doc:`dashboard
</dashboards>` before you can begin building charts.

For a complete list of available chart types and how to build specific
charts, refer to the :ref:`Chart Types <chart-type-reference>` page.
