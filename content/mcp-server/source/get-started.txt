In this guide, you learn how to get started with the MongoDB MCP Server
by configuring and using it in your AI client.

.. _mcp-get-started-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the MongoDB MCP server, you must have the following:
  
- An Atlas cluster or a self-hosted MongoDB deployment.

  To learn more, see :atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>`
  or :ref:`tutorials-installation`.

- Any `supported MCP client. <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients>`__

- A version of `Node.js <https://www.nodejs.org/>`__:
  
  - At least version 20.19.0.
  - If you must use version 22, install version 22.12.0 or later.
  - Otherwise any version 23 or later.

  .. note::
   
     Alternatively, you can run the server in Docker container, 
     which does not require installing Node.js. To learn more,
     see :github:`Using Docker <mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server#option-5-using-docker>`.

Configure the MCP Server
------------------------

Complete the following steps to configure the MongoDB MCP Server.

Select your MCP client and MongoDB deployment type from the drop-down menus
to see the corresponding configuration steps. If your preferred client isn't listed, 
use these steps as guidelines and refer to the documentation for your 
client for specific steps.

Use the MCP Server
------------------

After you configure the MongoDB MCP Server, use it to 
interact with your MongoDB data and deployments from your AI client.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Check that the server is running.

      In your AI client, check that the MongoDB MCP server is 
      running by verifying that your list of MCP tools includes
      the MongoDB MCP tools.

   .. step:: Test the MCP server tools.

      Run prompts in your AI client to test the MongoDB MCP server tools.
      Your exact responses will vary depending on the data in your MongoDB
      deployment, and the AI client and model that you're using. 
      The following sample prompts assume that the MCP server has both read and 
      write access to your MongoDB deployment.

      a. First, create a new database and collection to work 
         with by running the following prompt:

         .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/create-collection.rst

      #. Now that you have a MongoDB collection with some sample data, 
         run prompts to interact with it using the MCP tools:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Explore and query
            :tabid: data-exploration

            Run the following prompts in your AI client 
            to explore and query your data in natural language:

            .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/explore-and-query.rst

            .. collapsible:: 
               :heading: Learn by Watching 
               :sub_heading: Watch a video that demonstrates data exploration and querying through the MongoDB MCP Server.

         .. tab:: Manage your database
            :tabid: database-management

            If you have an Atlas cluster and enabled the Atlas-specific MCP tools,
            run the following prompts in your AI client to perform some administrative tasks:

            .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/database-management.rst

            .. collapsible:: 
               :heading: Learn by Watching

         .. tab:: Generate code
            :tabid: code-generation

            Run the following prompt to generate code related to your MongoDB data.
            Providing context, such as schemas and data structures, enables more accurate code generation, 
            reducing hallucinations and enhancing agent capabilities.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Ensure that your configuration file is correct and that 
you're using a valid connection string. To troubleshoot other 
issues, see `MCP debugging <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging>`__
and the documentation for your AI client.
