To make your multi-cluster |onprem| and the {+appdb+} deployment
resilient to entire data center or zone failures, deploy the |application|
and the {+appdb+} on multiple |k8s| clusters.

To learn more about the architecture, networking, limitations, and peformance
of multi-|k8s| cluster deployments for |onprem| resources, see:

.. _om-multi-procedure-overview:

Overview
--------

When you deploy the |application| and the {+appdb+} using the
procedure in this section, you:

1. Use |gke| and |istio| service mesh as tools that help demonstrate the
   multi-|k8s| cluster deployment.

2. Install the |k8s-op-short| on one of the member |k8s| clusters known
   as the operator cluster. The operator cluster acts as a Hub in the
   "Hub and Spoke" pattern used by the |k8s-op-short| to manage deployments
   on multiple |k8s| clusters.

3. Deploy the operator cluster in the ``$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE`` and configure
   this cluster to watch ``$NAMESPACE`` and manage all member |k8s| clusters.

4. Deploy the {+appdb+} and the |application| on a single member
   |k8s| cluster to demonstrate similarity of a multi-cluster deployment
   to a single cluster deployment. A single cluster deployment with
   :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
   set to ``MultiCluster`` prepares the deployment for adding more |k8s| clusters
   to it.

5. Deploy an additional {+appdb+} replica set on the second member
   |k8s| cluster to improve {+appdb+}\'s resiliency. You also
   deploy an additional |application| instance in the second member
   |k8s| cluster.

6. Create valid certificates for |tls| encryption, and establish
   |tls|-encrypted connections to and from the |application| and between
   the {+appdb+}\'s replica set members.  When running over |https|,
   |onprem| runs on port ``8443`` by default.

7. Enable backup using |s3|-compatible storage and deploy the Backup Daemon
   on the third member |k8s| cluster. To simplify setting up |s3|-compatible
   storage buckets, you deploy the |minio|. You enable the Backup Daemon only
   on one member cluster in your deployment. However, you can configure
   other member clusters to host the Backup Daemon resources as well.
   Only |s3| backups are supported in multi-cluster |onprem| deployments.

Prerequisites
--------------

- :ref:`install-tools-om-mc`
- :ref:`gcloud-cli-auth`
- :ref:`install-kubectl-mongodb-plugin-om-mc`
- :ref:`clone-k8sop-repo-om-mc`
- :ref:`set-env-vars-om-mc`

.. _install-tools-om-mc:

Install Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can begin the deployment, install the following required tools:

- |helm-install|. Installing |helm| is required for the installation of the |k8s-op-short|.
- |kubectl-install|.
- Prepare the |gcp| project so that you can use it to create |gke| clusters.
  In the following  procedure, you create three new GKE clusters, with a
  total of seven ``e2-standard-4`` low-cost |spot-vms|.
- |gcloud-cli-install|.

.. _gcloud-cli-auth:

Authorize into gcloud CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|gcloud-cli-install| and authorize into it:

.. code-block:: sh

   gcloud auth login

.. _install-kubectl-mongodb-plugin-om-mc:

Install the |kubectl-mongodb|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`kubectl mongodb plugin <kubectl-plugin-ref>` automates the
configuration of the |k8s| clusters. This allows the |k8s-op-short| to
deploy resources, necessary roles, and services for accounts for the
|application|, {+appdb+}, and MongoDB resources on these clusters.

To install the |kubectl-mongodb|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-kubectl-mongodb-plugin.rst

.. _clone-k8sop-repo-om-mc:

Clone the |k8s-op-full| Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the :github:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator repository </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>`, change into the ``mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes``
directory, and check out the current version.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes.git
   cd mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes
   git checkout {+dl-version+}
   cd architectures

.. important::

   Some steps in this guide work only if you run them from
   the ``public/samples/ops-manager-multi-cluster`` directory.

.. _set-env-vars-om-mc:

Set up Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All steps in this guide reference the environment variables defined in ``env_variables.sh``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/ops-manager-multi-cluster/env_variables.sh
  :language: shell
  :linenos:

Adjust the settings in the previous example for your needs as instructed
in the comments and source them into your shell as follows:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: true

   source env_variables.sh

.. important::

   Each time after you update ``env_variables.sh``, run ``source env_variables.sh`` 
   to ensure that the scripts in this section use updated variables.

.. _deploy-om-mc-procedure:

Procedure
---------

This procedure applies to deploying an |onprem| instance on multiple
|k8s| clusters.
