An **external dependency** is a library that includes code that you
can't or don't want to implement yourself. For example, you might use an
official library for an external service or a custom implementation of
a data structure or algorithm.

|service| automatically transpiles dependencies and also
supports most built-in Node.js modules.

.. note:: Create Your Own Modules

   Though most npm modules are written by third parties, you can also
   create and publish your own npm modules to house logic specific to
   your application. You can make your modules available to the Node.js
   community or reserve them for private use. For more information,
   check out npm's guide on `Contributing packages to the registry
   <https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry>`_.

.. _atlas-add-external-dependencies:

Add an External Package
-----------------------

To import and use an external dependency, you first need to add the
dependency to your application. You can either :ref:`add packages by
name <atlas-dependencies-add-by-name>` or :ref:`upload a directory of
dependencies <atlas-dependencies-upload-zip>`.

.. important:: Override Existing Dependencies

   You can only use one method at a time to specify the external
   packages your app can use. The most recent method that you used to
   specify dependencies is the source of truth and overrides previous
   specifications.

   For example, a package added by name through the UI overrides any
   copies of the same package that you've added previously, including
   those in an :ref:`uploaded dependency directory
   <atlas-dependencies-upload-zip>`.

.. _atlas-dependencies-add-by-name:

Add Packages by Name and Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add packages from the :npm:`npm registry <>` to your app by
name. You can either add a specific version or use the latest version.

.. procedure::

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-triggers.rst

   .. step:: Navigate to Dependencies in the {+atlas-ui+}

      a. Select the Trigger that you want to add the dependency to.

      #. On the :guilabel:`Edit Trigger` page, go to the
         :guilabel:`Function` section and click :guilabel:`Add Dependency`.

   .. step:: Add Dependency Information

      a. In the :guilabel:`Add Dependency` modal window, include the following
         information:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 20 50

            * - Field
              - Description

            * - Define a Package Name
              - The name of the npm package.

            * - Package Version
              - Optional. Specific version of the dependency to use.
                By default, |service| functions use the latest version available.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Add` to add the package.

      You can track the status of adding the dependency in the progress tracker
      at the bottom of the window. The progress tracker provides a message letting
      you know if the package succeeded or failed. Failure messages contain additional
      information about why the package could not be added.

   .. step:: Check Operation Success

      When you successfully add the dependency, you'll see it on the
      list of dependencies in the :guilabel:`Dependencies` tab on the main
      :guilabel:`Triggers` page.

.. _atlas-dependencies-upload-zip:

Upload a Dependency Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can upload a zipped ``node_modules`` directory of packages to your
app. Zipped dependency directories may not exceed 15MB.

.. important:: Existing Dependencies Overwritten

   When you import an archive, any existing dependencies will be removed.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Locally Install External Dependencies

      To upload external dependencies, you first need a local
      ``node_modules`` folder containing at least one Node.js package. You
      can use the following code snippet to install a dependency locally
      you would like to upload:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm install <package name>

      If the ``node_modules`` folder does not already exist, this command
      automatically creates it.

      .. note:: Alternative Methods of Installation

         You can also configure a ``package.json`` and run the
         ``npm install`` command to install all packages (and their
         dependencies) listed in your ``package.json``.

         To learn more about npm and ``node_modules``, consult the
         `npm documentation <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install>`_.

   .. step:: Create a Dependency Archive

      Now that you've downloaded all of your npm modules, you need to
      package them up in an archive so you can upload them to |service|. |service|
      supports ``.tar``, ``.tar.gz``, ``.tgz``, and ``.zip`` archive formats.

      Create an archive containing the ``node_modules`` folder:

      .. code-block:: shell

         tar -czf node_modules.tar.gz node_modules/

      After you create an archive containing your dependencies, you can 
      upload your dependency archive using the {+atlas-ui+}.
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-triggers.rst
   
   .. step:: Upload the Dependency Archive

      a. Select the :guilabel:`Dependencies` tab.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Upload Folder`.

      #. In the modal, click :guilabel:`Upload Folder`, then select the
         ``node_modules.tar.gz`` archive you
         just created.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Add`. |service| uploads the
         archive file, which may take several minutes depending on the
         speed of your internet connection and the size of your dependency
         archive.

      #. |service| displays a banner
         indicating the success or failure of the operation.
         If successful, the :guilabel:`Dependencies` tab displays a list of the
         dependencies that you included in your dependency archive.

         - If drafts are enabled, you must also click
           :guilabel:`Review & Deploy` to apply these changes.
         - If drafts are disabled, the change will take effect within 5 to 60
           seconds, depending on the size of your dependency archive.

.. _atlas-import-external-dependencies:

Import a Package in a Function
------------------------------

You can import built-in modules and external packages that you've added
to your app and then use them in your functions. To import a package,
call ``require()`` with the package name from within the function body.

.. important:: Where Do I Import Modules?

   Node.js projects commonly place ``require()`` calls in the global
   scope of each file, but |service| does not support this
   pattern. You *must* place ``require()`` calls within a function scope.

Import a Full Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   exports = () => {
      const R = require("ramda");
      return R.map(x => x*2, [1,2,3]);
   }

Import a Module Subfolder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   exports = function(arg){
      const cloneDeep = require("lodash/cloneDeep");

      var original = { name: "Deep" };
      var copy = cloneDeep(original);
      copy.name = "John";

      console.log(`original: ${original.name}`);
      console.log(`copy: ${copy.name}`);
      return (original != copy);
   };
