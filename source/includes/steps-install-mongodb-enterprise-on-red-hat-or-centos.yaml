title: Install the MongoDB Enterprise packages and associated tools.
stepnum: 1
ref: install
pre: |
  When you install the packages, you choose which release to install. This
  step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB Enterprise, issue the
      following command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install mongodb-enterprise
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB Enterprise, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example that installs the `2.6.1``
      release of MongoDB:
    language: sh
    code: |
      yum install mongodb-enterprise-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-server-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-shell-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-mongos-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-tools-2.6.1
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB Enterprise. However
      ``yum`` will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes
      available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a
      package, add the following ``exclude`` directive to your
      ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-enterprise,mongodb-enterprise-server,mongodb-enterprise-shell,mongodb-enterprise-mongos,mongodb-enterprise-tools

  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use different naming conventions.
  See the :v2.4:`2.4 version of documentation for more information
