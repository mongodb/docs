{+atlas-sp+} provides monitoring and alerts so that users can leverage
performance and status insights to refine their workflows.

Stream Processor Monitoring Methods
-----------------------------------

{+atlas-sp+} provides the following methods for on-demand reporting
about your stream processors:

- :method:`sp.processor.sample()`
- :method:`sp.processor.stats()`

The ``sp.processor.sample()`` method allows you to see a small sample of
the documents output by a currently running stream processor of your
choosing. Users can compare the sampled results against their expected
results to diagnose any errors in their aggregation pipeline design.

The ``sp.processor.stats()`` method returns a variety of runtime
statistics about a stream processor of your choosing, including, but
not limited to:

- Number of messages ingested
- Number of messages successfully processed
- Number of messages sent to your :ref:`Dead Letter Queue <atlas-sp-dlq>`
- In-memory size of your pipeline state
- Pipeline definition

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-proc-alerts:

Stream Processor Alerts
-----------------------

{+atlas-sp+} triggers alerts when processors change state, or a
processor meets various ingestion or output thresholds. For a
list of available {+atlas-sp+} alerts, see :ref:`atlas-sp-alerts`. To
learn more about alert configuration, see :ref:`configure-alerts`.

You can target {+atlas-sp+} alerts in the following ways:

- All stream processors within a project
- All stream processors within a {+spi+} matching the configured
  predicate
- All stream processors the names of which match the configured
  predicate

For targets other than all stream processors, you can configure
multiple targets for the same alert.
