msgid "The positional :projection:`$` operator limits the contents of an ``<array>`` from the query results to contain only the **first** element matching the query document. To specify an array element to update, see the :doc:`positional $ operator for updates </reference/operator/update/positional>`."

#: ../source/includes/fact-positional-projection-vs-elemmatch.rst:7
msgid "The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator takes an explicit condition argument.  This allows you to project based on a condition not in the query, or if you need to project based on multiple fields in the array's embedded documents. See :ref:`array-field-limitation` for an example."

msgid "If an array field contains multiple documents with the same field name and the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method includes a :method:`~cursor.sort()` on that repeating field, the returned documents may not reflect the sort order because the sort was applied to the elements of the array before the :projection:`$` projection operator."
