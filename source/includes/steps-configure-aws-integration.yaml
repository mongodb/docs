     * - :guilabel:`User Account`

title: "Add an SSH public key to use when provisioning a new server."
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: public-key
content: |
  To connect to a server through SSH, you must have at least one public
  key that you can select when provisioning the server.

  To add a key, select :guilabel:`Add SSH Public Key`. Input the
  :guilabel:`Key Name`, and paste the contents of the public key into
  the :guilabel:`Public Key` field.
  
  The location of your SSH key depends on your operating system.
  On Unix systems, the key is typically in the ``~/.ssh/`` directory.
  Generating SSH keys is beyond the scope of this documentation.

  When you provision a new machine, you will specify the name of
  the key to use to log in to the machine. You can add multiple
  SSH keys to |mms| but can only use **one** key for a given server.
