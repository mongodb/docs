   a.  In the :guilabel:`Choose a connection method` step, select
       :guilabel:`Connect with the Mongo Shell`.

   #. Click your operating system at the top of the dialog.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Download` to download the shell or click :guilabel:`Copy`
      to copy the download URL.

      * For Linux and macOS, run the following command in a
        terminal to download the Mongo shell from the command line:

        .. code-block:: shell

           curl -Of <URL>

      * For Windows, run the following command in PowerShell to download
        the installer:

        .. code-block:: shell

           curl -Uri <URL> -Outfile <path/to/<filename>.zip

   #. Extract the Mongo shell.

      * For Linux and macOS, run the following command in a
        terminal to extract the shell:

        .. code-block:: shell

           tar -xf ./<filename>.tgz

      * For Windows, double-click the ``.msi`` file in File Explorer and proceed
        through the installation wizard.

   #. Add the ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

      * For Linux and macOS, run the following command in a terminal:

        .. code-block:: none

           export PATH=/<extraction-directory>/bin:$PATH

        .. note::

           This command applies only to the current shell session. Edit
           the ``PATH`` environment variable in either ``~/.profile`` or
           ``~/.bash_profile`` to update the variable across shell sessions
           and reboots.

      * For Windows, use the following procedure:

        1. Click :guilabel:`Start` and select :guilabel:`Control Panel`.

        #. Click :guilabel:`System and Security`, then :guilabel:`System`,
           then :guilabel:`Advanced System Settings`.

        #. Click :guilabel:`Environment Variables`.

        #. Select :guilabel:`Path` and click :guilabel:`Edit`.

        #. Add the ``bin`` directory where the installer placed your
           MongoDB executables and click :guilabel:`OK`.

level: 4
ref: connect-details

  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays the full command for connecting
  the |service| cluster with the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell.

  A. Select the connection string for your :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell
     version:

     - For version 3.6 or later, click :guilabel:`I am using shell 3.6 or later`.

     - For version 3.4 or earlier, click
       :guilabel:`I am using shell 3.4 or earlier`.

     To check which version of the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell
     is installed on your system, run the following command from a
     terminal:

     .. code-block:: bash

        mongo --version

     If your version is older than 3.4, MongoDB recommends that you upgrade
     to the newest version.

  #. Copy and paste the ``mongo`` command and connection string into a
     terminal and run it.

     - For version 3.6 or later, the shell will prompt you for the
       ``--password`` parameter.

     - For version 3.4 or earlier, the connection string includes the
       ``--password`` parameter. Edit the placeholder value for the parameter.

     The connection string includes the user name of a MongoDB user set
     up for the project for authentication purposes. To connect with a
     different MongoDB user, update the ``--username`` parameter with
     the username of a different MongoDB user.
