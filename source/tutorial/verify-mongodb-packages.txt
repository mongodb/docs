Verify the Integrity of the |k8s-op-full| Packages

Starting in |k8s-op-full| 1.26.0, the MongoDB release team
digitally signs |k8s-op-full| packages to certify that they are valid and
unaltered MongoDB releases. Before you install |k8s-op-full|, validate the
package using the provided PGP signature or SHA-256 checksum.

PGP signatures provide the strongest guarantees by checking both the
authenticity and integrity of a file to prevent tampering.

Verify Linux/macOS Packages
---------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command to obtain our signing key:

.. code-block::

   wget https://cosign.mongodb.com/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem 

Use Cosign
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB signs each release branch with a signature file. You can verify
the authenticity of the binary with our public key file.

.. include:: /includes/steps-install-verify-files-pgp.rst

Use Images
~~~~~~~~~~

You can also verify the signature of any published Docker images. The
following example shows how to verify the signature of the |k8s-op-full| 1.26.0
image:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true 

   .. input:: 
            
      cosign verify --key mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-operator-ubi:1.26.0 --insecure-ignore-tlog
         
   .. output::

      WARNING: Skipping tlog verification is an insecure practice that lacks of transparency and auditability verification for the signature.

      Verification for quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-operator-ubi:1.26.0 --
      The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
      - The cosign claims were validated
      - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
