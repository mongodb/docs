  .. admonition:: Recommend Using |tls-ssl| with |ldap|
     :class: warning

     By default, |ldap| traffic is sent as plain text. This means that
     credentials (username and password) are exposed to basic network
     threats like sniffers and replay. Use |ldaps| (|ldap| over 
     |tls-ssl|) to encrypt authentication. Many modern directory 
     services, such as Active Directory, require encrypted  
     connections.

  .. admonition:: Remember
     :class: note
     
     |mms| limits Agents to using one :term:`mechanism <authentication
     mechanism>` per deployment.
  
  a. Select {{mechanism}} from the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` 
     drop-down menu.
  
  b. For each Agent, provide:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting
          - Value

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> LDAP Username`
          - Enter the |ldap| username.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> LDAP Password`
          - Enter the password for Agent's |ldap| Username.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> LDAP Group DN` 
          - Enter the Distinguished Name for the Agent's |ldap| Group.

            .. note:: 

               Provide the Agent's |ldap| Group 
               :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` only if you use |ldap| 
               Authorization. Each Agent should have and use its own 
               |ldap| Group :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)`.

  c. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
post: |
  Only configure the Agents you installed.

  .. example::
     If you did not install the {+bagent+}, do not configure the
     {+bagent+}.
