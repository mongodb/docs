.. _atlas-ui-create-a-collection:

Create a Collection
-------------------

.. tip::

   To create the first collection in a new database, see
   :ref:`atlas-ui-create-a-db`.

.. important::

   You cannot create new collections on the ``config`` and
   ``system`` databases. |service| will deprecate writing to existing
   collections on these databases in the near future.

To create a collection in an existing database through the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-create-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-view-collections:

View Collections
----------------

From the :guilabel:`Collections` tab, you can view the databases and
collections in the deployment. |service| shows the databases in the
left pane of the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. figure:: /images/atlas-ui-dbs-collections.png
    :figwidth: 700px
    :alt: Screenshot of the Collections tab in the Atlas UI.

To view the collections in a particular database, click on the
name of the database.

.. note::

   |service| bases the document count that appears on the 
   :guilabel:`Collections` tab on cached metadata using 
   :manual:`collStats </reference/command/collStats/>`. This count 
   might differ from the actual document count in the collection. For 
   example, an :manual:`unexpected shutdown 
   </reference/command/collStats/#behavior>` can throw off the count. 
   Use the :manual:`db.collection.countDocuments() 
   </reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/>` method for the 
   most accurate document count.

.. _atlas-ui-visualize-a-collection:

Visualize Collection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the :guilabel:`Collections` tab, you can launch |charts| 
to visualize data in your databases and collections.

.. include:: includes/fact-charts-activation.rst

.. _atlas-ui-drop-a-collection:

Drop a Collection
-----------------

To drop a collection, including its documents and indexes, through the
{+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-drop-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection
------------------

If you have large data sets and perform high throughput operations, you 
can :manual:`shard </sharding>` a collection to distribute data across 
the shards. 

.. note:: 

   Before you start, you must have the following: 

   - A :ref:`sharded <create-cluster-sharding>` |service| cluster 
   - {+mongosh+} on your local machine 

To shard a collection through the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/shard-collection.rst
