======================
Query MongoDB for Data
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.find()` method in the
:program:`mongo` shell to query a collection. In MongoDB, queries are
scoped to a single collection. Consider the following diagram of the
query process:

.. include:: /includes/crud-query-stages.rst

Considerations
--------------

Since the ``_id`` values are generated, when querying, your values
for the ``_id`` field will differ from those displayed on this page.

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section query the ``orders`` collection in the
``test`` database.

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :manual:`Cursor methods </reference/method/js-cursor>` that
allow you to modify a cursor to limit the size of the result set or to
return sorted results. Also consider the reference on the
:manual:`Query and Projection Operators </reference/operator/query>`
that MongoDB provides.
