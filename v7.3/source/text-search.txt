MongoDB provides different text search capabilities depending on whether
your data is hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` or a self-managed
deployment.

To learn about search on self-hosted deployments, see :ref:`text-search-on-prem`.

MongoDB Atlas Search
--------------------

To perform text search on data hosted on MongoDB Atlas, use
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Search </atlas-search>`. Atlas Search supports
fine-grained text indexing and a rich query language for fast, relevant
search results.
