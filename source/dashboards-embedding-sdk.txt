You can embed a dashboard into a web application with the 
:ref:`Embedding SDK <embedding-charts-sdk>`, which allows you to make 
more flexible adjustments to dashboard settings and rendering.

You can use the embedding SDK to do the following tasks:

- Change the size and style of the dashboard
- Refresh on demand
- Save dashboards as an image

To embed a dashboard with the SDK, you need to:

1. Enable embedding for the dashboard.
#. Have the dashboard ID and base URL strings.
