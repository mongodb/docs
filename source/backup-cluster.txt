|service| continuously backs up your data, ensuring your backups are
typically just a few seconds behind the operational system.

|service| supports two backup methods:

:doc:`/backup/continuous-backups`
  |service| uses incremental snapshots to continuously back up your 
  data. Continuous backup snapshots are typically just a few seconds 
  behind the operational system.

  |service| ensures point-in-time backup of replica sets and consistent,
  cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters. 

  For each |service| project with continuous snapshots enabled, 
  |service| stores the continuous backup snapshots in *one* backup data 
  center location dictated by the *first* backup-enabled cluster created 
  in that project. 

  Continuous snapshots support restoring from the full snapshot
  or from a point-in-time between snapshots. You can also
  :doc:`query a continuous snapshot </query-backup>`.

:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`
  .. important::

     |service| only supports cloud provider snapshots for 
     :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>` or 
     :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>` backed replica sets.  

     A project using the |service| Cloud Provider Snapshots
     *cannot* create backups of sharded clusters *or* any cluster
     hosted on :ref:`Google Cloud Provider (GCP) <google-gcp>`.


  |service| uses the native snapshot capabilities of your cloud
  provider to support full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot
  storage.

  For each |service| cluster with cloud provider snapshots enabled,
  |service| stores the snapshots in the same region as the snapshot
  source replica set member.
