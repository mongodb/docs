The choice of cloud provider and region affects network latency for clients
accessing your {+database-deployment+} and the
:doc:`cost of running the {+database-deployment+} </billing>`. For {+clusters+},
this choice also affects the configuration options for the available {+cluster+} tiers. The region
refers to the physical location of your MongoDB {+database-deployment+}.

Cloud Providers and Regions for {+Serverless-Instances+}
--------------------------------------------------------

|service| supports deploying {+serverless-instances+} to a subset of
:ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>` regions. For a list of regions
that support {+serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`.

Cloud Providers and Regions for {+Shared-Clusters+}
---------------------------------------------------

|service| supports deploying ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and
``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} on all cloud providers but only a
subset of each cloud provider's regions. For a list of regions that
support ``M0`` or ``M2/M5`` {+clusters+}, see:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

In the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` page:

- Regions marked as |star| are :guilabel:`Recommended` regions that 
  provide higher availability compared to other regions. 
- Regions marked as :icon-fa4:`money` under :guilabel:`Shared` tier  
  are not available for shared tier clusters and therefore appear 
  grayed-out. These regions are available for dedicated clusters only. 

For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`

   availability, see :doc:`/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution`.
