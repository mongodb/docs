"When reading from a replica set, it is possible to read data that is "
"stale (i.e. may not reflect all writes that have occurred prior to the "
"read operation) or not durable (i.e. the state of the data may reflect a "
"write that has not been acknowledged by a majority or the replica set "
"members and thus could be rolled back), depending on the read concern "
"used."
