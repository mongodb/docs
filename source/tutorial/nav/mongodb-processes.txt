:ref:`shut-down-deployment`
  Shut down individual |mongod| and |mongos| processes, :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. When you shut down a
  process, cluster, or replica set, |mms| continues to manage it.

:ref:`restart-processes`
  Restart a running sharded cluster, replica set, or standalone process
  directly from the |mms| console. You can also restart individual
  |mms|-managed MongoDB member processes of a deployment.

:ref:`trigger-resync`
  Start an :manual:`initial sync</core/replica-set-sync/#replica-set-initial-sync>`
  process on one or more MongoDB instances to resynchronize data stored
  on MongoDB nodes in clusters.

:ref:`suspend-automation`
  Suspend |mms| Automation to perform for manual maintenance. Automation
  ignores the process until you re-enable Automation's control.

:ref:`remove-process-from-monitoring`
  Removing a process from |mms| monitoring.
