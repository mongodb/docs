Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB .NET/C#
driver and Entity Framework provider.

.NET/C# Driver
--------------

You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in .NET or C#. See
the `.NET/C# driver documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/>`__
to learn how to install and begin using the driver.

Entity Framework Provider
-------------------------

You can add the MongoDB Entity Framework provider to your .NET application as an
object-relational mapper (ORM) to work with data in MongoDB. See the
`Entity Framework provider documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/entity-framework/current/>`__
to learn how to begin using the provider.
