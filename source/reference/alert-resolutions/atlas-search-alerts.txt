|fts| triggers :ref:`Atlas Search alerts 
<alert-conditions-atlas-search>` when the amount of CPU and memory used 
by |fts| processes reaches a specified threshold. If the search 
process (``mongot``) runs out of memory, indexing and 
queries fail. You can configure |fts| alert conditions in the project 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` modal. You can also view |fts| 
metrics with :ref:`cluster monitoring <review-atlas-search-metrics>`.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Index Replication Lag
<Atlas Search: Index Replication Lag is>` occurs if the approximate 
number of milliseconds that |fts| is behind in replicating changes from 
the :term:`oplog` of |mongod| is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Index Size on Disk
<Atlas Search: Index Size on Disk is>` occurs if the total size of all 
|fts| indexes on disk in bytes is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Number of Error Queries
<Atlas Search: Number of Error Queries is>` occurs if the number of 
queries for which |fts| is unable to return a response is above or 
below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Number of Index Fields
<Atlas Search: Number of Index Fields is>` occurs if the total number 
of unique fields present in the |fts| index is above or below the 
threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Number of Successful Queries
<Atlas Search: Number of Successful Queries is>` occurs if the number 
of queries for which |fts| successfully returned a response is above or 
below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search: Total Number of Queries
<Atlas Search: Total Number of Queries is>` occurs if the number of 
queries submitted to |fts| is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search Opcounter: Delete
<Atlas Search Opcounter: Delete is>` occurs if the total number of 
documents or fields (specified in the index definition) removed per 
second is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search Opcounter: Getmore
<Atlas Search Opcounter: Getmore is>` occurs if the total number of 
``getmore`` commands run on all |fts| queries per second is above or 
below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search Opcounter: Insert
<Atlas Search Opcounter: Insert is>` occurs if the total number of 
documents or fields (specified in the index definition) that |fts| 
indexes per second is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Atlas Search Opcounter: Update
<Atlas Search Opcounter: Update is>` occurs if the total number of 
documents or fields (specified in the index definition) that |fts| 
updates per second is above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Insufficient disk space to support rebuilding search indexes` 
occurs if your {+database-deployment+} runs out of enough free disk 
space to support your |fts| indexes.

.. note::

   This alert might appear when |service| automatically upgrades your 
   search indexes to enable new features. Your {+database-deployment+} 
   must have sufficient disk space for both the previous and new 
   version of the index. After the index upgrade completes, |service| deletes the old version of the index, which frees up disk space.

:alert:`Search Memory: Resident <Search Memory: Resident is>` occurs 
if the total bytes of resident memory occupied by the |fts| process is 
above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Search Memory: Shared <Search Memory: Shared is>` occurs if
the total bytes of shared memory occupied by the |fts| process is above 
or below the threshold.

:alert:`Search Memory: Virtual <Search Memory: Virtual is>` occurs if 
the total bytes of virtual memory occupied by the |fts| process is 
above or below the threshold.

:alert:`Search Process: CPU (Kernel) % 
<Search Process: CPU (Kernel) % is>` occurs if the percentage of time 
the CPU spent servicing operating system calls for the |fts| process is 
above the threshold.

:alert:`Search Process: CPU (User) % <Search Process: CPU (User) % is>` 
occurs if the percentage of time the CPU spent servicing the |fts| 
process is above the threshold.

:alert:`Search Process: Disk space used 
<Search Process: Disk space used is>` occurs if the total bytes of disk 
space used by the |fts| process is above the threshold.

:alert:`Search Process: Ran out of memory 
<Search Process: Ran out of memory>` occurs if the search process 
(``mongot``) runs out of memory. If the search process runs out of 
memory, indexing and queries fail.

.. note::

   The :alert:`Search Process: Ran out of memory 
   <Search Process: Ran out of memory>` alert runs 
   automatically by default. You can configure the :ref:`alert setting 
   <configure-alerts>` to disable this notification.

Common Triggers
---------------

|fts| alerts often occur when you try to build a large or 
complex search index. These indexes remain in the 
:guilabel:`Initial Sync` phase until you resolve the memory issue.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

If the search process (``mongot``) runs out of memory or disk space, 
you can :ref:`upgrade your cluster <scale-cluster-instance>` to fix the 
immediate problem. You can select a cluster tier with more memory, 
storage, and |iops|.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

To prevent |fts| alerts in the future, carefully review the 
:ref:`perf-ref` for |fts|. Work to optimize your indexes.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

View the available :ref:`Atlas Search charts 
<review-atlas-search-metrics>` to monitor |fts| metrics.

Monitor |fts| metrics to evaluate and optimize your 
|fts| indexes.
