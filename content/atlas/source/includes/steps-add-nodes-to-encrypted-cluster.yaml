title: "Add IP addresses from the new cluster nodes or shards."
optional: true

  Depending on your Key Management configuration, you may have to add |service| cluster node IP 
  addresses to your cloud provider KMS access list, so that the cluster can communicate with your KMS. 
  To enable communication between the cluster and KMS:

  a. Send a GET request to the ``ipAddresses`` endpoint. The 
     :oas-atlas-tag:`returnAllIpAddresses API endpoint
     </Projects/operation/returnAllIpAddresses>` returns a list of IP
     addresses from the new cluster nodes or shards, similar to the
     following:

     .. code-block:: json

        {
          "groupId": "xxx", // ObjectId
          "services": {
            "clusters": [
              {
                "clusterName": "Cluster0",
                "inbound": [
                  "3.92.113.229",
                  "3.208.110.31",
                  "107.22.44.69"
                  ], // List<String>
                "outbound": [
                  "3.92.113.229",
                  "3.208.110.31",
                  "107.22.44.69"
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
  
  b. Add the returned IP addresses to your cloud provider's IP access list. You must modify 
     your IP access list before the provisioning plan rolls back. The cluster attempts 
     provisioning for up to three days before the provisioning plan rolls back from IP access restrictions.
