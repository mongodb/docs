.. versionadded:: 4.2

The official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers provide a client-side field level
encryption framework. Applications can encrypt fields in documents *prior* to
transmitting data over the wire to the server. Only applications with access to
the correct encryption keys can decrypt and read the protected data. Deleting an
encryption key renders all data encrypted using that key as permanently
unreadable.

For example, a MongoDB cluster enforcing 
:ref:`authentication <authentication>` uses 
:ref:`TLS encryption <transport-encryption>` to protect data in transit.
The cluster also uses the 
:ref:`MongoDB encrypted storage engine <encrypted-storage-engine>` to
secure data on disk. Consider the following scenarios:

- An employee has administrative access to the cluster and its host 
  machines. The employee's access level allows them to view 
  high-sensitivity data in a decrypted state as part of their normal 
  duties.

- A third-party provider hosts the MongoDB cluster. The provider
  has a host-machine or database-level security breach where 
  unauthorized parties access the data in a decrypted state.

- A third-party data analytics firm has access to data that includes
  private, personal, or confidential information. The third-party
  firm loads the decrypted data into an unsecured data storage volume 
  which unauthorized parties can access.

With each scenario, a user with privileged access to either the MongoDB cluster
or a host machine can bypass encryption and read data that is private,
privileged, or confidential. Using client-side field level encryption to protect
data *prior* to being written to the server mitigates the risk of exposing that
data in the event network or disk encryption is bypassed.

Consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : "949-555-1212",
     "ssn" : "123-45-6789"
   }

With client-side field level encryption, the application can 
specifically encrypt sensitive information like the ``ssn``
and ``phone``. Encrypted fields are stored as
:bsontype:`binary data <data_binary>` with 
`subtype 6 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/subtype6.rst>`_:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : BinData(6,"U2FsdGVkX1+CGIDGUnGgtS46+c7R5u17SwPDEmzyCbA="),
     "ssn" : BinData(6,"AaloEw285E3AnfjP+r8ph2YCvMI1+rWzpZK97tV6iz0jx")
   }

MongoDB supports two methods of client-side field level encryption using the
official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers:

Explicit (manual) encryption of fields
  MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers support explicitly encrypting
  or decrypting fields with a specific data key and encryption
  algorithm.

  Applications must modify any code associated with constructing read and write
  operations to include encryption/decryption logic via the driver encryption
  library. Applications are responsible for selecting the appropriate data
  key for encryption/decryption on a per-operation basis.

  The 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the following methods for 
  performing explicit encryption and decryption:

  - :method:`getClientEncryption()`
  - :method:`ClientEncryption.encrypt()`
  - :method:`ClientEncryption.decrypt()`

Automatic encryption of fields
  MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise extends 4.2-compatible driver encryption support to 
  include :ref:`automatic field level encryption 
  <field-level-encryption-automatic>` 
  using :ref:`JSON schema syntax <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`.
  
  Applications must modify only the driver client object configuration code to
  include automatic encryption settings. All read/write operations to a cluster
  via the encryption-configured client are automatically encrypted and decrypted
  using the predefined automatic encryption rules. Code associated with
  constructing read and write operations does not require additional
  modification.

MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers and the 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell 
automatically decrypt :bsontype:`Binary` subtype 6 ``BinData`` objects
created using client-side field level encryption. For more information on 
automatic decryption, see :ref:`field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption`.

.. important::

   MongoDB client-side field level encryption only supports encrypting
   single fields in a document. To encrypt an entire document, you must
   encrypt each individual field in the document. 

.. _field-level-encryption-automatic:

Automatic Field Level Encryption
--------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

Official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers support automatic client-side field
level encryption. Applications configured for automatic client-side field level
encryption identify specific fields in documents for encryption.
4.2 drivers use the automatic encryption rules specified to the client for
identifying encrypted fields and their associated encryption keys.

For write operations, 4.2 drivers encrypt field values *prior* to writing to the
MongoDB database. For read operations, 4.2 drivers encrypt field values in the
query *prior* to issuing the read operation. 4.2 drivers can 
:ref:`automatically decrypt <field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption>` 
encrypted values returned in a document *only if* the client has access to the 
keys used to protect those values.

Applications must specify the following components when
instantiating the client to enable automatic client-side field level encryption:

- A MongoDB cluster storing the key vault of data keys.

- The key vault namespace (``<database>.<collection>``) used to
  store encrypted data keys. 

- A supported :ref:`Key Management Service (KMS) <field-level-encryption-kms>` 
  provider used to manage Customer Master Keys (CMK). MongoDB encrypts all data
  keys using the specified CMK *prior* to storing them in the key vault, leaving
  only metadata unencrypted.
  
  Drivers need access to the KMS to encrypt and decrypt protected
  fields *or* to create new data keys.

- Per-field encryption rules using 
  :ref:`JSON schema syntax <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`. 

The 4.2-compatible drivers use the Enterprise-only
:ref:`field-level-encryption-mongocryptd` process to parse the JSON
schema and apply the encryption rules when reading or writing documents.
Automatic encryption *requires* the ``mongocryptd`` process.

Each official MongoDB 4.2-compatible driver introduces new functionality
for supporting automatic encryption and data key management. Defer to
your preferred driver's documentation for language-specific instructions
on implementing automatic field level encryption.

.. _field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption:

Automatic Field Decryption
--------------------------

MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers and the 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
automatically decrypt :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` subtype 6 fields created 
using client-side field level encryption.

The :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob metadata
includes the data key ``_id`` and encryption algorithm used to encrypt the
binary data. The 4.2-compatible drivers and 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
automatically decrypt ``BinData`` type 6 fields. The automatic decryption
process works as follows:

1. Retrieve the data key used to encrypt the value from the
   :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob metadata.

#. Check the key vault configured in the current database connection for the 
   specified data key. MongoDB encrypts data keys with a 
   Customer Master Key prior to storing them in the key vault. 
   
#. Retrieve the unique identifier of the CMK from the data key metadata.

#. Use the :ref:`Key Management Service <field-level-encryption-kms>` (KMS).
   configured in the current database connection to decrypt the data
   key using the CMK.

#. Decrypt the :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` value using the decrypted data key.

Applications with access to the MongoDB server that do not *also* have access to
the required keys cannot decrypt the ``BinData``.

For more information on configuring the database connection for 
client-side field level encryption, see the 
:method:`Mongo()` constructor *or* defer to the documentation for 
your preferred driver's client construction method.

.. _field-level-encryption-algorithms:

Encryption Algorithms
---------------------

MongoDB client-side field level encryption uses the encrypt-then-MAC approach
combined with either a deterministic or random initialization vector to encrypt
field values. MongoDB *only* supports the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm with
HMAC-SHA-512 MAC. 

.. _field-level-encryption-deterministic:

Deterministic Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deterministic encryption algorithm ensures a given input value *always*
encrypts to the same output value each time the algorithm is executed. While
deterministic encryption provides greater support for read operations, encrypted
data with low cardinality is susceptible to frequency analysis recovery.

For sensitive fields that are *not* used in read operations, applications may
use :ref:`field-level-encryption-random` for improved protection from frequency
analysis recovery.

.. _field-level-encryption-random:

Random Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random encryption algorithm ensures that a given input value
*always* encrypts to a different output value each time the algorithm is
executed. While random encryption provides the strongest guarantees of
data confidentiality, it also prevents support for any read operations
which must operate on the encrypted field to evaluate the query.

Random encryption also supports encrypting entire objects or arrays. For
example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
    "personal_information" : {
      "ssn" : "123-45-6789",
      "credit_score" : 750,
      "credit_cards" : [ "1234-5678-9012-3456", "9876-5432-1098-7654"]
    },
    "phone_numbers" : [ "(212) 555-0153" ]
   }

Encrypting the ``personal_information`` and ``phone_numbers`` fields using the
random encryption algorithm encrypts the *entire* object. While this protects
all fields nested under those fields, it also prevents querying against those
nested fields. 

For sensitive fields that *are* used in read operations,
applications must use :ref:`field-level-encryption-deterministic` for improved
read support on encrypted fields.

Encryption Components
---------------------

MongoDB client-side field level encryption uses the following 
components:

- A third-party :ref:`Key Management Service (KMS) <field-level-encryption-kms>`
  for storing and retrieving a Customer Master Key (CMK).

- A :ref:`key vault <field-level-encryption-keyvault>` of data keys. 

- The ``libmongocrypt`` library that manages encryption, decryption,
  and communication between the KMS and ``mongocryptd``. Included with
  MongoDB 4.2 drivers.

- The :ref:`field-level-encryption-mongocryptd` daemon for supporting 
  automatic encryption. Included in MongoDB Enterprise *only*.

- *Optional* Server-side :ref:`schema-validation-json` 
  that specifies encryption validation rules.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the
driver and each encryption component:

.. _field-level-encryption-kms:

Supported Key Management Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client-side field level encryption requires a Key Management Service (KMS) for
accessing a Customer Master Key (CMK). MongoDB automatically encrypts data keys
using the specified CMK during 
:doc:`data key creation </reference/method/KeyVault.createKey>`. 

Deleting the CMK renders all data keys encrypted with that CMK as permanently
unreadable, which in turn renders all values encrypted with those data keys as
permanently unreadable.

Client-side field level encryption supports the following KMS providers:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services KMS <field-level-encryption-aws-kms>`
- :ref:`Locally Managed Keyfile <field-level-encryption-local-kms>`

.. _field-level-encryption-aws-kms:

Amazon Web Services KMS
```````````````````````

MongoDB client-side encryption supports using the 
`Amazon Web Services Key Management Service <https://aws.amazon.com/kms>`__
for encrypting and decrypting data keys. Specifically, MongoDB 
securely transmits the data key to AWS KMS for encrypting or decrypting using
the specified Customer Master Key (CMK). The CMK never leaves the 
AWS KMS. 

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports two methods for configuring 
access to an AWS KMS:

- Use the client-side field level encryption :ref:`command-line options 
  <mongo-client-side-field-level-encryption-options>`,

  *or*

- Use the :method:`Mongo()` constructor to create a database connection with 
  the required AWS :ref:`KMS configuration options 
  <ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions>`.

Configuring access to an AWS KMS requires at minimum an AWS access key and its
corresponding secret key. The IAM user associated to the access key *must*
have at least one policy with the following actions:

- ``kms:Decrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html>`__ 

- ``kms:Encrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`__ 

.. admonition:: Implement Seperation of Least Privilege for KMS Access
   :class: note

   Consider configuring IAM user roles such that MongoDB has only the 
   access to the actions and resources required to function. 

   For example, the following policy JSON scopes the required actions to a
   single CMK:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "kms:Decrypt",
                      "kms:Encrypt"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/12a345b6-cd7e-8f9g-0h1i-jk23l45mn6o7"
              }
          ]
      }

For complete documentation on data key management using AWS KMS, see 
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.

.. _field-level-encryption-local-kms:

Locally Managed Key
```````````````````

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports specifying a locally managed key as a 
KMS using the :method:`Mongo()` constructor. The local key *must* be a 
96-byte long string.

For complete documentation on data key management using the local keyfile,
see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.

.. _field-level-encryption-keyvault:

Key Vault
~~~~~~~~~

The key vault is a collection that stores data keys for use with
client-side field level encryption. Data keys are encrypted using a 
Customer Master Key (CMK) managed through a supported
:ref:`Key Management System (KMS) <field-level-encryption-kms>`.

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides helper methods for data key 
management:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 40

   * - Retrieving Data Keys
     -
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKey()`
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKeys()`
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKeyByAltName()`

   * - Creating or Modifying Data Keys
     -
      - :method:`KeyVault.createKey()`
      - :method:`KeyVault.addKeyAlternateName()`
      - :method:`KeyVault.removeKeyAlternateName()`

   * - Removing Data Keys
       
       .. important::
          
          Removing a data key renders all fields encrypted using that 
          data key as permanently unreadable.

     - 
      - :method:`KeyVault.deleteKey()`

Applications with :authrole:`read` access to the key vault collection can
retrieve data keys by querying the collection. However, only applications with
access to the CMK used to encrypt a data key can use that key for encryption or
decryption.

By default MongoDB stores the key vault collection on the connected cluster.
MongoDB also supports specifying a remote cluster as the key vault. Applications
must have access to both the remote key vault cluster and the connection 
cluster to perform client-side field level encryption operations.

Data keys have the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : UUID("<string>"),
     "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"<encrypted binary data string>"),
   	 "creationDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "updateDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "status" : <int>,
   	 "version" : NumberLong(0),
   	 "masterKey" : {
   	   "provider" : "<string>",
   	   "key" : "<string>",
   	   "region" : "<string>",
   	   "endpoint" : "<string>"
   	 },
   	 "keyAltNames" : [
       "<string>"
     ]
   }

Client-side field level encryption depends on uniqueness of
``keyAltNames`` values. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
:method:`KeyVault.createKey()` method creates a :ref:`unique index
<index-type-unique>` on ``keyAltNames`` if one does not exist.
Applications can use the :dbcommand:`listIndexes` command against the
key vault collection to check if the unique index exists. If the
unique index does not exist, applications *must* create it prior
to performing data key management.

For complete documentation on data key management, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.

.. _field-level-encryption-mongocryptd:
.. _mongocryptd:

``mongocryptd``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*MongoDB Enterprise Only*

``mongocryptd`` is a driver-spawned client-side process that parses and
validates the JSON schema encryption rules. ``mongocryptd`` is a required
component in 
:ref:`automatic field encryption <field-level-encryption-automatic>` and
is included as a component in the 
:doc:`MongoDB  Enterprise Server </administration/install-enterprise>` package.

4.2 drivers automatically spawn the ``mongocryptd`` process if
available on the host system. Applications can control the spawning
behavior as part of the automatic encryption options. Defer to the
driver documentation for the specific options and syntax for
controlling ``mongocryptd`` spawning.

.. _field-level-encryption-drivers:
