.. projection:: $slice

   The :projection:`$slice` operator controls the number of items of an
   array that a query returns. For information on limiting the size of
   an array during an update with :update:`$push`, see the
   :update:`$slice` modifier instead.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-projection-$slice.rst

   Consider the following prototype query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: value }, { array: {$slice: count } } );

   This operation selects the document ``collection`` identified by a
   field named ``field`` that holds ``value`` and returns the number
   of elements specified by the value of ``count`` from the array
   stored in the ``array`` field. If ``count`` has a value greater
   than the number of elements in ``array`` the query returns all
   elements of the array.

   :projection:`$slice` accepts arguments in a number of formats,
   including negative values and arrays. Consider the following
   examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: 5 } } )

   Here, :projection:`$slice` selects the first five items in an array
   in the ``comments`` field.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: -5 } } )

   This operation returns the last five items in array.

   The following examples specify an array as an argument to
   :projection:`$slice`. Arrays take the form of ``[ skip , limit ]``, where the
   first value indicates the number of items in the array to skip and
   the second value indicates the number of items to return.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: [ 20, 10 ] } } )

   Here, the query will only return 10 items, after skipping the first
   20 items of that array.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: [ -20, 10 ] } } )

   This operation returns 10 items as well, beginning with the item
   that is 20th from the last item of the array.
