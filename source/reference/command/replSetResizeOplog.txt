.. dbcommand:: replSetResizeOplog

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   The :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` dynamically resizes a replica
   set member's oplog to satisfy the operational needs in a replica
   set. It bypasses the need to perform a maintenance
   operation to resize the oplog.  The command may only be run against the
   ``admin`` database.

   This feature is only available for nodes running on the WiredTiger
   storage engine. If you are using the MMAPv1 storage engine, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size` to follow the maintenance
   procedure.

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetResizeOplog: <boolean>, size: <num MB> }

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes the size parameter
      in megabytes, while the oplog size is stored in bytes. The size
      parameter must also be over 990 megabytes.

   The command can also take the following options:

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/retryable-writes-table-options.rst

Example
--------

Use the :dbcommand:`stats` command to display the current oplog size,
``maxSize``. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command will return the oplog size of this member:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "maxSize": NumberLong("9790804377")

``maxSize`` is currently 9790804377 bytes, or 9337 megabytes.

The following command changes the oplog size of this member to
17179869184 bytes, or 16384 megabytes.

To change the size, run the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`, passing
the desired size in megabytes as a parameter.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({replSetResizeOplog:1, size: 16384})

To verify the new oplog size, rerun the :dbcommand:`stats` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "maxSize": NumberLong("17179869184")

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog in a node removes data from it. This
   may cause replica members syncing with that node to become stale.
   To resync those members, see :ref:`resync-replica-set-member`.
