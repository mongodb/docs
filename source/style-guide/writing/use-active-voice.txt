Why Use Active Voice?
---------------------

- *Active voice* makes the *performer* of the action (usually the
  reader or user) the subject of the sentence.

- *Passive voice* makes the *recipient* of the action (not the
  performer) the subject of the sentence.

When compared to passive-voice sentences, active-voice sentences are:

- more engaging
- less complicated
- less wordy
- easier to understand

With active voice, you can distinguish the actions and responses
of the user from those of the technology.

.. example::

   Beginning users look for specific calls to action in procedures.
   Active voice makes this clear.

   Consider if you write a step that reads "The service can be
   restarted".

   As written, this sentence reads as a *consideration* or a
   *possibility*, not an *instruction*. If the user skips this step
   due to this confusion, the rest of the tutorial might fail.

   If you write "Restart the service", you remove all doubt. It saves
   the tutorial. This also clarifies that the user restarts the
   service.

   In some systems, a service might restart itself after a failure.
   Active voice distinguishes between situations when a service acts
   and a user needs to act. "Restart the server" leaves no confusion
   over who performs the action: the user.

When Do You Use Passive Voice?
------------------------------

You can use passive voice when using active voice:

-  Sounds like you're blaming the user. For
   example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
   troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
-  Makes the sentence wordy or awkward.
-  Would emphasize the performer when you don't know the performer of
   action or you want to de-emphasize the performer in favor the object
   on which the action is performed.

     - Why?
   * - If the build fails, the flavor might have been omitted.
     - If the build fails, you probably omitted the flavor.
     - The active voice blames the user.
   * - A flag was set incorrectly.
     - You set the flag incorrectly.
     - The active voice blames the user.
   * - Account owners can't be assigned additional roles, and their
       access can't be restricted.
     - Administrators can't assign account owners additional roles, and
       they can't restrict the access of account owners.
     - In this context, the object, account owners, is more important
       than the actor, administrators.
