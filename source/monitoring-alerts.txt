|service-fullname| has a robust set of built-in metrics, telemetry,
and logs that you can leverage from |service| or integrate into your
third-party observability and alerting stack. This enables you to
monitor and manage your |service| deployments and respond to incidents
proactively and in real time.

Monitoring your deployment allows you to:

- Understand the health and status of your {+cluster+}
- Learn how operations running on the {+cluster+} are impacting the
  database
- Learn if your hardware is resource constrained
- Perform workload and query optimization
- Detect and react to real-time issues to improve your application stack

|service| provides several metrics for monitoring and alerting. You can
track the health, availability, consumption, and performance of your 
deployments in visual dashboards and by |api|.  

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Monitoring and Alerts
------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| provides several ways and tools to monitor your deployment and
improve performance. You can view various {+cluster+} metrics, monitor your
database performance, configure alerts and alert notification, and
download activity logs. 

Features 
~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80 
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metrics 
     - Deployment metrics provide insight into hardware performance and
       database operation efficiency. |service| collects metrics for
       your servers, databases, and MongoDB processes and stores metrics
       data at various granularity levels. For each granularity level,
       |service| computes metrics as averages of the reported metrics at
       the next finer granularity level. Many metrics have a burst
       reporting equivalent. 
       
       You can view metrics by using the {+atlas-ui+} Real-Time
       Performance Panel, Query Profiler, Performance Advisor and
       Namespace Insights page, {+atlas-cli+}, or {+atlas-admin-api+} to funnel metrics into a tool of your
       choice. 

   * - Alerts 
     - |service| provides alerts for over 200 event types, allowing you
       to tailor alerts for precise monitoring. |service| issues alerts
       for the database and server conditions that you configure in your
       alert settings. When a condition triggers an alert, |service|
       displays a warning symbol on the {+cluster+} and sends alert
       notifications. 
       
       You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, {+atlas-cli+},
       and integrated Terraform resource to configure alerts and alert
       notification.  

   * - Monitoring
     - |service| monitoring visualizations provide insights into
       various key
       metrics, including hardware performance and database operation
       efficiency. Tools such as real-time performance panels for
       network and operation visibility, query profilers for tracking
       efficiency trends, and automated index suggestions allow you to
       monitor and troubleshoot issues more effectively, driving
       greater operational efficiency. For example, these charts can
       help you understand the impact of server restarts and elections
       on database performance.  

   * - Logs 
     - |service| provides logs for each process in the {+cluster+}. Each
       process keeps an account of its activity in its own log file. 
       
       You can download logs by using the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+},
       {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

Recommendations for Monitoring by Using Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To monitor your {+cluster+} or database performance, you can view the {+cluster+} metrics such as historical throughput,
performance, and utilization metrics. The following table lists some
important categories of metrics to monitor: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 30 70 
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - |service| {+Cluster+} Operations and Connection Metrics 
     - - Opcounters 
       - Operation Execution Times 
       - Query Executors and Query Targeting 
       - Connections 
       - Queues 
       - Scan and Order

   * - Hardware Metrics
     - - Normalized System CPU 
       - Normalized Process CPU 
       - Disk Latency 
       - Disk IOPS 
       - Disk Space Free 
       - System Memory 
       - Swap Usage

   * - Replication Metrics
     - - Replication Lag 
       - Replication Oplog Window 
       - Replication Headroom 
       - Oplog GB/Hour 
       - Opcounters -repl 

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, and {+atlas-cli+} to
view |service| {+cluster+} metrics. Additionally, |service| provides
built-in integrations with third-party tools such as Datadog, and you
can also leverage the {+atlas-admin-api+} to integrate with other
custom metrics tools.

To learn more, see :ref:`monitor-cluster-metrics`. 

Recommendations for Monitoring by Configuring Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| extends into your existing observability stack so that you can get alerts and make data-driven decisions without replacing your
current tools or changing your workflows. {+service+} can send alert notifications with third-party tools like
:atlas:`Microsoft Teams </tutorial/integrate-msft-teams>`,
:ref:`PagerDuty <pagerduty-integration>`, :ref:`DataDog 
<datadog-integration>`, :ref:`Prometheus <prometheus-integration>`,
:atlascli:`Opsgenie </command/atlas-integrations-create-OPS_GENIE/>`,
:atlascli:`Splunk On-Call </command/atlas-integrations-create-VICTOR_OPS/>`, 
and :atlas:`other tools </tutorial/third-party-service-integrations/>` to give you visibility into both database and full-stack performance in the same place. 

Configure alerts and notifications for security events, such as failed
login attempts, unusual access patterns, and data breaches. In dev and
test environments, we recommend configuring alerts on {+clusters+} after
seven days of inactivity to save costs. 

Recommended {+service+} Alert Configurations
````````````````````````````````````````````

At the minimum, we recommend configuring the following alerts. These
alerts recommendations provide a baseline, but you should adjust them
based on your workload characteristics. Where "high priority" conditions
are specified, we recommend that you configure multiple alerts for the
same condition, one for a low priority / "warning" level of severity, and one for a high priority level of severity.

Recommendations for Monitoring by Using {+service+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| provides several tools that allow you to proactively monitor and
improve the performance of your database. 

Real-Time Performance Panel
```````````````````````````

The Real-Time Performance Panel (RTPP) in the {+atlas-ui+} provides
insights into current network traffic, database operations, and hardware
statistics about the hosts at a one second granularity in the
{+atlas-ui+}. We recommend that you use :abbr:`RTPP (Real-Time
Performance Panel)` to:   

- Visually identify relevant database operations
- Evaluate query execution times 
- Evaluate the ratio of documents scanned to documents returned
- Monitor network load and throughput
- Discover potential replication lag on secondary members of replica sets
- Kill operations before they have completed to free up valuable resources

The RTPP is not available to monitor from the {+atlas-admin-api+},
but you can enable and disable the RTPP from the {+atlas-admin-api+}
with :oas-atlas-op:`Update One Project Settings
</updateProjectSettings>`.

To learn more, see :ref:`real-time-metrics-status-tab`.

Query Profiler 
``````````````

The Query Profiler identifies slow queries and bottlenecks, and suggests
index refinement and query restructuring to improve the performance of
your database. It provides visibility into the slowest operations over 
a 24-hour window in the {+atlas-ui+}, making it easier to identify
trends and outliers in query efficiency. We recommend that you use this
data to pinpoint and troubleshoot poorly performing queries, reducing 
performance overhead. 

You can return log lines for slow queries that the Query Profiler identifies from the {+atlas-admin-api+}
with :oas-atlas-op:`Return Slow Queries
</listSlowQueries>`.

To learn more, see :ref:`query-profiler`.

Performance Advisor 
```````````````````

The Performance Advisor automatically analyzes logs for slow-running
queries and recommends indexes to create and drop. It analyzes slow
queries and provides index suggestions for individual collections,
ranked by a calculated impact score, and tailored to your workload. This
gives you an easy, instantaneous way to make high-impact performance
improvements. We recommend that you monitor regularly, focus on slow
queries, and enable the profiler selectively to minimize overhead.

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+}, and the {+atlas-admin-api+}
to view slow queries and suggestions for improving the performance of
your queries from the Performance Advisor.

You can return log lines for slow queries that the Performance Advisor identifies from the {+atlas-admin-api+}
with :oas-atlas-op:`Return Slow Queries
</listSlowQueries>`. To return suggested indexes and more with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see :oas-atlas-tag:`Performance Advisor
<Performance-Advisor>`.

To learn more, see :ref:`performance-advisor`.

Namespace Insights 
``````````````````

The Namespace Insights page in the {+atlas-ui+} allows you to monitor
collection-level performance and usage metrics. It displays metrics
(such as the number of CRUD operations on the collection) and statistics
(like average query execution time) for certain hosts and operation
types for the collections that you :atlas:`pin for monitoring </namespace-insights/#manage-pinned-namespaces-from-the-dialog>`. This gives you
more granular visibility into collection-level performance, which you
can use to optimize database performance, resolve issues, and make
decisions about scaling, indexing, and query tuning. 

To learn more, see :ref:`namespace-insights`.  

Recommendations for Monitoring by Using Logs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/cloud-docs/logs.rst

You can also :atlas:`push logs to an AWS S3 bucket </push-logs/>`. 
When you configure this feature, {+service+} continually pushes logs from ``mongod``, ``mongos``, and audit logs to an |aws| S3 bucket. {+service+} exports logs every five minutes.
