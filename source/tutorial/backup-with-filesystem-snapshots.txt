Backup and Restore with Filesystem Snapshots
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document describes a procedure for creating backups of MongoDB
systems using system-level tools, such as :term:`LVM` or storage
appliance, as well as the corresponding restoration strategies.

These filesystem snapshots, or "block-level" backup methods use system
level tools to create copies of the device that holds MongoDB's data
files. These methods complete quickly and work reliably, but require
more system configuration outside of MongoDB.

   :doc:`/tutorial/backup-with-mongodump`.

Snapshots Overview
------------------

Snapshots work by creating pointers between the live data and a
special snapshot volume. These pointers are theoretically equivalent
to "hard links." As the working data diverges from the snapshot,
the snapshot process uses a copy-on-write strategy. As a result the snapshot
only stores modified data.

After making the snapshot, you mount the snapshot image on your
file system and copy data from the snapshot. The resulting backup
contains a full copy of all data.

Snapshots have the following limitations:

- The database must be valid when the
  snapshot takes place. This means that all writes accepted by the
  database need to be fully written to disk: either to the
  :term:`journal` or to data files.

  If all writes are not on disk when the backup occurs, the backup
  will not reflect these changes. If writes are *in progress* when the
  backup occurs, the data files will reflect an inconsistent
  state. With :term:`journaling <journal>` all data-file states
  resulting from in-progress writes are recoverable; without
  journaling you must flush all pending writes to disk before
  running the backup operation and must ensure that no writes occur during
  the entire backup procedure.

  If you do use journaling, the journal **must** reside on the same volume
  as the data.

- Snapshots create an image of an entire disk image. Unless you need
  to back up your entire system, consider isolating your MongoDB data
  files, journal (if applicable), and configuration on one logical
  disk that doesn't contain any other data.

  Alternately, store all MongoDB data files on a dedicated device
  so that you can make backups without duplicating extraneous data.

- Ensure that you copy data from snapshots and onto other systems to
  ensure that data is safe from site failures.

- Although different snapshots methods provide different capability, the
  LVM method outlined below does not provide any capacity for
  capturing incremental backups.

.. _backup-with-journaling:

Snapshots With Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :program:`mongod` instance has journaling enabled, then you can
use any kind of file system or volume/block level snapshot tool to
create backups.

If you manage your own infrastructure on a Linux-based system, configure
your system with :term:`LVM` to provide your disk packages and provide
snapshot capability. You can also use LVM-based setups *within* a
cloud/virtualized environment.

.. note::

   Running :term:`LVM` provides additional flexibility and enables the
   possibility of using snapshots to back up MongoDB.

Snapshots with Amazon EBS in a RAID 10 Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your deployment depends on Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) with
RAID configured within your instance, it is impossible to get a
consistent state across all disks using the platform's snapshot tool. As
an alternative, you can do one of the following:

- Flush all writes to disk and create a write lock to ensure
  consistent state during the backup process.

  If you choose this option see :ref:`backup-without-journaling`.

- Configure :term:`LVM` to run and hold your MongoDB data files on top of the
  RAID within your system.

  If you choose this option, perform the LVM backup operation described
  in :ref:`lvm-backup-operation`.

.. _lvm-backup-and-restore:

Backup and Restore Using LVM on a Linux System
----------------------------------------------

This section provides an overview of a simple backup process
using :term:`LVM` on a Linux system. While the tools, commands, and paths may
be (slightly) different on your system the following steps provide a
high level overview of the backup operation.

.. note::

   Only use the following procedure as a guideline for a backup system
   and infrastructure. Production backup systems must consider a
   number of application specific requirements and factors unique to
   specific environments.

.. _lvm-backup-operation:

Create a Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a snapshot with :term:`LVM`, issue a command as root in the
following format:

.. code-block:: sh

   lvcreate --size 100M --snapshot --name mdb-snap01 /dev/vg0/mongodb

This command creates an :term:`LVM` snapshot (with the ``--snapshot`` option)
named ``mdb-snap01`` of the ``mongodb`` volume in the ``vg0``
volume group.

This example creates a snapshot named ``mdb-snap01`` located at
``/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01``. The location and paths to your systems volume
groups and devices may vary slightly depending on your operating
system's :term:`LVM` configuration.

The snapshot has a cap of at 100 megabytes, because of the parameter
``--size 100M``. This size does not reflect the total amount of the
data on the disk, but rather the quantity of differences between the
current state of ``/dev/vg0/mongodb`` and the creation of the snapshot
(i.e. ``/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01``.)

.. warning::

   Ensure that you create snapshots with enough space to account for
   data growth, particularly for the period of time that it takes to copy
   data out of the system or to a temporary image.

   If your snapshot runs out of space, the snapshot image
   becomes unusable. Discard this logical volume and create another.

The snapshot will exist when the command returns. You can restore
directly from the snapshot at any time or by creating a new logical
volume and restoring from this snapshot to the alternate image.

While snapshots are great for creating high quality backups very
quickly, they are not ideal as a format for storing backup
data. Snapshots typically depend and reside on the same storage
infrastructure as the original disk images. Therefore, it's crucial
that you archive these snapshots and store them elsewhere.

Archive a Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating a snapshot, mount the snapshot and copy the data to
separate storage. Your system might try to compress the backup images as
you move the offline. Alternatively, take a block level copy of the
snapshot image, such as with the following procedure:

.. code-block:: sh

   umount /dev/vg0/mdb-snap01
   dd if=/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01 | gzip > mdb-snap01.gz

The above command sequence does the following:

- Ensures that the ``/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01`` device is not mounted.  Never
  take a block level copy of a filesystem or filesystem snapshot that is
  mounted.

- Performs a block level copy of the entire snapshot image using the ``dd``
  command and compresses the result in a gzipped file in the
  current working directory.

  .. warning::

     This command will create a large ``gz`` file in your current
     working directory. Make sure that you run this command in a file
     system that has enough free space.

.. _backup-restore-snapshot:

Restore a Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore a snapshot created with the above method, issue the following
sequence of commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   lvcreate --size 1G --name mdb-new vg0
   gzip -d -c mdb-snap01.gz | dd of=/dev/vg0/mdb-new
   mount /dev/vg0/mdb-new /srv/mongodb

The above sequence does the following:

- Creates a new logical volume named ``mdb-new``, in the ``/dev/vg0``
  volume group. The path to the new device will be ``/dev/vg0/mdb-new``.

  .. warning::

     This volume will have a maximum size of 1 gigabyte. The original
     file system must have had a total size of 1 gigabyte or smaller, or
     else the restoration will fail.

     Change ``1G`` to your desired volume size.

- Uncompresses and unarchives the ``mdb-snap01.gz`` into the
  ``mdb-new`` disk image.

- Mounts the ``mdb-new`` disk image to the ``/srv/mongodb`` directory.
  Modify the mount point to correspond to your MongoDB data file
  location, or other location as needed.

.. note::

   The restored snapshot will have a stale ``mongod.lock`` file. If
   you do not remove this file from the snapshot, and MongoDB may
   assume that the stale lock file indicates an unclean shutdown. If
   you're running with :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` enabled, and you *do not*
   use :method:`db.fsyncLock()`, you do not need to remove the
   ``mongod.lock`` file. If you use :method:`db.fsyncLock()` you will
   need to remove the lock.

.. _backup-restore-from-snapshot:

Restore Directly from a Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore a backup without writing to a compressed ``gz`` file, use
the following sequence of commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   umount /dev/vg0/mdb-snap01
   lvcreate --size 1G --name mdb-new vg0
   dd if=/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01 of=/dev/vg0/mdb-new
   mount /dev/vg0/mdb-new /srv/mongodb

Remote Backup Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can implement off-system backups using the :ref:`combined process
<backup-restore-from-snapshot>` and SSH.

This sequence is identical to procedures explained above, except that it
archives and compresses the backup on a remote system using SSH.

Consider the following procedure:

.. code-block:: sh

   umount /dev/vg0/mdb-snap01
   dd if=/dev/vg0/mdb-snap01 | ssh username@example.com gzip > /opt/backup/mdb-snap01.gz
   lvcreate --size 1G --name mdb-new vg0
   ssh username@example.com gzip -d -c /opt/backup/mdb-snap01.gz | dd of=/dev/vg0/mdb-new
   mount /dev/vg0/mdb-new /srv/mongodb

.. _backup-without-journaling:

Create Backups on Instances that do not have Journaling Enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------

If your :program:`mongod` instance does not run with journaling
enabled, or if your journal is on a separate volume, obtaining a
functional backup of a consistent state is more complicated.
As described in this section, you must flush all
writes to disk and lock the database to prevent writes during the
backup process. If you have a :term:`replica set` configuration,
then for your backup use a
:term:`secondary` which is not receiving reads (i.e. :term:`hidden
member`).

1. To flush writes to disk and to "lock" the database (to prevent
   further writes), issue the :method:`db.fsyncLock()` method in the
   :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncLock();

#. Perform the backup operation described in :ref:`lvm-backup-operation`.

#. To unlock the database after the snapshot has completed, use the
   following command in the :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncUnlock();

   .. note::

      .. versionchanged:: 2.0
         MongoDB 2.0 added :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and
         :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` helpers to the :program:`mongo`
         shell.  Prior to this version, use the :dbcommand:`fsync`
         command with the ``lock`` option, as follows:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.runCommand( { fsync: 1, lock: true } );
         db.runCommand( { fsync: 1, lock: false } );
