msgid "Starting in v3.2, the :operator:`$max` operator is deprecated in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use :method:`cursor.max()` instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/meta/max.txt:20
msgid "Specify a :operator:`$max` value to specify the *exclusive* upper bound for a specific index in order to constrain the results of :method:`~db.collection.find()`. The :operator:`$max` specifies the upper bound for *all* keys of a specific index *in order*."

msgid "Interaction with Index Selection"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/meta/max.txt:45
msgid "Because :method:`~cursor.max()` requires an index on a field, and forces the query to use this index, you may prefer the :query:`$lt` operator for the query if possible. Consider the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/meta/max.txt:54
msgid "The query uses the index on the ``age`` field, even if the index on ``_id`` may be better."

msgid "the index bounds specified in :operator:`$min` and :operator:`$max` must both refer to the keys of the same index."

msgid "``$max`` without ``$min``"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-query-min-max.rst:1
msgid "The :operator:`min` and :operator:`max` operators indicate that the system should avoid normal query planning. Instead they construct an index scan where the index bounds are explicitly specified by the values given in :operator:`min` and :operator:`max`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-query-min-max.rst:8
msgid "If one of the two boundaries is not specified, the query plan will be an index scan that is unbounded on one side. This may degrade performance compared to a query containing neither operator, or one that uses both operators to more tightly constrain the index scan."

msgid "Consider the following operations on a collection named ``collection`` that has an index ``{ age: 1 }``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/meta/max.txt:90
msgid "This operation limits the query to those documents where the field ``age`` is less than ``100`` and forces a query plan which scans the ``{ age: 1 }`` index from :bsontype:`MinKey <data_minkey>` to 100."

Otherwise, MongoDB selects the index using the fields in the :operator:`$max` and :operator:`$min` bounds; however, if multiple indexes exist on same fields with different sort orders, the selection of the index may be ambiguous."
