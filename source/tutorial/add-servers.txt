==================
Add Servers to MMS
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Before you can deploy and manage MongoDB instances through MMS, you
must add the servers on which MongoDB will run.

|mms| can manage a deployment in three different environments:

- Systems provisioned directly with Amazon Web Services (AWS). |mms| provides
  integration with AWS and lets you deploy new EC2 instances directly from
  the |mms| interface. To use EC2 instances for your deployments, you
  must:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/provision-aws-servers`

- Existing systems and infrastructure. |mms| can deploy and manage
  MongoDB on your existing servers. To use your existing hardware, you
  must deploy the Automation Agent to each server on which |mms| will deploy
  MongoDB. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-hardware`.

- For testing, on your local system, |mms| can deploy MongoDB to your
  laptop or desktop system. Do not use local systems for production
  deployments. To deploy to your local
  machine, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.
