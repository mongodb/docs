You can use the ``vectorSearch`` type to index fields for running 
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. You can define the index for the
vector embeddings that you want to query and the boolean, numeric, or
string values that you want to use to pre-filter your data. You can use
the {+atlas-ui+} and {+atlas-admin-api+} to create your {+avs+} index.

.. _avs-types-vector-search-considerations:

Considerations 
--------------

You can't index fields inside arrays of documents or fields inside 
arrays of objects in a ``vectorSearch`` type index definition. You can
index fields inside documents using the dot notation. 

Syntax 
------

The following syntax defines the ``vectorSearch`` index type:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:

   {
     "name": "<index-name>",
     "type": "vectorSearch",
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": "<field-to-index>",
         "numDimensions": <number-of-dimensions>,
         "similarity": "euclidean | cosine | dotProduct"
       },
       {
         "type": "filter",
         "path": "<field-to-index>"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

.. _avs-types-vector:

About the ``vector`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The vector field must contain an array of numbers of the |bson|
``double`` data type for querying using the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
pipeline stage. You must index the vector field as the ``vector`` type
inside the ``fields`` array.  

The following syntax defines the ``vector`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5-10

   {
     "name": "<index-name>",
     "type": "vectorSearch",
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": <field-to-index>,
         "numDimensions": <number-of-dimensions>,
         "similarity": "euclidean | cosine | dotProduct"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

.. _avs-types-filter:

About the ``filter`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally index boolean, numeric, and string values to
pre-filter your data. You must index your boolean, numeric, and
string fields using the ``filter`` type inside the ``fields`` array. 

The following syntax defines the ``filter`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9-12 

   {
     "name": "<index-name>",
     "type": "vectorSearch",
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         ...
       },
       {
         "type": "filter",
         "path": "<field-to-index>"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

.. _avs-types-vector-search-options:

{+avs+} Index Fields
--------------------------------

The {+avs+} index definition takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 15 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type 
     - Necessity
     - Purpose

   * - ``name``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Human-readable label that identifies the index. The search index name
       in an |service| {+cluster+} must be unique within the namespace,
       irrespective of the type of index.  

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - Required
     - Human-readable label that identifies the type of index. Value must 
       be ``vectorSearch``.

   * - ``fields``
     - array of documents 
     - Required 
     - Vector and filter fields to index, one per document. At least one
       document *must* contain the field definition for the vector
       field. You can optionally also index number, boolean, and string
       fields, one per document, for pre-filtering the data.

   * - ``fields.type``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Field type to use to index fields for :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`.
       You can specify one of the following values:  
       
       - ``vector`` - for fields that contain vector embeddings.
       - ``filter`` - for fields that contain boolean, numeric, or
         string values. 

   * - ``fields.path``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Name of the field to index. For nested fields, use dot notation
       to specify path to embedded fields. You can't index field names
       with two consecutive dots (``.``) and field names ending with
       dots (``.``). For example, {+avs+} *doesn't* support indexing the 
       following field names: 

       .. list-table:: 
          :stub-columns: 1

          * - ``foo..bar`` 
            - Field name has two consecutive dots.
       
          * - ``foo_bar.`` 
            - Field name ends with a dot.

   * - ``fields.numDimensions``
     - int
     - Required
     - Number of vector dimensions that {+avs+} enforces at index-time and
       query-time. You must specify a value less than ``2049``. You can
       set this field only for ``vector`` type fields.

   * - ``fields.similarity``
     - string
     - Required
     - Vector similarity function to use to search for top K-nearest 
       neighbors. You can set this field only for ``vector`` type
       fields. Value include: 

       - ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. 
         This value allows you to measure similarity based on varying 
         dimensions. To learn more, see :wikipedia:`Euclidean 
         <Euclidean_distance>`.
       - ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between 
         vectors. This value allows you to measure similarity that isn't 
         scaled by magnitude. You can't use zero magnitude vectors with 
         ``cosine``. To measure cosine similarity, we recommend that 
         you normalize your vectors and use ``dotProduct`` instead. To 
         learn more, see :wikipedia:`Cosine <Cosine_similarity>`.
       - ``dotProduct`` - measures similar to ``cosine``, but takes 
         into account the magnitude of the vector. This value allows you to 
         efficiently measure similarity based on both angle and 
         magnitude. To use ``dotProduct``, you must normalize the 
         vector to unit length at index-time and query-time. To learn more, 
         see :wikipedia:`Dot Product <Dot_product>`.

       .. note:: 

          If you normalize the magnitude, ``cosine`` and 
          ``dotProduct`` are almost identical in measuring similarity.

  .. _avs-types-vector-search-clients:

  Supported Clients 
  -----------------

  You can create and manage {+avs+} indexes through the {+atlas-ui+},
  {+mongosh+}, and the following MongoDB :driver:`drivers </>`: 

  - :driver:`C# </csharp/current/>`
  - :driver:`Java </java-drivers/>`
  - :driver:`Node </node/current/>`
  - :driver:`Pymongo </pymongo/>`

  You can also use {+avs+} with local |service| deployments that you
  create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see :atlascli:`Create a
  Local Atlas Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

.. _avs-types-vector-search-manage:

Create and Manage {+avs+} Indexes   
---------------------------------------------

You can create and manage {+avs+} indexes from the {+atlas-ui+} and
the {+atlas-admin-api+}. To learn more, see: 

- :ref:`avs-create-index`
- :ref:`avs-view-index`
- :ref:`avs-edit-index`
- :ref:`avs-delete-index`

.. _avs-node-status-ref:

Node Status
-----------

When you create the {+avs+} index, the :guilabel:`Status` column shows 
the current state of the index on the primary node of the cluster. 
Click the :guilabel:`View status details` link below the status to view 
the state of the index on all the nodes of the cluster.

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Not Started 
     - |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Initial Sync 
     - |service| is building the index or re-building the 
       index after an edit. When the index is in this state:
       
       - For a new index, {+avs+} doesn't serve queries until the 
         index build is complete. 
       - For an existing index, you can continue to use the old index 
         for existing and new queries until the index rebuild 
         is complete.

   * - Active
     - Index is ready to use.

   * - Recovering
     - Replication encountered an error. This state commonly occurs 
       when the current replication point is no longer available on the 
       |mongod| oplog. You can still query the existing index until it 
       updates and its status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. Use the 
       error in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Failed 
     - |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.

While |service| builds the index and after the build completes, the 
:guilabel:`Documents` column shows the percentage and number of 
documents indexed. The column also shows the total number of documents 
in the collection.
