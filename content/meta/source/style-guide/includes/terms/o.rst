   only
     Place *only* preceding the word or group that it modifies. If
     *only* modifies a final word or phrase, it may precede or follow
     that word or phrase.

     .. example::

        - The program runs only the control file.

        - The program runs the control file only.

        - Only the control file is run by the program.

          (These statements mean that the control file is the only item
          that the program runs.)

        - The program only runs the control file.

          (This statement means that running the control file is all
          that the program does.)

   on-premises
     **off-premises**

     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` Avoid using these terms to distinguish
     non-Atlas deployments. To distinguish non-Atlas deployments, use
     :term:`self-managed`.

     Use *on-premises* to distinguish local computing (in which
     resources are located on a customer's own site) from remote
     computing (in which resources are provided partially or totally
     through the cloud). Always hyphenate. *Premises* is plural; don't
     use *on-premise* or *off-premise*. For consistency, always use the
     complete *on-premises* term, and do not shorten to *on-prem*.

   open
     .. seealso:: 
       
        :term:`close`, :term:`open`

   open source
     **open-source**
     Use lowercase. Hyphenate when used as a modifier.

   operating system
     **OS**
     *OS* is a common abbreviation for *operating system* and you can
     use it without first spelling it out if the context is clear. To
     form the plural of *OS*, add an *s* without an apostropheâ€”\
     *OSs*.

     However, if you feel that the context makes the use of *OS* or
     *OSs* confusing in a particular document, spell out the term in
     all instances in the document. If space is constrained (such as
     in a table or figure callout), use the abbreviated forms but
     explain them in text.

     If you mean the combination of operating system and hardware
     configuration, use *platform*.

   out-of-the-box
     This term describes a system, item, functionality, or feature
     that's usable without customization. Don't abbreviate as *OOTB*.

     When used as an adjective preceding a noun, the phrase is
     hyphenated, but when used as an adverb, it isn't hyphenated.

   over
     **more than**
     Don't use *over* to indicate quantities; use *more than*
     instead. Also, don't use *over* to refer to version numbers.
