Annotation Type Beta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_annotations_Beta:



io.realm.annotations
====================

**Implemented interfaces:**



- `java.lang.annotation.Annotation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html>`__ 


This annotation is added to classes, constructors or methods which are considered in beta phase. It indicates that any public interface can change without prior announcements. Moreover, classes, constructors, and methods annotated as beta are not considered at production quality, and should be used with care.
