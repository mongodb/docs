Overview
--------

A global alert applies the same :doc:`alert configuration
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>` to multiple projects at once. When
an alert condition occurs, |onprem| sends notification only to the
affected project. |onprem| sends notification at regular intervals until the
alert :ref:`resolves <resolved-alert>` or gets :ref:`canceled
<cancelled-alert>`.

If you acknowledge a global alert, |onprem| sends no further notifications to
the alert’s distribution list until the acknowledgement period has passed or
until the alert resolves. If the alert condition ends during the
acknowledgment period, |onprem| sends a notification of the resolution.

To access global alerts you must have the
:authrole:`Global Owner` role or :authrole:`Global Monitoring Admin` role.

   :class: note

   When |onprem| starts, it creates :ref:`default global alert 
   configurations <default-global-alerts>`. If you delete a default 
   global alert configuration, |onprem| recreates it when the 
   application restarts.

   If you don't want to receive alerts from a default global alert 
   configuration, you must :ref:`disable that global alert configuration <disable-enable-global-alert>`.

Default Global Alerts
---------------------

Each time |onprem| starts, it creates global alert 
configurations for the following conditions:

- Blockstore jobs have reached a high number of retries

- Sync slice transfer has not progressed in more than 60 minutes

- Inconsistent cluster snapshot count is above 5

- Backup is down

- Backup has too many conf call failures

- No daemon is available to take a queryable restore job

- Inconsistent backup configuration has been detected

- Backup requires a resync

- Replica set has a late snapshot

- Backup is in an unexpected state

- Backup has reached a high number of retries

- Backup could not be assigned to a backup daemon

If you do not want to receive alerts from a default global alert 
configuration, you must :ref:`disable that global alert configuration <disable-enable-global-alert>`.
