Configure |mms| to use HTTPS
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can *optionally* configure the Jetty instances that serve the |mms|
application to use HTTPS to encrypt connections between the MMS
application, the |mms| agent, and the web
interface. Alternately, you can provide access to the |mms| application
using a load balancer that provides HTTPS access.

Before you can configure |monitoring| Jetty instances to use HTTPS, you
must have a valid SSL certificate prepared in the right format.
This page provides procedures for creating and preparing a valid SSL
certificate.

Create and Prepare a Valid SSL Certificate
------------------------------------------

Create the certificate either through a 3rd-party authority or as a
self-signed certificate. If you have an existing certificate, you can use
that instead but still must prepare it. Preparing a certificate can
involve converting its format and concatenating it with other certificates
in a certificate chain.

Use the appropriate procedures in this section to generate and prepare the
certificate. To generate certificates must have access to the
``openssl`` utility.

Configure Jetty Instances to use HTTPS
--------------------------------------

Once you have created and prepared a valid SSL certificate, use the
following sequence of procedures to configure the Jetty instances to use
HTTPS to encrypt connections between the |mms| application and the MMS
agent.
