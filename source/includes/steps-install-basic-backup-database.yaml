title: Create a data directory for each replica set member.
stepnum: 1
ref: data-directories
action:
  pre: |
    For each replica set member, create a data directory and set
    ``mongod.mongod`` as the directory's owner. For example:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo mkdir -p /data /data/blockstore
    sudo chown mongod:mongod /data /data/blockstore
---
title: Start each MongoDB instance.
stepnum: 2
ref: start-mongod-instance
pre: |
  For each replica set member, start the :program:`mongod` daemon and specify
  "``mongod``" as the user. Start each instance on its own dedicated port number
  and with the data directory you created in the previous step. Use a
  **different port number** from the port used for the MongoDB instance
  hosting the |application| database. Specify the same replica set for all
  three members.
action:
  pre: |
    The following command starts a MongoDB instance as part of a
    replica set named ``blockstore``, specifies the ``/data/blockstore``
    data directory, and uses port ``27018``:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo -u mongod mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /data/blockstore --replSet blockstore --logpath /data/blockstore/mongodb.log --fork
post: |
  After you complete this step, you should have new :program:`mongod` instances
  running on **server1**, **server2**, and **server3**.
---
title: "Connect to the MongoDB instance that hosts the database's primary."
stepnum: 3
ref: connect
pre: |
  Connect to the MongoDB instance running on **server 2**, which is the server
  that hosts the Backup Blockstore's primary. Make sure to **connect
  on the correct port number** for the MongoDB instance that hosts the Backup
  Blockstore.
action:
  pre: |
    For example, the following command connects on port ``27018`` to a MongoDB
    instance running on ``mongodb2.example.net``:
  language: none
  code: |
    mongo --host mongodb2.example.net --port 27018
post: |
  Once you are connected, your command prompt changes to ``>``.

stepnum: 4
source:
  file: steps-install-basic-application-database.yaml
  ref: initiate
---
title: Add the remaining members to the replica set.
stepnum: 5
ref: add-members
action:
  pre: |
    Add the :program:`mongod` instances running on **server 3** and **server
    1** as a secondary and an arbiter, respectively. Add the secondary first.
    For example, the following two commands add MongoDB instances running on
    ``mongodb3.example.net`` and on ``mongodb1.example.net``:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    rs.add('mongodb3.example.net:27018')
    rs.addArb('mongodb1.example.net:27018')
---
title: Verify the replica set configuration.
stepnum: 6
ref: verify
action:
  - pre: |
      To verify that the configuration includes the three members, issue
      :manual:`rs.conf() </reference/method/rs.conf>`:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      rs.conf()
  - pre: |
      The method returns output similiar to the following.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      {
          "_id" : "blockstore",
          "version" : 3,
          "members" : [
              {
                  "_id" : 0,
                  "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27018"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 1,
                  "host" : "mongodb3.example.net:27018"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 2,
                  "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27018",
                  "arbiterOnly" : true
              }
          ]
      }
  - pre: |
      Optionally, connect to the MongoDB instances running on port ``27018``
      the other two servers and verify that **server 3** has the
      ``SECONDARY>`` prompt and **server 1** has the ``ARBITER>`` prompt.
