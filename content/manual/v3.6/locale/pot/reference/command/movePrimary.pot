msgid "In a :term:`sharded cluster`, :dbcommand:`movePrimary` reassigns the :term:`primary shard` which holds all un-sharded collections in the database.  :dbcommand:`movePrimary` first changes the primary shard in the cluster metadata, and then migrates all un-sharded collections to the specified :term:`shard`. Use the command with the following form:"

msgid "If you use the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command to move un-sharded collections, you must either restart all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, or use the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command on all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances before reading or writing any data to any unsharded collections that were moved. This action ensures that the :binary:`~bin.mongos` is aware of the new shard for these collections."

msgid "If you do not update the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances' metadata cache after using :dbcommand:`movePrimary`, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` may miss data on reads, and may not write data to the correct shard. To recover, you must manually intervene."
