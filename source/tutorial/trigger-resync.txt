|mms| Automation to resynchronize data stored on MongoDB nodes in
clusters.

Considerations
--------------

- You can only resync :term:`secondary` nodes.

  A node might become the primary between when triggering a resync and
  executing the resync. If that's the case, the {+mdbagent+} waits for
  you to connect to the node manually and execute the
  :method:`rs.stepDown` command.

- You can only schedule one node in any given replica set to resync at
  a given time. The option in the dropdown grays out for other nodes.
