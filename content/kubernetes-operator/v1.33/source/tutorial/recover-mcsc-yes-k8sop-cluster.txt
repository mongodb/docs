If one of your |k8s| clusters fails, but your operator cluster is available, 
and each of your MongoDB shard's replica sets and config server replica sets 
maintain a voting majority, you can use the |k8s-op-short| to reconfigure 
deployments of the |sharded-cluster|.

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Remove the failed cluster from the ``mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list``.
    
      1. When a member cluster is no longer operational, you must remove 
         it from the ``mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list`` configmap containing 
         the list of member clusters the |k8s-op-short| is managing. 
      
      2. When you update the config map, the |k8s-op-short| restarts.
    
      3. After the |k8s-op-short| restarts, without the failed member cluster in its 
         configuration, the |multi-cluster| custom resource referencing this 
         failed cluster in its ``clusterSpecList`` reconciles correctly. 
         
         Even though the failed member cluster is still referenced in the ``clusterSpecList``,
         it is ignored during the reconciliation (other clusters are be reconciled 
         normally). However, the failed memeber's processes are not removed from |onprem|. 
         Instead, they are ignored and shown in the |onprem| UI as being in a down/stale state.

   .. step:: Manually scale down the replica set members in the failed cluster.
    
      In order to reconfigure the deployment, you must first manually 
      scale down the replica set members deployed in the failed member clusters 
      to ``0``. To do so, you can either remove the whole cluster element from ``clusterSpecList`` element 
      or specify its ``members`` count to ``0``.

      .. note:: 
    
         Sometimes it is not possible to correctly reconfigure the deployment 
         when there are non-operational members of replica sets. In such a case, 
         you must remove the failed processes first from both the shard and config 
         server replica sets.

   .. step:: Reconfigure the deployment to its original state.
    
      After you've scaled the failed ``members`` counts to ``0``, you can 
      reconfigure the deployment to its original size by adding members on 
      healthy |k8s| clusters or by adding entirely new clusters as well.
