Accumulators (in Other Stages)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operators that are available as accumulators for the
:pipeline:`$group` stage are also available for use in other stages but
not as accumulators. When used in these other stages, these operators
do not maintain their state and can take as input either a single
argument or multiple arguments. For details, refer to the specific
operator page.

Variable Expression Operators
