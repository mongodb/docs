{+rel-mig+} is a free tool to help you migrate from a relational database to MongoDB.
This page provides an overview of {+rel-mig+}'s :ref:`key features <rm-key-features>`, 
:ref:`use cases <rm-use-cases>`, :ref:`migration scenarios <rm-migration-scenarios>`, 
and :ref:`supported databases and versions<supported-databases>`.

.. _rm-key-features:

Key Features
------------

Map and Model Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+rel-mig+} provides an entity-relationship diagram builder to map your 
relational schema to a MongoDB schema. You can start with a recommended schema,
a 1:1 mapping, or create a new schema from scratch. For more information, 
see :ref:`<rm-mapping-rules>`.


Generate Application Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+rel-mig+} generates MongoDB-compatible JSON application code for entity classes, 
persistence layers, and APIs.

Code generation templates support JSON output. For more information, see 
:ref:`<rm-code-generation-templates>`.

Migrate to MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use {+rel-mig+} to migrate snapshot data from :ref:`supported relational databases <supported-databases>` 
to MongoDB Atlas or a self-managed MongoDB deployment. For more information, see :ref:`<rm-use-cases>`.

.. _rm-use-cases:

Use Cases
---------

{+rel-mig+} is only compatible with Snapshot migration jobs.

Snapshot migration jobs migrate all data once, and then stop. You can 
use snapshot migrations for point-in-time database migrations,
batch migrations, and incremental syncs. You can also use them with 
:ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>` to split large migration jobs 
into parallel batches to improve performance. 

.. _rm-migration-scenarios:

Migration Scenarios
-------------------

You can use {+rel-mig+} to migrate one legacy application at a
time to MongoDB. Depending on your application's needs, you can migrate
either with or without downtime.

Migrate During Scheduled Downtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application does not require constant uptime, such as in the
case of an internal application, you can have the migration occur during
scheduled downtime. Migrating during downtime is the easiest way to
configure and complete the migration process.

When you start the migration process, {+rel-mig+} takes a
snapshot of the data on the legacy application and migrates the data
from that point in time. During the migration process, your legacy
application can remain online to support incoming reads, but cannot
support incoming writes. The length of the migration process depends on
several factors, such as the amount of data being migrated and your
connection speed.

After the migration completes, take your legacy application offline and
launch your new application.

Unsupported Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+rel-mig+} currently does not support migrating an operational
data store.
