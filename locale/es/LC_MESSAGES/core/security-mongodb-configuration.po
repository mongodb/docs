"Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and "
":binary:`~bin.mongos`, bind to ``localhost`` by default. From MongoDB "
"versions 2.6 to 3.4, only the binaries from the official MongoDB RPM (Red"
" Hat, CentOS, Fedora Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and"
" derivatives) packages would bind to ``localhost`` by default. To learn "

"Before binding to a non-localhost (e.g. publicly accessible) IP address, "
"ensure you have secured your cluster from unauthorized access. For a "

"<checklist-auth>` and :doc:`hardening network infrastructure </core"
