Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow
you to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the
transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction returns an
error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards all data changes
before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you intend to run sequentially. 
Sessions enable causal consistency for a group of operations in an  **ACID-compliant**  transaction, which is a 
transaction that meets an expectation of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB
guarantees that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} does not support running parallel operations within a single transaction.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a ``mongocxx::client`` instance.
Then, you can use the resulting ``mongocxx::client_session`` instance to perform transactions. 
We recommend that you reuse your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
instantiating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``mongocxx::client_session`` only with the ``mongocxx::client`` that created it. 
   Using a ``client_session`` with a different ``client`` results in operation errors.

.. important::
   
   Instances of ``mongocxx::client`` are not thread-safe. 
   Each ``mongoxcc::client`` instance and its child instances, including ``mongocxx::client_session``, should be used by a single thread at a time. 
   To learn more, see the :ref:`Thread and Fork Safety <cpp-thread-safety>` guide.

Transaction APIs
----------------

The {+driver-long+} provides a callback API and a core API to manage the transaction lifestyle. 
Before you begin a transaction, you must call the ``start_session()`` method to instantiate a ``mongocxx::client_session``. 
Then, you can use either of the following APIs to perform a transaction:

- :ref:`Callback API <cpp-callback-api>`: High-level API that manages the life cycle of the transaction and automatically incorporates error handling logic.
- :ref:`Core API <cpp-core-api>`: Low-level API that allows you to manage the life cycle of the transaction and implement custom error handling logic. 

.. tip:: 

   To learn more about error handling, see the :manual:`Transaction Error Handling </core/transactions-in-applications/#transaction-error-handling>` section in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _cpp-callback-api: 

Callback API 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the callback API to allow the {+driver-long+} to manage the life cycle of your transaction. 
To implement this API, call the ``with_transaction()`` method on your ``mongocxx::client_session`` and pass in a 
callback function specifying the sequence of operations you want to run. The ``with_transaction()`` method starts a transaction, executes the callback function, and
either commits your transaction or ends the transaction if it encounters an error. If your transaction encounters a ``TransientTransactionError`` or ``UnknownTransactionCommitResult`` error, the 
``with_transaction()`` method reruns the transaction.  

The following code uses the callback API to perform a transaction that inserts documents into the ``movies`` and ``comments`` collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database. 
This code performs the following actions: 

1. Starts a session from the client using the ``start_session()`` method.
#. Defines a callback function that specifies the operations to perform during the transaction.
#. Creates an option object to prepare to set the write concern for the transaction operations.
   To learn more about read and write semantics, see the :manual:`Read Concern/Write Concern/Read Preference </core/transactions/#read-concern-write-concern-read-preference>`
   section in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 
#. Calls the ``with_transaction()`` method to manage the transaction, passing the callback function and option object as arguments.

.. _cpp-core-api: 

Core API 
~~~~~~~~

Use the core API to manage the life cycle of your transaction. To implement this API, you must make explicit calls to methods in the ``mongocxx::client_session`` interface 
to start a transaction, commit an active transaction, and end a transaction if an error occurs. The core API doesn't automatically incorporate error handling logic, 
and instead allows you to implement custom handling logic for errors including ``TransientTransactionError`` and ``UnknownTransactionCommitResult``. 

The following table describes the core API methods provided by the ``mongocxx::client_session`` interface:  

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``start_transaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction on the current client session. Accepts an optional ``mongocxx::options::transaction`` 
         instance as an argument to set options. For a full list of options, see `mongocxx::options::transaction <{+api+}/classmongocxx_1_1v__noabi_1_1options_1_1transaction.html>`__
         in the API documentation.
       |
       | Raises an exception if the options are misconfigured, if there are network or other transient failures, or if there 
         are other errors such as a session with a transaction already in progress. If an error is returned with the ``TransientTransactionError`` label, 
         you can end the transaction and then retry it with the expectation that it will succeed. 
       |
       | To learn more about this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction()
         </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``commit_transaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction on the current client session.
       |
       | Raises an exception if options are misconfigured, if there are network or other transient failures,
         or if there are other errors such as a session with no transaction in progress. If an error is returned with the ``UnknownTransactionCommitResult`` label,
         you can end the transaction and then retry it with the expectation that it will succeed when the committed transaction satisfies the set write concern. 
       |
       | To learn more about this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction()
         </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 

   * - ``abort_transaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction on the current client session. 
       |
       | Raises an exception if the options are misconfigured or if there are other errors such as 
         a session with no transaction in progress.
       |
       | To learn more about this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction()
         </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. tip:: 
   
   The ``mongocxx::client_session`` class also provides methods to retrieve and modify session properties.
   To learn more, see `mongocxx::client_session <{+api+}/classmongocxx_1_1v__noabi_1_1client__session.html>`__ in the API documentation. 

The following code uses the core API to perform a transaction that inserts documents into the ``movies`` and ``comments`` collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database. 
This code performs the following actions: 

1. Starts a session from the client using the ``start_session()`` method.
#. Creates an option object to prepare to set the write concern for the transaction operations.
   To learn more about read and write semantics, see the :manual:`Read Concern/Write Concern/Read Preference </core/transactions/#read-concern-write-concern-read-preference>`
   section in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 
#. Calls the ``start_transaction()`` method to start a transaction, passing in the option object as an argument.
#. Runs operations to insert documents into collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database, passing the active 
   session to each operation.
   If an operation encounters an error, the whole transaction is aborted. If the error has the label ``TransientTransactionError``,
   the transaction is retried. 
#. Commits the active transaction using the ``commit_transaction()`` method. If the commit encounters an error with the label ``UnknownTransactionCommitResult``, the commit is retried.
