Solution Overview
------------------

In the rapidly transforming fintech sector, financial services providers 
require several application features that address evolving customer needs
and meet the following requirements:

- Process high-volume real-time transactions
- Map complex data relationships across customer profiles, financial 
  instruments, and privacy requirements
- Meet regulatory compliance requirements with geographical data residency 
  constraints
- Adapt to volume spikes and new product offerings with scalable systems
- Provide real-time analytics for risk assessment and fraud detection

To address these challenges, this solution uses Hasura and MongoDB to build
a modern fintech application with the following tools: 

- **Hasura Data Delivery Network**: Hasura :abbr:`DDN (Data Delivery Network)` provides 
  a data access layer for advanced applications and AI. You can use Hasura 
  DDN to build and deploy a secure, federated API layer on your data.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas' </>` document model, horizontal 
  scalability through sharding, and performance optimizations provide security 
  and reliability in your financial applications.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This reference architecture enables you to build fintech applications that 
handle high transaction volumes while maintaining data integrity, security, 
and regulatory compliance.

The following diagram shows the multi-regional deployment of Hasura DDN
with MongoDB clusters: 

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/hasura-fintech-architecture.png
    :alt: Hasura DDN with MongoDB architecture diagram

    Figure 1. Hasura DDN with MongoDB architecture diagram

In this diagram, client applications connect through a global load balancer 
to multiple Hasura DDN regions, which interact with MongoDB Atlas 
clusters across multiple geographic locations. The architecture also 
incorporates centralized authentication and access control, AI and analytics capabilities,
global compliance, security measures, and integration with external financial services.

The following layers make up the key components of this solution's architecture: 

- **Data layer:** MongoDB Atlas clusters for primary data storage
- **API and access layer:** Hasura DDN for data access and real-time subscriptions
- **Application layer:** Fintech services and applications
- **Security layer:** Authentication and authorization services
- **Analytics layer:** Data processing and |ml| services

Data Model Approach
-------------------

MongoDB's document-based structure addresses the unique requirements of 
financial applications. The flexible schema design allows organizations to 
adapt quickly to new financial products or regulatory requirements without 
disruptive schema migrations.

The following example shows a customer document with embedded account 
information:

.. code-block:: javascript
  
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("5f8a7b2b9d3b2e5a7c8b4567"),
    "customerId": "C10045678",
    "customerInfo": {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "contactDetails": {
        "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
        "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
        // PII fields can utilize MongoDB's field-level encryption
      },
      "kycStatus": "verified",
      "riskProfile": "moderate"
    },
    "accounts": [
      {
        "accountId": "A200387645",
        "accountType": "savings",
        "balance": 45678.92,
        "currency": "USD",
        "status": "active",
        "createdDate": ISODate("2022-03-15T10:30:00Z")
      },
      {
        "accountId": "A200456789",
        "accountType": "investment",
        "balance": 125000.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "status": "active",
        "createdDate": ISODate("2022-08-22T14:45:00Z")
      }
    ]
  }

This example document demonstrates the following MongoDB capabilities:

- Support sharding strategies for high-volume data by customer ID or date ranges 
  for time-series transaction data
- Provide storage optimization for performance
- Grant role-based access control and field-level security

Build the Solution
------------------

This architecture focuses on security, performance, and scalability. The 
MongoDB data layer interacts with the Hasura DDN API layer while addressing 
authentication, security policies, and compliance requirements.

Deployment Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy this solution in multiple geographic regions to support global 
financial operations:

- Configure MongoDB for high availability using replica sets.
- Use appropriate sharding strategies based on financial data access 
  patterns.
- Position Hasura DDN instances close to their respective MongoDB clusters 
  to minimize latency for real-time financial transactions and market data 
  updates.

The centralized authentication and access control layer ensures consistent 
policy enforcement across all regions. The AI and analytics layer enables 
fraud detection and risk assessment.

Implementation Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use an incremental approach when implementing this architecture:

1. Start with specific financial use cases like trading platforms or 
   personalized banking.
#. Expand to cover more complex scenarios.

This solution accommodates new fintech startups building from scratch and 
established financial institutions transitioning from legacy systems through 
an API-first modernization approach.

.. note::

  To learn how to implement anti-money laundering solutions using this architecture,
  see the `Axiom repository <https://github.com/hasura/axiom?tab=readme-ov-file#-aml-demo-in-action>`__.

  While the API querying functionality works as documented, the Axiom repository 
  does not cover the additional steps necessary to set up PromptQL locally. Use the
  `PromptQL playground <https://promptql.console.hasura.io/public/aml/playground>`__
  to test queries online.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **Distributed architecture improves performance:** MongoDB's distributed 
  clusters with Hasura DDN's regional deployment achieve microsecond-level 
  latency for trading platforms and high-frequency transactions while 
  maintaining data consistency globally.

- **Multi-layered security protects applications:** A multi-layered strategy 
  combines centralized and decentralized security. Hasura's permission systems and 
  MongoDB's field-level security provide protection while maintaining 
  flexibility for regulatory requirements like GDPR, PSD2, and MiFID II.

- **Flexible data models enable innovation:** MongoDB's schema flexibility 
  with Hasura's GraphQL API generation allows fintech organizations to 
  deploy new offerings without extensive redevelopment.

- **Real-time capabilities enhance customer experiences:** This architecture 
  supports real-time data subscriptions and complex relationship mapping 
  for personalized banking, fraud detection, and risk assessment using 
  complete customer data views.

- **Incremental modernization reduces risk:** The API-first approach allows 
  organizations to transition from legacy systems by creating a modern data 
  access layer while maintaining existing data sources.
