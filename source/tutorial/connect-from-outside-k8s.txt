The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed by |k8s| from outside of the |k8s| cluster.

.. important::
   
   You can only connect to a :doc:`standalone
   </tutorial/deploy-standalone>` or a :doc:`sharded cluster
   </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>` resource from outside of the
   |k8s| cluster.

Procedure
---------

To connect to a MongoDB resource deployed by |k8s| from outside of
the |k8s| cluster, you must set the resource's
:setting:`spec.exposedExternally` flag to ``true``.

When this flag is set to ``true``, the |k8s-op-short| creates a
`NodePort service
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/>`__.
The NodePort service exposes the deployment as a network service,
thereby enabling access from outside of the |k8s| cluster.

Example Deployment Configurations
---------------------------------

.. tabs-deployments::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: standalone

      The following example standalone configuration object exposes
      the deployment outside of the |k8s| cluster by setting
      ``spec.exposedExternally`` to ``true``:

      .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-exposed-standalone.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 15
  
      Once your standalone instance is deployed in |com|, run the
      following command to get information on the NodePort service
      created by the Operator:

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl get services -n <namespace>

      The list output by this command should contain an entry
      similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

         standalone-svc-external   NodePort    10.102.27.116   <none>        27017:30994/TCP   8m30s

      In this case, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is exposed on port
      ``27017`` in the |k8s| container, and the NodePort service
      exposes the ``mongod`` via port ``30994``.
      
      When you connect to your deployment, you must specify the external
      :abbr:`DNS (Domain Name System)` of a node in the |k8s| cluster as
      the ``--host`` option in your ``mongo`` command. If a node in the
      |k8s| cluster has an external DNS of
      ``ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com``, you
      can connect to this standalone instance from outside of |k8s|
      using the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --port 30994

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/fact-get-external-dns.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      The following example sharded cluster configuration object exposes
      the deployment outside of the |k8s| cluster by setting
      ``spec.exposedExternally`` to ``true``:

      .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-exposed-sharded.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 19

      Once your sharded cluster is deployed in |com|, run the
      following command to get information on the NodePort service
      created by the Operator:

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl get services -n <namespace>

      The list output by this command should contain an entry
      similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

         shardedcluster-svc-external   NodePort    10.106.44.30    <none>        27017:30078/TCP   10s

      In this case, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` is exposed on port
      ``27017`` in the |k8s| container, and the NodePort service
      exposes the ``mongos`` via port ``30078``.

      When you connect to your deployment, you must specify the external
      :abbr:`DNS (Domain Name System)` of a node in the |k8s| cluster as
      the ``--host`` option in your ``mongo`` command. If a node in the
      |k8s| cluster has an external DNS of
      ``ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com``, you
      can connect to this standalone instance from outside of |k8s|
      using the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --port 30078

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/fact-get-external-dns.rst
