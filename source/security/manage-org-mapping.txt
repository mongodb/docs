When you map organizations to your Identity Provider, |service| grants
users who authenticate through the |idp| membership in the selected
organizations. You can give these users a default
:ref:`role <organization-roles>` in the mapped organizations.
Organization mapping lets you configure a single |idp| to grant users
access to multiple |service| organizations.

You can apply the same |idp| to multiple organizations. You can
assign each organization a single |idp|.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have already linked an |idp| to
|service| and mapped one or more domains to that |idp|.
For instructions on these procedures, see:

- :ref:`atlas-manage-fed-auth`
- :ref:`atlas-manage-fed-domain-map`

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-fed-management-access.rst

Map an Organization to your Identity Provider
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-organization-mapping.rst

Select a Default User Role for the Organization
-----------------------------------------------

You can have |service| grant users who authenticate through the |idp| a
default :ref:`role <organization-roles>` in a mapped organization. You
can select different roles for different organizations.

.. note::

   The selected role only applies to users who authenticate through the
   |idp| if they do not already have a :ref:`role <organization-roles>`
   in the organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/org-mapping-default-role.rst

Change an Organization's Mapped Identity Provider
-------------------------------------------------

Reconfigure your |idp| to change the organizations to which it's mapped.

.. include:: /includes/steps/change-org-mapped-idp.rst

Disconnect an Organization from the Federation Application
----------------------------------------------------------

When you disconnect an organization from the Federation Application,
|service| no longer grants membership or a default
:ref:`organization role <organization-roles>` to users who authenticate
through the |idp|.

From the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console`:
