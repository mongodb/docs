.. dbcommand:: removeShard

   Starts the process of removing a shard from a :term:`cluster
   <sharded cluster>`. This
   is a multi-stage process. Begin by issuing the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { removeShard : "[shardName]" }

   The balancer will then migrate chunks from the shard specified by
   ``[shardName]``. This process happens slowly to avoid placing
   undue load on the overall cluster.

   The command returns immediately, with the following message:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg : "draining started successfully" , state: "started" , shard: "shardName" , ok : 1 }

   If you run the command again, you'll see the following progress
   output:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg: "draining ongoing" , state: "ongoing" , remaining: { chunks: 23 , dbs: 1 }, ok: 1 }

   The ``remaining`` :term:`document` specifies how many chunks and
   databases remain on the shard. Use :method:`db.printShardingStatus()`
   to list the databases that you must move from the shard.

   Each database in a sharded cluster has a primary shard. If the
   shard you want to remove is also the primary of one of the cluster's
   databases, then you must manually move the database to a new
   shard. This can be only after the shard is empty. See the
   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command for details.

   After removing all chunks and databases from the shard, you
   may issue the command again, to return:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg: "remove shard completed successfully", state: "completed", host: "shardName", ok : 1 }
