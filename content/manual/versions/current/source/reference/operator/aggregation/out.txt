.. pipeline:: $out

   Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes
   them to a specified collection. You can specify the output database.

   The ``$out`` stage must be *the last stage* in the
   pipeline. The ``$out`` operator lets the aggregation
   framework return result sets of any size.

   .. warning::

      If the collection specified by the ``$out`` operation already
      exists, then the ``$out`` stage atomically replaces the existing
      collection with the new results collection upon completion of the
      aggregation. See :ref:`replace-existing-collection` for details.

Syntax
------

The ``$out`` stage has the following syntax:

- ``$out`` can take a string to specify only the output
  collection (i.e. output to a collection in the same database):

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { $out: "<output-collection>" } // Output collection is in the same database

- ``$out`` can take a document to specify the output database as well as the 
  output collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { $out: { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>" } }

- Starting in MongoDB 7.0.3 and 7.1, ``$out`` can take a document to
  output to a :ref:`time series collection<manual-timeseries-landing>`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    { $out: 
      { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>",
        timeseries: {
          timeField: "<field-name>", 
          metaField: "<field-name>", 
          granularity:  "seconds" || "minutes" || "hours" ,
        } 
      } 
    }

  .. important:: Changing Time Series Granularity

      After creating a time series collection, you can modify its
      granularity using the :dbcommand:`collMod` method. However,
      you can only increase the timespan covered by each bucket. You
      cannot decrease it.

   - You cannot specify a sharded collection as the output
     collection. The input collection for a pipeline can be sharded.
     To output to a sharded collection, see :pipeline:`$merge`.
   - The ``$out`` operator cannot write results to a
     :ref:`capped collection <manual-capped-collection>`.
   - If you modify a collection with an :atlas:`Atlas Search
     </atlas-search>` index, you must first delete and then re-create
     the search index. Consider using :pipeline:`$merge` instead.


.. _out-merge-comparison:
   
Comparison with ``$merge``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides two stages, :pipeline:`$merge` and ``$out``, for
writing the results of the aggregation pipeline to a collection. The
following summarizes the capabilities of the two stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``$out``
     - :pipeline:`$merge`
   * - - Can output to a collection in the same or different database.
     - - Can output to a collection in the same or different database.
   * - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.
     - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.
   * - - Replaces the output collection completely if it already exists.
     - - Can incorporate results (insert new documents, merge
         documents, replace documents, keep existing documents, fail
         the operation, process documents with a custom update pipeline) into
         an existing collection.

         Can replace the content of the collection but only if the
         aggregation results contain a match for all existing
         documents in the collection.
   * - - Cannot output to a sharded collection. Input collection,
         however, can be sharded.
     - - Can output to a sharded collection. Input collection can
         also be sharded.
   * - - Starting in MongoDB 7.0.3 and 7.1, can output to a time series 
         collection.
     - - Cannot output to a time series collection.
   * - - Corresponds to the SQL statements:

         - .. code-block:: sql
              :copyable: false

              INSERT INTO T2 SELECT * FROM T1

         - .. code-block:: sql
              :copyable: false

              SELECT * INTO T2 FROM T1

     - - Corresponds to the SQL statement:

         -  .. code-block:: sql
               :copyable: false

               MERGE T2 AS TARGET
               USING (SELECT * FROM T1) AS SOURCE
               ON MATCH (T2.ID = SOURCE.ID)
               WHEN MATCHED THEN
                 UPDATE SET TARGET.FIELDX = SOURCE.FIELDY
               WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
                 INSERT (FIELDX)
                 VALUES (SOURCE.FIELDY)

Behaviors
---------

$out Read Operations Run on Secondary Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, ``$out`` can run on 
replica set secondary nodes if all the nodes in
cluster have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` set 
to ``5.0`` or higher and the :doc:`/core/read-preference` is set to 
secondary.

Read operations of the ``$out`` statement occur on the 
secondary nodes, while the write operations occur only on the 
primary nodes.

Not all driver versions support targeting of ``$out`` 
operations to replica set secondary nodes. Check your 
:driver:`driver </>` documentation to see when your driver added
support for ``$out`` running on a secondary.

Create New Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$out`` operation creates a new collection if one does not
already exist.

The collection is not visible until the aggregation completes. If the
aggregation fails, MongoDB does not create the collection.

.. _replace-existing-collection:

Replace Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the collection specified by the ``$out`` operation already
exists, then upon completion of the aggregation, the ``$out``
stage atomically replaces the existing collection with the new results
collection. Specifically, the ``$out`` operation:

#. Creates a temp collection.
#. Copies the indexes from the existing collection to the temp collection.
#. Inserts the documents into the temp collection.
#. Calls the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command with ``dropTarget: true``
   to rename the temp collection to the destination collection.

If specified collection exists and the ``$out`` operation specifies
``timeseries`` options, then the following restrictions apply:

#. The existing collection must be a time series collection.
#. The existing collection must not be a view.
#. The ``timeseries`` options included in the ``$out`` stage must
   exactly match those on the existing collection.

The ``$out`` operation does not change any indexes that existed on the
previous collection. If the aggregation fails, the ``$out`` operation
makes no changes to the pre-existing collection.

Schema Validation Errors
````````````````````````

If your ``coll`` collection uses :ref:`schema validation
<schema-validation-overview>` and has ``validationAction`` set to 
``error``, inserting an invalid document with ``$out`` throws an 
error. The ``$out`` operation makes no changes to the pre-existing 
collection and documents returned by the aggregation pipeline are not
added to the ``coll`` collection.

Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline will fail to complete if the documents produced by the
pipeline would violate any unique indexes, including the index on the
``_id`` field of the original output collection.

If the ``$out`` operation modifies a collection with an
:atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` index, you must delete and
re-create the search index. Consider using :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

``majority`` Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-aggregate-readConcern.rst

Interaction with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongodump` started with :option:`--oplog
<mongodump.--oplog>` fails if a client issues an aggregation pipeline
that includes ``$out`` during the dump process. See
:option:`mongodump --oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` for more information.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Restrictions
     - Description

   * - :ref:`transactions <transactions>`

     - An aggregation pipeline cannot use ``$out`` inside
       :ref:`transactions <transactions>`.

   * - :ref:`view definition <views-landing-page>`

     - The ``$out`` stage is not allowed as part of a
       view definition. If the view definition includes nested pipeline 
       (e.g. the view definition includes :pipeline:`$lookup` or 
       :pipeline:`$facet` stage), this ``$out`` stage 
       restriction applies to the nested pipelines as well.

   * - :pipeline:`$lookup` stage

     - You can't include the ``$out`` stage in the :pipeline:`$lookup`
       stage's :ref:`nested pipeline <lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>`.

   * - :pipeline:`$facet` stage

     - :pipeline:`$facet` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
       <lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>` cannot include the
       ``$out`` stage.

   * - :pipeline:`$unionWith` stage

     - :pipeline:`$unionWith` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
       <unionWith-pipeline>` cannot include the ``$out`` stage.

   * - :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern

     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-out-linearizable.rst

Examples
--------

In the ``test`` database, create a collection ``books`` with the
following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 },
      { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 },
      { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   ])

If the ``test`` database does not already exist, the insert operation
creates the database as well as the ``books`` collection.

Output to Same Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection in the ``test`` database to have titles grouped by authors and then writes
the results to the ``authors`` collection, also in the ``test`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.aggregate( [
       { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
       { $out : "authors" }
   ] )

First Stage (``$group``):
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the ``authors`` and uses
   :group:`$push` to add the titles to a ``books`` array field:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
      { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }

Second Stage (``$out``):
   The ``$out`` stage outputs the documents to the ``authors``
   collection in the ``test`` database.

To view the documents in the output collection, run the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").authors.find()

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }

Output to a Different Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   For a :ref:`replica set <replica-set>` or a standalone, if the
   output database does not exist, ``$out`` also creates
   the database.


``$out`` can output to a collection in a database different from where the 
aggregation is run.

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection to have titles grouped by authors and then writes the
results to the ``authors`` collection in the ``reporting`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.aggregate( [
       { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
       { $out : { db: "reporting", coll: "authors" } }
   ] )

First Stage (``$group``):
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the ``authors`` and uses
   :group:`$push` to add the titles to a ``books`` array field:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
      { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }

Second Stage (``$out``):
   The ``$out`` stage outputs the documents to the ``authors``
   collection in the ``reporting`` database.

To view the documents in the output collection, run the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("reporting").authors.find()

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
