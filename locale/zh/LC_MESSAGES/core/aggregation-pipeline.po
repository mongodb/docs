"The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the "
"concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline"
" that transforms the documents into an aggregated results."

"The aggregation pipeline provides an alternative to :term:`map-reduce` and "
"may be the preferred solution for aggregation tasks where the complexity of "
"map-reduce may be unwarranted."

"Aggregation pipeline have some limitations on value types and result size. "

"The MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of :ref:`stages <aggregation-"
"pipeline-operator-reference>`. Each stage transforms the documents as they "
"pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output"
" document for every input document; e.g., some stages may generate new "
"documents or filter out documents. Pipeline stages can appear multiple times"
" in the pipeline."

"MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method in the "
":program:`mongo` shell and the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command for "
"aggregation pipeline. See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference` for"
" the available stages."

"Some pipeline stages takes a pipeline expression as its operand. Pipeline "
"expressions specify the transformation to apply to the input documents. "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:56
msgid ""
"Pipeline expressions can only operate on the current document in the "
"pipeline and cannot refer to data from other documents: expression "
"operations provide in-memory transformation of documents."

"Generally, expressions are stateless and are only evaluated when seen by the"
" aggregation process with one exception: :ref:`accumulator <aggregation-"

"The accumulators, used with the :pipeline:`$group` pipeline operator, "

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:76
msgid ""
"In MongoDB, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command operates on a single "
"collection, logically passing the *entire* collection into the aggregation "
"pipeline. To optimize the operation, wherever possible, use the following "
"strategies to avoid scanning the entire collection."

"The :pipeline:`$match` and :pipeline:`$sort` pipeline operators can take "

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:90
msgid ""
"The :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator takes advantage of a geospatial "
"index. When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, the :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline "
"operation must appear as the first stage in an aggregation pipeline."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:96
msgid ""
"Even when the pipeline uses an index, aggregation still requires access to "
"the actual documents; i.e. indexes cannot fully cover an aggregation "
"pipeline."

"In previous versions, for very select use cases, an index could cover a "

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:107
msgid ""
"If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the data in a "
"collection, use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and "
":pipeline:`$skip` stages to restrict the documents that enter at the "
"beginning of the pipeline. When placed at the beginning of a pipeline, "
":pipeline:`$match` operations use suitable indexes to scan only the matching"
" documents in a collection."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:114
msgid ""
"Placing a :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage followed by a :pipeline:`$sort` "
"stage at the start of the pipeline is logically equivalent to a single query"
" with a sort and can use an index. When possible, place :pipeline:`$match` "
"operators at the beginning of the pipeline."
