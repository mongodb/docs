You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to process your data by building
:manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>`.
Aggregation pipelines transform your documents into aggregated results
based on selected
:manual:`pipeline stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>`.

The |service| aggregation pipeline builder is primarily designed for
building pipelines, rather than executing them. The pipeline builder
provides an easy way to :ref:`export your pipeline <export-pipeline>`
to execute in a :driver:`driver </>`.

Required Roles
--------------

To create and execute aggregation pipelines in the
{+atlas-ui+}, you must have the 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only` role or higher.

To utilize the :pipeline:`$out` stage in your pipeline, you must
have the :authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write` role.

Collation
~~~~~~~~~

Use :manual:`collation </reference/collation/>` to specify
language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase and accent marks.

To specify a collation document, click :guilabel:`Collation` at
the top of the pipeline builder.

A collation document has the following fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      locale: <string>,
      caseLevel: <boolean>,
      caseFirst: <string>,
      strength: <int>,
      numericOrdering: <boolean>,
      alternate: <string>,
      maxVariable: <string>,
      backwards: <boolean>
   }

The ``locale`` field is mandatory; all other collation fields are
optional. For descriptions of the fields, see
:manual:`Collation Document
</reference/collation/#collation-document-fields>`.

Import an Aggregation Pipeline from Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can import aggregation pipelines from plain text into the
pipeline builder to easily modify and verify your pipelines.

To import a pipeline from plain text:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-pipeline-import.rst

Reset Your Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return your pipeline to the initial blank state, click the plus icon
at the top of the pipeline builder.

.. _export-pipeline:

Export an Aggregation Pipeline to Driver Language
-------------------------------------------------

You can use the aggregation pipeline builder to export your finished
pipeline to one of the supported :driver:`driver languages </>`; Java,
Node, C#, and Python 3. Use this feature to format and export pipelines
for use in your applications.

To export your aggregation pipeline:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-pipeline-export.rst

.. _pipeline-settings:

Aggregation Pipeline Settings
-----------------------------

To modify the aggregation pipeline builder settings:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-pipeline-settings.rst
