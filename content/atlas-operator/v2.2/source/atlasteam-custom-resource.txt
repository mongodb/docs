The ``AtlasTeam`` custom resource defines a :ref:`team <manage-teams>` of |service| 
users. 
To give this team access to one or more projects, you must reference the 
``AtlasTeam`` custom resource from the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` and 
configure access roles for the team.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-crds.rst

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service| 
:oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Teams API Resource <teams>`:
   
- Creates a new team.

Example
-------

The following example shows an ``AtlasTeam`` custom resource
that defines the ``green-leaf-team``, comprised of four users. This custom 
resource must be referenced from the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` before 
this team can access an |service| project:

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasTeam
   metadata:
     name: green-leaf-team
   spec:
     name: "greenLeafTeam"
     usernames:
       - "atlas.user1@example.com"
       - "atlas.user2@example.com"
       - "atlas.user3@example.com"
