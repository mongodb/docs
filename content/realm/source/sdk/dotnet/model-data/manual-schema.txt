Manually Define a Schema - .NET SDK
===================================

When Realm processes Realm objects, it 
generates a schema for each class based on the class properties. 
However, there may be times that you want to manually define the schema, 
and the .NET SDK provides a mechanism for doing so.

Use the Schema Property
-----------------------
You use the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Schema <reference/Realms.RealmConfigurationBase.html#Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_Schema>` 
property of the 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmConfigurationBase <reference/Realms.RealmConfigurationBase.html>` 
object to control how schemas are defined. The following code example shows three 
ways to do this, from easiest to most complex: automatic configuration, manual 
configuration, and a mix of both methods.
