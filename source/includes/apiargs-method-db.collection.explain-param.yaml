arg_name: param
description: |
  Specifies the verbosity mode for the explain output. The mode affects
  the behavior of ``explain()`` and determines the amount of information
  to return. The possible modes are: ``"queryPlanner"``,
  ``"executionStats"``, and ``"allPlansExecution"``.

  Default mode is ``"queryPlanner"``.

  For backwards compatibility with earlier versions of
  :method:`cursor.explain()`, MongoDB interprets ``true`` as
  ``"allPlansExecution"`` and ``false`` as ``"queryPlanner"``.
  
  For more information on the modes, see
  :ref:`explain-method-verbosity`.
