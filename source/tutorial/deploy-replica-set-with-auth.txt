Deploy Replica Set and Configure Authentication and Authorization
=================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With :doc:`authentication </core/authentication>` enabled, MongoDB
forces all clients to identify themselves before granting access to
the server. :doc:`Authorization </core/authorization>`, in turn,
allows administrators to define and limit the resources and operations
that a user can access. Using authentication and authorization is a
key part of a complete security strategy.

All MongoDB deployments support authentication. By default, MongoDB runs
without authentication enabled. You can enable it at anytime, both during
initial deployment or after a system has been deployed.

This tutorial provides a procedure for creating a MongoDB :doc:`replica
set </core/replication-introduction>` that uses the challenge-and-response
authentication mechanism. The tutorial includes creation of a minimal
authorization system to support basic operations.

Considerations
--------------

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication requires an authentication mechanism and in many cases a
:setting:`key file <keyFile>`.

Running with authentication requires that a user administrator exists who
can create any type of user with any level of access required by your
deployment. In the source of this procedure, you will create one user
with this role.

Procedure
---------

This procedure deploys a replica set in which all members use the same key
file.
