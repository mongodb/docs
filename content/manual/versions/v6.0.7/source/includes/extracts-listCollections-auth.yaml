   To run :dbcommand:`listCollections` when access control is enforced,
   users must, in general, have privileges that grant
   :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database. For example,
   the following privilege grants users to run
   :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` against the ``test`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { resource: { db: "test", collection: "" }, actions: [ "listCollections" ] }

   The built-in role :authrole:`read` provides the privilege to run
   :dbcommand:`listCollections` for a specific database.

   Users without the required privilege
   can run the command with **both** ``authorizedCollections`` and
   ``nameOnly`` options set to ``true``. In this case, the command returns
   just the name and type of the collection(s) to which the user has
   privileges.

   For example, consider a user with a role that grants just the following
   privilege:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { resource: { db: "test", collection: "foo" }, actions: [ "find" ] }

   The user can run the command if the command includes **both**
   ``authorizedCollections`` and ``nameOnly`` options set to ``true``
   (with or without the ``filter`` option):

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1.0, authorizedCollections: true, nameOnly: true } )

   The operation returns the name and type of the ``foo`` collection.

   However, the following operations (with or without the ``filter``
   option) error for the user without the required access:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1.0, authorizedCollections: true } )
      db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1.0, nameOnly: true } )

   The ``mongo`` shell, ``show collections`` is equivalent to:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1.0, authorizedCollections: true, nameOnly: true } )

   - For users with the required access, ``show collections`` lists the
     non-system collections for the database.

   - For users without the required access, ``show collections`` lists
     only the collections for which the users has privileges.

   When a version 4.0 ``mongo`` shell is connected to an
   earlier version MongoDB deployment that does not support
   ``authorizedCollections`` and ``nameOnly`` options, 

   - A user must have the required access to run
     :dbcommand:`listCollections`.

   - If a user does not have required access and runs ``show
     collections``, MongoDB uses the
     :data:`~connectionStatus.authInfo.authenticatedUserPrivileges` field
     returned by :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` to return an approximate
     list of collections for the user.

ref: listCollections-auth-showCollectionNames
content: |

   The :method:`db.getCollectionNames()` is equivalent to:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1.0, authorizedCollections: true, nameOnly: true } )

   - For users with the required access (privileges that grant
     :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database), the method
     lists the names of all collections for the database.

   - For users without the required access, the method lists only the
     collections for which the users has privileges. For example, if a
     user has :authaction:`find` on a specific collection in a
     database, the method would return just that collection.
