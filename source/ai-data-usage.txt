How Your Data is Used

When you use the |copilot| , the following information is sent to
MongoDB's backend, the MongoDB Docs Chatbot, and/or the third party AI
provider: 

- The full text of your natural language prompt.
- The schema of the collection you are using, 
  including database name, collection name, field names, and types. 

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third
