Compass Firewall Requirements
-----------------------------

Certain features of |compass|, such as third-party mapping services and
Intercom, require inbound connections from external sources to
function. In some instances, users have reported issues with their
system firewall blocking these network requests and thereby limiting
|compass| functionalities. To fix this issue, configure your system
firewall to allow incoming connections for |compass|.

.. important::

   Ensure ports ``80`` and ``443`` are open between |compass| and the
   host for the MongoDB Instance to which Compass connects.
