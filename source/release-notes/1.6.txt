=============================
Release Notes for MongoDB 1.6
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Upgrading
---------

MongoDB 1.6 is a drop-in replacement for 1.4. To upgrade, simply
shutdown :program:`mongod` then restart with the new binaries.

*Please note that you should upgrade to the latest version of whichever
driver you're using. Certain drivers, including the Ruby driver, will
require the upgrade, and all the drivers will provide extra features for
connecting to replica sets.*

Sharding
--------

:doc:`/sharding` is now production-ready, making MongoDB horizontally
scalable, with no single point of failure. A single instance of
:program:`mongod` can now be upgraded to a distributed cluster with zero
downtime when the need arises.

- :doc:`/sharding`

- :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-shard-cluster`

- :doc:`/tutorial/convert-replica-set-to-replicated-shard-cluster`

Replica Sets
------------

:doc:`Replica sets </replication>`, which provide automated failover
among a cluster of ``n`` nodes, are also now available.

Please note that replica pairs are now deprecated; we strongly recommend
that replica pair users upgrade to replica sets.

- :doc:`/replication`

- :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`

- :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`

Other Improvements
------------------

- The ``w`` option (and ``wtimeout``) forces writes to be propagated to ``n``
  servers before returning success (this works especially well with
  replica sets)

- :doc:`$or queries </reference/operator/query/or>`

- Improved concurrency

- :doc:`$slice </reference/operator/projection/slice>` operator for returning
  subsets of arrays

- 64 indexes per collection (formerly 40 indexes per collection)

- 64-bit integers can now be represented in the shell using NumberLong

- The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command
  now supports upserts. It also allows you to specify fields to return

- $showDiskLoc option to see disk location of a document

- Support for IPv6 and UNIX domain sockets

Installation
------------

- Windows service improvements

- The C++ client is a separate tarball from the binaries
