Congratulations on completing the Quick Start tutorial for Sinatra!

After you complete these steps, you have a Sinatra web application that
uses {+odm+} to connect to your MongoDB deployment, run a query on
the sample data, and render retrieved results.

.. TODO You can download the completed web application project by cloning the
.. `mongoid-quickstart <>`__
.. GitHub repository.

Learn more about {+odm+} features from the following sections:

- :ref:`mongoid-data-modeling`: Learn how to customize your {+odm+}
  models.

- :ref:`mongoid-interact-data`: Learn how to interact with your MongoDB
  data by using {+odm+} models.
