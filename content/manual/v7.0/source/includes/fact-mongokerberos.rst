After completing the configuration steps, you can validate your
configuration with the :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` tool.

:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` provides a convenient method to verify your 
platform's Kerberos configuration for use with MongoDB, and to test that 
Kerberos authentication from a MongoDB client works as expected. See the 
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` documentation for more information.

:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` is available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
