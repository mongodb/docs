   percent, percentage
     *Percent* can take a singular or a plural verb, depending on the
     quantity being described. If the percentage refers to a singular
     term, use a singular verb. If the percentage refers to a plural
     term, use a plural verb. When a prepositional phrase exists
     between percent and the verb, the form of the verb is determined
     by the nearest noun. When a prepositional phrase doesn't follow
     percent, a singular verb or a plural verb is acceptable.

     Always use a number with *percent*. If you're describing a
     nonspecific quantity, use *percentage*.

     Unless space is restricted, use *percent* rather than %.

   permissions
     In general, you can use *permission* to refer to the ability of
     a particular user to access a particular resource by means of a
     user account or assigned role. A permission is associated with
     an item (as opposed to a whole system), such as a file,
     directory, or printer shared on a network.
