"Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to distribute data of a sharded "
"collection evenly across a :term:`sharded cluster`. When a :term:`shard` "
"has too many of a sharded collection's :term:`chunks <chunk>` compared to"
" other shards, MongoDB automatically balances the chunks across the "
"shards. The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded "
