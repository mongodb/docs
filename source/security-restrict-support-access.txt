As an organization owner, you can set up your |service| organization
so that MongoDB Production Support Employees, including Technical
Service Engineers, can only access your production servers with your
explicit permission. If an issue that requires MongoDB Support arises 
and you want to grant 24-hour temporary infrastructure access to 
MongoDB Support, you can grant access at the {+database-deployments+} 
level. Granting temporary access doesn't give MongoDB Support access to 
read your database, only the underlying infrastructure, which should 
exclude :ref:`sensitive information <sensitive-info>`. You can also 
revoke temporary infrastructure access at any time prior to the 
automatic 24-hour expiration.

      {+app-services+} sync data in a {+database-deployment+} 
      within your organization with the following procedure.

you can do so with the following procedure.

.. important:: 
   
   Temporary infrastructure access that is not revoked will automatically
   expire at the end of 24 hours. |service| displays a timer indicating 
   the amount of time left before 24-hour temporary infrastructure access expires.
