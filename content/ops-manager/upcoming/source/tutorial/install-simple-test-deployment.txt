Install a Simple Test |onprem| Installation
===========================================

.. meta::
   :description: Install and configure a simple test deployment of Ops Manager on a single host for evaluation purposes, without failover or high availability.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. warning::

   This setup is not suitable for a production deployment.

To evaluate |onprem|, you can install the
:ref:`mms-application-package` and
:ref:`mms-application-database` on a single host. This setup provides
all the functionality of |onprem| monitoring and automation but
provides **no** failover or high availability.

Considerations
--------------

This test installation includes the following caveats:

- It uses one |mongod| for the |application| database. In production,
  the database requires a dedicated :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

- It uses MongoDB Community Edition. MongoDB Community doesn't need
  additional libraries.

- It doesn't include backup functionality.

Procedure
---------

To install and configure an evaluation version of |onprem| on hosts
running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0:
