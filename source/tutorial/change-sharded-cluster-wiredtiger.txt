====================================
Change Sharded Cluster to WiredTiger
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB deprecates the MMAPv1 storage
   engine and will remove MMAPv1 in a future release.

Use this tutorial to update MongoDB 4.0 sharded clusters to use
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`.

For earlier versions of MongoDB:

- To convert a 3.6 sharded cluster that uses MMAPv1, see the
  :v3.6:`MongoDB 3.6 manual
  </tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger>`.

- To convert a 3.4 sharded cluster that uses MMAPv1, see the
  :v3.4:`MongoDB 3.4 manual
  </tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger>`.

- To convert a 3.2 sharded cluster that uses MMAPv1, see the
  :v3.2:`MongoDB 3.2 manual
  </tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

If you change the host or port of any :term:`shard`, you must update
the shard configuration as well.

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 3.4, config servers must be :ref:`deployed as
replica sets (CSRS) <3.4-remove-sccc>`. As such, version 3.4+ config
servers already use the WiredTiger storage engine.

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.

Procedure
---------

For each replica set :term:`shard <shard>`, to change the storage
engine to WiredTiger:

A. Update the secondary members to WiredTiger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the secondary members one at a time:

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the steps for the remaining secondary members, updating them one
at a time.

B. Step down the primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the secondary members have been upgraded to WiredTiger,
connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
:method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an election
of a new primary.

.. container:: admonition

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

C. Update the old primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the primary has stepped down and become a secondary, update the
secondary to use WiredTiger as before:

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the procedure for the other shards.
