Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! MongoDB is an open-source,
document-oriented database designed for ease of development and
scaling.

The Manual introduces MongoDB and continues to describe the query
language, operational considerations and procedures, administration,
and application development patterns, among other topics relevant to
users and administrators of MongoDB. The Manual also has a thorough
reference section of the MongoDB interface and tools.

This manual is under constant development. See the :doc:`/about` for
