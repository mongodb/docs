   :description: Learn how to connect a Rust application to MongoDB using both asynchronous and synchronous APIs, and execute a query.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Rust Application

      Open the file called ``main.rs`` in your
      ``rust_quickstart/src`` project directory.  In this file, you can
      begin writing your application.
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``main.rs`` file:
      
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Asynchronous API
            :tabid: asynchronous-api

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/code-snippets/connect-async.rs
               :language: rust
         
         .. tab:: Synchronous API
            :tabid: synchronous-api

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/code-snippets/connect-sync.rs
               :language: rust

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`rust-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Rust Application

      In your shell, run the following command to compile and run this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         cargo run

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         Found a movie:
         Some(
             Document({
                 "_id": ObjectId(...),
                 "title": String(
                     "The Perils of Pauline",
                 ),
                 "plot": String(
                     "Young Pauline is left a lot of money ...",
                 ),
                 "runtime": Int32(
                     199,
                 ),
                 "cast": Array([
                     String(
                         "Pearl White",
                     ),
                     String(
                         "Crane Wilbur",
                     ),
                     ...
                 ]),
             }),
         )

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``main.rs`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
