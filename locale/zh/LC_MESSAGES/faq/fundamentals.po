"MongoDB is a :term:`document`\\-oriented DBMS. Think of MySQL but with "

"tables. Significantly, MongoDB supports neither joins nor transactions. "
"However, it features secondary indexes, an expressive query language, atomic"
" writes on a per-document level, and fully-consistent reads."

"MongoDB是一个文档型的数据库。和MySQL类似但是用JSON作为数据模型，而不是关系型表。"

"Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in :term:`collections "
"<collection>`, which are the rough equivalent of RDBMS tables. A collection "
"holds one or more :term:`documents <document>`, which corresponds to a "
"record or a row in a relational database table, and each document has one or"
" more fields, which corresponds to a column in a relational database table."
msgstr ""
"MongoDB数据库用:term:`集合 <collection>`来组织文档，类似于关系型数据库的表。"
"一个集合内可以有一个或多个:term:`文档 <document>`。文档的概念类似于关系型数据库的一个行,"

"In practice, it is common for the documents in a collection to have a "

"No. In MongoDB, a document's representation in the database is similar to "

"This differs from relational databases, where caching data is more "
