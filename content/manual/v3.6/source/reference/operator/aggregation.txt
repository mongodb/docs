stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline>`.

Accumulators (``$project``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operators that are available as accumulators for the
:pipeline:`$group` stage are also available for use in the
:pipeline:`$project` stage but not as accumulators. When used in the
:pipeline:`$project` stage, these operators do not maintain their state
and can take as input either a single argument or multiple arguments.
