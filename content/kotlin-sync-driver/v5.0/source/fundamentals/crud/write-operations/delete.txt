Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to remove documents with the MongoDB Kotlin
driver.

You can remove documents by passing a query filter to the
``deleteOne()``, ``deleteMany()`` or ``findOneAndDelete()`` methods. 

The ``deleteOne()`` method deletes a single document. If the query
filter matches more than one document, the method will remove the first
occurrence of a match in the collection. 

The ``deleteMany()`` method deletes all documents that match the query
filter.

The ``findOneAndDelete()`` method atomically finds and deletes the first
occurrence of a match in the collection.

To specify a collation or hint an index, use ``DeleteOptions``
as a second parameter to the ``deleteOne()`` and ``deleteMany()`` methods. 

To specify a collation, hint an index, specify sort order, or specify a
projection on the returned document, use ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` 
as the second parameter to the ``findOneAndDelete()`` method.

.. tip:: 

   When deleting a single document, filter your query by a unique index, 
   such as an ``_id``, to ensure your query matches the document you want to 
   delete.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples are about a paint store that sells eight different
colors of paint. The store had their annual online sale resulting in the
following documents in their ``paint_inventory`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
    { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 6 }
    { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DeleteTest.snippet.delete-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

Delete Many Documents
---------------------

The paint store website displays all documents in the
``paint_inventory`` collection. To reduce customer confusion, the store
wants to remove the colors that are out of stock.

To remove the out of stock colors, query the ``paint_inventory``
collection where the ``qty`` is ``0`` and pass the query to the
``deleteMany()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DeleteTest.snippet.delete-many.kt
   :language:  kotlin

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false  

   { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 6 }
   { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Delete a Document
-----------------

The store is donating the remaining quantity of their yellow paint. This
means that the ``qty`` for yellow is now ``0`` and we need to remove yellow
from the collection. 

To remove yellow, query the ``paint_inventory`` collection where the
``color`` is ``"yellow"`` and pass the query to the ``deleteOne()``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/DeleteTest.snippet.delete-one.kt
   :language:  kotlin

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false  

   { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Find and Delete a Document
--------------------------

The store would like to raffle the remaining quantity of purple paint
and remove purple from the ``paint_inventory`` collection. 

To pick a color, query the ``paint_inventory`` collection where the
``color`` is ``"purple"`` and pass the query to the ``findOneAndDelete()``
method. Unlike the other delete methods, ``findOneAndDelete()`` returns the
deleted document:  

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/DeleteTest.snippet.find-one-and-delete.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      The following was deleted: PaintOrder(id=2, qty=8, color=purple)

.. note::

    If there are no matches to your query filter, no document gets
    deleted and the method returns ``null``. 

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false  

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }
