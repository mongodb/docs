level: 4
stepnum: 1

  In the ``mongo``, run the following command:

  .. code-block:: none

     use gettingStarted

  This command creates a new :manual:`database
  </core/databases-and-collections/#databases>` called
  ``gettingStarted`` and points your ``mongo`` shell
  environment to that database.

title: "Insert a document into your database."
ref: shell-insert-document
level: 4
content: |
  In the ``mongo`` shell, run the following command to insert
  a document into your new database:

  .. code-block:: none

     db.people.insert({
       name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
       birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
       death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
       contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
       views : NumberLong(1250000)
     })

  This command creates a new :manual:`collection
  </core/databases-and-collections/#collections>` in your
  ``gettingStarted`` database called ``people`` and inserts one
  document into that collection.

  You should see the following output, confirming that you have
  successfully inserted a document into your collection:

  .. code-block:: none
     :copyable: false

     WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
