Relational Migrator allows you to create synthetic foreign keys. Foreign keys 
define and display a relationship between two tables through shared values. 
A synthetic foreign key also represents a relationship between two tables, but 
unlike a regular foreign key, it does not exist in the source database and can 
be defined directly using Relational Migrator. Synthetic foreign keys represent 
relationships between tables that allow you to then create mapping rules based 
on those relationships.   

Use Cases
---------

Use synthetic foreign keys when foreign keys aren't defined in your source 
database but a logical relationship exists between two tables. 
Create synthetic foreign keys before you create mapping rules to define
relationships between your tables before defining relationships between your 
tables and collections. 

Behavior
--------

- You can add synthetic foreign keys using the diagramming toolbar in the 
  :guilabel:`Relational` model. You cannot use the :guilabel:`MongoDB` model to 
  add synthetic foreign keys.

- You can only build synthetic foreign keys on a single field from each table.

- You can only have one synthetic foreign key defined on a single foreign key 
  field.

- You can create a synthetic foreign key between any columns and tables, but if 
  the table rows do not share common values in the selected columns, embedded 
  documents and arrays are not populated during the migration job.
