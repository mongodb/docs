When a migration reaches the "Ready for Cutover" status,
click :guilabel:`Cutover on target cluster`
followed by the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover` on the {+cluster+} card to initiate 
the cutover process.
Upon successful completion of the cutover, reconfigure your application to point 
to the new destination {+cluster+}.
