To share your schema with others, you can export your data model diagram. 
By sharing your data model diagram, you can collaboratively design a 
database schema.

About this Task
---------------

You can export your data model diagram as a: 

- :guilabel:`Diagram File`.
- :guilabel:`PNG` image.
- :guilabel:`JSON` file. 

When you export your data model as a :guilabel:`Diagram File`, |compass-short| 
exports the diagram as a ``.mdm`` file. This file format allows you to 
import the diagram into |compass-short|, which can be helpful when sharing your 
data model with collaborators that also use |compass-short|.

When you export your data model diagram as a PNG image, |compass-short| exports 
the collections and their relationships as they are represented in the 
:guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab. This can be helpful for sharing a visual 
representation of your schema in documentation or presentations.

When you export your data model as a JSON file, it includes: 

- A ``collections`` array with the collection namespaces and their 
  :query:`jsonSchema <$jsonSchema>`. 

- A ``relationships`` array with the namespaces of the related 
  collections and their linked fields.

Before You Begin
----------------
