For data hosted on MongoDB Atlas, you can support full-text search with
Atlas Search indexes. To learn more, see :atlas:`Create an Atlas Search
Index </atlas-search/create-index/>`.

For self-managed (non-Atlas) deployments, MongoDB provides a ``text``
index type that supports searching for string content in a collection.
To learn more about self-managed text indexes, see
:ref:`index-feature-text`.
