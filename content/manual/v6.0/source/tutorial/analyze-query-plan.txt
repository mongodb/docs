Evaluate the Performance of a Query
-----------------------------------

Consider a collection ``inventory`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "f1", type: "food", quantity: 500 }
   { "_id" : 2, "item" : "f2", type: "food", quantity: 100 }
   { "_id" : 3, "item" : "p1", type: "paper", quantity: 200 }
   { "_id" : 4, "item" : "p2", type: "paper", quantity: 150 }
   { "_id" : 5, "item" : "f3", type: "food", quantity: 300 }
   { "_id" : 6, "item" : "t1", type: "toys", quantity: 500 }
   { "_id" : 7, "item" : "a1", type: "apparel", quantity: 250 }
   { "_id" : 8, "item" : "a2", type: "apparel", quantity: 400 }
   { "_id" : 9, "item" : "t2", type: "toys", quantity: 50 }
   { "_id" : 10, "item" : "f4", type: "food", quantity: 75 }

            db.inventory.find( { quantity: { $gte: 100, $lte: 200 } } )

         The query returns the following documents:

           Collection scans indicate that the

            Because we are working with such a small dataset for the

            ``0`` seconds, even though we are not using an index.

            In a larger dataset, the difference in query
            execution time between an indexed query versus a
            non-indexed query would be much more substantial.

             that the winning query plan returns three documents.

           - :guilabel:`Index Keys Examined` displays ``0`` to
             indicate that this query is not using an index.

           - :guilabel:`Documents Examined` displays ``10`` to indicate
             that MongoDB had to scan ten documents (i.e. all documents
             in the collection) to find the three matching documents.

         - Below the :guilabel:`Query Performance Summary`, |compass|
           displays the ``COLLSCAN`` query stage to indicate that a
           collection scan was used for this query.

           Collection scans indicate that the
           :binary:`~bin.mongod` had to scan the entire collection
           document by document to identify the results. This is a

The difference between the number of matching documents and the number
of examined documents may suggest that, to improve efficiency, the
query might benefit from the use of an index.

.. _analyze-index:

Query with Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support the query on the ``quantity`` field, add an index on the
``quantity`` field:

         :method:`~cursor.explain("executionStats")` method:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.inventory.find(
               { quantity: { $gte: 100, $lte: 200 } }
            ).explain("executionStats")

         The :method:`~cursor.explain()` method returns the following
         results:

         - :data:`executionStats.nReturned <explain.executionStats.nReturned>`
           displays ``3`` to indicate that the winning query plan returns 
           three documents.

         - :data:`executionStats.totalKeysExamined
           <explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined>` displays ``3``
           to indicate that MongoDB scanned three index entries. The
           number of keys examined match the number of documents
           returned, meaning that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` only had
           to examine index keys to return the results. The
           :binary:`~bin.mongod` did not have to scan all of the
           documents, and only the three matching documents had to be
           pulled into memory. This results in a very efficient query.

         - :data:`executionStats.totalDocsExamined
           <explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined>` display ``3``

             that the winning query plan returns three documents.

           - :guilabel:`Index Keys Examined` displays ``3``
             to indicate that MongoDB scanned three index entries. The
             number of keys examined match the number of documents
             returned, meaning that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` only had
             to examine index keys to return the results. The
             :binary:`~bin.mongod` did not have to scan all of the

           - :guilabel:`Documents Examined` displays ``3`` to indicate

           - On the right-hand side of the

         - Below the :guilabel:`Query Performance Summary`, |compass|
           displays the query stages ``FETCH`` and ``IXSCAN``.
           ``IXSCAN`` indicates that the
           :binary:`~bin.mongod` used an index to satisfy the query
           before exeuting the ``FETCH`` stage and retrieving the
           documents.

            :alt: Compass query plan with index raw JSON

Without the index, the query would scan the whole collection of ``10``
documents to return ``3`` matching documents. The query also had to
scan the entirety of each document, potentially pulling them into
memory. This results in an expensive and potentially slow query
operation.

When run with an index, the query scanned ``3`` index entries
and ``3`` documents to return ``3`` matching documents, resulting
in a very efficient query.

         .. _analyze-compare-performance:

         Compare Performance of Indexes
         ------------------------------

         To manually compare the performance of a query using more
         than one index, you can use the :method:`~cursor.hint()`
         method in conjunction with the :method:`~cursor.explain()`
         method.

         Consider the following query:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.inventory.find( {
               quantity: {
                  $gte: 100, $lte: 300
               },
               type: "food"
            } )

         The query returns the following documents:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            { "_id" : 2, "item" : "f2", "type" : "food", "quantity" : 100 }
            { "_id" : 5, "item" : "f3", "type" : "food", "quantity" : 300 }

         To support the query, add a :doc:`compound index
         </core/index-compound>`. With :doc:`compound indexes
         </core/index-compound>`, the order of the fields matter.

         For example, add the following two compound indexes. The
         first index orders by ``quantity`` field first, and then the
         ``type`` field. The second index orders by ``type`` first,
         and then the ``quantity`` field.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.inventory.createIndex( { quantity: 1, type: 1 } )
            db.inventory.createIndex( { type: 1, quantity: 1 } )

         Evaluate the effect of the first index on the query:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.inventory.find(
               { quantity: { $gte: 100, $lte: 300 }, type: "food" }
            ).hint({ quantity: 1, type: 1 }).explain("executionStats")

         The :method:`~cursor.explain()` method returns the following
         output:

               },
               ...

         MongoDB scanned ``5`` index keys
         (:data:`executionStats.totalKeysExamined

         matching documents (:data:`executionStats.nReturned

         Evaluate the effect of the second index on the query:

         MongoDB scanned ``2`` index keys
         (:data:`executionStats.totalKeysExamined
         <explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined>`) to return ``2``
         matching documents (:data:`executionStats.nReturned
         <explain.executionStats.nReturned>`).

         The second compound index, ``{ type: 1, quantity: 1 }``, is
         therefore the more efficient index for supporting the example
         query, as the MongoDB server only needs to scan ``2``
         :data:`index keys <explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined>`
         to find all matching documents using this index, compared to
         ``5`` when when using the compound index
         ``{ quantity: 1, type: 1 }``.
