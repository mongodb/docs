.. dbcommand:: getFreeMonitoringStatus

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

   Returns the status of whether :doc:`free Cloud monitoring
   </administration/free-monitoring>` is enabled for standalone or
   replica sets (including shards).

   The command is run against the ``admin`` database and has the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getFreeMonitoringStatus: 1 } )

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
   :method:`db.getFreeMonitoringStatus()` helper for the command.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`checkFreeMonitoringStatus` privilege actions on the
:ref:`cluster <resource-document>`. That is, a user must have a
:ref:`role <roles>` that grants the following :ref:`privilege
<privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { cluster : true }, actions: [ "checkFreeMonitoringStatus" ] }

The built-in role :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role provides this
privilege.
 
Output
------

The command returns a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``state``

     - The free monitoring enablement state. Values are either:
       ``"enabled"`` or ``"disabled"``.

   * - ``message``

     - Any informational message related to your state.

   * - ``url``

     - The unique URL at which your monitoring data can be accessed.

       .. note::

          Anyone with whom you share the URL can access your
          monitored data.

       Even when disabled, your unique URL is returned so that if you
       re-enable monitoring, you can access your previous metrics, if
       collected less than 24 hours ago.

   * - ``userReminder``

     - Any informational message related to your state.


   * - ``ok``
       ``operationTime``
       ``$clusterTime``
