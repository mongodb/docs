To read about strategies for keeping documents in your working set at 
a manageable size, see the following patterns:

- Use 
  `The Extended Reference Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern>`__ to 
  duplicate a frequently-read portion of data from large documents to 
  smaller ones.

- Use 
  `The Subset Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-subset-pattern>`__  
  to reduce the size of documents with large array fields.

- Use 
  `The Outlier Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-outlier-pattern>`__ to handle a few 
  large documents in an otherwise standard collection.
