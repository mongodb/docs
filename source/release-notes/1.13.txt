.. _1.13.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.13.0 Release
--------------

**March 25, 2025**

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mongosync`` no longer requires you to fully disable the source
  cluster's balancer for migrations started with namespace filtering.
  Now, you only have to disable the balancer for collections within the
  namespace filter.
  
  You can leave the balancer enabled for collections outside the filter.
  The destination balancer still must be fully disabled for the duration
  of the migration.
  
  .. note::

     You don't need to disable the source balancer on individual
     collections. You can still disable the source balancer globally.

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` builds are now available for the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- Amazon Linux 2023

Live Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Live upgrades <c2c-live-upgrade>` from version 1.12 to 1.13 are
supported.

Other Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed Issues:

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 where ``mongosync`` could exit
  gracefully (instead of crashing with a fatal level log) on some
  errors.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.11.0 where ``mongosync`` returned a
  confusing error when the user lacked sufficient permissions to enable
  destination-only write blocking by default.
