If you, or one of your users, already has an account in the `MongoDB
Jira instance`_, you can grant these users access to your MMS console
because MMS and Jira have integrated user management systems. In the
"Admins" section of the MMS console, click on the plus (``+``) icon
next to your account name and enter the Jira username in the dialogue.

If you're not sure if your user has a Jira account, or if you do not
know their username, you can enter their email address in the dialogue
box. If the console finds a connected account, MMS will automatically
add the user to your Jira group and the MMS console.

Users can create accounts at any time using the "`account registration
page <https://mms.10gen.com/user/register/user>`_", or through Jira at
`jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

.. index:: users; propagation

.. note:: 

   If you create an account in Jira or make any changes to that
   account from *within* Jira, it can take up to 30 minutes for that
   change to propagate to MMS. During this window you cannot add a
   user to a group in MMS. Also, passwords changed in Jira are subject
   to the same propagation delay for MMS accounts.
