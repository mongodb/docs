cumulative sales data for each month. This view uses data from the ``sample_supplies.sales``

the materialized view.

   To create the triggers, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` or higher access 
   to the project.

In the following procedures, you create triggers to create a materialized view 
and schedule a function to update the materialized view daily. Expand
