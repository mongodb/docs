MongoDB versioning has the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y`` refers to the
release series and ``Z`` refers to the patch number.

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, MongoDB is released as two different release
series:

- |lts| Releases
- Rapid Releases

For MongoDB 4.4 and previous, MongoDB used a Production / Development
versioning system. See :ref:`historical-releases`.

|lts| Releases
--------------

|lts| Releases are made available approximately once a year, and
introduce new features and improvements. |lts| Releases are supported
for MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0``
- ``6.0``

Rapid Releases
--------------

Rapid Releases are made available approximately once each quarter that
does not contain a |lts| Release, and introduce new features and
improvements. Rapid Releases are only supported within `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`_, and are not
supported for on-premises deployments.

Rapid Releases are not available for use with `MongoDB Ops Manager
<https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/?tck=docs_server>`_.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.1``
- ``5.2``
- ``5.3``

Patch Releases
--------------

Patch Releases are made available as needed to both |lts| Releases and
Rapid Releases. Patch releases generally include bug fixes and minor
improvements.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.1`` (a |lts| Release patch version)
- ``5.2.1`` (a Rapid Release patch version)

Release Candidate (RC) Releases
-------------------------------

In advance of new |lts| Releases and Rapid Releases, Release Candidates
are made available for early testing. A Release Candidate represents a
version of the upcoming release that is stable enough to begin testing,
but is not suitable for production deployment.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.0-rc0``
- ``5.0.0-rc1``
- ``5.1.2-rc5``

Driver Versions
---------------

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the :ecosystem:`MongoDB drivers </drivers>`.

MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
---------------------------

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell
</>` (``mongosh``) is released separately from the MongoDB Server, and uses its 
own version numbering system.

Database Tools
--------------

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the :dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools
</>` are released separately
from the MongoDB Server, and use their own version numbering system.

Historical Releases
-------------------

For MongoDB 4.4 and previous, MongoDB versioning used a Production /
Development versioning scheme, and had the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y``
refers to either a release series or development series and ``Z`` refers
to the revision/patch number.

- If ``Y`` is even, ``X.Y`` refers to a release series; for example,
  ``4.2`` release series and ``4.4`` release series. Release series are
  **stable** and suitable for production.

- If ``Y`` is odd, ``X.Y`` refers to a development series; for example,
  ``4.3`` development series and ``4.5`` development series.
  Development series are **for testing only and not for production**.

For example, in MongoDB version ``4.4.7``, ``4.4`` refers to the
release series and ``.7`` refers to the revision.
