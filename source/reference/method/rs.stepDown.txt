rs.stepDown()

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

.. method:: rs.stepDown(seconds)

   Forces the current :term:`replica set` member to step down as
   :term:`primary` and then attempt to avoid election as primary for
   the designated number of seconds. Produces an error if the current
   member is not the primary.

   The :method:`rs.stepDown()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /reference/method/rs.stepDown-param.rst

   This function disconnects the shell briefly and forces a
   reconnection as the replica set renegotiates which member
   will be primary. As a result, the shell will display an
   error even if this command succeeds.

   :method:`rs.stepDown()` provides a wrapper around the
   :term:`database command` :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`.
