"Users may configure :term:`read preference` on a per-connection basis to "
"prefer that the read operations return on the :term:`secondary` members. If "
"clients configure the :term:`read preference` to permit secondary reads, "

"replicated more recent updates or operations. When reading from a secondary,"
" a query may return data that reflects a previous state."
