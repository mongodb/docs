X.509 certificates provide :term:`database users <database user>` access to the
{+database-deployments+} in their project. Note that Database users are different from :term:`Atlas
users <Atlas user>`. Database users have access to MongoDB databases, while |service|
users have access to the |service| application itself.

X.509 certificates can be of one of the following types:

- **Self-managed certificates**. With self-managed certificates, you must provide a
  |certauth| (CA) and generate your own certificates for your database users. See
  :ref:`configure-pki` for more details on setting up self-managed certificates in your
  project.

- **Atlas-managed certificates**. With Atlas-managed certificates, |service| manages your 
  CA as well and generates the certificates for your database users. You do not need to 
  handle any additional CA configuration with Atlas-managed certificates. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To self-manage your X.509 certificates, you must have a :wikipedia:`Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI)<Public_key_infrastructure>` to integrate with |service|.

------------------------------------------------------

If you choose to work with self-managed X.509 certificates, you must configure your
project to use a PKI you provide.

To edit your CA once uploaded, click the
