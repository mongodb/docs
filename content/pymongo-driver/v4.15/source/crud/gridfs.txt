Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB by using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification implemented by 
{+driver-short+} that describes how to split files into chunks when storing them
and reassemble them when retrieving them. The driver's implementation of
GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of
the file storage. 

You should use GridFS if the size of your files exceeds the BSON document
size limit of 16MB. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` in the
MongoDB Server manual.

The following sections describe GridFS operations and how to
perform them.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections, named using the convention
defined in the GridFS specification:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding 
collections, prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless
you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each
collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related
metadata. The driver creates the GridFS bucket, if it doesn't exist, only when the first write
operation is performed. The driver creates indexes only if they don't exist and when the
bucket is empty. For more information about
GridFS indexes, see :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from
memory or from a stream. See the following diagram to see how GridFS splits
the files when uploaded to a bucket.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

.. _gridfs-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a GridFS bucket by calling the
``GridFSBucket()`` constructor and passing in a ``Database`` instance.
You can use the ``GridFSBucket`` instance to
call read and write operations on the files in your bucket. If you are working with an
asynchronous application, use the ``AsyncGridFSBucket()`` constructor instead.

Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding
code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start create bucket
         :end-before: end create bucket

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start create bucket
         :end-before: end create bucket

.. _gridfs-create-custom-bucket:

To create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the default name
``fs``, pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the ``GridFSBucket()``
constructor, as shown in the following example. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or
:guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start create custom bucket
         :end-before: end create custom bucket

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start create custom bucket
         :end-before: end create custom bucket

.. _gridfs-upload-files:

Upload Files
------------

Use the ``open_upload_stream()`` method from the ``GridFSBucket`` class to
create an upload stream for a given file name. The ``open_upload_stream()``
method allows you to specify configuration information such as file chunk
size and other field/value pairs to store as metadata. Set these options
as parameters of ``open_upload_stream()``, as shown in the following code
example. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the
corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start upload files
         :end-before: end upload files

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start upload files
         :end-before: end upload files

.. _gridfs-retrieve-file-info:

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the
``files`` collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information
about the file it refers to, including:

- The ``_id`` of the file
- The name of the file
- The length/size of the file
- The upload date and time
- A ``metadata`` document in which you can store any other information

To retrieve files from a GridFS bucket, call the ``find()`` method on the ``GridFSBucket``
instance. The method returns a ``Cursor`` instance
from which you can access the results. To learn more about ``Cursor`` objects in
{+driver-short+}, see :ref:`<pymongo-cursors>`.

The following code example shows you how to retrieve and print file metadata
from all your files in a GridFS bucket. It uses the ``for...in`` syntax to traverse the
``Cursor`` iterable and display the results. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or
:guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start retrieve file info
         :end-before: end retrieve file info

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start retrieve file info
         :end-before: end retrieve file info

The ``find()`` method accepts various query specifications. You can use
its parameters to specify the sort order, maximum number of documents to return,
and the number of documents to skip before returning. To learn more about querying
MongoDB, see :ref:`<pymongo-retrieve>`.

.. _gridfs-download-files:

Download Files
--------------

You can download files from your MongoDB database by using the
``open_download_stream_by_name()`` method from ``GridFSBucket`` to create a
download stream.

The following example shows you how to download a file referenced
by the file name, ``"my_file"``, and read its contents. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous`
or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start download files name
         :end-before: end download files name

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start download files name
         :end-before: end download files name

.. note::

   If there are multiple documents with the same ``filename`` value,
   GridFS will stream the most recent file with the given name (as
   determined by the ``uploadDate`` field).

Alternatively, you can use the ``open_download_stream()``
method, which takes the ``_id`` field of a file as a parameter. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous`
or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start download files id
         :end-before: end download files id

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start download files id
         :end-before: end download files id

.. note::

   The GridFS streaming API cannot load partial chunks. When a download
   stream needs to pull a chunk from MongoDB, it pulls the entire chunk
   into memory. The 255-kilobyte default chunk size is usually
   sufficient, but you can reduce the chunk size to reduce memory
   overhead.

.. _gridfs-rename-files:

Rename Files
------------

Use the ``rename()`` method to update the name of a GridFS file in your
bucket. You must specify the file to rename by its ``_id`` field
rather than its file name.

The following example shows how to update the ``filename`` field to
``"new_file_name"`` by referencing a document's ``_id`` field. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous`
or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start rename files
         :end-before: end rename files

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start rename files
         :end-before: end rename files

.. note::

   The ``rename()`` method supports updating the name of only one file at
   a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the
   file name from the bucket, extract the ``_id`` field from the files you
   want to rename, and pass each value in separate calls to the ``rename()``
   method.

.. _gridfs-delete-files:

Delete Files
------------

Use the ``delete()`` method to remove a file's collection document and associated
chunks from your bucket. This effectively deletes the file. You must
specify the file by its ``_id`` field rather than its file name.

The following example shows you how to delete a file by referencing its ``_id`` field.
Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the
corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start delete files
         :end-before: end delete files

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/gridfs/gridfs-async.py
         :language: python
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start delete files
         :end-before: end delete files

.. note::

   The ``delete()`` method supports deleting only one file at a time. To
   delete multiple files, retrieve the files from the bucket, extract
   the ``_id`` field from the files you want to delete, and pass each value
   in separate calls to the ``delete()`` method.
