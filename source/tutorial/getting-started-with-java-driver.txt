Introduction
-------------

This page is a brief overview of working with the MongoDB Java Driver.

For more information about the Java API, please refer to the `online
API Documentation for Java Driver`_.

.. _`online API Documentation for Java Driver`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/index.html

A Quick Tour
------------

Using the Java driver is very simple. First, be sure to include the
driver jar :file:`mongo.jar` in your classpath. The following code
snippets come from the :file:`examples/QuickTour.java` example code
found in the driver.

Making a Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a connection to a MongoDB, you need to have at the minimum, the
name of a database to connect to. The database doesn't have to exist -
if it doesn't, MongoDB will create it for you.

Additionally, you can specify the server address and port when
connecting. The following example shows three ways to connect to the
database ``mydb`` on the local machine :

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
   import com.mongodb.MongoException;
   import com.mongodb.WriteConcern;
   import com.mongodb.DB;
   import com.mongodb.DBCollection;
   import com.mongodb.BasicDBObject;
   import com.mongodb.DBObject;
   import com.mongodb.DBCursor;
   import com.mongodb.ServerAddress;

   import java.util.Arrays;

   // To directly connect to a single MongoDB server (note that this will not auto-discover the primary even
   // if it's a member of a replica set:
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient();
   // or
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient( "localhost" );
   // or
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient( "localhost" , 27017 );
   // or, to connect to a replica set, with auto-discovery of the primary, supply a seed list of members 
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress("localhost", 27017),
                                         new ServerAddress("localhost", 27018),
                                         new ServerAddress("localhost", 27019)));

   DB db = mongoClient.getDB( "mydb" );

At this point, the ``db`` object will be a connection to a MongoDB server
for the specified database. With it, you can do further operations. 

.. note::
   The ``MongoClient`` instance actually represents a pool of
   connections to the database; you will only need one instance of
   class ``MongoClient`` even with multiple threads. See the
   :ref:`concurrency <java-driver-concurrency>` doc page for more
   information.

The ``MongoClient`` class is designed to be thread safe and shared
among threads. Typically you create only 1 instance for a given
database cluster and use it across your application. If for some reason
you decide to create many ``MongoClient`` instances, note that:

- all resource usage limits (max connections, etc) apply per
  ``MongoClient`` instance

- to dispose of an instance, make sure you call ``MongoClient.close()`` to
  clean up resources

.. versionadded:: 2.10.0
   The `MongoClient`_ class is new in version 2.10.0. For releases
   prior to that, please use the `Mongo`_ class instead.

.. _`MongoClient`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClient.html

.. _`Mongo`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/Mongo.html

Authentication (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can be run in a `secure mode`_ where access to databases is
controlled through name and password authentication. When run in this
mode, any client application must provide a name and password before
doing any operations. In the Java driver, you simply do the following
with a ``MongoClient`` instance:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient();
   DB db = mongoClient.getDB("test");
   boolean auth = db.authenticate(myUserName, myPassword);

If the name and password are valid for the database, ``auth`` will be
``true``. Otherwise, it will be ``false``. You should look at the
MongoDB log for further information if available.

Most users run MongoDB without authentication in a trusted environment.

.. _`secure mode`: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Security+and+Authentication

Getting a List Of Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each database has zero or more collections. You can retrieve a list of
them from the ``db`` (and print out any that are there) :

.. code-block:: java

   Set<String> colls = db.getCollectionNames();

   for (String s : colls) {
       System.out.println(s);
   }

and assuming that there are two collections, ``name`` and ``address``,
in the database, you would see

.. code-block:: none

   name
   address

as the output.

Getting a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a collection to use, just specify the name of the collection to
the `getCollection(String collectionName)`_ method:

.. code-block:: java

   DBCollection coll = db.getCollection("testCollection");

Once you have this collection object, you can now do things like insert
data, query for data, etc

.. _`getCollection(String collectionName)`: 
   http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/DB.html#getCollection%28java.lang.String%29

Setting Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of version 2.10.0, the default write concern is
`WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`_, but it can be easily changed:

.. code-block:: java

   mongoClient.setWriteConcern(WriteConcern.JOURNALED);

There are many options for write concern. Additionally, the default
write concern can be overridden on the database, collection, and
individual update operations. Please consult the `API Documentation`_ for
details.

.. versionchanged:: 2.10.0 
   Prior to version 2.10.0, the default write concern is
   `WriteConcern.NORMAL`_. Under normal circumstances, clients will
   typically change this to ensure they are notified of problems
   writing to the database.

.. _`WriteConcern.NORMAL`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/WriteConcern.html#NORMAL

.. _`WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`: 
   http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/WriteConcern.html#ACKNOWLEDGED

.. _`API Documentation`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/index.html

Inserting a Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the collection object, you can insert documents into the
collection. For example, lets make a little document that in JSON would
be represented as

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "name" : "MongoDB",
      "type" : "database",
      "count" : 1,
      "info" : {
                  x : 203,
                  y : 102
                }
   }

Notice that the above has an "inner" document embedded within it. To do
this, we can use the `BasicDBObject`_ class to create the document
(including the inner document), and then just simply insert it into the
collection using the ``insert()`` method.

.. code-block:: java

   BasicDBObject doc = new BasicDBObject("name", "MongoDB").
                                 append("type", "database").
                                 append("count", 1).
                                 append("info", new BasicDBObject("x", 203).append("y", 102));

   coll.insert(doc);

.. _`BasicDBObject`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/BasicDBObject.html

Finding the First Document in a Collection Using ``findOne()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To show that the document we inserted in the previous step is there, we
can do a simple `findOne()`_ operation to get the first document in the
collection. This method returns a single document (rather than the
`DBCursor`_ that the `find()`_ operation returns), and it's useful for things
where there only is one document, or you are only interested in the
first. You don't have to deal with the cursor.

.. code-block:: java

   DBObject myDoc = coll.findOne();
   System.out.println(myDoc);

and you should see

.. code-block:: sh

   { "_id" : "49902cde5162504500b45c2c" , 
     "name" : "MongoDB" , 
     "type" : "database" , 
     "count" : 1 , 
     "info" : { "x" : 203 , "y" : 102}}

.. note::
   The ``_id`` element has been added automatically by MongoDB to your
   document. Remember, MongoDB reserves element names that start with
   "_"/"$" for internal use.

.. _`findOne()`: 
   http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/DBCollection.html#findOne%28java.lang.Object%29

.. _`DBCursor`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/DBCursor.html

.. _`find()`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/DBCollection.html#find()'

Adding Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to do more interesting things with queries, let's add multiple
simple documents to the collection. These documents will just be

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "i" : value
   }
   
and we can do this fairly efficiently in a loop

.. code-block:: java

   for (int i=0; i < 100; i++) {
       coll.insert(new BasicDBObject("i", i));
   }

Notice that we can insert documents of different "shapes" into the same
collection. This aspect is what we mean when we say that MongoDB is
"schema-free"

Counting Documents in A Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've inserted 101 documents (the 100 we did in the loop, plus
the first one), we can check to see if we have them all using the
``getCount()`` method.

.. code-block:: java

   System.out.println(coll.getCount());

and it should print ``101``.

Using a Cursor to Get All the Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to get all the documents in the collection, we will use the
``find()`` method. The ``find()`` method returns a ``DBCursor`` object which allows
us to iterate over the set of documents that matched our query. So to
query all of the documents and print them out :

.. code-block:: java

   DBCursor cursor = coll.find();
   try {
      while(cursor.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(cursor.next());
      }
   } finally {
      cursor.close();
   }

and that should print all 101 documents in the collection.

Getting A Single Document with A Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can create a query to pass to the find() method to get a subset of
the documents in our collection. For example, if we wanted to find the
document for which the value of the "i" field is 71, we would do the
following ;

.. code-block:: java

   BasicDBObject query = new BasicDBObject("i", 71);

   cursor = coll.find(query);

   try {
      while(cursor.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(cursor.next());
      }
   } finally {
      cursor.close();
   }

and it should just print just one document

.. code-block:: sh

   { "_id" : "49903677516250c1008d624e" , "i" : 71 }

You may commonly see examples and documentation in MongoDB which use $
Operators, such as this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.things.find({j: {$ne: 3}, k: {$gt: 10} });

These are represented as regular ``String`` keys in the Java driver,
using embedded ``DBObjects``:

.. code-block:: java

   BasicDBObject query = new BasicDBObject("j", new BasicDBObject("$ne", 3).
                                         append("k", new BasicDBObject("$gt", 10));

   cursor = coll.find(query);

   try {
      while(cursor.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(cursor.next());
      }
   } finally {
      cursor.close();
   }

Getting A Set of Documents With a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the query to get a set of documents from our collection. 
For example, if we wanted to get all documents where ``"i" > 50``, we could write :

.. code-block:: java

   query = new BasicDBObject("i", new BasicDBObject("$gt", 50));  // e.g. find all where i > 50

   cursor = coll.find(query);

   try {
      while(cursor.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(cursor.next());
      }
   } finally {
      cursor.close();
   }

which should print the documents where ``i > 50``. 

We could also get a range, say ``20 < i <= 30``:

.. code-block:: java

   query = new BasicDBObject("i", new BasicDBObject("$gt", 20).
                                                  append("$lte", 30));  // i.e.   20 < i <= 30
   cursor = coll.find(query);

   try {
      while(cursor.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(cursor.next());
      }
   } finally {
      cursor.close();
   }

Quick Tour of the Administrative Functions
------------------------------------------

Creating An Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports indexes, and they are very easy to add on a
collection. To create an index, you just specify the field that should
be indexed, and specify if you want the index to be ascending (``1``)
or descending (``-1``). The following creates an ascending index on the
``i`` field :

.. code-block:: java

   coll.createIndex(new BasicDBObject("i", 1));  // create index on "i", ascending

Getting a List of Indexes on a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of the indexes on a collection:

.. code-block:: java

   List<DBObject> list = coll.getIndexInfo();

   for (DBObject o : list) {
      System.out.println(o);
   }
   
and you should see something like

.. code-block:: sh

   { "name" : "i_1" , "ns" : "mydb.testCollection" , "key" : { "i" : 1} }

Getting A List of Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of the available databases:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient();

   for (String s : mongoClient.getDatabaseNames()) {
      System.out.println(s);
   }

Dropping A Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can drop a database by name using a ``MongoClient`` instance:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient();
   mongoClient.dropDatabase("myDatabase");
