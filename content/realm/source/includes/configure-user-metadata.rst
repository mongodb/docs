You can only read user metadata from the client app that you have configured
on the App Services application.

You can configure the :ref:`user metadata <user-metadata>` you request from 
an authentication provider. You do this directly on the authentication 
provider's configuration. For more details on which metadata fields you 
can use, see the provider details:

- OAuth 2.0 (:ref:`Facebook <facebook-authentication>` & :ref:`Google <google-authentication>`)
- :ref:`Custom JWT <custom-jwt-authentication>`

You can change which metadata fields you have configured by :ref:`editing the 
provider's configuration <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>`.
