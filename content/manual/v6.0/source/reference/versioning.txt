   Always upgrade to the latest stable revision of your release series.

MongoDB versioning has the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y`` refers to the
release series and ``Z`` refers to the patch number.

MongoDB is released as two different release series:

- |lts| Releases
- Rapid Releases

.. _major-releases:

|lts| Releases
--------------

|lts| Releases are made available approximately once a year, and
introduce new features and improvements. |lts| Releases are supported
for MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments.

*Example versions:*

- ``6.0``
- ``7.0``

.. _rapid-releases:

Rapid Releases
--------------

Rapid Releases are made available approximately once each quarter that
does not contain a |lts| Release, and introduce new features and
improvements. Rapid Releases are only supported within `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database>`_, and are not
supported for on-premises deployments.

Rapid Releases are not available for use with `MongoDB Ops Manager
<https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/>`_.

*Example versions:*

- ``6.1``
- ``6.2``
- ``6.3``

.. _versions-patch-release:

Patch Releases
--------------

Patch Releases are made available as needed to both |lts| Releases and
Rapid Releases. Patch releases generally include bug fixes and minor
improvements.

*Example versions:*

- ``6.0.1`` (a |lts| Release patch version)
- ``6.2.1`` (a Rapid Release patch version)

Release Candidate (RC) Releases
-------------------------------

In advance of new |lts| Releases and Rapid Releases, Release Candidates
are made available for early testing. A Release Candidate represents a
version of the upcoming release that is stable enough to begin testing,
but is not suitable for production deployment.

*Example versions:*

- ``6.0.0-rc0``
- ``6.0.0-rc1``
- ``6.1.2-rc5``

Driver Versions
---------------

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the :ecosystem:`MongoDB drivers </drivers>`.

MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
---------------------------

The :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>` (``mongosh``) is released separately 
from the MongoDB Server and uses its own version numbering system.

Database Tools
--------------

:dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools </>` are released separately
from the MongoDB Server and use their own version numbering system.
