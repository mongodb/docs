  You can install the MongoDB Agent in any directory. If you want
  to move the archive to another directory before extracting, you may
  do so.

  To install the MongoDB Agent, extract the archive:

  Create the following directories to store files that the
  {+mdbagent+} needs.

  .. note::

     The use of ``mongodb-mms-automation`` in the file path is a
     legacy artifact and does not mean that the {+mdbagent+} is being
     installed with Automation configured.

       - Description

     * - Binaries
       - ``/var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation``
       - These are the binaries that the {+mdbagent+} manages.
         They include the {+mdbagent+}, BI Connector, and MongoDB
         binaries.

     * - MongoDB Agent logs

     * - MongoDB databases
       - ``/data``
       - These are the databases that the {+mdbagent+} creates and
         manages.

  Run the following commands to create the directories:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo mkdir -m 755 -p /var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation
