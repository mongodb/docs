Add MongoDB Users
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Create MongoDB users to provide clients access to the clusters in your
group. A MongoDB user's access is determined by the roles assigned to
the user. When you create a MongoDB user, the user is added to all
clusters in your |service| group.

To create a new MongoDB user, from the :guilabel:`Clusters` view,
select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then click :guilabel:`Users`, then
:guilabel:`Add New User`.

MongoDB users are separate from |service| users. MongoDB users have
access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users access to the
|service| application itself.
