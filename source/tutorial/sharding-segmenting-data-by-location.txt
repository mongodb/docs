MongoDB Tag Aware Sharding allows administrators to control data distribution
in a sharded cluster by defining ranges of the :term:`shard key` and tagging
them to one or more shards.

This tutorial uses :ref:`tag-aware-sharding` to segment data based on
geographic area.

The following are some example use cases for segmenting data by geographic
area:

* An application that requires segmenting user data based on geographic country
* A database that requires resource allocation based on geographic country

The following diagram illustrates a sharded cluster that uses geographic based
shard tags to manage and satisfy data segmentation requirements.

Scenario
--------

A financial chat application logs messages, tracking the country of the
originating user. The application stores the logs in the ``chat`` database
under the ``messages`` collection. The chats contain information that must be
segmented by country to have servers local to the country serve read and write
requests for the country's users. A group of countries can be assigned
same tag in order to share resources.

The application currently has users in the US, UK, and Germany. The
``country`` field represents the user's country based on its
`ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`_
two-character country codes.

The following documents represent a partial view of three chat messages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
     "country" : "US",
     "userid" : 123,
     "message" : "Hello there",
     ...,
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fb"),
     "country" : "UK",
     "userid" : 456,
     "message" : "Good Morning"
     ...,
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fc"),
     "country" : "DE",
     "userid" : 789,
     "message" : "Guten Tag"
     ...,
   }


Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The ``messages`` collection uses the ``{ country : 1, userid : 1 }`` compound
index as the shard key.

The ``country`` field in each document allows for creating a tag range on
each distinct country value.

The ``userid`` field provides a high :ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>`
and low :ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>` component to the shard key
relative to ``country``.

See :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-requirements>` for more
general instructions on selecting a shard key.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharded cluster has shards in two data centers - one in Europe, and
one in North America.

.. include:: /images/sharding-segmenting-data-by-location-architecture.rst


Tags
~~~~

This application requires one tag per data center.

``EU`` - European data center
   Shards deployed on this data center are tagged as ``EU``.

   For each country using the ``EU`` data center for local reads and writes,
   create a tag range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MinKey }``
   * an upper bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MaxKey }``

``NA`` - North American data center
   Shards deployed on this data center are tagged as ``NA``.

   For each country using the ``NA`` data center for local reads and writes,
   create a tag range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MinKey }``
   * an upper bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MaxKey }``

.. note::

   The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
   values for comparisons

Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With tag-aware sharding, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` compares incoming documents
against any configured tag ranges. If a document matches a configured tag
range, :binary:`~bin.mongos` routes the document to a shard with the appropriate
tag.

On insert, MongoDB can route documents that do not match a configured tag
range to any shard in the cluster.

Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can route queries to a specific shard if the query includes at least
the ``country`` field.

For example, MongoDB can attempt a :ref:`targeted read operation
<sharding-mongos-targeted>` on the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   chatDB = db.getSiblingDB("chat")
   chatDB.messages.find( { "country" : "UK" , "userid" : "123" } )

Queries without the ``country`` field perform :ref:`broadcast operations
<sharding-mongos-broadcast>`.

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` the tagged chunks to the appropriate shard. Until
the migration, shards may contain chunks that violate configured tag ranges
and tags. Once balancing completes, shards should only contain chunks whose
ranges do not violate its assigned tags and tag ranges.

Adding or removing tags or tag ranges can result in chunk migrations.
Depending on the size of your data set and the number of chunks a tag range
affects, these migrations may impact cluster performance. Consider running
your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` during specific scheduled windows.
See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial on how to set a
scheduling window.

Security
~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authorization`, authenticate as a user
with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager` role on the ``admin`` database.

Procedure
---------

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to create tags and tag ranges.
You cannot create tags by connecting directly to a :term:`shard`.

Updating Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application requires the following updates:

* Documents with ``country : UK`` must now be associated to the new ``UK``
  data center. Any data in the ``EU`` data center must be migrated

* The chat application now supports users in Mexico. Documents with
  ``country : MX`` must be routed to the ``NA`` data center.

Perform the following procedures to update the tag ranges.
