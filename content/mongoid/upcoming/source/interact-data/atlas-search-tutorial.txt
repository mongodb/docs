Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you can learn how to integrate :atlas:`{+search+}
</atlas-search/>`, an advanced full-text search feature, into a {+ror+} app.

After you complete this tutorial, you have a fully functional search
feature embedded in your Rails app, allowing you to efficiently find
information.

Prerequisites
-------------

The tutorial builds on a template app that you can download from the
:github:`mongodb-atlas-with-ruby-on-rails-example GitHub repository
<mongodb-developer/mongodb-atlas-with-ruby-on-rails-example>` by running
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-atlas-with-ruby-on-rails-example.git

Then, perform the following setup actions:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster. To learn how to create a cluster, see
   the :ref:`mongoid-quick-start-rails-create-deployment` step of the
   Rails Quick Start guide.

#. Update the app's ``config/mongoid.yml`` file with your own connection
   string and set the default database to ``inspiration``, as shown the
   following example configuration:

   .. code-block:: yml

      development:
        clients:
          default:
            uri: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<host>/inspiration

#. Start the Rails app by running the ``rails server`` command, then
   complete the :guilabel:`New Idea` entry form to insert some sample
   data into the ``inspiration.ideas`` collection.

   .. tip:: Sample Data
      
      To achieve the search functionality demonstrated later in
      the tutorial, insert sample documents that contain some overlapping
      terms in the ``name`` or ``description`` fields.

#. Create a {+search+} index in Compass or the Atlas UI called
   ``inspiration`` with dynamic (default) mappings. To learn more about
   creating {+search+} indexes, see the
   :ref:`mongoid_indexes_atlas_search` section of the Indexes guide.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Configure the {+search+} feature in your {+odm+} model.

      First, update the ``Idea`` model to handle {+search+} queries on
      the ``ideas`` collection by defining the ``search`` method in the
      model. The method ``self.search(query)`` defines a class method
      called ``search`` that takes a single argument ``query`` and
      returns the search results.

      Open the ``app/models/idea.rb`` file and replace its contents with
      the following code:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         class Idea
           include Mongoid::Document
           include Mongoid::Timestamps
           field :name, type: String
           field :description, type: String
           field :picture, type: String

           def self.search(query)
             aggregation_pipeline = [
               {
                 "$search": {
                   "index": "inspiration",
                   "text": {
                     "query": query,
                     "path": ['name', 'description']
                   },
                   "sort": {
                     "score": { "$meta": "searchScore" }
                   }
                 }
               },
               {
                 "$limit": 20
               }
             ]
             results = collection.aggregate(aggregation_pipeline)

             search_results = results.to_a
             search_results.map do |result|
               Idea.new(
                 id: result["_id"],
                 name: result["name"],
                 description: result["description"],
                 picture: result["picture"]
               )
             end
           end
         end

      When you call ``idea.search("<example query>")``, {+odm+} performs the
      following actions:
      
      1. Performs a full-text search by using the ``inspiration`` index.
      #. Runs the query across the ``name`` and ``description`` fields.
      #. Sorts the results by their relevance scores.
      #. Limits the number of results to ``20`` to improve performance
         for queries on large collections.
      
      The ``search_results`` variable then converts the raw results from
      MongoDB into an array of hashes that can be mapped to ``Idea``
      model instances and rendered in your view files.

   .. step:: Add a Search action in your controller.

      Now that you defined the Search query functionality in the
      ``Idea`` model, you must add an action to initiate queries.

      Open the ``app/controllers/ideas_controller.rb`` file and add the
      following action to your ``IdeasController`` before the ``private``
      declaration:
      
      .. code-block:: ruby
      
         def search
           @query = params[:query]
           @ideas = @query.present? ? Idea.search(@query) : Idea.all
           render :display_results
         end
      
      Now, when you submit a Search query, {+odm+} runs the
      ``search`` method in the ``Idea`` model. The
      results are then rendered in your view files.

   .. step:: Generate the Search controller.

      Run the following command to generate the ``SearchesController``
      and the ``display_results`` view file, which handle ``search``
      requests and display the results, respectively:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
      
         rails generate controller Searches display_results
      
      Open the newly created ``searches_controller.rb`` file and replace
      the contents with the following code:
      
      .. code-block:: ruby
      
         class SearchesController < ApplicationController
           def display_results
             query = params[:query]
             @results = Idea.search(query)
           end
         end
      
      Open the ``app/views/searches/display_results.html.erb`` file and
      replace the contents with the following code, which renders the search results:

      .. code-block:: html
      
         <div class="search-results">
           <h1>Search Results for "<%= params[:query] %>"</h1>
      
           <% if @results.empty? %>
             <p>No ideas found.</p>
           <% else %>
             <div class="idea-container">
               <% @results.each do |result| %>
                 <div class="idea">
                   <h2><%= result.name %></h2>
                   <p><%= truncate(result.description, length: 150) %></p>
                   <img src="<%= result.picture %>" alt="<%= result.name %>" />
      
                   <p><%= link_to "View", idea_path(result.id) %></p>
                 </div>
               <% end %>
             </div>
           <% end %>
         </div>
      
         <%= link_to "Back", ideas_path %>

      Then, add the following code to your ``app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`` file to include
      basic styling for the search results:
      
      .. code-block:: css
      
         .search-results {
           width: 80%;
           margin: 0 auto;
         }
         .idea-container {
           display: flex;
           flex-direction: column;
         }
         .idea {
           padding: 20px;
           border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc;
           border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
           margin-bottom: 10px;
         }
         .idea h2 {
           margin: 0;
         }
         .idea p {
           margin: 0;
         }
         .idea img {
           width: 100px;
           height: auto;
           display: block;
         }
         ul {
           list-style-type: none;
           padding: 0;
         }

   .. step:: Create the Search form.

      To enable Search queries directly in your application, open the 
      ``app/views/ideas/index.html.erb`` file and add the following
      code:
      
      .. code-block:: html
      
         <%= form_tag(search_results_path, method: :get, class: "form-inline") do %>
           <div class="input-group mb-3">
             <%= text_field_tag :query, params[:query], placeholder: "Search Ideas...", class: "form-control" %>
             <div class="input-group-append">
               <%= submit_tag "Search", class: "btn btn-primary text-white" %>
             </div>
           </div>
         <% end %>
      
      Add the following styling for the search bar to your ``application.css`` file:
      
      .. code-block:: css
      
         .input-group {
           width: 100%;
         }
         .btn-primary {
           background-color: #007bff;
           border-color: #007bff;
           color: white;
         }
         .btn-primary:hover {
           background-color: #0056b3;
           border-color: #004085;
         }

   .. step:: Update app routes for Search queries.

      Replace the existing route in the ``config/routes.rb`` file with
      following route to display search results:

      .. code-block:: ruby
      
         Rails.application.routes.draw do
           root to: "ideas#index"
           resources :ideas
           get '/search_results', to: 'searches#display_results', as: "search_results"
         end

   .. step:: Start your application and run Search queries.

      In your project directory, run the following command to start your
      application:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
      
         rails server

      Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the landing page.

      To submit a query, type a term or phrase in the search bar then
      click the :guilabel:`Search` button. The following image depicts
      the search results for the term ``"outdoor"``:

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas-search-tutorial-render.png
         :alt: The rendered Search results
      
      The search results depend on the documents in your
      database. As the complexity of your data increases, you might need
      to perform more advanced queries to narrow results. To learn more
      about different {+search+} queries and view examples, see the
      :atlas:`Query Reference </atlas-search/query-ref/>` in the Atlas
      documentation.
