.. dbcommand:: setFeatureCompatibilityVersion

   Enables or disables the features that persist data incompatible with
   earlier versions of MongoDB. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` against the ``admin``
   database.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( {
         setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: <version>,
         writeConcern: { wtimeout: <timeout> }
      } )

   The values for the ``version`` are:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 85

      * - Version
        - Description

      * - ``"4.2"``


        - *Available on MongoDB 4.2 Deployments*

          Enables the :ref:`4.2 features that persist data incompatible
          with MongoDB 4.0 <4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

          .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

      * - ``"4.0"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 4.0 and 4.2 Deployments*

          - If set on MongoDB 4.0 deployments,
              Enables the :ref:`4.0 features that persist data incompatible
              with MongoDB 3.6 <4.0-compatibility-enabled>`.

              .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

          - If set on MongoDB 4.2 deployments,
              Disables the :ref:`4.2 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 4.0
              <4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

      * - ``"3.6"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.6 and 4.0 Deployments*

          - If set on MongoDB 3.6 deployments,
              Enables the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 3.4
              <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

              .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

          - If set on MongoDB 4.0 deployments,
              Disables the :ref:`4.0 features that persist data

      * - ``"3.4"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 and MongoDB 3.6 Deployments*

          - If set on MongoDB 3.4 deployments,
              Enables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 3.2
              <3.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

              .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

          - If set on MongoDB 3.6 deployments,
              Disables the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 3.4
              <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

      * - ``"3.2"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 Deployments*

          Disables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data
          incompatible with MongoDB 3.2 <3.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

   The optional ``writeConcern`` specifies the write concern
   :ref:`wc-wtimeout` value in milliseconds:

   - The time period that the :term:`primary` waits for
     acknowledgment from the majority of the replica set members. If the
     acknowledgment is not received in the time period, the operation
     fails.

   - Default is ``60000`` milliseconds. Use a longer time period if the
     :term:`secondary` members of the replica set have a delay that
     exceeds the :ref:`wc-wtimeout` default.

Behavior
--------

Conflicts with Background Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain background operations may prevent
execution of :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`. Use 
:dbcommand:`currentOp` to identify any ongoing operations.

Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-table-featureCompatibilityVersion-defaults.rst

Idempotency
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection. If
for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you can
safely retry the command as the operation is idempotent.

Feature Compatibility in Arbiters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/arbiter-fcv.rst

For example, an arbiter in a MongoDB |newversion| cluster, has an FCV
value of |oldversion|.

Examples
--------

.. _view-fcv:

View FeatureCompatibilityVersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance, run the following command on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

.. note::

   The operation is undefined on the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. For a
   sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the command
   against a member of the shard replica set, you must connect to the
   member as a :ref:`shard local user <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

In the results document, the format of the
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` depends on the MongoDB version. Click
on the tab for the appropriate MongoDB version.

.. tabs::

   tabs:

      - id: mongodb-36-or-greater
        name: For MongoDB 3.6 or greater
        content: |

           For MongoDB 3.6 or greater :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances:

           - If the deployment has the default ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, or
             if the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command has run
             successfully against the deployment, the
             ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the form:

             .. code-block:: javascript

                "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
                   "version" : <version>
                }

           - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is in a partially upgraded or downgraded
             state, the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the following form:

             .. code-block:: javascript

                "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
                   "version" : <version> ,
                   "targetVersion" : <target version>
                }

             For instance, if a sharded cluster has a shard replica set that is
             read only when you run :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`
             command against the :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the command will fail, and the
             ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the config servers will include
             the ``targetVersion`` field.

             Or if a replica set becomes read only while
             :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running, the command
             will fail, and the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the replica set
             will include the ``targetVersion`` field as well.

      - id: mongodb-3.4
        name: For MongoDB 3.4

           For MongoDB 3.4 :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances:
