This tutorial describes how to create a three-member
:term:`replica set` from three existing :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.
The tutorial provides two procedures: one for development and test systems; and
a one for production systems.

To instead deploy a replica set from a single standalone MongoDB
instance, see :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`. For
additional information regarding replica set deployments, see
:doc:`/core/replication` and :doc:`/administration/replica-set-architectures`.

Overview
--------

Three member :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide enough redundancy to survive most
network partitions and other system failures. Additionally, these sets
have sufficient capacity for many distributed read operations. Most
deployments require no additional members or configuration.

Requirements
------------

Most replica sets consist of three or more :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances. [#odd-numbered-set-sizes]_ This tutorial
describes a three member set. Production environments should have at
least three distinct systems so that each system can run its own
instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod`. For development systems you can run all three instances
of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process on a local system or within a virtual
instance. For production environments, you should maintain as much separation
between members as possible. For example, when using virtual
machines for production deployments, each member
should live on a separate host server, served by redundant power circuits and with
redundant network paths.

.. [#odd-numbered-set-sizes] To ensure smooth :ref:`elections
   <replica-set-elections>` always design replica sets with odd numbers
   of members. Use :ref:`replica-set-arbiters` to ensure the set has
   odd number of voting members and avoid tied elections.

Procedures
----------

These procedures assume you already have instances of MongoDB
installed on the systems you will add as members of your
:term:`replica set`. If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the
:ref:`installation tutorials <tutorials-installation>`.

Deploy a Development or Test Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this procedure create a new replica set named ``rs0``.

1. Before creating your replica set, verify that every member can
   successfully connect to every other member. The network
   configuration must allow all possible connections between any
   two members. To test connectivity, see
   :ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection`.

#. Start three instances of :binary:`~bin.mongod` as members of a replica
   set named ``rs0``, as described in this step. For ephemeral tests and
   the purposes of this guide, you may run the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances in separate windows of GNU Screen. OS X and most Linux
   distributions come with screen installed by default [#screen]_
   systems.

   a. Create the necessary data directories by issuing a command
      similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mkdir -p /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 /srv/mongodb/rs0-2

   #. Issue the following commands, each in a distinct screen window:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 --replSet rs0
         mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 --replSet rs0
         mongod --port 27019 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-2 --replSet rs0

      This starts each instance as a member of a replica set named
      ``rs0``, each running on a distinct port. If you are already using
      these ports, you can select different ports. See the documentation
      of the following options for more information: :option:`--port
      <mongod --port>`, :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, and
      :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and connect to the first
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, with the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --port 27017

#. Create a replica set configuration object in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
   shell environment to use to initiate the replica set with the
   following sequence of operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rsconf = {
                 _id: "rs0",
                 members: [
                            {
                             _id: 0,
                             host: "<hostname>:27017"
                            }
                          ]
               }

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate a replica set consisting of
   the current member and using the default configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate( rsconf )

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

#. Add the second and third :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances to the replica
   set using the :method:`rs.add()` method. Replace ``<hostname>`` with
   your system's hostname in the following examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("<hostname>:27018")
      rs.add("<hostname>:27019")

   After these commands return you have a fully functional replica set.
   New replica sets elect a :term:`primary` within a few seconds.

#. Check the status of your replica set at any time with the
   :method:`rs.status()` operation.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`
   - :method:`rs.add()`

   You may also consider the `simple setup script
   <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-snippets/blob/master/replication/simple-setup.py>`_
   as an example of a basic automatically configured replica set.

   ``screen`` on Debian-based, Fedora/Red Hat-based, and Arch Linux.

Deploy a Production Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Production replica sets are very similar to the development or testing
deployment described above, with the following differences:

- Each member of the replica set resides on its own machine, and
  the MongoDB processes all bind to port ``27017``, which is the
  standard MongoDB port.

- Each member of the replica set must be accessible by way of
  resolvable DNS or hostnames in the following scheme:

  - ``mongodb0.example.net``
  - ``mongodb1.example.net``
  - ``mongodb2.example.net``

  Configure DNS names appropriately, *or* set up your systems'
  ``/etc/hosts`` file to reflect this configuration.

- You specify run-time configuration on each system in a
  :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>` stored in
  ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` or in a related location. You *do not* specify
  run-time configuration through command line options.

  For each MongoDB instance, use the following configuration. Set
  configuration values appropriate to your systems:

  .. code-block:: cfg

     port = 27017

     bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

     dbpath = /srv/mongodb/

     fork = true

     replSet = rs0

  You do not need to specify an interface with :setting:`bind_ip`.
  However, if you do not specify an interface, MongoDB listens for
  connections on all available IPv4 interfaces. Modify
  :setting:`bind_ip` to reflect a secure interface on your system that
  is able to access all other members of the set *and* on which all
  other members of the replica set can access the current member. The
  DNS or host names must point and resolve to this IP address.
  Configure network rules or a virtual private network (i.e. "VPN") to
  permit this access.

  For more documentation on run time options used above and on
  additional configuration options, see
  :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

To deploy a production replica set:

1. Before creating your replica set, verify that every member can
   successfully connect to every other member. The network
   configuration must allow all possible connections between any
   two members. To test connectivity, see
   :ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection`.

#. On each system start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing a
   command similar to following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

   .. note::

      In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
      :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this
      command. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to this host:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate a replica set consisting of
   the current member and using the default configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

#. Add two members to the replica set by issuing a sequence of commands
   similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
      rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")

   After these commands return you have a fully functional replica set.
   New replica sets elect a :term:`primary` within a few seconds.

#. Check the status of your replica set at any time with the
   :method:`rs.status()` operation.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`
   - :method:`rs.add()`
