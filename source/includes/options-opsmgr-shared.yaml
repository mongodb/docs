  - Authentication credentials for the :parameter:`authentication
    mechanism <authenticationMechanisms>` used on the |application|
    database.

  See the following example connection strings:

  Replica Sets
    If you use a :term:`replica set` for the database's :doc:`backing
    instance </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`, specify
    all members of the replica set, as shown in the following example.
    If you omit the port number, |onprem| uses the default ``27017``
    port for all hosts.

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://db1.example.com:40000,db2.example.com:40000,db3.example.com:40000

    .. note::

       |onprem| does not require the
       :ref:`replicaSet <replica-set-options>` option in the |uri|.

  Default MongoDB Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using the MongoDB ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or
    ``MONGODB-CR`` challenge-response mechanisms, the connection string
    must include authentication credentials. The |application| must
    authenticate as a MongoDB user with the following roles:

    - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`

    - :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase`.

    - :authrole:`clusterAdmin` if the database is a sharded cluster,
      otherwise :authrole:`clusterMonitor`

    Prefix the hostname with the MongoDB username and password in the
    form ``<username>:<password>@``

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodbuser1:password@mydb1.example.com:40000

  x.509 Certificate Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication, you
    must first add the value of the *subject* from the client
    certificate as a MongoDB user, as described in :manual:`Use x.509
    Certificates to Authenticate Clients
    </tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication>` in the MongoDB
    manual. The client certificate is contained in the PEM file you
    specify in the :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFile` setting. Once you
    have created the user, prefix the host specified in
    :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` with the name of the new user and append
    ``authMechanism=MONGODB-X509`` after the specified port:

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://<new_mongodb_user>@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=MONGODB-X509

  |ldap| Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using |ldap|, prefix the hostname with the
    MongoDB username and password in the form
    ``<username>:<password>@``, and append the
    ``authMechanism=PLAIN&authSource=$external`` options after the
    port:

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodbuser1:password@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=PLAIN&authSource=$external

  Kerberos Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using Kerberos, prefix the hostname with the
    Kerberos user principal and specify the authentication mechanism,
    ``authMechanism=GSSAPI``, after the port.

    Kerberos user principal names have the form ``<username>@<KERBEROS
    REALM>``. You must escape the user principal, replacing symbols
    with the |url| encoded representation. A Kerberos user principal of
    ``username@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM`` would therefore become
    ``username%40REALM.EXAMPLE.COM``.

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://username%40REALM.EXAMPLE.COM@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=GSSAPI

    To enable Kerberos authentication between the |application| and the
    :ref:`backup-database`, review the following settings:

    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.conf`
    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.kdc`
    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.realm`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.debug`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.keyTab`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.principal`

  Specifies whether to use MongoDB Community or Enterprise binaries
  for :doc:`backup </tutorial/nav/backup-deployments>`.

  Accepted values are:

  - {{entpref}}
  - {{entreq}}
  - {{comreq}}

  When {{entreq}} or {{comreq}} is selected, |mms| only uses those
  binaries for backup. When {{entpref}} is selected, |mms| uses
  Enterprise binaries if available and Community binaries if they are
  not.

  .. note::

     When {{entreq}} is selected, you must either set {{entdl}} to
     ``true`` or manually place Enterprise binaries in the {{versdir}}
     in :doc:`Local Mode </tutorial/configure-local-mode>`.

  .. warning::

     Backup fails when either {{entreq}} or {{comreq}} is selected,
     but the {{versdir}} does not contain the required binary.
