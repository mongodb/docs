  a. Drag the ``director`` property from the :guilabel:`Fields`
     section of the Chart Builder view to the :guilabel:`X Axis`
     encoding channel. This tells |charts| to create a column
     for each ``director`` value in the dataset.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``awards`` field to
     expand the ``awards`` object and view its properties.

  #. Drag the ``awards.wins`` field to the :guilabel:`Y Axis`
     encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel
     determines which field to use for the chart's
     :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`.

     .. cssclass:: admonition-example
     .. admonition:: Aggregation

        :manual:`Aggregation <aggregation>` processes data records
        using a wide variety of methods and returns computed results
        which may not be available in the original dataset. Because we
        are interested in the total number of awards won by each
        director, we use the ``awards.wins`` field here and will use
        an aggregation operator which will allow us to add up the
        total wins for each director.

  #. Leave the :guilabel:`Aggregate` dropdown menu for the
     :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel on its default
     value of :guilabel:`sum`. This value directs the aggregation
     operation to return the total number of award wins for each
     director.

  At this point there are too many columns in our X axis to show any
  meaningful results. To bring the number down to a manageable level,
  we'll sort the directors by their total number of awards won in
  descending order, then apply a :ref:`limit <charts-limit-data>` to get
  the top ten:

  1. In the :guilabel:`X Axis` channel, expand the
     :guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown and select
     :guilabel:`Aggregated Value`.

  #. To order the results in descending order, click the
     :guilabel:`AZ` order button located to the right of the
     :guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown.

  #. Apply a limit to the number of columns in the :guilabel:`X Axis` by
     toggling :guilabel:`Limit Results`, then setting :guilabel:`Show`
     to ``10``.

title: Group awards by genre.
ref: add-genres
level: 4
content: |
  a. Drag the ``genres`` field to the :guilabel:`Series` encoding
     channel, then click on the :guilabel:`Array Reductions` dropdown
     menu and select ``unwind array``. The X axis columns are now
     broken down by movie genre.

     .. note::

        Some movies contain more than one genre, so the numbers
        shown in the columns may not be the exact number of awards
        for each director.
