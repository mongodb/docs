What is the MongoDB Connector for BI?
=====================================

   :description: Enable SQL-based queries on MongoDB data using the BI Connector to integrate with relational business intelligence tools like Tableau and Power BI.

Traditional business intelligence tools work with flat, tabular data.
These tools aren't sophisticated enough to understand three-dimensional
data stored in MongoDB databases.

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows you to
create queries with |sql| to visualize, graph, and report on your
three-dimensional MongoDB data using relational 
business intelligence tools such as :doc:`Tableau </connect/tableau>`
and :doc:`Power BI </connect/powerbi>`.

.. note::

   As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and
   the |bi-short|, you can use :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` to create
   data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections.

The |bi| acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a
|mongod| or |mongos| instance and your reporting tool. The |bi-short|
stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your MongoDB cluster with
business intelligence tools.

System Components
-----------------

The |bi-short| deployment includes the following components:

BI tool
  Visualization and reporting tool, such as Tableau and PowerBI.

|jdbc| or |odbc| driver
  Provides a standard method to connect to the |bi-short| and MongoDB
  databases from a BI tool. Depending on what your BI tool supports, you
  can use |jdbc| or |odbc| drivers to connect to the |bi-short|.

BI Connector
  Provides a relational schema and translates |sql|
  queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.

MongoDB database
  MongoDB database deployment, either a self-managed MongoDB server 
  or hosted {+atlas+} cluster.

   :alt: Diagram showing that other BI tools communicate with the DSN, which communicates with MongoDB's BI Connector, which in turn communicates with the MongoDB database.

Your **BI tool** and **driver** typically run on your local machine. 
Your **{+bi-short+} instance** and your **database** can run on your 
local machine, in a data center, or hosted in the cloud.

|bi-short| Configurations
-------------------------

The following table outlines the supported configurations for the 
|bi-short| and MongoDB database deployments:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - |bi-short| configuration
     - {+atlas-short+} Database (hosted)
     - MongoDB Database (self-managed)
  
   * - {+atlas-short+} |bi-short| (hosted)
     - :icon:`check`

       *Clusters M10 and greater only*
     -

   * - |bi-short| (self-managed)
     - :icon:`check`
     - :icon:`check`

The following sections describe these configurations:

Hosted Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, your database and |bi-short| 
applications both run on {+atlas+}, MongoDB's fully-managed 
database-as-a-service. Databases hosted on {+atlas+} natively support 
the |bi-short|.

.. note::

   You must have an M10 or higher {+atlas+} cluster to enable the 
   built-in |bi-short|.

:ref:`Enable the BI Connector <enable-bi-atlas>` for {+atlas+}, then 
use the connection information that {+atlas-short+} provides to 
configure your |jdbc| or |odbc| driver.

Hosted Database and Self-Managed |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, your MongoDB database runs on any tier of 
{+atlas-short+} cluster and you install and manage the |bi-short| 
locally or on your network.

:ref:`Install <installation-guides>` and :ref:`launch <launch>` the 
|bi-short|, specifying a remote database address, then configure your 
|jdbc| or |odbc| driver to connect to the |bi-short|.

Self-Managed Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, you install and manage both the MongoDB database 
and |bi-short| applications, either locally or on your network.

:ref:`Install <installation-guides>` and :ref:`launch <launch>` the 
|bi-short|, then configure your |jdbc| or |odbc| driver to connect to 
the |bi-short| server address.

Local Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run
MongoDB and the |bi-short| on your desktop. This configuration might be 
helpful for proofs of concept or as a way to explore the possibilities 
of data visualization with the |bi-short|.

Learn more about setting up a local |bi-short| test installation
in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </local-quickstart>`.
