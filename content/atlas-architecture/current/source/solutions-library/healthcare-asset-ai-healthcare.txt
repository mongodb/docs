Predictive AI for Early Detection  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
Predictive AI is critical in healthcare as it aids in accurate
diagnosis, relying on predictions from large datasets compared with
manual analysis, which is likely to bring in manual errors. `Microsoft
Fabric Data Science
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/data-science-overview>`__
presents a robust platform to train and experiment with ML Models and
manage MLOps cycles. In this solution, we trained two models: 
  
1. **BI-RADS prediction**    

   BI-RADS is an industry standard mechanism to describe mammogram
   findings and is classified in seven categories with a score of
   possibility of a malignant cancer increasing with the score value
   from 0 to 6. VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
   model. It is trained on mammogram images from the `dataset
   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asmaasaad/king-abdulaziz-university-mammogram-dataset>`__
   on Kaggle, which were grouped in folders as per their BI-RADS. Image
   analysis needs deep neural network models and the best model needs to
   be selected based on training on actual datasets running into
   multiple epochs.  

   Fabric Data Science is used to train the models, run experiments, and
   manage the multiple versions. Multiple experiments were run with the
   two algorithms VGG16 and EfficientNetV2L, and the easy comparison of
   the multiple ML parameters and metrics for each version helps in the
   selection process of the final model. The images for training are
   directly uploaded to the Lakehouse in OneLake from the user's local
   machine using the UI itself. Additionally, the images stored in Azure
   Blob Storage can be easily referenced in the notebook downloading
   them from the blob URL using wget/curl, referencing using `shortcuts
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/get-started-shortcuts>`__,
   or even using a `data pipeline
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/tutorial-lakehouse-data-ingestion>`__.
   The image metadata and final prediction are stored in MongoDB Atlas.    
  
#. **Biopsy classification**    

   For the use case of binary classification of the cancer as malignant
   or benign, classification or regression models can be used. Random
   forest classifier model is trained on a `dataset
   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninjacoding/breast-cancer-wisconsin-benign-or-malignant>`__
   from Kaggle, with nine input parameters such as clump thickness,
   uniformity of cell size and shape, bare nuclei, mitoses, etc. Based
   on the values of these parameters the model is able to predict if the
   cancer is malignant or benign. In production use cases, more
   parameters can be added and the model can be trained from their
   values to be able to predict with more accuracy. Random forest model
   gave an accuracy of more than 97% and thus was ideal for this use
   case. The training dataset is fetched from MongoDB Atlas and
   prediction output is updated back to MongoDB, thanks to the `MongoDB
   Spark Connector
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/spark-connector/current/>`__.    
  
Fabric Data Science makes the training and managing the end-to-end ML
lifecycle easy and intuitive. Fabric Data Science manages the lifecycle
by auto logging related parameters for each experiment and model using
the de-facto data science standards of MLflow.  
  
Vector Search Implementation  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
`Vector Search
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/vector-search>`__ capabilities
form the foundation of the solution's intelligent querying system,
implemented in three key stages:  
  
1. **Data preparation**   

   - Clinical notes are processed using Azure OpenAI's
     text-embedding-ada-002 model.

   - Data is converted into vector embeddings for high-dimensional space
     representation.

   - Vector embeddings are stored in MongoDB Atlas with optimized search
     indexes.    
  
#. **Query processing**    

   - Natural language queries are converted to vector representations.

   - Semantic understanding enables complex medical queries.

   - Query vectors are matched against stored embeddings.
  
#. **Document retrieval**    

   - Atlas Search executes similarity-based searches.

   - Returns relevant medical records based on semantic matching.

   - Enables intuitive access to patient information.

RAG-based Chatbot Architecture  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
The chatbot implementation leverages `retrieval augmented generation
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/retrieval-augmented-generation>`__
(RAG) architecture with three distinct data contexts:  
  
1. **Patient information retrieval**    

   - Executes queries to fetch current patient details.

   - Retrieves structured patient data from MongoDB collections.

   - Provides immediate access to critical patient information.
  
2. **Historical data processing**    

   - Accesses 10-year patient history from MongoDB Atlas.

   - Decodes and summarizes historical data through Azure OpenAI LLM.

   - Implements thought chaining for context-aware responses.
  
3. **Medical knowledge integration**    

   - Uses vectorized medical documentation.

   - Performs real-time vectorial searches based on the query's context.

   - Integrates relevant medical literature and case studies.

   :alt: Blueprint for the Chatbot architecture  
  
   Figure 4. Blueprint for the chatbot architecture  
  
Analytics and Visualization  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
The solution leverages two complementary visualization platforms for    
comprehensive analytics.

First, MongoDB Atlas Charts provides native, real-time operational
dashboards directly connected to MongoDB data. It enables immediate
insights into critical healthcare metrics through intuitive
visualizations without requiring data transformations or additional
tools. The operational dashboard (Figure 5) demonstrates key metrics
including patient numbers, appointment status, and clinic distribution.

   :alt: Atlas Charts Dashboard  
  
   Figure 5. Operational dashboard with Atlas Charts  
  
Then, Power BI integration extends the analytics capabilities by
enabling enterprise-wide data analysis and advanced visualizations.
Through the `MongoDB Atlas Connector
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/mongodb-atlas-sql-interface>`__,
healthcare data can be combined with other enterprise sources in
Microsoft OneLake. The geographical visualization dashboard (Figure 6)
showcases this integration, displaying patient distribution and enabling
sophisticated analytical capabilities.
