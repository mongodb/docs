Install Relational Migrator to run as an unattended server on Windows. By running 
as an unattended server, Relational Migrator binds to any IP and port on the server 
and is exposes it as a web application.

Steps
-----

1. Log in to the server.

   You can log into the server interactively or using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   For more information on logging into the server using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
   see `Connect to your Windows Instances using RDP <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html#connect-rdp>`__. 

#. Download the Relational Migrator ``.msi`` installer. 

   Download the Relational Migrator ``.msi`` installer to the target machine or 
   remotely copy it over to the instance. Find the latest Relational Migrator 
   installer on the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Launch the installer and follow the local machine :ref:`install instructions <local-machine-install>`. 

#. Enable Relational Migrator to run as an unattended server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 
   Your ``user.properties`` file is located in 
   ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\Relational Migrator\Data``.

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   It is recommended that the unattended server installation is supplemented with 
   TLS/SSL configuration because Relational Migrator can be bound to any IP and port on 
   the server. For additional information, see `TLS/SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that Relational Migrator runs on.

   By default, Relational Migrator is configured to run on port 8278.
   To change the port Relational Migrator runs on, update the ``server.port`` line 
   in your ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port.

#. Run Relational Migrator from its installed location or any shortcuts that were 
   created during the installation process. 

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\Relational Migrator\Data\Logs``.
 
   - When running Relational Migrator as a system service, the path is under the 
     service user’s home directory. The local system user’s profile is located 
     at ``C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile``.
