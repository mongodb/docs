Considerations
--------------

- You can pause a cluster:

  - In the ``M10`` or larger tiers.
  - If it doesn't use :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`.

- You can't:

  - Modify the configuration of a paused cluster.
  - Read data from or write data to a paused cluster.

- For paused clusters, |service|:

  - Bills you at a different rate.
  - Doesn't trigger configured alerts.
  - Stops all backups. Your existing snapshots remain until they
    expire.

.. _pause-cluster:

Pause One Cluster
-----------------

You can pause a cluster for 30 days. If you don't resume the cluster
within 30 days, |service| resumes the cluster.

To pause a |service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/pause-cluster.rst

Resume One Cluster
------------------

To resume a paused |service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/resume-cluster.rst

.. note::

   If you don't resume the cluster within 30 days, |service| resumes
   the cluster.

.. _terminate-cluster:

Terminate One Cluster
---------------------

To terminate |a-service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the cluster after completing any in-progress
deployment changes.

|service| bills for the hours that the cluster was active. To learn
more about |service| billing, see :doc:`/billing`.

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

.. admonition:: Public IP Reusable within 36 Hours
   :class: note

   When you terminate a cluster, |service| reserves the cluster's
   public |ipaddr| address, bound to its original cluster name, for 36
   hours. If, in that time frame, you create a new cluster with the
   same name, |service| reassigns the reserved public |ipaddr| address
   to that cluster.

   Cluster |ipaddr| addresses don't change when clusters are paused
   then resumed.
