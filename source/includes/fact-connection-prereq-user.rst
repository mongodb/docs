MongoDB User
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access a cluster, you must create a
:manual:`MongoDB User </core/security-users/>` with access to the
desired database(s) on your |service| cluster. MongoDB users are
separate from |service| users. MongoDB users have access to MongoDB
databases, while |service| users have access to the |service|
application itself.

You can create a MongoDB user to access to your |service| cluster in
the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the MongoDB user from
the :ref:`Clusters view <mongodb-users>`.
