    .. topic:: Using a Different Path than ``/var/lib``

       By default, the Automation Agent binaries and |mms|
       configuration backup file are located in ``/var/lib/mongodb-mms-
       automation``. If you want to store these files in a different
       directory, follow these procedures:

       **To change the location of the Automation Agent Binaries:**

       a. Click :guilabel:`Deployment`; :guilabel:`Agents`; and then
          :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings`.

       b. Below the :guilabel:`Download Directory` heading, click the
          pencil icon to the right of the path shown in
          :guilabel:`Download Directory (Linux/MacOS)`.

       c. Change the path to the new path you want.

       d. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

       e. Create the new directory you specified on each host that runs
          an Automation Agent.

          .. code-block:: sh

               sudo mkdir -m 755 -p /<newPath>

          .. important::
             Make sure the system user that runs the Automation Agent
             can write to this new directory.

       **To change the location of the Automation Agent configuration backup:**

       a. Open the
          :ref:`Automation Agent configuration file <automation-agent-config-file-location>`
          in your preferred text editor.

       b. Change the :asetting:`mmsConfigBackup` setting to the new path for
          the configuration backup file.

          .. code-block: ini

             mmsConfigBackup=/<newPath>/mms-cluster-config-backup.json

       c. Save the Automation Agent configuration file.

       d. Move the configuration backup file to the new directory.

          .. code-block:: sh

             sudo mv /var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation/mms-cluster-config-backup.json /<newPath>
