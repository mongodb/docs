You can use |compass| to generate queries using natural 
language. |compass-short| uses AI to generate queries based on prompts 
you provide. Querying with natural language can be a helpful starting 
point and assist you in learning to write MongoDB queries.

About this Task
---------------

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-natural-language-query.rst

- You can query with natural language to create both queries and 
  aggregations. If your prompt results in an aggregation, you are 
  automatically redirected to the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab and 
  a pop-up displays indicating your prompt requires aggregation stages.

- You can also provide natural language prompts on the 
  :ref:`aggregations tab <compass-prompt-natural-language-agg>`.

- This page uses the :ref:`sample_mflix.movies <sample-mflix>` 
  collection from the Atlas sample dataset.
