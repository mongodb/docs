The flexible schema model of MongoDB allows a given field to contain
data of multiple types, while relational databases restrict columns to a
single data type. The |bi-short| samples data from MongoDB to generate a
relational schema model, but
:ref:`type conversion <type-conversion-modes>` conflicts may occur
when the |bi-short| samples different data types from a field in
MongoDB documents.

There are two main categories of type conversion conflicts that may
occur in the presence of multiple data types: conflicts
between scalar types and conflicts involving composite types like
documents and arrays.

.. note::

   The |bi-short| only uses the sampled subset of your data to
   detect type conflicts during schema generation. If your data set
   contains type conflicts on a field and the conflicting types were
   not both present in the sample, the generated schema will not be
   prepared to resolve these conflicts and may result in increased query
   latency.

   For more information on sampling configuration, such as setting
   the :option:`--samplesize <mongosqld --sampleSize>` and
   :option:`--schemaRefreshIntervalSecs <mongosqld --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs>`,
   see :ref:`msqld-schema-options`.

Scalar-Scalar Conflicts
-----------------------

When a scalar-scalar confict occurs, the |bi-short| uses the following
lattice to determine the least upper bound of the two different data
types:

   :alt: Scalar-scalar type lattice
   :figwidth: 500px

.. example::

   If a given field contains ``int``, ``double``, and ``string`` types,
   the least upper bound is ``string``.

When a scalar-scalar conflict occurs, the |bi-short| inserts a row into
the ``information_schema.COLUMNS`` table and lists the different sampled
types in the ``COLUMN_COMMENT`` column.

Composite Conflicts
-------------------

Composite conflicts are type conversion conflicts involving a document
or an array. The following sections describe how the |bi-short| resolves
both types of composite conflicts.

Document Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a conflict occurs involving a document, the |bi-short|
displays the fields of the document type as separate columns using
dot notation. For example, the ``conflict`` collection contains the
following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { _id: 0, a: "foo" } // "a" is scalar (string)
   { _id: 1, a: { a: "bar", b: "baz" } } // "a" is composite (document)

The |bi-short| detects a scalar-composite conflict and generates the
following relational schema:

**Table:** ``conflict``

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - _id
     - a
     - a.a
     - a.b

   * - 0
     - "foo"
     - ``NULL``
     - ``NULL``

   * - 1
     - ``NULL``
     - "bar"
     - "baz"

When a conflict occurs involving a document, the |bi-short| inserts a
row into the ``information_schema.COLUMNS`` table and lists the
different sampled types in the ``COLUMN_COMMENT`` column.

Array Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a conflict occurs involving an array, the |bi-short| creates a new
table for the conflict field with a column for the foreign key, array
index, and value. The |bi-short| unwinds the array into multiple rows in
new table and fills in the columns accordingly. For example, the
``conflict`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { _id: 0, a: "foo" } // "a" is scalar (string)
   { _id: 1, a: ["bar", "baz"] } // "a" is composite (array)

The |bi-short| renders the above into the following two tables:

**Table:** ``conflict``

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - _id

   * - 0

   * - 1

**Table:** ``conflict_a``

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 34 33 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - _id
     - a_idx
     - a

   * - 0
     - ``NULL``
     - "foo"

   * - 1
     - 0
     - "bar"

   * - 1
     - 1
     - "baz"

When a conflict occurs involving an array, the |bi-short|:

- Inserts a row into the ``information_schema.COLUMNS`` table and lists
  any different types sampled in the ``COLUMN_COMMENT`` column

- Inserts a row into the ``information_schema.TABLES`` table containing
  information on how the array maps to the row in the
  ``information_schema.COLUMNS`` table
