.. meta::
   :keywords: test connection, runnable, code example

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Implement the function to insert data

      Replace the ``store()`` method in the ``MovieController.php`` file,
      located in the ``app/Http/Controllers`` directory with the following
      code:

      .. code-block:: php

         public function store(Request $request)
         {
             $data = $request->all();
             $movie = new Movie();
             $movie->fill($data);
             $movie->save();
         }

   .. step:: Add an API route that calls the controller function

      Generate an API route file by running the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         php artisan install:api

      .. tip::

         Skip this step if you are using Laravel 10.x because the file that
         the command generates already exists.

      Import the controller and add an API route that calls the ``store()``
      method in the ``routes/api.php`` file:

      .. code-block:: php

         use App\Http\Controllers\MovieController;

         // ...

         Route::resource('movies', MovieController::class)->only([
             'store'
         ]);

   .. step:: Update the model fields

      Update the ``Movie`` model in the ``app/Models`` directory to
      specify the fields that the ``fill()`` method populates as shown in the
      following code:

      .. code-block:: php
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         class Movie extends Model
         {
              protected $connection = 'mongodb';
              protected $fillable = ['title', 'year', 'runtime', 'imdb', 'plot'];
         }

   .. step:: Post a request to the API

      Create a file called ``movie.json`` and insert the following data:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "title": "The {+odm-long+} Quick Start",
           "year": 2024,
           "runtime": 15,
           "imdb": {
             "rating": 9.5,
             "votes": 1
           },
           "plot": "This movie entry was created by running through the {+odm-long+} Quick Start tutorial."
         }

      Send the JSON payload to the endpoint as a ``POST`` request by running
      the following command in your shell:

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @movie.json http://localhost:8000/api/movies

   .. step:: View the data

      Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/browse_movies in your web browser to view
      the movie information that you submitted. The inserted movie appears at
      the top of the results.
