Data sources in |charts| reference a :ref:`collection <collections>`
or :ref:`view <3.4-reference-views>` in your MongoDB
deployment. The fields in that collection or view can be used
to contruct a chart. When building a chart, you will need to specify
the data source that the chart uses.

To view, add, or remove data sources, click :guilabel:`Data Sources` on
the top navigation bar.

.. _data-sources-view:

Data Sources View
-----------------

The :guilabel:`Data Sources` view displays existing data sources that
the currently logged-in user has permission to view. The data sources
are displayed in a tabular format with the following columns:

   :alt: Diagram of the "Data Sources" view
   :figwidth: 750px

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 72

   * - Column
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Deployment`
     - The MongoDB deployment containing the source database and
       collection. Identified by the |service| cluster associated
       with the |charts-short| instance.

   * - :guilabel:`Database`
     - The database containing the source collection or view.

   * - :guilabel:`Collection`
     - The collection or view from where |charts-short| retrieves data.

   * - :guilabel:`Alias`
     - Optional. The display name of the data source used by the
       Chart Builder. Providing an :guilabel:`Alias` may result in a
       shorter and more identifiable name when selecting a data source
       in the :doc:`chart builder </build-charts>`.

       To modify the :guilabel:`Alias` for a data source, see the
       :ref:`Modify a Data Source <mod-data-source-alias>`
       section.

   * - :guilabel:`Last modified`
     - The date the data source was last modified.

   * - :guilabel:`Permissions`
     - The icon next to the :guilabel:`Access` button denotes the
       :ref:`permissions <permission-model>` you have on the data
       source. For details on the various data source permissions, see
       :ref:`Data Source Permissions <permission-model>`.

       To modify the permissions for a data source, see the
       :ref:`Modify a Data Source <mod-data-source-permissions>`
       section.

.. note::

   You can sort data sources by any of the columns by clicking on the
   column header.

.. _filter-data-sources:

Filter Data Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for specific data sources, use the search bar at the
upper right corner of the :guilabel:`Data Sources` view. You can search
by :guilabel:`Deployment`, :guilabel:`Database`,
:guilabel:`Collection`, or :guilabel:`Alias`.

Additionally, you can use the dropdown to the left of the search bar to
show either all data sources on your |charts| deployment, or only data
sources for which you have the ``Owner`` permission. For more
information on data source permissions, see
:ref:`Data Source Permissions <permission-model>`.

.. _add-data-source:

Add a Data Source
-----------------

1. From the :guilabel:`Data Sources` view, click the
   :guilabel:`New Data Source` button.

#. Select one of the |service| clusters.

   |service| displays all clusters in the current project for which
   the current user has the :authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`
   role or higher.

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

#. Select the collections from which you wish to create data sources.
   |charts-short| creates a separate data source for each selected
   collection.

#. Click :guilabel:`Set Permissions`.

#. Set the :ref:`permissions <permission-model>` for the data source.

   By default, |service| assigns the :ref:`Reader <data-source-roles>`
   permission to every user in the project. To change a user's permission,
   search for the user by name or email address using the search bar.

   .. note::

      If you selected multiple collections for your data source in step
      4, the data source :ref:`permissions <permission-model>` you
      select are applied to all of the selected collections when you
      publish your data source. If you wish to apply different
      permissions to individual collections that you have selected, you
      will need to edit those data sources after publishing.

#. Click :guilabel:`Publish Data Source`.

You will see your newly added data source listed in the
:guilabel:`Data Sources` view. To learn how to manage existing
data sources, see :doc:`manage-data-sources`.
