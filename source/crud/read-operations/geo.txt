Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to search **geospatial data** with the
MongoDB Java Driver, and the different geospatial data formats supported by MongoDB.

Geospatial data is data that represents a geographic location on
the surface of the Earth. Examples of geospatial data include:

- Locations of movie theaters
- Borders of countries
- Routes of bicycle rides
- Dog exercise areas in New York City

Coordinates on Earth
--------------------

To store and query your geospatial data in MongoDB, use **GeoJSON**. GeoJSON is
a data format created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 

Here is the location of MongoDB headquarters in GeoJSON:

.. code-block:: json

   "MongoDB Headquarters" : {
      "type": "point",
      "coordinates": [-73.986805, 40.7620853]
   }

For definitive information on GeoJSON, see the
`official IETF specification <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`__.

GeoJSON Positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A position represents a single place on Earth, and exists in code as an array
containing two or three number values: 

- Longitude in the first position (required)
- Latitude in the second position (required)
- Elevation in the third position (optional)

.. important:: Longitude then Latitude

  GeoJSON orders coordinates as longitude first and latitude second. This might
  be surprising as geographic coordinate system conventions generally list
  latitude first and longitude second. Make sure to check what format any other
  tools you are working with use. Popular tools such as OpenStreetMap and Google
  Maps list coordinates as latitude first and longitude second.

GeoJSON Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your GeoJSON object's type determines its geometric shape. Geometric shapes are
made up of positions.

Here are some common GeoJSON types and how you can specify them with positions:

- ``Point``: a single position. This can represent the location of a
  `sculpture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Picasso>`__. 
- ``LineString``: an array of two or more positions, thus forming a series of line
  segments. This can represent
  `the route of the Great Wall of China <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GreatWallChina4.png>`__. 
- ``Polygon``: an array of positions in which the first and last
  position are the same, thus enclosing some space. This can represent 
  `the land within Vatican City <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vatican_City_map_EN.png>`__.


To learn more about the shapes you can use in MongoDB, see the
:manual:`GeoJSON manual entry </reference/geojson/>`.

Insert a Document Containing GeoJSON Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To insert a document that stores GeoJSON data, create a document that contains a GeoJSON
value and pass the document to the ``insertOne()`` method.

The following example inserts a document that includes a ``location.geo`` field,
which contains GeoJSON data:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertGeoJSONExample
   :end-before: end insertGeoJSONExample

To learn more about inserting documents, see the :ref:`java-fundamentals-insert` guide.

Index
~~~~~

To query data stored in the GeoJSON format, add the field containing
GeoJSON data to a ``2dsphere`` index. The following snippet creates a
``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field using the ``Indexes`` builder:

.. code-block:: java

   // <MongoCollection setup code here>
   collection.createIndex(Indexes.geo2dsphere("location.geo"));

For more information about the ``Indexes`` builder, see our 
:doc:`guide on the Indexes builder </builders/indexes>`.

.. guide resource

Coordinates on a 2D Plane
-------------------------

You can store geospatial data using ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates on 
a two-dimensional Euclidean plane. We refer to coordinates on a two-dimensional
plane as "legacy coordinate pairs".

Legacy coordinate pairs have the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   "<field name>" : [ x, y ]

Your field should contain an array of two values in which the first represents 
the ``x`` axis value and the second represents the ``y`` axis value.

Insert a Document Containing Legacy Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To insert a document that stores a legacy coordinate pair, create a document that
assigns a coordinate pair value to a field. Then, pass the document to the
``insertOne()`` method.

The following example inserts a document that includes a ``coordinates`` field,
which contains a legacy coordinate pair:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertLegacyExample
   :end-before: end insertLegacyExample

To learn more about inserting documents, see the :ref:`java-fundamentals-insert` guide.

Index
~~~~~

To query data stored as legacy coordinate pairs, you must add the field containing
legacy coordinate pairs to  a ``2d`` index. The following snippet creates a
``2d`` index on the ``coordinates`` field using the ``Indexes`` builder:

.. code-block:: java

   // <MongoCollection setup code here>
   collection.createIndex(Indexes.geo2d("coordinates"));

For more information about the ``Indexes`` builder, see our 
:doc:`guide on the Indexes builder </builders/indexes>`. 
   
For more information about legacy coordinate pairs, see the
:manual:`{+mdb-server+} manual page on legacy coordinate pairs </geospatial-queries/#legacy-coordinate-pairs>`.

.. tip:: Supported Operators

   Spherical (``2dsphere``) and flat (``2d``) indexes support some, but
   not all, of the same query operators. For a full list of operators
   and their index compatibility, see the
   :manual:`manual entry for geospatial queries </geospatial-queries/#geospatial-query-operators>`.

   .. external resource

Geospatial Queries
------------------

Geospatial queries consist of a query operator and GeoJSON shapes as query
parameters.

Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query your geospatial data, use one of the following query operators: 

- ``$near``
- ``$geoWithin``
- ``$nearSphere``
- ``$geoIntersects`` *requires a 2dsphere index*

You can specify these query operators in the MongoDB Java driver with the
``near()``, ``geoWithin()``, ``nearSphere()``, and ``geoIntersects()`` utility
methods of the ``Filters`` builder class.

For more information about geospatial query operators, see the
:manual:`manual entry for geospatial queries </geospatial-queries/#geospatial-query-operators>`.

.. external resource

For more information about ``Filters``, see our 
:doc:`guide on the Filters builder </builders/filters>`.  

Query Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a shape to use in a geospatial query, use the
``Position``, ``Point``, ``LineString``, and ``Polygon`` classes of the MongoDB
Java driver.

For a full list of the GeoJSON shapes available in the MongoDB Java driver, see the
`GeoJSON package
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/geojson/package-summary.html>`__
API Documentation.

Examples
--------

The following examples use the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset. You can learn how
to  set up your own free-tier Atlas cluster and how to load the sample dataset
in our :doc:`quick start guide </quick-start>`.

The examples use the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database
from the sample dataset. The ``theaters`` collection contains a ``2dsphere`` index
on the ``location.geo`` field.

The examples require the following imports:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin exampleImports
   :end-before: end exampleImports

You can find the  
`source code for the examples on Github here <https://github.com/mongodb/docs-java/blob/master/source/includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java>`__.

Query by Proximity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for and return documents from nearest to farthest from a point, use
the ``near()`` static utility method of the ``Filters`` builder class. The
``near()`` method constructs a query with the ``$near`` query operator. 

The following example queries for theaters between ``10,000`` and ``5,000``
meters from the 
`Great Lawn of Central Park <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lawn_and_Turtle_Pond>`__.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin findExample
   :end-before: end findExample

The output of the preceding code resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Bronx"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "New York"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "New York"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Long Island City"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "New York"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Secaucus"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Jersey City"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Elmhurst"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Flushing"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Flushing"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Flushing"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Elmhurst"}}}

.. tip:: Fun Fact

   MongoDB uses the
   :manual:`same reference system </reference/glossary/#std-term-WGS84>`
   as GPS satellites to calculate geometries over the Earth.

For more information about the ``$near`` operator, see  
:manual:`the reference documentation for $near </reference/operator/query/near/#mongodb-query-op.-near>`.

For more information about ``Filters``,
:doc:`see our guide on the Filters builder </builders/filters>`.

Query Within a Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for geospatial data within a specified shape use the ``geoWithin()``
static utility method of the ``Filters`` builder class. The ``geoWithin()``
method constructs a query with the ``$geoWithin`` query operator. 

The following example searches for movie theaters in a section of Long Island.

.. _example_range_query:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Geo.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin rangeExample
   :end-before: end rangeExample

The output of the preceding code resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Baldwin"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Levittown"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Westbury"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Mount Vernon"}}}
   {"location": {"address": {"city": "Massapequa"}}}

The following figure shows the polygon defined by the
``longIslandTriangle`` variable and dots representing the locations of
the movie theaters returned by our query. 

.. figure:: /includes/figures/geo_geometry.png
