Overview
--------

You can use the {+driver-short+} to connect to and communicate with
MongoDB. This guide shows you how to create an application that uses
the {+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on
MongoDB Atlas and interact with data.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this guide to connect a sample {+language+} application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see the :driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.
