The following sections describe information typing and provide
prototypes that show how to apply this strategy to our documentation.

What is Information Typing?
---------------------------

Information typing categorizes content by type based on your audience's
goals. Throughout the writing process, information typing helps keep the
information that you write focused on those goals.

Additionally, information typing accomplishes the following goals:

- Separate content into categories and delivers roughly one type at a
  time.

- Account for the purpose of a page before you write it.

- Answer the user question "why do I care?" or "what does this mean for
  me?" quickly.

- Use a suggested format to help you get started on a blank page.

What Information Types Do We Use?
---------------------------------

.. note:: DITA Document Types

   The information types used in MongoDB documentation are similar to
   `DITA Document Types
   <http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/errata02/os/complete/part3-all-inclusive/archSpec/technicalContent/dita-technicalContent-InformationTypes.html#dita_technicalContent_InformationTypes>`__.
   While we do not impose the same {+rst-abbrev+} requirements that are
   used in DITA, the high-level purposes of corresponding content types
   are largely the same.

Currently, some teams use the following information types:

Concept
  .. include:: /includes/info-typing/concept-overview.rst

Reference
  A reference page delivers granular details about a topic. The audience
  includes experienced users. Reference pages may describe the use of a
  method, operator, or database command.
