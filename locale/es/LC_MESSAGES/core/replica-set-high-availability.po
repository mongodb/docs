"The deployment of a replica set affects the outcome of failover situations. "
"To support effective failover, ensure that one facility can elect a primary "

"host the majority of the replica set. Place a majority of voting members and"
" all the members that can become primary in this facility. Otherwise, "
"network partitions could prevent the set from being able to form a majority."
