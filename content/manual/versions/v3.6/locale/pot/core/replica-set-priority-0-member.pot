msgid "A :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` member is a member that **cannot** become :term:`primary` and **cannot** trigger :term:`elections <election>`. Priority 0 members can acknowledge write operations issued with :ref:`write concern <write-concern>` of ``w : <number>``. For ``\"majority\"`` write concern, the priority 0 member must also be a voting member (i.e. :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is greater than ``0``) to acknowledge the write. Non-voting replica set members (i.e. :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is ``0``) cannot contribute to acknowledging write operations with ``\"majority\"`` write concern."

msgid "Other than the aforementioned restrictions, secondaries that have :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` function as normal secondaries: they maintains a copy of the data set, accept read operations, and vote in elections."

msgid "Configure a secondary to have *priority 0* to prevent it from becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-data center deployments."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, in the following diagram, one data center hosts the primary and a secondary. A second data center hosts a secondary with *priority 0*. Only the members in data center 1 can become primary."

msgid "Priority 0 Members as Standbys"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-priority-0-member.txt:43
msgid "A secondary with :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` can function as a standby. In some replica sets, it might not be possible to add a new member in a reasonable amount of time. A standby member keeps a current copy of the data to be able to replace an unavailable member."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-priority-0-member.txt:49
msgid "In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in replica sets with varied hardware or :ref:`geographic distribution <replica-set-geographical-distribution>`, a *priority 0* standby ensures that only certain members become primary."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-priority-0-member.txt:54
msgid "A *priority 0* standby may also be valuable for some members of a set with different hardware or workload profiles. In these cases, deploy a member with *priority 0* so it can't become primary. Also consider using an :ref:`hidden member <replica-set-hidden-members>` for this purpose."

msgid "When configuring a secondary to have :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>`, consider potential failover patterns, including all possible network partitions. Always ensure that your main data center contains both a quorum of voting members and members that are eligible to be primary."
