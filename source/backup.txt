   |backup| is a system that creates backups of
   MongoDB replica sets and sharded clusters. A lightweight agent runs
   within your infrastructure and captures data from your MongoDB
   deployment using the same mechanism as replication.
   |backup| hosts the backup data and snapshots using its own
   infrastructure.

   |backup| is currently in limited release, and is fully
   integrated with :doc:`MMS Monitoring </monitoring>`.

   This manual describes the process for registering and activating
   |backup|, the process for installing the Backup agent, and the basic
   procedures for enabling backups and restoring from a backup.

   As an alternative, you may consider the above procedures as a single
   tutorial: :doc:`/backup/tutorial`.

   If you have questions about |backup|, consider
   :doc:`/backup/faq` or open a support request via the |backup|
   interface.
