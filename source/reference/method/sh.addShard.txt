sh.addShard()
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: sh.addShard(host)

   :param host: Specify the hostname of a new shard server.

   Use this to add shard instances to the present :term:`shard
   cluster`. The ``host`` parameter can be in any of the following
   forms: ::

        [hostname]
        [hostname]:[port]
        [set]/[hostname]
        [set]/[hostname],[hostname]:port

   You can specify shards using the hostname, or a hostname and port
   combination if the shard is running on a non-standard port. A
   :term:`replica set` can also function as a shard member. In these
   cases supply :method:`addShard <sh.addShard()>` with the set name,
   followed by at least one existing member of the set as a seed in a
   comma separated list, as in the final two examples.

   This function provides a wrapper around the administrative command
   :dbcommand:`addShard`.
