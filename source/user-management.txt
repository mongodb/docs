Roles
-----

|charts-short| users are assigned one of the following roles upon
creation depending on whether they are a standard user or a user
administrator:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Role
     - Description

   * - ``User``
     - Authorized to add :doc:`data sources </data-sources>`, create
       :doc:`dashboards </dashboards>`, build
       :doc:`charts </build-charts>`, and change their own passwords.

       When sharing a data source or dashboard with a user, the roles
       granted to that user may authorize them to view, modify, or
       delete the shared resources. For more information, see
       :ref:`Data Source Permissions <permission-model>` and
       :ref:`Dashboard Permissions <dashboard-permissions>`.

   * - ``UserAdmin``
     - Includes all privileges from the ``User`` role and is authorized
       to add users, delete users, edit the profile of other users,
       and change the password of other users.

       User administrators are unable to view, modify, or delete
       the data sources and dashboards of other users unless they are
       shared with the appropriate permissions.

Add a User
----------

You can add a user either through the |charts-short| User Management
interface *or* by executing the ``charts-cli add-user`` script on the
|charts-short| host.

User Management Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a user, log in to |charts-short| as a user administrator with the
``UserAdmin`` role:

1. From the :guilabel:`User Management` view, click the
   :guilabel:`New User` button.

#. Fill in all form fields, then click :guilabel:`Add User`.

.. note::

   For more information on the actions each role authorizes, see
   :ref:`Roles <user-roles>`.

Add User Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System administrators with access to the |charts-short| host can add
users via the ``charts-cli add-user`` script.

.. include:: /includes/add-user-script.rst

.. note::

   The first |charts-short| user must be created using this script.
   Subsequent users can be added by either rerunning the script or using
   the user management interface.

Delete a User
-------------

.. important::

   Before deleting a user, update the permissions for any data sources
   or dashboards for which they are the sole owner. Any items owned
   solely by the user being deleted will not be transferred and may
   become orphaned.

To delete a user:

1. From the :guilabel:`User Management` view, click the red trash can
   icon on the right-hand side of the user you wish to delete.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete User` to confirm deletion.

Edit a Profile
--------------

User administrators can edit the profile of other users, including
other user administrators:

1. From the :guilabel:`User Management` view, click the ellipses,
   :guilabel:`...`, of the user whose profile you wish to edit.

#. Click :guilabel:`Edit Profile`.

#. Fill in the form and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. note::

   User administrators can not edit the email address of another
   user.

Change Passwords
----------------

In |charts|, users can change their own passwords and user
administrators can change the password of any user.

**To change your own password:**

1. Click the down arrow next to your name on the upper-right hand side
   of the application.

#. Click :guilabel:`Change Password`.

#. Fill in the form and click :guilabel:`Save`.

**To change another user's password as a user administrator:**

1. From the :guilabel:`User Management` view, click the ellipses,
   :guilabel:`...`, of the user whose password you wish to change.

#. Click :guilabel:`Change Password`.

#. Fill in the form and click :guilabel:`Save`.
