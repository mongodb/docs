The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is included as part of the :doc:`MongoDB
server installation </installation>`. If you have already installed the
server, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is installed to the same location
as the server binary.

Alternatively, if you would like to download the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell separately from the MongoDB Server, you can install the shell as 
a standalone package by following these steps:

1. Access the Download Center for your Edition of MongoDB:

   - `MongoDB Community Download Center 
     <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server>`__

   - `MongoDB Enterprise Download Center 
     <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`__
   
2. Select your preferred :guilabel:`Version` and :guilabel:`Platform`
   from the dropdowns.

3. Select the :guilabel:`Package` to download according to your
   platform:
