   There are two mutually exclusive options for Shard Keys:

   - Check :manual:`hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` if you want to use a
     hashed shard key.
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A Shard Key cannot be unique *and* hashed.

   .. note:: 
      If the field or fields chosen as the shard key are not indexed,
      |mms| creates an index for the shard key field(s) during this procedure.

   - A :term:`compound shard key` cannot be hashed, so the
     :guilabel:`hashed` checkbox is grayed out.
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A compound shard key cannot include more than three keys.
