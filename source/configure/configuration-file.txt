{+mcli+} Configuration File

The {+mcli+} configuration file stores related settings and
|api| keys in groups called *profiles*. You can define multiple profiles
so that you can use the {+mcli+} to access different MongoDB services or
projects from the same terminal. You can update the settings stored in
your configuration file by editing the file with a text editor or
by using the ``mongocli config set`` command.

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The first time you run the :ref:`mcli-config-command` command, the
{+mcli+} creates a configuration file called ``mongocli.toml`` and grants
you read and write access to the file. The {+mcli+} saves the
configuration file to the folder where your system stores application
configuration files, which is defined by the ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``
environment variable. By default, this location is the ``/.config``
folder of your home directory. If this folder doesn't exist, the
{+mcli+} creates the folder and grants you read, write, and execute
permissions.

Example
-------

The following example configuration file contains two profiles,
``default`` and ``myOpsManager``. The ``default`` profile contains |api|
keys, an organization ID, and a project ID for an |service| deployment.
The ``myOpsMgr`` profile contains |api| keys, the base |url|, an
organization ID, and a project ID for an |onprem| deployment.
