"In 2.4 MongoDB includes two new features related to indexes that users "
"upgrading to version 2.4 must consider, particularly with regard to "
"possible downgrade paths. For more information on downgrades, see "
":ref:`2.4-downgrade`."

"In 2.4 MongoDB adds two new index types: ``2dsphere`` and ``text``. These"
" index types do not exist in 2.2, and for each database, creating a "
"``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, will upgrade the data-file version and "
"make that database incompatible with 2.2."

"If you intend to downgrade, you should always drop all ``2dsphere`` and "

"You can use the :ref:`downgrade procedure <2.4-downgrade>` to downgrade "
"these databases and run 2.2 if needed, however this will run a full "
"database repair (as with :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`) for all affected "
"databases."

"In MongoDB 2.2 and earlier you could specify invalid index types that did"
" not exist. In these situations, MongoDB would create an ascending (e.g. "
"``1``) index. Invalid indexes include index types specified by strings "

"``1`` and ``-1``. [#grandfathered-indexes]_"

"In 2.4, indexes that specify a type of ``\"1\"`` or ``\"-1\"`` (the "

"warning on start-up. **However**, a :term:`secondary` in a replica set "
"cannot complete an initial sync from a primary that has a ``\"1\"`` or "
"``\"-1\"`` index. Avoid all indexes with invalid types."
