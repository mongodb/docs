.. note::

   The documents in the ``restaurants`` collection use the snake-case naming
   convention. The examples in this guide use a ``ConventionPack``
   to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to
   the properties in the ``Restaurant`` class.

   To learn more about custom serialization, see :ref:`csharp-custom-serialization`.
