Internal Authentication
=======================

You can authenticate members of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. For the internal authentication of
the members, MongoDB can use either keyfiles or :ref:`x.509 <security-auth-x509>`
certificates.

.. note::

   Enabling internal authentication also enables :doc:`client
   authorization </core/authorization>`.

.. _internal-auth-keyfile:

Keyfiles
--------

Keyfiles use :doc:`/core/security-scram-sha-1` challenge and response
authentication mechanism. The contents of the keyfiles serve as the
shared password for the members. A key's length must be between 6 and
1024 characters and may only contain characters in the base64 set.

MongoDB strips whitespace characters (e.g. ``x0d``, ``x09``, and ``x20``)
for cross-platform convenience. As a result, the following operations
produce identical keys:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo -e "my secret key" > key1
   echo -e "my secret key\n" > key2
   echo -e "my    secret    key" > key3
   echo -e "my\r\nsecret\r\nkey\r\n" > key4

On UNIX systems, the keyfile must not have group or world permissions. On
Windows systems, keyfile permissions are not checked

The content of the keyfile must be the same on all :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances that connect to each other. You must store the
keyfile on each member of the replica set or sharded clusters.

To specify the keyfile, use the :setting:`security.keyFile` setting or
``--keyFile`` command line option.

For an example of keyfile internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-internal-authentication`.

x.509
-----

Members of a replica set or sharded cluster can use x.509 certificates for
internal authentication instead of using keyfiles. MongoDB supports x.509
certificate authentication for use with a secure TLS/SSL connection.
