Introduction
------------

Charts provide visual representations of the data in your
:doc:`data source <data-sources>`. A chart maps to a *single*
data source, and can display correlations between several fields in the
data. MongoDB Charts provides the following visualizations for
your collection data:

- Bar Charts

  - Colored Bar

  - Stacked Bar

  - Grouped Bar

- Column Charts

  - Colored Column

  - Stacked Column

  - Grouped Column

- Line Charts

  - Discrete Line

  - Continuous Line

- Area Charts

  - Stacked Discrete Area

  - Continuous Area

- Scatter Charts

- Donut Charts

Create a Chart
--------------

To begin building a new chart:

1. From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab, select the dashboard where you
   wish to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard,
   see :doc:`Dashboards </dashboards>`.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Add Chart` button at the top-right corner of
   the dashboard view.

3. In the :guilabel:`Data Source` dropdown, select the data source to
   be used for this chart. For information on adding data sources in
   MongoDB Charts, see
   :doc:`Data Sources <data-sources>`.

4. In the :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown, select the type for this
   chart.

   .. note::

      Each chart type provides different visualization options
      for the fields in your data, reflected by various
      *encoding channels*. These channels dictate how your data is
      visualized and enable powerful
      :manual:`aggregations </reference/operator/aggregation/>` for
      your data. For details on the different encoding channel types,
      refer to the :ref:`Encoding Channels <encoding-channels>`
      section.

5. Drag fields from the :guilabel:`Fields` section to the desired
   encoding channels below the :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown. The
   fields listed correspond to the fields in your data source. You can
   search for a specific field in your data source by using the
   :guilabel:`Filter` search bar at the top of the :guilabel:`Fields`
   section.

   .. note::

      For details on how MongoDB Charts handles nested objects and nested
      arrays in fields, see the
      :ref:`Nested Objects and Arrays <nested-objects-arrays>` section.

6. Give your chart a title by hovering over the
   :guilabel:`Enter a title for your chart` text clicking the
   :guilabel:`Pencil Icon`. Click the :guilabel:`Green Check Mark` to
   save your title.

7. Once you are satisfied with your chart, click
   :guilabel:`Save Changes`. This saves your chart to your dashboard
   and redirects you to the dashboard view.

.. _encoding-channels:

Encoding Channels
-----------------

MongoDB Charts provides various encoding channels to visualize
your data based on the type of chart selected. Each encoding channel
type provides different capabilities for processing and visualizing
your data. The following table provides a brief description for each
encoding channel type in MongoDB Charts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Encoding Channel Type
     - Description

   * - Value
     - A point on the chart is created from the chosen field for each
       document in the collection. You may only assign fields with a
       ``numeric`` or ``date`` type to a :guilabel:`Value` channel.

   * - Category
     - Each *unique* value from this field in the collection is used
       as a chart category. The :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel
       provides the following additional visualization options:

       - For fields with a ``string`` data type, you can specify a field
         to sort on and the sort order.

       - For fields with a ``numeric`` data type, you can toggle
         `data binning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning>`_
         and select the bin size.

       - For fields with a ``date`` data type, you can toggle date
         grouping and select the grouping period.

   * - Aggregation
     - A point on the chart is created by applying an
       :manual:`aggregation <aggregation>` function over the values of
       this field from multiple documents; for example
       :manual:`$count </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>` and
       :manual:`$sum </reference/operator/aggregation/sum/>`.

Dragging a field onto an :guilabel:`aggregation` encoding channel
allows you to use an
:manual:`aggregation pipeline operator </reference/operator/aggregation/>`
on that field. The aggregation operators available in the chart
builder change based on the :manual:`data type </reference/bson-types/>`
of the selected field. MongoDB Charts categorizes the field data as
either a ``number``, ``string``, or ``date`` and displays appropriate
aggregation options accordingly.

.. example::

   Donut charts provide two encoding channels:

   - A :guilabel:`category` channel called :guilabel:`Label` dictating
     which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart

     and

   - An :guilabel:`aggregation` channel called :guilabel:`Arc` dictating
     the aggregation operation to perform on the :guilabel:`Label`
     category.

   The following donut chart examines NASA's Landslide data source to
   show the frequency of various landslide triggers by performing a
   :manual:`$count </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>` aggregation
   on the ``trigger`` field:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/donut-chart-example-2.png
      :figwidth: 721px
      :alt: Donut chart example

   We see from the chart that the most common landslide trigger is
   ``Downpour`` followed by ``Continuous_rain``.

.. _charts-filter-documents:

Filter Documents in the Visualization
-------------------------------------

To display a subset of results in your data that match a given
criteria, use the :guilabel:`Filters` input bar above the chart
display. The filters used here employ the same syntax used in the
:manual:`db.collection.find() </tutorial/query-documents/>`
command. After entering a filter document, click :guilabel:`Apply` to
see the filter reflected in your visualization.

.. note::

   Filters on large collections may have performance issues if there
   are not appropriate :manual:`indexes <indexes>` on the collection.

.. example::

   The following chart shows the average runtime of movies by genre.
   The filter of ``{runtime: {$gte: 120 }}`` means that we are only
   taking into account movies which have a runtime greater than or
   equal to 120 minutes.

      :figwidth: 721px
      :alt: Charts dashboard filter

.. _nested-objects-arrays:

Nested Objects and Arrays
-------------------------

MongoDB Charts elegantly handles nested objects and array fields in
your data, meaning you can create data visualizations while still
structuring your data in the best way for your application.

Nested Objects
``````````````

Nested objects in the :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder
are indicated by curly brackets (``{}``) next to their name. To expand
an object field, click the arrow to the left of the field name. You can
drag nested object fields onto the desired
:guilabel:`encoding channels` just like any other field to visualize
those fields in your chart.

.. example::

   The ``video.movieDetails`` data source in the following example
   contains nested objects named ``awards`` and ``imdb``. We expand the
   objects by clicking the arrows to the left of their names, then in
   the bar chart we compare the
   mean ``imdb.rating`` in the :guilabel:`Y-axis` with
   ``awards.wins`` in the :guilabel:`X-axis`.

   .. figure:: /images/charts/charts-nested-obj-3.png
      :figwidth: 721px
      :alt: Create chart nested object

   .. note::

      Notice the :guilabel:`filter` provided above the chart of
      ``{'awards.wins': {$gt: 0}}``, meaning only movies which have won
      at least one award are included in the visualization. For more
      information on filtering documents in MongoDB Charts, see the
      :ref:`Filter Documents <charts-filter-documents>` section.

Array Fields
````````````

Array fields the :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder page
are indicated by square brackets (``[]``) next to their name. When
adding an array field to an encoding channel, select an
:guilabel:`array reduction` option to process the data in the best way
for your visualization. The following array reduction options are
available in MongoDB Charts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Array Reduction Option
     - Description

   * - Unwind array
     - Deconstructs the array field from the input documents to
       output a document for *each* element. Each output document is
       the input document with the value of the array field replaced by
       the element.

   * - Array length
     - Counts and returns the total number of items in the array.

   * - Array element by index
     - The zero-based index of the array to use in the visualization.

You are also required to select an array reduction option when adding a
field which exists *inside* of an array to an encoding channel. In this
case, the selected reduction is applied to the array containing the
target field. Additionally, in the case of nested arrays, you must
select a reduction option for the top-level array and all sub-arrays.
Note that different reduction options may be used for each nested
array.

Below the array reduction options in the dropdown, MongoDB also
provides many :guilabel:`numeric accumulate` and
:guilabel:`string accumulate` options for handling your array data.
These accumulators indicate how the array should be processed in the
visualization, and what elements of the array to visualize if
appropriate. For example, the ``max`` numeric accumulate outputs the
greatest value in the array, and the ``count of occurrences``
string accumulate outputs the number of times the input string
occurs in the array.

.. note::

   MongoDB Charts only displays accumulate options which match the data
   type of the field used in the visualization (i.e., only showing
   string accumulate options for string data and numeric accumulate
   options for numeric data).

.. _charts-sample-mode:

Sample Mode
-----------

Enabling :guilabel:`Sample Mode` in MongoDB Charts restricts the input
collection to ``1000`` randomly selected documents. To toggle
:guilabel:`Sample Mode`, use the toggle above the
:guilabel:`Data Source` dropdown. The sample mode setting for a chart
persists when the chart is rendered on a dashboard, meaning that if
you enable sample mode when building a chart, the data rendered in the
dashboard will also be sampled.

.. note::

   When sampling mode is enabled and you have specified a
   :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>`, the sample of ``1000``
   documents is taken *before* the filter is applied, meaning there may
   be fewer than ``1000`` documents used to plot the chart.

Consider using sample mode in the following scenarios:

- When drafting a chart and heavily modifying chart options. In this
  situation, sampling mode allows the chart to render quickly during
  the building process. Once you are satisfied with your chart you can
  disable sample mode to have all documents included in your
  final visualization if desired.

- When visualizing a large data source and the chosen data is
  sufficiently aggregated (e.g. showing averages of fields) so
  not all documents are needed to obtain a useful visualization.
  In this case, leaving sample mode enabled for the rendered dashboard
  allows you to retain a useful chart.

.. note::

   Due to the random nature of sampling, when Sample Mode is enabled,
   it is possible your visualizations will change each time the
   chart is loaded.
