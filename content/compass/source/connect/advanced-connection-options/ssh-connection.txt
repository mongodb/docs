The :guilabel:`Proxy / SSH Tunnel` tab allows you to connect to your deployment 
with a Proxy method or SSH tunnel. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal.

      .. include:: /includes/open-new-connection.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

         :figwidth: 690px
         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Proxy / SSH Tunnel` tab.

      You have the following connection options:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1 
         :widths: 50 50 
      
         * - Option
           - Description 

         * - SSH with Password 
           - Connects to a deployment using a SSH Tunnel and has the option to secure 
             the connection with a password. For information on SSH connections and 
             the fields for this connection option, see :ref:`<ssh-fields>`.

         * - SSH with Identity File 
           - Connects to a deployment using a SSH Tunnel and uses an Identity File 
             to secure the connection. For information on SSH connections and 
             the fields for this connection option, see :ref:`<ssh-fields>`.

         * - Socks5
           - Connects to a deployment using a seperate proxy server. For more 
             information on the fields for this connection option, see 
             :ref:`<socks5>`. 

         * - Application-level Proxy 
           - Connects to a deployment using application-level proxy settings 
             specified in the :ref:`Compass Settings panel 
             <compass-interface-settings>`.

      SSH Connection
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To connect to a deployment using :guilabel:`SSH with Password` or 
      :guilabel:`SSH with Identity File`, use the following fields:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1 
         :widths: 50 50
      
         * - Field
           - Description

         * - SSH Hostname
           - Bastion (jumpbox) hostname. This is the unique identifier 
             (Fully Qualified Domain Name, or FQDN) for the computer to access. 

         * - SSH Port
           - Port used for the SSH connection. This defaults to 22, 
             the standard port for SSH.

         * - SSH Username
           - This is the user for which the profile to log into on the remote 
             system. This is the user for which you want to establish the 
             SSH connection.

         * - SSH Password 
           - (Optional) Password used to secure the SSH connection. This is 
             required if you are not using an identity file.

         * - SSH Identity File
           - File from which the identity (private key) for SSH public 
             key authentication is read.

             Unix or OS X: If using OpenSSH, identity files are found in the ``~/.ssh`` 
             directory. By default, the private key files have one of the following 
             file names:

             - ``id_dsa``
             
             - ``id_ecdsa``

             - ``id_ed25519``
 
             - ``id_rsa``

             On Windows, the location of the identity files depends on your choice 
             of SSH client, such as PuTTY. 

         * - SSH Passphrase
           - (Optional) If your private key is encrypted, provide the passphrase 
             used to decrypt your private key. A passphrase provides an extra 
             layer of security for an SSH connection.  

      Behavior
      ````````

      - In |compass|, :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel Connections` allow users to connect 
        to replica sets. 

      - Users can connect to replica sets using SSH Tunnels and 
        :ref:`TLS / SSL connections <tls-ssl-tab>`. 

      .. _socks5:

      Socks5
      ~~~~~~

      To connect to a deployment using :guilabel:`Socks5`, use the following 
      fields:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1 
         :widths: 50 50
      
         * - Field
           - Description

         * - Proxy Hostname
           - Domain name, IPv4, or IPv6 address on which a socks5 proxy is listening.

         * - Proxy Tunnel Port
           - (Optional) TCP port number. Default is 1080.  
         
         * - Proxy Username
           - (Optional) Username used to authenticate the connection with the proxy 
             server.  
         
         * - Proxy Password
           - (Optional) Password used to authenticate the connection with the 
             proxy server. 

      Behavior
      ````````

      - If you specify a non-local Socks5 proxy host and provide a 
        username and password authentication, you receive a warning 
        stating that the credentials will be sent in plaintext. 

      - If you specify a remote Socks5 proxy host and do not enable TLS, 
        you receive a warning stating that the proxy administrator will 
        be able to intercept data sent and received by |compass-short|.

   .. step:: (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.
