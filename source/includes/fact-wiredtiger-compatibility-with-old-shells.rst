For MongoDB 3.0 deployments using the :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine, if you run |method| from a
version of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell before 3.0 or a version of the
driver prior to :ref:`3.0 compatible version
<compatibility-driver-versions>`, |method| will return no data, even if
there are existing |things|. For more information, see
:ref:`3.0-compatibility-drivers-wired-tiger`.
