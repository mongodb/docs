Overview
--------

This tutorial manipulates the :doc:`Public API's </core/api>` automation
configuration to deploy a :term:`sharded cluster` that is owned by another
user. The tutorial first
creates a new project, then a new user as owner of the project, and then a
sharded cluster owned by the new user. You can create a script to automate
these procedures for use in routine operations.

.. only:: cloud

   To perform these steps, you must have sufficient access to |mms|. A user
   with the :authrole:`Project Owner` role has sufficient access.

.. only:: onprem

   To perform these steps, you must have sufficient access to |mms|. A
   user with the :ref:`global owner <global-owner-role>` or 
   :authrole:`Project Owner` role has sufficient access.

The procedures install a cluster with two :term:`shards <shard>`. Each
shard comprises a three-member :term:`replica set`. The tutorial installs
one :program:`mongos` and three :term:`config servers <config server>`.
Each component of the cluster resides on its own server, requiring a total
of 10 servers.

The tutorial installs the :doc:`Automation Agent
</tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>` on each server.

.. _create-cluster-with-api-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

.. only:: onprem

   |mms| must have an existing user. If you are deploying the sharded cluster
   on a fresh install of |mms|, you must register the first user.

   You must have the URL of the |onprem| Web Server, as set in the
   ``mmsBaseUrl`` setting of the :doc:`Monitoring Agent configuration
   file </reference/monitoring-agent>`.

Provision ten servers to host the components of the :term:`sharded
cluster`. For server requirements, see the :manual:`Production Notes
</administration/production-notes>` in the MongoDB manual.

Each server must provide its :doc:`Automation Agent
</tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>` with full networking access to
the hostnames and ports of the Automation Agents on all the other servers.
Each agent runs the command ``hostname -f`` to self-identify its hostname
and port and report them to |mms|.

.. tip::

   To ensure agents can reach each other, :doc:`provision the servers using 
   Automation </tutorial/add-servers-automation>`. This installs
   the Automation Agents with correct network access. Then use this
   tutorial to reinstall the Automation Agents on those machines.

Examples
--------

As you work with the API, you can view examples on the following GitHub page:
`<https://github.com/10gen-labs/mms-api-examples/tree/master/automation/>`_.

Procedures
----------

Generate a Public API Key
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This procedure displays the full API key **just once**. You must record
the API key when it is displayed.

.. note::

   A :term:`Public API key` is different from an :term:`agent API key`. A Public
   API key is associated with a user; an agent API key is associated with a
   project.

Create the Group and the User through the API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-group-through-api.rst

Install the Automation Agent on each Provisioned Server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Your servers must have the networking access described in the
:ref:`create-cluster-with-api-prerequisites`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-automation-agent-to-provisioned-servers.rst

Deploy the New Cluster
++++++++++++++++++++++

To add or update a deployment, retrieve the :ref:`configuration document
<automation-configuration-sample-entity>`, make changes as needed, and
send the updated configuration though the API to |mms|.

The following procedure deploys an updated automation configuration
through the Public API:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-cluster-through-api.rst

Next Steps
----------

To make an additional version of MongoDB available in the cluster, follow
the steps in :doc:`update-mongodb-version-of-deployment-via-api`.
