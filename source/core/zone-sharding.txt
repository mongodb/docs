Some common deployment patterns where zones can be applied are as follows:

- Isolate a specific subset of data on a specific set of shards.

- Ensure that the most relevant data reside on shards that are
  geographically closest to the application servers.

- Route data to shards based on the hardware / performance of the
  shard hardware.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster with three shards and two
zones. The ``A`` zone represents a range with a lower boundary of ``1`` and an
upper bound of ``10``. The ``B`` zone represents a range with a lower boundary
of ``10`` and an upper boundary of ``20``. Shards ``Alpha`` and ``Beta`` have
the ``A`` zone. Shard ``Beta`` also has the ``B`` zone. Shard ``Charlie`` has
no zones associated with it. The cluster is in a steady state and no chunks
violate any of the zones.

Behavior and Operations
-----------------------

Ranges
~~~~~~

Each zone covers one or more ranges of :term:`shard key` values for a
collection. Each range a zone covers is always inclusive of its lower
boundary and exclusive of its upper boundary. Zones cannot share ranges,
nor can they have overlapping ranges.

For example, consider a shard key on ``{"x": 1}``. The cluster has
the following zone ranges:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "x" : 5 } --> { "x" : 10 } // Zone A
   { "x" : 10} --> { "x" : 20 } // Zone B

- A document with a shard key value of ``7`` is routed to zone A.
- A document with shard key value of ``10`` is routed to zone B.

Hashed Shard Keys and Zone Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For collections whose shard key includes a hashed field, zone ranges and
data distribution on that field are on hashed values. The zone contains
documents whose *hashed* shard key value falls into the defined range. A
zone range on a hashed field does not have the same predictable document
routing behavior as a zone range on an unhashed field.

For example, consider a shard key on ``{"x" : "hashed"}``. The following
range represents the *hashed* range between ``5`` and ``10``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "x": NumberLong("4470791281878691347") } --> { "x": NumberLong("7766103514953448109") } // Zone A

- A document with a shard key value of ``1`` is routed to Zone A
  since the *hashed* value of ``1`` falls into the defined range.

- A document with a shard key value of ``15`` is routed to Zone A
  since the *hashed* value of ``15`` falls into the defined range.

- A document with a shard key value of ``8`` is not routed to
  Zone A since the *hashed* value of ``8`` does not fall into the 
  defined range.

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
:method:`convertShardKeyToHashed()` for computing the post-hash value of
the specified parameter.

One valid use of zone ranges on a hashed field is to restrict the data
for a collection to the shard or shards in a single zone. Create a zone
range that covers the entire range of possible hashed shard key values
using :doc:`minKey </reference/bson-types>` as the lower bound and
:doc:`maxkey </reference/bson-types>` as the upper bound.

To define ranges, MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange`
command and the associated helper methods
:method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` and :method:`sh.addShardTag()`.

.. _zone-sharding-balancer:

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :term:`balancer` attempts to evenly distribute a sharded collection's
chunks across all shards in the cluster.

For each :term:`chunk <chunk>` marked for migration, the balancer checks each
possible destination shard for any configured zones. If the chunk range falls
into a zone, the balancer migrates the chunk into a shard inside that
zone. Chunks that do not fall into a zone can exist on *any* shard in the
cluster and are migrated normally.

During balancing rounds, if the balancer detects that any chunks violate the
configured zones for a given shard, the balancer migrates those chunks to
a shard where no conflict exists.

After associating a zone with a shard or shards and configuring the
zone with a shard key range for a sharded collection, the cluster may
take some time to migrate the affected data for the sharded collection.
This depends on the division of chunks and the current distribution of
data in the cluster. When balancing is complete, reads and writes for
documents in a given zone are routed only to the shard or shards inside
that zone.

Once configured, the balancer respects zones during future
:ref:`balancing rounds <sharding-internals-balancing>`.

.. _zone-sharding-shard-key:

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

You must use fields contained in the :term:`shard key` when defining a new
range for a zone to cover. If using a :term:`compound <compound index>` shard
key, the range must include the prefix of the shard key.

For example, given a shard key ``{ a : 1, b : 2, c : 3 }``, creating or
updating a zone to cover values of ``b`` requires including ``a`` as the
prefix. Creating or updating a zone to covers values of ``c`` requires
including ``a`` and ``b`` as the prefix.

You cannot create zones using fields not included in the shard key. For
example, if you wanted to use zones to partition data based on
geographic location, the shard key would need at least one field that
contained geographic data.

When choosing a shard key for a collection, consider what fields you might
want to use for configuring zones. See :ref:`sharding-internals-choose-shard-key` 
for considerations in choosing a shard key.
