  If you selected :guilabel:`Pull Via Secure HTTP`, |mms| creates links to
  the snapshot that by default are available for an hour and can be used
  just once. To download the snapshot files, select the :guilabel:`Backup`
  tab and then :guilabel:`Restore History` page. When the restore job
  completes, the :guilabel:`download` link appears for every :term:`config
  server` and :term:`shard` in the cluster. Click each link to download
  the files and copy each to its server. For a shard, copy the file to
  every member of the shard's :term:`replica set`.

  If you selected :guilabel:`Push Via Secure Copy`, the files are copied
  to the server directory you specfied. To verify that the files are
  complete, :ref:`see the section on how to validate an SCP restore
  <backup-faq-scp-validation>`. For each shard, copy its restore file to
  every member of the shard's :term:`replica set`.

  |mms| creates one-time links to tar files for the snapshot. The links are
  available for one download each, and each expires after an hour.

  To download the tar files, select the |mms| :guilabel:`Backup` tab and
  then :guilabel:`Restore Jobs`. When the restore job completes, the
  :guilabel:`download` link appears for every :term:`config server` and
  :term:`shard` in the cluster. Click each link to download the tar files
  and copy each tar file to its server. For a shard, copy the file to
  every member of the shard's :term:`replica set`.

  If you **optionally** chose SCP as the delivery method, the files are
  copied to the server directory you specfied. To verify that the files
  are complete, :ref:`see the section on how to validate an SCP restore
  <backup-faq-scp-validation>`.
