Definition
----------

.. method:: cursor.skip(<offset>)


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst


   Call the :method:`~cursor.skip()` method on a cursor to control where
   MongoDB begins returning results. This approach may be useful in
   implementing paginated results.

   .. note::

      You must apply :method:`~cursor.skip()` to the cursor before
      retrieving any documents from the database.

   The :method:`~cursor.skip()` method has the following parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``offset``
   
        - number
   
        - The number of documents to skip in the results set.

Behavior
--------

Using ``skip()`` with ``sort()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using :method:`~cursor.skip()` with :method:`~cursor.sort()`, be
sure to include at least one field in your sort that contains
unique values, before passing results to :method:`~cursor.skip()`.

Sorting on fields that contain duplicate values may return an
inconsistent sort order for those duplicate fields over multiple
executions, especially when the collection is actively receiving writes.

The easiest way to guarantee sort consistency is to include the
``_id`` field in your sort query.

See :ref:`Consistent sorting with the sort() method
<sort-cursor-consistent-sorting>` for more information.


Using ``skip()`` with ``limit()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pagination Example
------------------

Using ``skip()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following JavaScript function uses :method:`~cursor.skip()` to
paginate a collection by its ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function printStudents(pageNumber, nPerPage) {
     print( "Page: " + pageNumber );
     db.students.find()
                .sort( { _id: 1 } )
                .skip( pageNumber > 0 ? ( ( pageNumber - 1 ) * nPerPage ) : 0 )
                .limit( nPerPage )
                .forEach( student => {
                  print( student.name );
                } );
   }

The :method:`~cursor.skip()` method requires the server to scan from the
beginning of the input results set before beginning to return results.
As the offset increases, :method:`~cursor.skip()` will become slower.

Using Range Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Range queries can use :ref:`indexes <indexes>` to avoid scanning
unwanted documents, typically yielding better performance as the offset
grows compared to using :method:`~cursor.skip()` for pagination.

Descending Order
````````````````

Use this procedure to implement pagination with range queries:

* Choose a field such as ``_id`` which generally changes in a consistent
  direction over time and has a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
  to prevent duplicate values,
* Query for documents whose field is less than the start value
  using the :query:`$lt` and :method:`~cursor.sort()` operators, and
* Store the last-seen field value for the next query.

For example, the following function uses the above procedure to print
pages of student names from a collection, sorted approximately in order
of newest documents first using the ``_id`` field (that is, in
*descending* order):

.. code-block:: javascript

   function printStudents(startValue, nPerPage) {
     let endValue = null;
     db.students.find( { _id: { $lt: startValue } } )
                .sort( { _id: -1 } )
                .limit( nPerPage )
                .forEach( student => {
                  print( student.name );
                  endValue = student._id;
                } );

     return endValue;
   }

You may then use the following code to print all student names using this
pagination function, using :bsontype:`MaxKey` to start
from the largest possible key:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let currentKey = MaxKey;
   while (currentKey !== null) {
     currentKey = printStudents(currentKey, 10);
   }

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-ObjectId-timestamp-order.rst

Ascending Order
```````````````

Returning paginated results in ascending order is similar to the
previous, but uses :query:`$gt` with an *ascending* sort order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function printStudents(startValue, nPerPage) {
     let endValue = null;
     db.students.find( { _id: { $gt: startValue } } )
                .sort( { _id: 1 } )
                .limit( nPerPage )
                .forEach( student => {
                  print( student.name );
                  endValue = student._id;
                } );

     return endValue;
   }

Using this function is likewise similar, but with
:bsontype:`MinKey` as the starting key:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let currentKey = MinKey;
   while (currentKey !== null) {
     currentKey = printStudents(currentKey, 10);
   }
