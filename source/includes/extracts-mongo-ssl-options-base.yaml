  .. versionchanged:: 3.2.6
  
     MongoDB 3.2.6 adds support for checking a certificate against the
     system CA store, allowing you to run the {{program}} shell with
     the ``--ssl`` option *without* including ``--sslCAFile`` or
     ``sslAllowInvalidCertificates``.
     
     If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` to which the
     :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is connecting presents a certificate signed
     with a CA trusted by the operating system, the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
     shell will connect without error. In previous versions of MongoDB,
     the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell exited with an error that it could not
     validate the certificate.

   .. warning::

      For SSL connections (``--ssl``) to :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`, if the {{program}} runs with the
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` option , the {{program}} will
      not attempt to validate the server certificates. This creates a
      vulnerability to expired :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
      certificates as well as to foreign processes posing as valid
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. Only use
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` on systems where intrusion
      is not possible.
