   agent
      A lightweight program that provides an interface between your MongoDB processes and mms.


   agent API key
      A unique identifier that authenticates a project's
      :term:`MongoDB Agents <MongoDB Agent>` to |mms|. A project can have multiple agent |api| keys.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`

   authentication mechanism
      A method to enable access to a MongoDB database. This is separate
      from authorization, which grants you permission to use certain
      actions on a MongoDB database.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`

   automation
      The assisted management of MongoDB processes through the |mms|
      interface. The :term:`MongoDB Agents <MongoDB Agent>` installed on
      your MongoDB hosts allow you to deploy, configure, and update
      MongoDB processes directly from |mms|.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`automation`

   Automation Agent
      The lightweight component that had automated common management
      tasks. The Automation Agent runs on every server that ran a
      :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`.

      .. note::

         This has been replaced with the :term:`MongoDB Agent`.

   Backup Agent
      The lightweight component that had run within your data center and
      backed up MongoDB processes via the MongoDB wire protocol. No direct
      file system access was needed.

      .. note::

         This has been replaced with the :term:`MongoDB Agent`.

   batch
      The collection of jobs needed to restore a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`:
      one job for each shard and one job for the :manual:`config server </reference/glossary/#std-term-config-server>`.

      Replica set restore jobs do not use batches.

   checkpoint
      A point in time between snapshots to which you can restore a sharded
      cluster. |mms| must stop the :term:`balancer` each time it creates a
      checkpoint. |mms| doesn't require checkpoints and disables
      checkpoints by default.

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/important/checkpoints-fcv-4-0-only.rst

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`checkpoint`


   cluster
      In |mms|, *cluster* can refer to either a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` or
      :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.


   custom snapshot
      A backup of the state of your MongoDB deployment at a point in time
      between :manual:`stored snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`. |mms| builds a custom
      snapshot by applying oplog data to a stored snapshot.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview`

   deduplication
      A process that eliminates redundant data. This data can be additional
      copies of database or file system documents or redundant data within
      those documents at the block level when written to a storage medium
      like spinning or solid state disks. Only unique documents or blocks
      are written to a storage medium. This process usually applies to
      backups or data archiving.

      .. example::

         Each recipient in an email system may have their own copy of an
         email sent to the whole company. With deduplication, all copies of
         this except one are replaced with pointers to a single stored copy
         before backing up the email system. This effectively reduces the
         amount of storage capacity needed to back up this one email by 99
         percent.


   deployment
      Usually refers to all the MongoDB processes that run within |a-mms|
      :cloudmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`. *Deployment* can also refer to a specific set of
      MongoDB processes, such as a specific :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` or
      :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.


   dirty bytes
      Data that has been updated in the WiredTiger cache but not flushed to
      disk.


   excluded namespace
      A database or collection that |mms| will not back up, as designated
      by its :term:`namespace`.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`namespaces-filter`

   group
      A distinct set of MongoDB processes and |mms| users. Synonymous with
      :cloudmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/manage-projects`

   host
      A physical machine, virtual machine, or container that serves one or
      more MongoDB processes.

   initial sync
      The MongoDB operation that replicates data from an existing
      :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` member to a new member. |mms| uses initial
      sync when :doc:`starting a new backup </tutorial/enable-backup>`.
  
      .. seealso::

         :manual:`Replica Set Data Synchronization
         </core/replica-set-sync>` in the MongoDB manual

   link-token
      A string that contains the information necessary to connect from
      |mms| to |service-short| during a Live Migration from an |mms| deployment
      to a deployment in |service-short|.
      
      When you are ready to live migrate data from an
      |mms| deployment, you generate a link-token in |service-short|
      and then enter it in your |mms| organization's settings. You use the
      same link-token to migrate each deployment in your |mms|
      organization sequentially, one at a time.
      
      You can generate multiple link-tokens in |service-short|. Use
      one unique link-token for each |mms| organization.

      .. seealso::
      
         - :ref:`lm-workflow`
         - :doc:`/tutorial/migrate-to-atlas`


   migration host
      A dedicated server with its own specially-configured {+mdbagent-lm+}.
      You run the Live Migration (push) process on the migration host to migrate
      your MongoDB deployment to |service-short|.

      .. seealso::
      
         - :doc:`/tutorial/provision-migration-host`
         - :doc:`/tutorial/migrate-to-atlas`


   MongoDB Agent
      A lightweight :term:`agent` that can monitor, manage, and back up
      your MongoDB databases.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent`


   monitoring
      The real-time reporting, visualization, and alerting of the state of
      your MongoDB processes.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`monitoring-functional-overview`

   Monitoring Agent
      The lightweight component that had run within your data center and
      monitored your MongoDB processes via the MongoDB wire protocol. No
      direct file system access was needed.

      .. note::

         This has been replaced with the :term:`MongoDB Agent`.


   namespace
      The combination of the database name and collection name:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         "database-name.collection-name"


   oplog slice
      Compressed batch of entries for the tailed :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` of a
      backed-up shard or replica set. The :term:`MongoDB Agent` creates an
      oplog slice and sends it to |mms|, which stores it in the
      :term:`Oplog Store Database`.


   Oplog Store Database
      The database where |onprem| stores :term:`oplog slices <oplog slice>`
      before applying them to a deployment's backup.


   ping
      A data transmission that the :term:`MongoDB Agent` sends to |mms| to
      confirm that the Agent and its MongoDB processes are running and
      reachable.


   point-in-time restore
      A database restoration that captures the state of your data at a
      moment in-between :manual:`snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`. Point-in-time
      restores take longer to perform than snapshot restores.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview`

   process
      An instance of MongoDB running on a given host and port. The MongoDB
      database process is :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`. MongoDB also uses the
      :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process to route operations in the
      :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

      .. seealso::

         :manual:`MongoDB Package Components </reference/program>`

   project
      A distinct set of MongoDB processes and |mms| users. Synonymous with
      :cloudmgr:`group </reference/glossary/#std-term-group>`.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/manage-projects`

   Public API key
      A unique identifier that authenticates |a-mms| user through the
      :doc:`{+admin-api+} </core/api>`. The key belongs to 
      the user, as opposed to the :cloudmgr:`agent API key </reference/glossary/#std-term-agent-api-key>`, which belongs to 
      the project.

   queryable backup
      A feature provided by |mms| in which |mms| quickly and securely makes
      a given snapshot accessible over a MongoDB connection string. You can
      use the connection string with standard MongoDB tools such as
      {+mongosh+} or mongodump to access the snapshot for read-only
      operations.

      Queryable backups start up quickly regardless of the snapshot's total
      data size. They are uniquely useful for restoring a small subset of
      data, such as a document that was accidentally deleted, or reading
      out a single collection with mongodump.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/query-backup/`

   Query Insights
      |service| tool that monitors collection-level 
      :manual:`query latency </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>`. You can view query latency metrics and 
      statistics for certain hosts and operation types. Manage pinned 
      namespaces and choose up to five namespaces to show in the 
      corresponding query latency charts.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`query-insights`

   Recovery Point Objective
      The maximum tolerable age of backup files that must be recovered from
      storage for normal operations to resume after a failure or disaster
      occurs.


   Recovery Time Objective
      The maximum tolerable length of time that a system can be offline
      after a failure or disaster occurs.


   role
      The permissions granted to |a-mms| or MongoDB user.

      .. seealso::

         - :doc:`/reference/user-roles` for |mms| user roles
         - :manual:`Built-in Roles </reference/built-in-roles>` in the
           MongoDB manual for MongoDB user roles

   rolling restart
      A technique used to maintain cluster availability during maintenance 
      periods by updating nodes in a replica set one-by-one, always
      maintaining a primary node, until all nodes are updated.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`rolling-restart-faq`

   server
      A physical or virtual machine that serves one or more MongoDB
      processes.


   snapshot
      Single backup of your data that |mms| captures at a specific
      interval and stores. The :ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention` determines the interval
      for taking snapshots and how long to store them. You can
      :doc:`query specific backups </tutorial/query-backup/>`.

      .. seealso::

         - :term:`custom snapshot`


   snapshot frequency and retention policy
      The schedule for how often to take :manual:`snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` and
      how long to store them.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`

   snapshot store
      The location where your :manual:`snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` are stored.


   storage engine
      The database storage engine manages how data is stored on disk.
      MongoDB versions 3.0 and later offer multiple storage engines.

      .. seealso::

         - :manual:`Storage </core/storage>`
         - :manual:`MongoDB Storage FAQ </faq/storage>` in the MongoDB
