|mms| supports SSL for encrypting the following connections made by
Monitoring Agents:

- Connections between the Monitoring Agents and MongoDB instances.

Prerequisite

To configure the agent to use SSL, you must have a trusted CA
certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's certificate.

Procedures

To use SSL for the Monitoring Agent's connection to a MongoDB host, specify
the host's SSL settings when :doc:`adding the host
