Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.moveChunk(namespace, query, destination)

   Moves the :term:`chunk` that contains the document specified by the
   ``query`` to the ``destination`` shard. :method:`sh.moveChunk()`
   provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` database
   command.


   .. important:: In most circumstances, allow the :term:`balancer` to
      automatically migrate :term:`chunks <chunk>`, and avoid calling
      :method:`sh.moveChunk()` directly.

   .. warning:: 
      
      This command cannot be used for hashed shard keys, as it 
      uses the ``find`` option from the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command. 
      To move a chunk with a :term:`hashed shard key`, use the 
      :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command specifying the ``bounds`` field.

   :method:`sh.moveChunk()` takes the following arguments:

      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``namespace``
   
        - string
   
        - The :term:`namespace` of the sharded collection that contains the
          chunk to migrate.
          
          
   
      * - ``query``
   
        - document
   
        - An equality match on the shard key that selects the chunk to move.
          
          
   
      * - ``destination``
   
        - string
   
        - The name of the shard to move.
          
          
   By default, MongoDB cannot move a chunk if the number of documents
   in the chunk is greater than 2 times the result of dividing the
   configured :ref:`chunk size<sharding-chunk-size>` by the average
   document size. The :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command can specify the 
   :ref:`forceJumbo <movechunk-forceJumbo>` option to allow for the manual 
   migration of chunks too large to move, with or without the 
   :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>` label. See :ref:`moveChunk <movechunk-forceJumbo>` 
   command for details.

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

Example
-------

Given the ``people`` collection in the ``records`` database, the
following operation finds the chunk that contains the documents with the
``zipcode`` field set to ``53187`` and then moves that chunk to the
shard named ``shard0019``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.moveChunk("records.people", { zipcode: "53187" }, "shard0019")
