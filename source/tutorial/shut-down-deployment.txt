|mms| supports shutting down individual |mongod| and |mongos|
processes, as well as :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. When you shut down a
process, cluster, or replica set, |mms| continues to manage it, even
though it is not running.

You can later :doc:`restart </tutorial/restart-deployment>` your
processes, or, if you no longer want |mms| to manage them, you can
:doc:`remove </tutorial/unmanage-deployment>` them.

.. admonition:: No Alert Raised if User Shuts Down a MongoDB Process
   :class: note

   If you shut down a MongoDB process, |mms| doesn't raise a
   ``HOST_DOWN`` alert.
