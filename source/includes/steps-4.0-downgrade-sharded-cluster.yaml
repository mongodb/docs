  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

title: Disable the Balancer.
level: 4
ref: disable-balancer
content: |
  Connect a ``mongo`` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in
  the sharded cluster, and run :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to
  disable the balancer:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.stopBalancer()

  .. note::

     If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
     in-progress migration before stopping the balancer. You can run
     :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check the balancer's current
     state.

  To verify that the balancer is disabled, run
  :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`, which returns false if the balancer
  is disabled:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.getBalancerState()

  For more information on disabling the balancer, see
  :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

title: Downgrade each shard, one at a time.
level: 4
ref: 4.0-downgrade-shard
content: |

   Downgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

   1. Downgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace the |newversion|
         binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options. Include any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         ``--bind_ip``.
 
         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

         Or if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`net.port`, and any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         :setting:`net.bindIp`, and start:

         .. code-block:: yaml

            sharding:
               clusterRole: shardsvr
            net:
               port: <port>
               bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>
            storage:
               dbpath: <path>


      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         downgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's
         state, you can issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
         ``mongo`` shell.

         Repeat for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      Connect a ``mongo`` shell to the primary and use
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
      election of a new primary:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown()

   #. When :method:`rs.status()`
      shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
      has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, downgrade the stepped-down primary: 

      1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options. Include any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         ``--bind_ip``.
 
         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>  --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

         Or if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`net.port`, and any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         :setting:`net.bindIp`, and start the |oldversion| binary:

         .. code-block:: yaml

            sharding:
               clusterRole: shardsvr
            net:
               port: <port>
