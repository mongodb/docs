|operation-name| includes all fields by default, except
:data:`~serverStatus.workingSet`, by default.

.. note::

   You may only dynamically include top-level fields from the
   :data:`serverStatus` document that are not included by default. You
   can exclude any field that |operation-name| includes by
   default.
