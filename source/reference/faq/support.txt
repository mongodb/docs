How do I get support for my Atlas clusters?
-------------------------------------------

Using the in-app chat or opening a support case, :doc:`request support
</support>` through the |service| console. Support for development and
performance of the database requires an upgraded support plan.

For more information on support plans or to subscribe to an 
upgraded support plan, you can either:

- Contact |mdb-support|, or

- Navigate to your organization's :guilabel:`Support` tab in the 
  |service| console.

  .. seealso::
  
     :ref:`Modify a Support Plan <subscribe-support>`.

Where can I view the system status of the MongoDB Cloud?
--------------------------------------------------------

Visit https://status.cloud.mongodb.com for the status of the
MongoDB Cloud, including |service| and |mms|.

You can also subscribe to an
`RSS feed <http://status.cloud.mongodb.com/rss>`_ of the MongoDB
Cloud Status page using your preferred RSS reader.
