Description
-----------

Reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

For example:

- You have a ``COMMITTED`` sync operation.

- ``cluster0`` is the source and ``cluster1`` is the destination.

- After the sync operation is ``COMMITTED``, new writes occur only on
  the destination cluster. The source cluster will not accept new
  writes.

In this scenario, you can use the ``reverse`` endpoint to sync writes
from ``cluster1`` to ``cluster0``.

Requirements
------------

To use the ``reverse`` endpoint:

- You must have started your original sync operation with the
  ``reversible`` and ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` options set to
  ``true``.
- ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.
- Source and destination clusters must be MongoDB 6.0 or later.
- :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>` on the original source
  cluster must be formatted properly. If an upgraded cluster has unique
  indexes that were created in MongoDB 4.2 or earlier, you must
  :ref:`resync <resync-replica-member>` all of the nodes in the
  original source cluster before reversing.

Request
-------

.. code-block:: http
   :copyable: false

   POST /api/v1/reverse 

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/api/facts/no-body-parameters.rst

Response
--------

.. include:: /includes/api/tables/basic-response.rst

Example
-------

The following example reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

Request
~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/reverse.sh
   :language: shell

Response
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Behavior
--------

If the ``reverse`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``RUNNING`` state. The synchronization continues in the reverse
direction from the original sync job. You do not need to restart the
entire sync process to copy the original data.

To view the mapping direction for the synchronization of the source and
destination clusters, use the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>`
endpoint and check the ``directionMapping`` object.
