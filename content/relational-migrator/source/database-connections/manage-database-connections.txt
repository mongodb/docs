You can copy, edit, or delete database connections from the {+rel-mig+}
:guilabel:`Connections` page. Saved connections are listed by their environment
tag. You can mouse over the :icon-fa5:`info-circle` icon for a connection to
see a list of projects that use that connection.

Create a Connection
-------------------

You can create a connection by using one of the following places in the
:ref:`Relational Migrator UI <rm-project-overview>`.

Creating a New Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a connection when you create a new project. After selecting
:guilabel:`Connect to live database` from the :guilabel:`New Project`
page, select the :guilabel:`Add a new connection` option. See :ref:`rm-projects`
for more information.

Connections Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Connections` tab on the home screen, click
:guilabel:`+ Add connection`.

Database Connections Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a project's :guilabel:`Database Connections Bar`, open the
of :guilabel:`Relational` connections and click :guilabel:`+ Add connection`.

Creating or Modifying a Data Migration Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a project's :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab, 
click :guilabel:`Create migration job` 
and select :guilabel:`Add a new connection`. See :ref:`rm-create-jobs`
for more information.

Copy a Connection
-----------------

You can copy an existing connection. This can be useful if you want multiple
connections to the same server that each connect to different databases, or if
you have similar connection information for a staging database and a 
production database.

Copying a connection creates a duplicate with ``-Copy`` appended to the
connection name.


Steps
~~~~~

To copy a connection:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :icon-lg:`Copy` icon.

   .. step:: Make any desired changes.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.



Edit a Connection
-----------------

You can edit an existing connection to change any settings except for the
database type. This can be useful for:

- Renaming the connection
- Adding changing, or removing the :guilabel:`Environment tag`
- Changing authentication credentials or SSL settings


Steps
~~~~~

To edit a connection:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :icon-lg:`Edit` icon.

   .. step:: Make any desired changes, such as renaming the connection or changing the database.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.



Delete a Connection
-------------------

You can delete a connection that you no longer need. Deleting a relational
database connection causes any projects using that connection to fall back to
{+rel-mig+}'s last copy of the database contents. Mapping rules remain
in place.

Steps
~~~~~

To delete a connection:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :icon-lg:`Trash` icon.

      A warning dialog displays and lists any projects that use the connection.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Delete` to confirm.
