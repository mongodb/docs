You can configure your |service| project to use an |aws| `IAM role 
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ 
for accessing your |aws| KMS keys for encryption at rest. You can either 
use an existing role or create a new role when you enable encryption at 
rest for your project.

This page covers configuring customer key management on your |service| 
project for role-based access.

If you have not yet enabled encryption at rest for your new or existing 
|service| project, follow the :ref:`aws-kms-enable-project` procedure to 
enable encryption at rest for your |service| project. If you have an 
|service| project for which you have already enabled encryption at rest 
and configured credentials-based access to your encryption keys, follow 
the :ref:`aws-kms-switch-project` procedure to switch to role-based 
access to your encryption keys.

You must configure customer key management for the |service| project
before enabling it on clusters in that project.

   If your switch your |service| project from credentials-based access 
   to role-based access to your encryption keys, you cannot undo the 
   role-based access configuration and revert to credentials-based access 
   for that project.
