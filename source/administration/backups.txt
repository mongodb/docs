Backups are an important part of any operational disaster recovery
plan. A good backup plan must be able to capture data in
a consistent and usable state, and operators must be able to automate
both the backup and the recovery operations. Also test all components
of the backup system to ensure that you can recover backed up data as
needed. If you cannot effectively restore your database from the
backup, then your backups are useless. This document addresses
higher level backup strategies, for more information on specific
backup procedures consider the following documents:

Backup Considerations
---------------------

As you develop a backup strategy for your MongoDB deployment consider
the following factors:

- Geography. Ensure that you move some backups away from the your
  primary database infrastructure.

- System errors. Ensure that your backups can survive situations where
  hardware failures or disk errors impact the integrity or
  availability of your backups.

- Production constraints. Backup operations themselves sometimes require
  substantial system resources. It is important to consider the time of
  the backup schedule relative to peak usage and maintenance windows.

- System capabilities. Some of the block-level snapshot tools require
  special support on the operating-system or infrastructure level.

- Database configuration. :term:`Replication` and :term:`sharding
  <shard>` can affect the process and impact of the backup
  implementation. See :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups` and
  :ref:`replica-set-backups`.

- Actual requirements. You may be able to save time, effort, and space
  by including only crucial data in the most frequent backups and
  backing up less crucial data less frequently.

.. _backup-approaches:

Approaches to Backing Up MongoDB Systems
----------------------------------------

There are two main methodologies for backing up MongoDB
instances. Creating binary "dumps" of the database using
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` or creating filesystem level snapshots. Both
methodologies have advantages and disadvantages:

- binary database dumps are comparatively small, because they don't
  include index content or pre-allocated free space, and :ref:`record
  padding <write-operations-padding-factor>`. However, it's impossible to
  capture a copy of a running system that reflects a single moment in
  time using a binary dump.

- filesystem snapshots, sometimes called block level backups, produce
  larger backup sizes, but complete quickly and can reflect a single
  moment in time on a running system. However, snapshot systems
  require filesystem and operating system support and tools.

The best option depends on the requirements of your deployment and
disaster recovery needs. Typically, filesystem snapshots are because
of their accuracy and simplicity; however, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` is a
viable option used often to generate backups of MongoDB systems.

The following topics provide details and procedures on the two approaches:

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-databases-with-filesystem-snapshots`.
- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-databases-with-binary-database-dumps`.

In some cases, taking backups is difficult or impossible because of
large data volumes, distributed architectures, and data transmission
speeds. In these situations, increase the number of members in your
replica set or sets.

Backup Strategies for MongoDB Deployments

.. _sharded-cluster-backups:

Sharded Cluster Backup Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/note-shard-cluster-backup.rst

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` complicate backup operations,
as distributed systems. True point-in-time backups are only possible
when stopping all write activity from the application. To create a
precise moment-in-time snapshot of a cluster, stop all application write
activity to the database, capture a backup, and allow only write
operations to the database after the backup is complete.

However, you can capture a backup of a cluster that **approximates** a
point-in-time backup by capturing a backup from a secondary member of
the replica sets that provide the shards in the cluster at roughly the
same moment. If you decide to use an approximate-point-in-time backup
method, ensure that your application can operate using a copy of the
data that does not reflect a single moment in time.

The following documents describe sharded cluster related backup
procedures:

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-small-sharded-cluster-with-mongodump`
- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots`
- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps`
- :doc:`/tutorial/schedule-backup-window-for-sharded-clusters`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-single-shard`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster`

.. _replica-set-backups:

Replica Set Backup Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, backing up data stored in a :term:`replica set` is
similar to backing up data stored in a single instance. It is possible
to lock a single :term:`secondary` database and then create a backup
from that instance. When you unlock the database, the secondary will
catch up with the :term:`primary`. You may also choose to deploy a
dedicated :term:`hidden member` for backup purposes.

If you have a :term:`sharded cluster` where each :term:`shard` is itself
a replica set, you can use this method to create a backup of the entire
cluster without disrupting the operation of the node. In these
situations you should still turn off the balancer when you create
backups.

For any cluster, using a non-primary node to create backups is
particularly advantageous in that the backup operation does not affect
the performance of the primary. Replication itself provides some measure
of redundancy. Nevertheless, keeping point-in time backups of your
cluster to provide for disaster recovery and as an additional layer of
protection is crucial.
