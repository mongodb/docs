Cloud Service Provider and Region
---------------------------------

|service| supports deploying clusters onto :ref:`Amazon Web Services
<amazon-aws>`, the :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp>`, and
:ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`. The choice of cloud service
provider and region or regions for the |service| project affects the
cost of running a |service| cluster.

Multi-region cluster costs depend on the number of and location of
additional regions selected. When creating a cluster, |service|
displays the :ref:`cluster tier cost <instance-size-costs>` based on
only the :guilabel:`Preferred Region` of the cluster. You can see the
total cost of running the cluster in the :guilabel:`Cluster Overview`.

To learn more about configuring your cloud provider and region, see
:ref:`Cloud Providers and Regions <create-cluster-cloud-provider-region>`.

.. _instance-size-costs:

Cluster Tier
-------------

|service| provides different :ref:`cluster tiers <create-cluster-instance>`.
Each cluster tier has a default RAM capacity, storage capacity, and
maximum storage speed. The cluster's per-hour charge includes these
default values. |service| uses the selected cluster when deploying all
the data-bearing [#data-bearing]_ servers in your cluster.

Depending on the choice of cloud service provider, |service| provides
customization options for :ref:`cluster storage capacity <storage-capacity>`
and the :ref:`speed <instance-storage-speed>` of that storage. If you
add capacity or speed, you incur additional costs on top of the base
cost. For multi-region clusters, the per-cluster cost, including any
selected customizations, is relative to the
:guilabel:`Preferred Region`. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
shows your overall charges.

.. _storage-capacity:
.. _instance-storage-capacity:

Storage Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for :ref:`storage capacity <create-cluster-storage>`
differently depending on whether you use the cluster default or specify
a custom storage capacity.

- If you use the default storage capacity, |service| includes its cost
  in the {+cluster+}'s per-hour cost. However, when you pause the
  {+cluster+}, the [service] cost includes a charge for the default
  storage.

- If you customize the amount of storage capacity, |service| charges
  for the full amount of storage. |service| doesn't deduct the cost of
  the default storage capacity. This change can be a disk upgrade or a
  instance family change such as changing from general CPU to low-CPU.

.. example::

   A new ``M10`` cluster defaults to 10 GB of storage. You can increase
   this amount up to 120 GB of storage using this cluster tier.

   If you increase the storage capacity to 50 GB, your monthly
   |service| cost includes 50 GB of storage, not the cost of the
   additional 40 GB.

.. note::

   Increasing storage capacity can change the maximum |iops| available
   with each :guilabel:`Custom Storage Speed`.

|service| only charges for storage for paused {+clusters+}. |service|
does not charge for any other services or data transfer on paused
{+clusters+}. To learn more, see :ref:`pause-terminate-cluster`.

.. _storage-speed:
.. _instance-storage-speed:

Custom Storage Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| measures storage speed as maximum |iops|. Each |service|
:ref:`{+cluster+} tier <instance-size-costs>` offers a default storage
speed that is included in the cluster's per-hour cost. The choice of
cloud service provider and cluster affects the available storage
speed customization options, as well as the cost of selecting a custom
storage speed.

.. tabs-cloud-providers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: azure

      All {+clusters+} use premium |ssd| disks with |iops| based on the
      storage capacity. The maximum |iops| increases as
      you increase storage capacity for the {+cluster+} in the same tier.
      The cost of the increased |iops| is included in the cost of the
      increased storage capacity. If you choose to increase |iops| in
      addition to the increased |iops| that comes with the increased
      storage capacity, MongoDB charges you more.

      To learn more, see :ref:`Change Storage Capacity and IOPS on Azure <change-storage-capacity-azure>`
      and :azure:`High-performance Premium Storage and Managed Disks for VMs </storage/storage-premium-storage>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: aws

      For most cluster types, you can increase storage speed from
      :guilabel:`Standard` to :guilabel:`Fast` or :guilabel:`Fastest`,
      which affects costs. Selecting a custom speed changes both |iops|
      and the type of storage used. The storage type changes from a
      general-purpose |ssd| to a provisioned-|iops| |ssd|.
      To learn more about storage types, see
      :aws:`Amazon EBS Volume Types </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: gcp

      All clusters use |ssd| persistent disks with fixed maximum |iops|
      based on the cluster storage capacity. The maximum |iops|
      increases as storage capacity increases. The cost of the
      increased maximum |iops| is included in the cost of the increased
      storage capacity. To learn more about the |gcp| persistent disks,
      see :gcp:`Persistent Disks </compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs>`.

Cluster Auto-Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help minimize cluster costs while retaining the flexibility to
easily scale your cluster, you can enable
:ref:`Cluster Auto-Scaling <cluster-autoscaling>`. With auto-scaling,
your cluster automatically scales its tier, storage capacity, or both
in response to cluster usage. Auto-scaling reduces the need to
manually optimize your cluster to adapt to your current workload.

.. _cluster-config-costs-backup:

Backup
------

|service| supports :doc:`Cloud Backups </backup/cloud-backup/overview>`. 
For each cluster with cloud backups enabled, |service| bills you for:

- Storage costs for data in your replica set
- Storage costs for the configuration server replica set in sharded deployments
- Network transfer costs of restoring a snapshot

To learn how |service| charges for network data, see :ref:`data-transfer-costs`.

.. _billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots:

{+Cloud-Backup+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   If you enabled {+PIT-Restore+}s, |service| bills you using the rates
   given for :ref:`billing-backup-cps-pit`.

Atlas cloud backups provides localized backup storage using the native snapshot 
functionality of the cluster's cloud service provider. 
Snapshots in Cloud Backups are incremental snapshots, where in most cases 
after the first snapshot, a new snapshot saves only the data that changed 
after your most recent snapshot. For example, a cluster with 10 GB of data 
and 3 snapshots may require less than 30 GB of total snapshot storage 
depending on how data changed between snapshots. 

Incrementality is determined by your cluster's cloud service provider. 
To compute the cost for Cloud Backups, Atlas obtains the raw metric data 
from the cloud providers and calculates the total size of all snapshots 
based on the region where it stores the snapshot and the amount of 
storage used per month.

The cost for {+Cloud-Backup+}s is calculated per GB per month. Rates 
vary between cloud providers and between regions within a given cloud 
provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 25 50

   * - Cloud Provider
     - Cost per GB

   * - |aws|
     - $0.14 to $0.19

   * - |azure|
     - $0.34 to $0.65

   * - |gcp|
     - $0.08 to $0.12

While this rate determines the cost of the backup, your bill displays
this item in terms of ``GB days``. This appears as a line item each 
day, but does not result in duplicated charges. Each backup retained
on a given day contributes to the total ``GB days`` billed for that
day.

.. example::

   You back up 400 GB of data from a cluster in an |aws| region with a
   $0.14 per month Cost per GB, yielding a cost of $56.00.

   To determine the price in ``GB days``, use the following formula:
   
   ``((GB per month rate) * 12 months)/365 days``. 
   
   In this case: ``($0.14 * 12)/365 = $0.004603``. A 400 GB backup will
   appear in your billing statement as 400 GB days at a price of 
   $0.004603, for a total cost of $1.84 for the day. In a 30-day month,
   the cost of retaining one 400 GB backup totals $55.20.

.. note::
  |service| applies a default backup policy to {+Cloud-Backup+}-enabled 
  {+clusters+} on creation. Review and :ref:`change the backup policy 
  <cloud-provider-backup-schedule>` as needed.
  
|service| can bill backup as high as the total storage capacity of the
volume. This depends upon how the cloud provider stores the volume
snapshots.

When restoring a cluster using a manual download via |https|, |service|
also charges for:

- Each hour that the download link remains active 
  (*Atlas Backup Download VM* charge).

- The total storage capacity of the restore virtual machine data volume 
  (*Atlas Backup Restore Storage* charge).

- :ref:`Data transfer <data-transfer-costs>` costs for downloading the
  snapshot over the public internet or for downloading the snapshot
  over :ref:`private endpoints <billing-private-endpoints-clusters>`
  for |service| {+clusters+} on |aws| or |azure| with private
  endpoints. These costs vary by cloud provider and region. To learn
  more, see :ref:`billing-private-endpoints-clusters`.

Cloud Backup Considerations
```````````````````````````

|service| can retain more than one full snapshot per replica set or shard in certain cases. 
This may result in a higher invoice due to less overall snapshot incrementality.
|service| might retain more than one full snapshot in the following cases:

- When a snapshot is taken on a different node than the previous snapshot due to node or region failover.
- When a cluster's configuration changes (including cluster tier, storage volume, or IOPS).
- When region priority changes for a multi-region cluster and a new node becomes responsible for snapshots.
- During maintenance performed by the cluster’s cloud provider.

If |service| must retain more than one snapshot, |service| stores the new snapshot 
in the same region as the cluster's current backup node. 
|service| continues using that backup node for snapshots and snapshot storage. 
 
|service| might charge for backup up to the total storage capacity of the volume, depending 
on how your cloud provider stores volume snapshots.

.. example::

   A storage volume on the cloud provider has a capacity of 4 TB. The
   cloud provider informs |service| that the snapshots occupy the full
   volume capacity even though your backups only occupy 500 GB. Due to
   this reporting, |service| bills you for 4 TB in backup storage.

To learn more about how Atlas manages snapshot storage, see 
:ref:`Back Up Your {+Database-Deployment+} <backup-cloud-provider>`.

.. include:: /includes/cps-sizing-support.rst

.. _billing-backup-cps-pit:

{+PIT-Restore+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cluster owners may enable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} restores <pit-restore>` 
from Cloud Backups. |pit| backups are billed based on the disk space 
occupied by an internal oplog, combined with the cloud backup 
snapshot size.

You can :ref:`configure <create-cluster-backups>` |pit| backups to
cover a window of time that you specify. Longer backup windows result
in larger oplogs and higher backup costs.

To compute the cost for {+PIT-Restore+}s, |service| obtains the raw
metric data from the cloud providers and calculates the *total* size of
all snapshots and the amount of storage used per month:

- The cloud provider
- The region in which the snapshots are stored
- The usage tier

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 25 15 15 15 15 15

   * - Cloud Provider
     - 0-5 GB Storage Used (Tier 0)
     - 5-100 GB Storage Used (Tier 1)
     - 100-250 GB Storage Used (Tier 2)
     - 250-500 GB Storage Used (Tier 3)
     - >500 GB Storage Used (Tier 4)

   * - |aws|
     - 
     - $1.00 to $1.55
     - $0.75 to $1.20
     - $0.50 to $0.80
     - $0.25 to $0.40

   * - |azure|
     - 
     - $1.00 to $3.95
     - $0.75 to $2.95
     - $0.50 to $2.00
     - $0.55 to $1.00

   * - |gcp|
     - 
     - $0.60 to $0.95
     - $0.45 to $0.70
     - $0.30 to $0.50
     - $0.15 to $0.25

.. example::

   A cluster on |aws| in the ``US_EAST_1`` region has a combined total 
   snapshot and oplog size of 115 GB. The first 5 GB are free. The 
   remaining 110 GB are billed at $1.00 from 5 to 100 GB, and at $0.75
   from 100 GB to 115 GB:

   (95 × $1.00) + (15 × $0.75) = $106.25 per month

.. note::
  |service| applies a default backup policy to {+Cloud-Backup+}-enabled 
  {+clusters+} on creation. Review and :ref:`change the backup policy 
  <cloud-provider-backup-schedule>` as needed. 
   
Multi-Region Snapshot Distribution Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| bills you for the following items:

- Cross region data transfer when you copy your backups to another
  region.

- Enabling :guilabel:`Additional Backup Copies` for your {+cluster+}, 
  and using additional storage in other regions. For example, 
  if you copy all of your backups to one additional region, you pay for 
  approximately twice the storage: an amount for your standard backup, 
  and approximately the same amount for your copies stored in the other 
  region (storage costs vary by region). Furthermore, when copying backups 
  to a GCP region, snapshot incrementality is **not** preserved. This can lead 
  to an exponential increase in cost, especially for customers with large data 
  sizes, as each copied snapshot is a **full** snapshot. For example, if you 
  have a cluster with 1TB of data and your current backup storage amount in 
  your billing invoice shows an average of 3TB of backup storage (due to the 
  incremental changes in your data over time), copying 10 backups to another 
  region in GCP will incur 1TB of data transfer cost for each copy and 10TB of 
  backup storage for the secondary backup region (1TB of data size * 10 copied 
  snapshots).

  .. important:: Google Cloud Platform
   
     In |gcp| regions, the incrementality of your backups is not 
     preserved. Each copy stored in |gcp| is a full copy.
     Because of this, enabling backup copies in a |gcp| region will 
     likely result in exponentially higher costs compared to other 
     cloud providers.

     In |aws| and |azure| regions, the incrementality of your backups is 
     preserved during the copy process.

Lowering the Monthly Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The amount that you can reduce your costs varies depending on your deployment's configuration. 
You can reduce your |service| backup costs in the following ways:

- Delete unneeded backup snapshots
- Reduce the frequency that |service| creates backup snapshots
- Reduce the retention time of backup snapshots 
- Modify the backup policy to reduce the number of snapshots automatically copied to additional regions 
- Increase the efficiency of your application's database access patterns for better snapshot incrementality 
  (for example, using a simple insert instead of updating an array is a more efficient operation and might improve snapshot incrementality)
- Change the cluster’s backup cloud provider or region
- Reduce the restore window duration (for {+pit-restore+}s only)

.. note::
   
   When you delete a snapshot, deleted data that exists in any other snapshot is 
   still counted as unique data. Unique data is only deleted from the sequence 
   of snapshots if all snapshots that reference that data are deleted.

|bic|
-----

.. include:: /includes/abic-deprecation.rst

Excluding |service-fullname| Enterprise and |service-fullname| Platinum
customers, if |bic| is enabled for your cluster:

- The billing rate for the |bic| is described in the cluster console
  as a daily uplift on the cost of the associated cluster. You can
  view the rate when :ref:`deploying your cluster <create-new-cluster>`
  or by :doc:`modifying your cluster </scale-cluster>`.

- |bic| has a sustained-usage pricing. That is, the daily rate is
  charged only up to a maximum for the month.

.. _server-number-costs:

Number of Nodes
---------------

|service| charges the cluster cost and data storage cost for each
data-bearing node [#data-bearing]_ in your cluster.

- For a replica set, the number of data-bearing nodes equals the
  replication factor.

- For a sharded cluster, the number of data-bearing nodes equals the
  replication factor multiplied by the number of shards.

If you enable sharding, |service| also runs three
:ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` in addition to your
data-bearing nodes. Your selections for cluster tier and data
storage do not affect the costs of the config nodes. Config servers
are charged at a separate rate. Their cost is reflected in the cost of
the cluster.
