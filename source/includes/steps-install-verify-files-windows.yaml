  Get the public signature file for your MongoDB version.

  For example, for the SHA256 signature for the latest {+version+} of
  MongoDB Community Edition:
 
  #. From `<https://fastdl.mongodb.org/win32/mongodb-win32-x86_64-2012plus-{+release+}-signed.msi.sha256>`_, copy the content.
  
  #. Save the content to a file ``mongodb-win32-x86_64-2012plus-{+release+}-signed.msi.sha256`` in your Downloads folder.

title: Compare the signature file to the MongoDB installer hash.
level: 4
ref: download-key-file
content: |

  To compare the signature file to the hash of the MongoDB binary, 
  invoke this Powershell script:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     $sigHash = (Get-Content $Env:HomePath\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2012plus-{+release+}-signed.msi.sha256 | Out-String).SubString(0,64).ToUpper(); `
     $fileHash = (Get-FileHash $Env:HomePath\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2012plus-{+release+}-signed.msi).Hash.Trim(); `
     echo $sigHash; echo $fileHash; `
     $sigHash -eq $fileHash

  .. code-block:: bat
     :emphasize-lines: 1-2

     {+windows-sha256+}
     {+windows-sha256+}
     True

  The command outputs three lines:
  
  - A ``SHA256`` hash that you downloaded directly from MongoDB.
  - A ``SHA256`` hash computed from the MongoDB binary you
    downloaded from MongoDB.
  - A ``True`` or ``False`` result depending if the hashes match.
 
  If the hashes match, the MongoDB binary is verified.
