Follow this tutorial to learn how to configure a {+sink-connector+}
to read data from an Apache Kafka topic and write it to a MongoDB
collection.

Get Started with the MongoDB Kafka Sink Connector
-------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style:connected

   .. step:: Complete the Tutorial Setup

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/setup.rst

   .. step:: Configure the Sink Connector

      Create an interactive shell session on the tutorial Docker Container
      using the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      Create a source configuration file called ``simplesink.json`` with
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         nano simplesink.json

      Paste the following configuration information into the file and save
      your changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/sink-connector/simplesink.json 
         language: json
         :copyable: true
         :emphasize-lines: 7-9

      .. note::

         The highlighted lines in the configuration properties specify
         **converters** which instruct the connector how to translate the data
         from Kafka.

      Run the following command in the shell to start the sink connector
      using the configuration file you created:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         cx simplesink.json

      .. note::

         The ``cx`` command is a custom script included in the tutorial
         development environment. This script runs the following
         equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new
         connector:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :copyable: true

            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @simplesink.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n"

      Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the
      connectors:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         status

      If your sink connector started successfully, you should see the
      following output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/sink-connector/output/kc.out
         :language: text
         :copyable: false

   .. step:: Write Data to a Kafka Topic

      In the same shell, create a Python script to write data to a Kafka
      topic.

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         nano kafkawrite.py

      Paste the following code into the file and save your changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/sink-connector/kafkawrite.py
         :language: python
         :copyable: true

      Run the Python script:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         python3 kafkawrite.py

   .. step:: View the Data in the MongoDB Collection

      In the same shell, connect to MongoDB using ``mongosh``, the MongoDB
      shell by running the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         mongosh "mongodb://mongo1"

      After you connect successfully, you should see the following
      MongoDB shell prompt:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         rs0 [direct: primary] test>

      At the prompt, type the following commands to retrieve all the
      documents in the ``Tutorial2.pets`` MongoDB namespace:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: true

         use Tutorial2
         db.pets.find()

      You should see the following document returned as the result:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         { _id: ObjectId("62659..."), name: 'roscoe' }

      Exit the MongoDB shell by entering the command ``exit``.

   .. step:: (Optional) Stop the Docker Containers

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/stop-containers.rst

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you configured a sink connector to save data from
a Kafka topic to a collection in a MongoDB cluster.
