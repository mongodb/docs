Production Cluster Architecture
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In a production cluster, you must ensure that data is redundant and that
your systems are highly available. To that end, a production
cluster must have the following components:

- Three :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`. Each config
  servers must be on separate machines. A single :term:`sharded
  cluster` must have exclusive use of its :ref:`config servers
  <sharding-config-server>`. If you have multiple sharded clusters,
  you will need to have a group of config servers for each cluster.

- Two or more :term:`replica sets <replica set>`. These replica sets
  are the :term:`shards <shard>`. For information on replica sets, see
  :doc:`/replication`.

- One or more :program:`mongos` instances.  :program:`mongos` is the
  routers for the cluster. Typically, deployments have one
  :program:`mongos` instance on each application server. You may also
  may deploy a group of :program:`mongos` instances and use a
  proxy/load balancer between the application and the
  :program:`mongos`.
