  a. Create a file named ``date-range.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the
     ``date-range.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:
      
     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your cluster.
     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection:

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-clauses.rst
