  For security purposes, |service| does not show your MongoDB user's
  password in the connection string. Instead, your connection string
  has a placeholder ``<password>``.
  
  Open your preferred text editor and paste the connection string that
  you copied from Atlas. Replace ``<password>`` with the password you
  specified when you created your MongoDB user.

  To connect to a running MongoDB instance, PyMongo
  requires ``MongoClient``. In the Python shell running in your
  terminal, run the following
  command to import ``MongoClient``:

  .. code-block:: python

      from pymongo import MongoClient

  In your Python shell, run the following command to specify a
  client to connect to your cluster. You will need to paste your
  updated connection string from your text editor into this command:

  .. code-block:: python

     client = MongoClient('<your updated connection string>')

  Your connection string should be in single quotes, and should be
  updated to contain your MongoDB user password. After you run this
  command, you will be able to connect to your cluster using this
  client.
