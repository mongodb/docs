=================================
Change Hostnames in a Replica Set
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

For most :term:`replica sets <replica set>` the hostnames
[#hostnames-ips-dns]_ in the :data:`members[n].host` field never
change. However, in some cases you must migrate some or all host names
in a replica set as organizational needs change. This
document presents two possible procedures for changing the hostnames
in the :data:`members[n].host` field. Depending on your environments
availability requirements, you may:

#. Make the configuration change without disrupting the availability
   of the replica set. While this ensures that your application will
   always be able to read and write data to the replica set, this
   procedure can take a long time and may incur downtime at the
   application layer. [#application-changes]_

   For this procedure, see :ref:`replica-set-change-hostname-no-downtime`.

#. Stop all members of the replica set at once running on the "old"
   hostnames or interfaces, make the configuration changes, and then
   start the members at the new hostnames or interfaces. While the set
   will be totally unavailable during the operation, the total
   maintenance window is often shorter.

   For this procedure, see :ref:`replica-set-change-hostname-downtime`.

   - :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`
   - :ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration Process <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`
   - :func:`rs.conf()` and :func:`rs.reconfig()`

   And the following tutorials:

   - :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`

.. [#hostnames-ips-dns] Always use resolvable hostnames
   for the value of the :data:`members[n].host` field in the replica
   set configuration to avoid confusion and complexity.

.. [#application-changes] You will have to configure your applications
   so that they can connect to the replica set at both the old and new
   locations. This often requires a restart and reconfiguration at the
   application layer, which may affect the availability of your
   applications. This re-configuration is beyond the scope of this
   document and makes the :ref:`second option <replica-set-change-hostname-downtime>`
   preferable when you must change the hostnames of *all* members of
   the replica set at once.

Changing Hostnames while Maintaining the Replica Set's Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo given a dummy config. 

#. For each :term:`secondary` in the replica set, perform the
   following sequence of operations:

   .. todo note about stopping things 

   a. For example, given a secondary with hostname
      ``database0.example.net:27017`` that you want to change to
      ``mongodb0.database.example.net:27017``, you could change the
      hostname by starting this secondary on a different port for
      maintenance, as shown here:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --dbpath /data/db/ --port 37017

      .. make it clear that the db path is the same. 

   #. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the replica set's
      :term:`primary` and then call :func:`rs.reconfigure()` to
      reconfigure the set. For example, for a primary running on port
      ``37107``, you would issue the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --port 37017

      .. make clear that its the same host as in a.) 

   #. Then run the following reconfiguration option, for the
      :data:`members[n].host`  value where ``n`` is ``2``:

      .. code-block:: javascript
 
         cfg = rs.conf()

         cfg.members[2].host = mongodb2.databse.example.net:27017

         rs.reconfigure(cfg)

      See :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` for more
      information.

   #. Make sure that your client applications are able to access the
      set at the new location and that the secondary has a chance to
      catch up with the other members of the set.

      Repeat the above steps for each non-primary member of the set.

#. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the primary and step
   down the primary using :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`. In the
   :program:`mongo` shell, use the the :func:`rs.stepDown()` wrapper,
   as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

#. When the step down succeeds, shut down the primary.

#. To make the final configuration change, connect to the new primary in
   the :program:`mongo` shell and reconfigure the :data:`members[n].host`
   value where ``n`` is ``0``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()

      cfg.members[0].host = mongodb0.databse.example.net:27017

      rs.reconfigure(cfg)

#. Start the original primary.

#. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the primary.

#. To confirm the new configuration, call :func:`rs.status()` in the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

   .. output ofchanged rsconfig.

Changing All Hostnames in Replica Set at Once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Stop all members in the :term:`replica set`.

#. Restart each member *on a different port* and *without* using the
   :option:`--replSet <mongod --replset>` run-time option. Changing
   the port number during maintenance prevents clients from connecting
   to this host while you perform maintenance. Use a command that
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db/ --port 37017

#. For each member of the replica set, perform the following sequence
   of operations:

   a. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongod`
      running on the new, temporary port. For example, for a member
      running on a temporary port of ``37017``, you would issue this
      command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --port 37017

   #. Edit the replica set configuration manually. The replica set
      configuration is the only document in the ``system.replset``
      collection in the ``local`` database. Edit the replica set
      configuration with the new hostnames and correct ports for all
      the members of the replica set. Consider the following sequence of
      commands to change the hostnames in a three-member set:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use local

         cfg = db.system.replset.findOne( { "_id": "rs0" } )

         cfg.members[0].host = "mdb0.example.net:27017"

         cfg.members[1].host = "mdb1.example.net:27018"

         cfg.members[2].host = "mdb2.example.net:27019"

         db.system.replset.update( { "_id": "rs0" } , cfg )

   #. Stop the :program:`mongod` process on the member.

#. After re-configuring all members of the set, start each
   :program:`mongod` instance in the normal way: use the usual port
   number and use the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replset>` option. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db/ --port 27017 --replSet rs0

#. Connect to one of the :program:`mongod` instances
   using the :program:`mongo` shell. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --port 27017

#.  Run :func:`rs.stdatus()` to confirm that the set has reconfigured.
    For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rs.status()
