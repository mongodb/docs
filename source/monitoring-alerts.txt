|service| provides the following ways to monitor your cluster's performance.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

|service| collects and displays metrics on the state of your cluster's
databases and on server usage. Metrics provide an indication of when
you must modify your database configuration or add server capacity. See
:doc:`monitor-cluster-metrics`.

.. _alerts:

Alerts
------

|service| notifies you when your database operations or server usage
reach thresholds that affect your cluster's performance. See:

- :doc:`/respond-to-alerts`

- :doc:`/configure-alerts`

- :doc:`/alert-resolutions`

.. _mongodb-logs:

MongoDB Logs
------------

Each :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
tier keeps an account of its activity in its own log file. |service|
retains the last 30 days of :manual:`log messages
</reference/log-messages>` for each tier in a cluster. The Performance
Advisor retains at most 7 days of logs for each tier in a cluster.

.. note::

   ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters do not provide downloadable logs.

To download the logs for a single tier in a given cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/download-logs.rst

For information on reading MongoDB logs, refer to the
:manual:`Log Messages </reference/log-messages>` documentation in the
MongoDB manual.

Database Access Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-free-tier-limits.rst

You can :doc:`view authentication attempts </access-tracking>` that
were made against your cluster. Both successful and unsuccessful
attempts are logged, including the timestamp of the attempt and which user tried to authenticate.
