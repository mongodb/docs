MongoDB deployments can support large-scale databases with 
high transaction volumes, making performance tuning essential.
Regular tuning helps identify issues within the cluster 
early, allowing you to address them before they 
impact system responsiveness or stability.

This document addresses some common methods to optimize 
your deployment performance by using performance tuning 
and helpful metrics. These methods apply to both 
MongoDB Atlas clusters and self-managed deployments. 
However, the tuning process is significantly easier 
with :ref:`MongoDB Atlas <unified-get-started>`, which 
automates many tasks and streamlines for efficiency. 
For more information on performance, see :ref:`performance`.

Run Your Queries at Top Speed
-----------------------------

To ensure optimal query performance, you can use metrics that reveal 
query performance problems and tell you what to do if you find slow queries.

MongoDB log files record the execution time and method for each 
query, allowing you to search for slow queries. The 
:ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>` 
logs queries exceeding a specified threshold.

If a query is slow, first access your query plans. For more information 
on finding query plan data, see :ref:`explain-results`. 

- Ensure that your query performed an index scan, rather than 
  a collection scan. 
  
  An index scan limits the number of documents that MongoDB 
  inspects, while a collection scan requires that MongoDB reads
  all documents in a collection. To learn more about how 
  to interpret plan results, see :ref:`interpret-explain-plan`.

- If you see a lot of collection scans in your explain plan 
  results, consider adding an :ref:`index <indexes>`. 

  .. note::

     Indexes can slow down writes and updates, so having too many 
     underutilized indexes may hinder document modifications or 
     insertions, depending on your workload.

Query Metrics 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use the following query metrics to ensure 
your query is running at top speed:

- :serverstatus:`metrics.queryExecutor.scanned`
  tells you how many documents were scanned to return your query results. 

  - Ideally, the ratio of scanned documents
    to returned documents is 1:1, which means MongoDB returns
    all documents. Typically, the ratio is greater than 1, 
    indicating MongoDB does not return some scanned documents.

  - The ratio can be less than 1 or even 0, 
    indicating a covered query where the index contains all necessary data.

  - If MongoDB is scanning large numbers of documents
    to respond to your query, you may be missing indexes or need to
    optimize your query.

- :serverstatus:`metrics.operation.scanAndOrder` 
  indicates the server's effort to sort query results. 

  - A high Scan and Order number, such as 20 or more, indicates 
    that the server is having to sort results, increasing 
    query result time and server memory load.

  - To fix a high Scan and Order number, sort your indexes according 
    to query requirements, or add any missing indexes.
    Generally, sort b-tree indexes in ascending order from 
    the leading field in the index, if it's a compound index.

- The :ref:`WiredTiger Ticket Number <storage-wiredtiger>` 
  metric reflects the performance of the WiredTiger
  storage engine.

  - WiredTiger read and write tickets are the WiredTiger storage engine's 
    concurrency control mechanism to manage the number of concurrent transactions. 
    Starting in version 7.0, MongoDB uses a dynamic algorithm to adjust the 
    maximum number of concurrent storage engine transactions, 
    optimizing database throughput during cluster overload.
  
  - The read and write tickets control the maximum number of concurrent transactions.
    The WiredTiger ticket number should always be at 128. Sustained 
    values below 128 indicates a server delay and consequential potential issues.

  - To remedy a low WiredTiger ticket number: 

    - Ensure that the Dynamic Adjustment feature is enabled to 
      manage ticket allocation automatically.

    - Ensure that your cluster has sufficient resources, such as 
      CPU and memory, to handle the workload.

    - If you are using MongoDB 3.2 or earlier,
      upgrade to a later version that uses WiredTiger.
  
    - If you need to manually adjust the maximum number of concurrent 
      transactions, you can modify the :parameter:`storageEngineConcurrentReadTransactions` and
      :parameter:`storageEngineConcurrentWriteTransactions` parameters.

.. note:: 

   Take caution when modifying :parameter:`storageEngineConcurrentReadTransactions` 
   and :parameter:`storageEngineConcurrentWriteTransactions`, as changing 
   these settings can lead to performance issues or errors. We recommend
   you consult with MongoDB Support before changing these parameters.

Document Structure Antipatterns 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query plan does not contain any metrics to reveal document structure 
antipatterns, but you can look for antipatterns when debugging slow queries. 
Be careful of the following most common bad query practices that hurt performance: 

- **Unbound arrays:** Arrays in a document that can grow without
  a size limit cause performance problems, because each time you update
  the array, MongoDB must rewrite the array into the document. For more
  information, see :ref:`unbounded-arrays-anti-pattern`.

- **Embedded documents without bounds:** MongoDB supports inserting documents 
  within documents, with up to 128 levels of nesting. Each MongoDB document, 
  including embedded documents, has a size limit of 16MB. An excessive number
  of embedded documents can result in performance problems. 

  To mitigate excessive embedded documents, move embedded documents to separate 
  collections and reference them from the original document. 

Ensure a Top Speed Database 
---------------------------

MongoDB has thousands of metrics that track all aspects of database performance, 
including reading, writing, and querying the database, as well as making 
sure background maintenance tasks like backups don't hinder performance.
The following metrics help indicate problems with your 
database so you can ensure its optimal performance.

Replication Lag 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replication lag occurs when a secondary member of a replica set falls 
behind the primary. To understand the cause of your replication lag, you 
can examine the :term:`oplog`-related metrics. However, the 
following problems are the most common causes of replication lag: 

- A networking issue between the primary and secondary, making nodes unreachable

- A secondary node applying data slower than the primary node

- Insufficient write capacity, in which case you should add more shards

- Slow operations on the primary node, blocking replication

Locking Performance Problems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's internal locking system is used to support simultaneous 
queries while avoiding write conflicts and inconsistent reads.
Performance problems that are the result of locking occur when the 
remaining number of available read or write tickets reaches zero, 
meaning any new read or write requests will be queued until 
a new read or write ticket is available. 

Locking performance problems can indicate suboptimal 
indexes and poor schema design patterns, which can 
both lead to locks being held longer than necessary.

Open Cursors 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the number of open cursors is rising without a corresponding 
growth of traffic, this might be the result of poorly indexed 
queries, or long-running queries due to large result sets.

Overloaded Clusters 
-------------------

When performance tuning, it is important to recognize when your
total traffic, or the throughput of transactions through the system,
is rising beyond the planned capacity of your cluster. By keeping
track of growth in throughput, you can expand your cluster's capacity
efficiently. 

The following metrics can help you track your cluster's throughput.
To find these metrics, run the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command and 
examine the fields specified below. 

Read and Write Operations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Read and Write Operations metrics indicate how much work the  
cluster does. You can find read operations through the 
:serverstatus:`opcounters.query` field and write operations through 
:serverstatus:`opcounters.insert`, :serverstatus:`opcounters.update`,
and :serverstatus:`opcounters.delete`, which count the total number 
of insert, update, and delete operations, respectively. 

The ratio of reads to writes depends on the 
nature of the workloads running on the cluster.

- Monitoring read and write operations over time allows 
  normal ranges and thresholds to be established.

- As trends in read and write operations show growth in 
  throughput, you can gradually increase capacity.

Document Metrics and Query Executor 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Document Metrics and Query Executor indicate if the cluster is 
too busy. Similarly to the Read and Write operations metric, there is 
no right or wrong number for these metrics, but having a good idea 
of what's normal helps you discern whether poor performance 
is coming from large workload size or attributable to other reasons.

To retrieve Document Metrics, access the ``metrics.keysExamined``
and ``metrics.totalExecMicros`` fields. To retrieve Query Executor metrics, 
examine the ``metrics.fromPlanCache`` field. You can find 
all of these fields using the :pipeline:`$queryStats` aggregation stage.

- MongoDB updates document metrics anytime you find a document 
  or insert a document. The more documents that you find,
  insert, update or delete, the busier your cluster is.

  - Poor performance in a cluster that has plenty of capacity 
    usually indicates query problems.

- The query executor tells you how many queries are being processed 
  by using two data points:

  - **Scanned:** The average rate per second over the selected sample period 
    of index items scanned during queries and query-plan evaluation.

  - **Scanned objects:** The average rate per second over the selected
    sample period of documents scanned during queries and query-plan evaluation.

Hardware and Network Metrics 
----------------------------

Hardware and Network metrics can indicate that throughput is 
rising and will exceed the capacity of computing infrastructure. 
These metrics are gathered from the operating system and networking 
infrastructure. To make these metrics useful for diagnostic 
purposes, you must have a sense of what is normal.

- If you are running MongoDB on-premises, you may be able to view 
  hardware and network metrics using :opsmgr:`Ops Manager
  </application>`, depending on your operating system.

- While there are many metrics to track, some important 
  metrics to have a baseline range for are:

  - Disk latency

  - Disk IOPS

  - Number of Connections

Cluster and Key Resources 
-------------------------

A MongoDB cluster uses a variety of resources that the underlying 
computing and networking infrastructure provides.

Number of Client Connections 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Current Number of Client Connections metric, located in the
:serverstatus:`connections.current` field in the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` 
document, can indicate total load on a system. Keeping track of normal ranges 
at various times of the day or week can help you quickly identify spikes in traffic.

A related metric, percentage of connections used, can indicate 
when MongoDB is getting close to running out of available connections.

Storage Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Storage metrics track how MongoDB uses persistent storage. In the WiredTiger 
storage engine, each collection and each index are individual files. When 
you update a document in a collection, MongoDB re-writes the entire document.

- If memory space metrics such as :data:`dbStats.dataSize`, 
  :data:`dbStats.indexSize`, :data:`dbStats.storageSize`, or the number
  of documents in the database show a significant unexpected change while 
  the database traffic stays within ordinary ranges, it can indicate 
  problems such as data deletion or corruption, unexpected data growth, or index changes.

- A sudden drop in :data:`dbStats.dataSize` may indicate a large amount of 
  data deletion. If this drop is unexpected, you should quickly investigate.

Memory Metrics 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Memory metrics show how MongoDB uses the virtual memory 
of the computing infrastructure that is hosting the cluster.
You can find memory metrics in the :serverstatus:`mem` document
in the results of :dbcommand:`serverStatus`.

- An increasing number of page faults or a growing amount of data 
  changed but not yet written to disk can indicate problems 
  related to the amount of memory available to the cluster.

- Cache metrics can help determine if the working set is outgrowing the available cache.

Critical Errors
---------------

MongoDB creates :ref:`asserts <server-status-asserts>` 
mostly through errors that MongoDB captures as part of its logging process.

Monitoring the number of asserts created at various levels of 
severity can provide a first level indication of unexpected problems.
Asserts can be message asserts, the most serious kind, or
warning assets, regular asserts, and user asserts.
