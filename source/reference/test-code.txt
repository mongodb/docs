Test Code
=========

You can make a code block testable in an automated fashion using the
``test`` directive. This directive's body is a YAML document with two
possible keys: ``code`` and ``check``.

The ``code`` script is run immediately before ``check``.

For example:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. test:: js
      check: |
        db.members.insertOne(
           {
              name: "sue",
              age: 19,
              status: "P",
              likes : [ "golf", "racquetball" ]
           }
        )
