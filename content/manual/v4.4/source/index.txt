What is MongoDB?
================

.. introduction::

   MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of application
   development and scaling.

   You can run MongoDB in the following environments:

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Work with your data in MongoDB
------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Store and query your data
      :tabid: store

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Deploy MongoDB

            Create a cluster in the {+atlas+} UI or the Atlas CLI
            quickly and easily. To learn more, see 
            :atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` 
            in the {+atlas+} documentation
            and :atlascli:`Get Started with Atlas </atlas-cli-getting-started>` in the Atlas CLI documentation. 
            
            For self-hosted deployments,
            see :ref:`Replication <replication>` in the MongoDB manual
            to create a replica
            set.
            
         .. step:: Connect to your deployment

            Access deployments in the 
            {+atlas+} UI or connect with :driver:`drivers </>` or the
            :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell (mongosh) </>` in the MongoDB
            manual. 
            
            To learn more, see :ref:`Find Your Connection String <find-connection-string>` in the MongoDB manual.

         .. step:: Insert, query, update, or delete documents

            Perform CRUD operations in the {+atlas+} UI or by using the
            MongoDB Query API - with or without transactions.

            To learn more, see 
            :atlas:`Create, View, Update, and Delete Documents 
            </atlas-ui/documents/>` in the {+atlas+} documentation and
            :ref:`MongoDB CRUD Operations <crud>` in the MongoDB manual.

         .. step:: Model your data

            Design your data schema to support frequent access patterns.
            You can update or enforce your schema at any point.

            To learn more, see :ref:`Data Modeling Introduction 
            <manual-data-modeling-intro>` in the MongoDB manual.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         ➜ atlas setup
         ? Do you want to setup your Atlas database with default settings? (Y/n)
         ➜ Y

         We are deploying Cluster9876543...
         Please store your database authentication access details in a secure location.
         Database User Username: Cluster9876543
         Database User Password: abcdef12345
         Creating your cluster... [Its safe to 'Ctrl + C']

   .. tab:: Transform data with Aggregations
      :tabid: transform

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Import your data

            Import data from a CSV or JSON file with database tools.

            To learn more, see 
            :atlas:`Migrate or Import Data </import>` in the {+atlas+}
            documentation and `mongoimport 
            <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongoimport/>`__ in the database tools documentation.

         .. step:: Aggregate your data

            Use aggregation pipelines to process your data in multiple
            stages and return the computed results. You can  
            preview the results at each pipeline stage when you 
            run aggregation pipelines in {+atlas+}.

            To learn more, see :atlas:`Run Aggregation Pipelines
            </atlas-ui/agg-pipeline>` in the {+atlas+} documentation
            and :ref:`aggregation` in the MongoDB manual.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         test> db.orders.insertMany([
            { "item" : "almonds", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 2 },
            { "item" : "pecans", "price" : 20, "quantity" : 1 },
         ])

         test> db.inventory.insertMany([
            { "sku" : "almonds", "description": "product 1", "instock" : 120 },
            { "sku" : "cashews", "description": "product 3", "instock" : 60 },
            { "sku" : "pecans", "description": "product 4", "instock" : 70 }
         ])

         test> db.orders.aggregate([
            { $match: { price: { $lt: 15 } } },
            { $lookup: {
                  from: "inventory",
                  localField: "item",
                  foreignField: "sku",
                  as: "inventory_docs"
            } },
            { $sort: { price: 1 } },
         ])

   .. tab:: Secure access to your data
      :tabid: create

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a client

            Verify the identity of a user, replica set member, or
            sharded cluster member with authentication.

            To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas UI Authenication 
            </atlas-ui-authentication>` in the {+atlas+} documentation
            and :ref:`Authentication <authentication>` in the MongoDB
            manual.

         .. step:: Control access to your database

            Enable Role-Based Access Controls to manage user privileges
            on your entire database cluster or individual collections.

            To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas UI Authorization 
            </atlas-ui-authorization>` in the {+atlas+} documentation
            and :ref:`Role-Based Access Controls <authorization>`
            in the MongoDB manual.

         .. step:: Encrypt your most sensitive data

            Client-side field level encryption protects data while it is
            in-use by the database. Fields are encrypted before they
            leave your application, protecting them over the network, in
            memory and at rest.

            To learn more, see :doc:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption
            </core/security-client-side-encryption>` in the MongoDB
            manual.

   .. tab:: Deploy and scale your database
      :tabid: deploy

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a deployment

            Create a free cluster, an auto-scaling cluster, or a
            serverless instance in the {+atlas+} UI. To learn
            more, see 
            :atlas:`Choose a Database Deployment Type 
            </create-database-deployment/#std-label-ref-deployment-types>` in the {+atlas+}
            documentation.

            For self-hosted deployments, provide redundancy and
            resilience for your database by deploying a replica set. To
            learn more, see :ref:`Replication <replication>` in the
            MongoDB manual.

         .. step:: Scale out your database

            Use sharding to horizontally scale your database or to
            ensure location-based separation of data.

            To learn more, see :atlas:`Shard a Collection 
            </collections/#shard-a-collection>` in the {+atlas+}
            documentation and :ref:`Sharding <sharding-introduction>`
            in the MongoDB manual.
