Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure a logger in the
{+driver-short+}. The driver allows you to log information categorized
at following severity levels:

- ``emergency``
- ``alert``
- ``critical``
- ``error``
- ``warn``
- ``notice``
- ``info``
- ``debug``
- ``trace``
- ``off``

The preceding list is ordered by decreasing severity level. Specifying a severity
level also logs all messages with higher severity levels. For example, setting
the log level to ``critical`` also results in log messages with severity levels of
``emergency`` and ``alert``.

The lower the severity level you specify, the more information the driver logs,
which might impact the performance of your application.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure logging in the {+driver-short+} without code changes by
specifying environment variables. You can also configure logging
programmatically by specifying client options in the ``MongoClient``
constructor.

.. note::

   Because connection strings are often shared among a deployment of different
   appications that might have different logging support, we do not recommend
   using a connection string to configure logging.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure logging for different components of the driver by specifying
a severity level in one or more of the following environment variables:

- ``MONGODB_LOG_ALL``: Specifies the default severity for any unset components 
- ``MONGODB_LOG_COMMAND``: Logs all commands sent to the server
- ``MONGODB_LOG_TOPOLOGY``: Logs any changes to the cluster topology
- ``MONGODB_LOG_SERVER_SELECTION``: Logs the server selection process
- ``MONGODB_LOG_CONNECTION``: Logs all connection pool events
- ``MONGODB_LOG_CLIENT``: Logs all client events

If you don't specify any of the preceding environment variables, the driver uses
the value of ``MONGODB_LOG_ALL``, which if not specified, is implicitly set to
``off``.

.. tip::

   Logging at the command level is the most performance-heavy logging option
   due to the frequency in which commands are sent to the server. Only
   specify this option if necessary for debugging your application.

The following example sets the log level for all components to ``debug`` except
for ``MONGODB_LOG_COMMAND``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_LOG_ALL="debug"
   export MONGODB_LOG_COMMAND="off"

Log Location
````````````

You can specify whether the driver logs to ``stderr`` or ``stdout`` by setting
the ``MONGODB_LOG_PATH`` environment variable to ``"stderr"`` or ``"stdout"``,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_LOG_PATH="stderr"

By default, the driver logs to ``stderr``.

Document Length
```````````````

The driver stringifies logged documents by using EJSON, which limits strings to
1000 characters by default. You can specify a maximum document length for your
logger by specifying the ``MONGODB_LOG_MAX_DOCUMENT`` environment variable. Set
this variable to ``0`` to not perform truncation.

The following example sets the maximum document length to 500 characters:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_LOG_MAX_DOCUMENT_LENGTH=500

Client Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure logging programmatically by specifying client options in the
``MongoClient`` constructor. Because client options take precedence over environment
variables, only specify them in the client if you no longer want the driver to
respond to environment variables.

.. tip::

   If your application relies on the format of ``stdout`` or ``stderr``, we
   recommend configuring logging by using client options to avoid conflicts with
   your application user's environment variables.

You can specify which component to configure logging for by specifying one or more of the
following client options:

- ``default``: Specifies the default severity for any unset components
- ``command``: Logs all commands sent to the server
- ``topology``: Logs any changes to the cluster topology
- ``serverSelection``: Logs the server selection process
- ``connection``: Logs all connection pool events
- ``client``: Logs all client events

To specify a log level for a component, set the
``mongodbLogComponentSeverities`` option to an object that contains the
component and your desired severity level. The following example sets the log
level for all components to ``debug`` except for ``command``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-logger-client-options
   :end-before: end-logger-client-options

Log Location
````````````
You can specify whether the driver logs to ``stderr`` or ``stdout`` by setting
the ``mongodbLogPath`` option to ``"stderr"`` or ``"stdout"``, as shown in the
following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-log-location
   :end-before: end-log-location
   :emphasize-lines: 5-8

By default, the driver logs to ``stderr``.

You can also specify a custom log destination. The following example creates a
custom log destination:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-custom-logger
   :end-before: end-custom-logger

If your function throws an error in the write operation, the thrown error
ends the logger. Because of this, we recommend that you handle errors by
making the write function a no-op rather than throwing an error, as shown in
the preceding example.

.. note::

   Logging can exhaust disk space if the proper log rotation system is not in
   place. We recommend that you connect your custom write function to a popular
   logging library.

Document Length
```````````````

The driver stringifies logged documents by using EJSON, which limits strings to
1000 characters by default. You can specify a maximum document length for your
logger by specifying the ``mongodbLogMaxDocumentLength`` option. Set
this option to ``0`` to perform no truncation.

The following example sets the maximum document length to 500 characters:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-log-length
   :end-before: end-log-length
   :emphasize-lines: 5, 8
