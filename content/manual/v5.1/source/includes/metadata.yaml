title: "Common Single-Source Includes Overview"
domain: 'mongodb'
introduction: |
  This page provides an overview of all common "includes" files used
  in the production of this site. Use this page when contributing to
  the docs to introspect the common content, and understand the use of
  this content.

  For clarity, this resource does *not* include those files in the
  ``source/includes`` directory that are dynamically generated such as
  tables, sequences, tables of contents, image definitions, or API
  references. Use the :ref:`fabric <build-fabric>` tasks in the
  ``includes`` module to introspect these resources.
