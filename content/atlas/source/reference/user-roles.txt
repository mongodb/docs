|service| user roles define the actions |service| users can perform in
organizations, projects, or both. Organization and project ``Owners``
can manage |service| users and their roles within their respective
organizations and projects.

You can apply these permissions **only** on the :ref:`the 
organization level <org-level-best-practices>` or
:ref:`the project level <project-level-best-practices>`. So,
you should carefully plan the hierarchy of your
organizations and projects. To learn more, see
:ref:`<db-deployment-best-practices>`.

Organization Roles
------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Organization Role (UI)
     - Organization Role (API, CLI)
     - Description

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Owner

     - ``ORG_OWNER``

     - Grants root access to the organization, including:

       - :authrole:`Project Owner` access to all projects in
         the organization, which grants database access, even if 
         added to a project with a non-Owner role.

       - Privileges to administer organization settings.

       - Privileges to add, modify, or delete |service| users and :ref:`database users <mongodb-users>`
         within the organization.

       - Privileges to delete the organization.
       
       - Privileges to add, modify, or delete :ref:`resource tags  
         <configure-resource-tags>`.

       - All the privileges granted by the other organization roles
         combined.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Project Creator

     - ``ORG_GROUP_CREATOR``

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to create projects in the organization.

       - Privileges granted by the :authrole:`Organization Member` role.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Billing Admin

     - ``ORG_BILLING_ADMIN``

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to administer billing information for the organization.

       - Privileges granted by the :authrole:`Organization Member` role.

       - Privileges to create, edit, delete, acknowledge, and 
         unacknowledge billing alerts.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Billing Viewer

     - ``ORG_BILLING_READ_ONLY``

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to view billing information for the organization.

       - Privileges granted by the :authrole:`Organization Member` role.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Read Only

     - ``ORG_READ_ONLY``

     - Provides read-only access to the settings, users, and projects 
       in the organization.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Member

     - ``ORG_MEMBER``

     - Provides read-only access to the settings and users
       in the organization and the projects they belong to.

       Unlike :authrole:`Organization Read Only`,
       an :authrole:`Organization Member` can only access projects 
       they have been explicitly added to.

       For an :authrole:`Organization Member`, within a project, the
       user has the privileges as determined by the user's
       :ref:`project role <project-roles>`. If a user's project role is
       :authrole:`Project Owner`, then the user can
       add a new user to the project, which results in adding the
       newly-added user to the organization as well (if the newly added
       user is not already in the organization).
