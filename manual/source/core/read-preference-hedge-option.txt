You can specify the use of :ref:`hedged reads <mongos-hedged-reads>` for 
non-``primary`` :ref:`read preferences <read-preference>` on sharded 
clusters.

With hedged reads, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can route read
operations to two replica set members per each queried shard and return
results from the first respondent per shard.
