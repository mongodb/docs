   * - matchers
     - array of objects
     - Required
     - Rules to apply when matching an object against this alert
       configuration. Only entities that match *all* these rules are
       checked for an alert condition.

       |service| limits filtering alerts using **matchers** when the
       **eventTypeName** specifies an event for the following:

       - a host,
       - a replica set, or
       - a sharded cluster.

       To add one or more **matchers**, see `Filter Results`_.

   * - notifications
     - array of objects
     - Required
     - One or more targets for |service| to send notifications when an
       alert condition is detected. You can configure any number of
       notifications for each alert condition.

       To add one or more **notifications**, see `Set Notifications`_.
