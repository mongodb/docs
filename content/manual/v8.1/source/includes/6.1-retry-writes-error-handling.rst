Starting in MongoDB 6.1, if both the first and second attempt of a
retryable write fail without a single write being performed, MongoDB
returns an error with the ``NoWritesPerformed`` label.

The ``NoWritesPerformed`` label differentiates the results of batch
operations like :method:`~db.collection.insertMany()`. In an
``insertMany`` operation, one of the following outcomes can occur:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Outcome
     - MongoDB Output

   * - No documents are inserted.
     - Error returned with ``NoWritesPerformed`` label.

   * - Partial work done. (At least one document is inserted, but not
       all.)
     - Error returned without ``NoWritesPerformed`` label.

   * - All documents are inserted.
     - Success returned.

Applications can use the ``NoWritesPerformed`` label to definitively
determine that no documents were inserted. This error reporting lets the
application maintain an accurate state of the database when handling
retryable writes.

In previous versions of MongoDB, an error is returned when both the
first and second attempts of a retryable write fail. However, there is
no distinction made to indicate that no writes were performed.
