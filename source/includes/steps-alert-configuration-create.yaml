     :widths: 35 65
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Notification Method

       - Description

     * - Group

       - Sends the alert by email or SMS to the group. If you select
         :guilabel:`SMS`, |mms| sends the text message to the number
         configured on each user's :ref:`Account page <profile-page>`.

         To send only to specific roles, deselect :guilabel:`All Roles`
         and select the desired roles.

     * - User

       - Sends the alert by email or SMS to a specified |mms| user. If you
         select :guilabel:`SMS`, |mms| sends the text message to the number
         configured on the user's :ref:`Account page <profile-page>`.

     * - Email

       - Sends the alert to a specified email address.

     * - SMS

       - Sends the alert to a specified mobile number. |mms| removes all
         punctuation and letters and uses only the digits.

         If you are outside of the United States or Canada, include '011'
         and the country code. For example, for New Zealand enter '01164'
         before your phone number. As an alternative, use a Google Voice
         number. |mms| uses the U.S.-based `Twilio
         <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send SMS messages.

     * - HipChat

       - Sends the alert to a HipChat room message stream. Enter the HipChat
         room name and API token. To define a default room and API token for
         the group, see :ref:`Group Settings <group-settings-page>`.

     * - PagerDuty

       - Enter only the service key. Define escalation rules and alert
         assignments in `PagerDuty
         <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_.
         To define a default service key for the group, see :ref:`Group
         Settings <group-settings-page>`.

     * - Webhook

       - Sends an HTTP POST request to an endpoint for programmatic processing.
         The request body contains a JSON document that uses the same
         format as the Public API's :doc:`Alerts resource
         </reference/api/alerts>`.

         The ``Webhook`` option is available only if you have configured the :guilabel:`Webhook
         Settings` on the :ref:`Group Settings <group-settings-page>`
         page.

     * - .. only:: onprem

            SNMP

       - .. only:: onprem

            Specify the hostname that will receive the v2c trap on standard
            port ``162``. The MIB file for SNMP is `available for download
            here
            <http://downloads.mongodb.com/on-prem-monitoring/MMS-10GEN-MIB.txt>`_.
