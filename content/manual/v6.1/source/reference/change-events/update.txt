Summary
-------

.. data:: update

   An ``update`` event occurs when an operation updates a document
   in a collection.

   .. note:: Disambiguation

      To learn more about events that occur when collection options are
      modified, see the :data:`modify` event.

Behavior

Path Disambiguation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 6.1

The ``updateDescription`` field notes changes made to specific fields in 
documents by an operation.  These field descriptors use dots (``.``) as
path separators and numbers as array indexes, which leads to some
ambiguity when it contains field names that use dots or numbers.

When an ``update`` event reports changes involving ambiguous fields,
the ``disambiguatedPaths`` document provides the path key with an array 
listing each path component.

.. note::
   
   The ``disambiguatedPaths`` field is only available on change streams
   started with the :ref:`showExpandedEvents 
   <change-streams-expanded-events>` option 

For example, consider a document that lists people and the towns in which they 
live:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "name": "Anthony Trollope",
      "home.town": "Oxford",
      "residences": [
         {"0": "Oxford"},
         {"1": "Sunbury"}
      ]
   }

* When an update modifies the ``home.town`` field from ``Oxford`` to
  ``London``, it produces an update description that looks like this:

  .. code-block:: json
  
     "updateDescription": {
        "updatedFields": {
           "home.town": "London"
        },
        "disambiguatedPaths": {
           "home.town": [ "home.town" ]
        }
     }
  
  Because the field ``home.town`` contains a period, the ``disambiguatedPaths`` 
  field shows an array with one value, to indicate that ``town`` is not a
  sub-field of ``home``.

* When an update modifies a value in the ``residences`` array to make the same 
  change, it produces an update description that looks like this:
  
  .. code-block:: json
  
     "updateDescription": {
        "updatedFields": {
           "residences.0.0": "London"
        },
        "disambiguatedPaths": { "residences.0.0": [ "residences", 0, "0" ] }
     }

  The disambiguated paths include an integer ``0`` to indicate the array index
  and the string ``"0"`` to indicate the field name within the nested document.
  
There are two cases where ``disambiguatedPath`` does **not** include a 
numeric field:

* When the first field in the path is a numeric string (i.e. ``0.name``).
  This is not ambiguous since the first field cannot be an array index.


* When the numeric string field has leading zeroes (i.e., ``0001``).  
  This is not ambiguous since an integer cannot have leading zeroes.


Example
-------

The following example illustrates an ``update`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "update",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "wallTime": <ISODate>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      },
      "documentKey": {
         "_id": ObjectId("58a4eb4a30c75625e00d2820")
      },
      "updateDescription": {
         "updatedFields": {
            "email": "alice@10gen.com"
         },
         "removedFields": ["phoneNumber"],
         "truncatedArrays": [ {
            "field" : "vacation_time",
            "newSize" : 36
         } ]
      }
   }

The following example illustrates an ``update`` event for change streams
opened with the ``fullDocument : updateLookup`` option:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "update",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "wallTime": <ISODate>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      },
      "documentKey": {
         "_id": ObjectId("58a4eb4a30c75625e00d2820")
      },
      "updateDescription": {
         "updatedFields": {
            "email": "alice@10gen.com"
         },
         "removedFields": ["phoneNumber"],
         "truncatedArrays": [ {
            "field" : "vacation_time",
            "newSize" : 36
         } ],
         "disambiguatedPaths": { }
      },
      "fullDocument": {
         "_id": ObjectId("58a4eb4a30c75625e00d2820"),
         "name": "Alice",
         "userName": "alice123",
         "email": "alice@10gen.com",
         "team": "replication"
      }
   }

The ``fullDocument`` document represents the most current majority-committed
version of the updated document. The ``fullDocument`` document may vary from
the document at the time of the update operation depending on the number of
interleaving majority-committed operations that occur between the update
operation and the document lookup.
