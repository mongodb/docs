This tutorial describes how to create indexes to limit the number of
index entries scanned for queries that includes a :query:`$text`
expression and equality conditions.

A collection ``inventory`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, dept: "tech", description: "lime green computer" }
   { _id: 2, dept: "tech", description: "wireless red mouse" }
   { _id: 3, dept: "kitchen", description: "green placemat" }
   { _id: 4, dept: "kitchen", description: "red peeler" }
   { _id: 5, dept: "food", description: "green apple" }
   { _id: 6, dept: "food", description: "red potato" }

Consider the common use case that performs text searches by individual
departments, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { dept: "kitchen", $text: { $search: "green" } } )

To limit the text search to scan only those documents within a specific
``dept``, create a compound index that *first* specifies an
ascending/descending index key on the field ``dept`` and then a
``text`` index key on the field ``description``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.ensureIndex(
      {
        dept: 1,
        description: "text"
      }
   )

Then, the text search [#text-command]_ within a particular department
will limit the scan of indexed documents. For example, the following
query scans only those documents with ``dept`` equal to ``kitchen`` or
``food``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { dept: "kitchen", $text: { $search: "green" } } )

.. [#text-command] If using the deprecated :dbcommand:`text` command, the
   :dbcommand:`text` command **must** include the ``filter`` option
   that specifies an **equality** condition for the prefix fields.
