             You are responsible for the following:
             
             - TLS Certificate Key File issuance and renewal.
             - Checking if the endpoint started correctly in the automation agent logs.

     * - Discovery Method

     * - :prom-docs:`HTTP SD </prometheus/latest/http_sd/>`
       - This method requires Prometheus v2.28 and later. It
         generates the :prom-docs:`scrape_config </prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config>`
         part of your :prom-docs:`configuration file </prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file>`
         to discover targets over an HTTP endpoint.

     * - :prom-docs:`File Service Discovery </guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets>`
       - This method allows Prometheus to read |yaml| or |json|
         documents to configure the targets to scrape from.
