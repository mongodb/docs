msgid "Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes of data into useful *aggregated* results. For map-reduce operations, MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` database command."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:17
msgid "Consider the following map-reduce operation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:21
msgid "In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each input document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the query condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those keys that have multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which collects and condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results in a collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may pass through a *finalize* function to further condense or process the results of the aggregation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:30
msgid "All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run within the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the documents of a single :term:`collection` as the *input* and can perform any arbitrary sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage. :dbcommand:`mapReduce` can return the results of a map-reduce operation as a document, or may write the results to collections. The input and the output collections may be sharded."
msgstr ""

msgid "For most aggregation operations, the :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline` provides better performance and more coherent interface. However, map-reduce operations provide some flexibility that is not presently available in the aggregation pipeline."

msgid "Map-Reduce JavaScript Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:49
msgid "In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom JavaScript functions to *map*, or associate, values to a key. If a key has multiple values mapped to it, the operation *reduces* the values for the key to a single object."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:54
msgid "The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to map-reduce operations. For instance, when processing a document, the map function can create more than one key and value mapping or no mapping. Map-reduce operations can also use a custom JavaScript function to make final modifications to the results at the end of the map and reduce operation, such as perform additional calculations."

msgid "Map-Reduce Behavior"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:64
msgid "In MongoDB, the map-reduce operation can write results to a collection or return the results inline. If you write map-reduce output to a collection, you can perform subsequent map-reduce operations on the same input collection that merge replace, merge, or reduce new results with previous results. See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce` for details and examples."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:72
msgid "When returning the results of a map-reduce operation *inline*, the result documents must be within the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, which is currently 16 megabytes. For additional information on limits and restrictions on map-reduce operations, see the :doc:`/reference/command/mapReduce` reference page."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/map-reduce.txt:78
msgid "MongoDB supports map-reduce operations on :doc:`sharded collections </sharding>`. Map-reduce operations can also output the results to a sharded collection. See :doc:`/core/map-reduce-sharded-collections`."
