MMS Reference
=============

This document contains references of the different types of hosts,
databases, and other statuses that may occur in MMS.

.. _host-types:

Host Types
----------

The possible values for the "Type" column in the Hosts page are:

- primary
- secondary
- standalone
- master
- slave
- unknown
- recovering

The "Host Type" selector on the advanced dashboard creator also
includes:

- conf
- mongos

.. note::

   The host type column may also have the value "no data," which means
   that MMS has not received any data from the agent for this
   host. Possible causes for this state:

   - If the agent can't connect to the server because of networking
     restrictions or issues (i.e. firewalls, proxies, routing.)

   - If your database is running with SSL. You must enable SSL either
     globally or on a per-host basis. See :ref:`ssl` for more
     information.

   - If your database is running with authentication. You must supply
     MMS with the authentication credentials either when you're adding
     a host *or* by clicking on the edit (i.e. "Pencil" button) on the
     right of the entry on the "Hosts" page.

------------------

MMS can monitor the process types:

- ``mongod`` database processes
- ``mongod`` arbiter processes
