|charts| is a tool to create visual representations of
your MongoDB data. Data visualization is a key component to providing a
clear understanding of your data, highlighting correlations between
variables and making it easy to discern patterns and trends within your
dataset. |charts| makes communicating your data a straightforward
process by providing built-in tools to easily share and collaborate on
visualizations.

Features
--------

Aggregation Functionality
  |charts| provides built-in
  :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>` functionality. Aggregation
  allows you to process your collection data by a variety of metrics
  and perform calculations such as mean and standard deviation to
  provide further insight into your data.

Seamless Integration with MongoDB |service|
  |charts-short| provides seamless integration with
  :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>`. You can link |charts| to
  |service| projects and quickly get started visualizing your |service|
  cluster data.

Document Data Handling
  |charts-short| handles document-based data, including
  :ref:`embedded objects and arrays <embedded-objects-arrays>`.
  Utilizing a nested data structure provides the flexibility to
  structure your data as it best fits for your application while still
  retaining powerful visualization capabilities.

Concepts
--------

The following elements of |charts| provide the flow of data from its
source to a visual representation:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Element
     - Description

   * - :doc:`Data Source </data-sources>`
     - A reference to a MongoDB collection which contains the data you
       wish to visualize. Note that deleting a data source has no
       effect on the underlying MongoDB collection. For information on
       connecting to and managing a data source, see
       :doc:`Data Sources <data-sources>`.

   * - :doc:`Chart </build-charts>`
     - A visualization which maps to a *single* data source.

   * - :doc:`Dashboard </dashboards>`
     - A group of one or more charts.

Dashboards are the cornerstone of |charts| as they are where you create
and view your data visualizations. For details on how to create,
manage, and share dashboards, see :doc:`Dashboards <dashboards>`.

.. note::

   Since a chart can only display data from a single collection,
   dashboards which combine multiple charts are not only useful, but
   necessary for visualizing data from multiple collections in a single
   view. This can lead to new insights into your data which may not be
   immediately apparent.

Chart Types
-----------

|charts| provides a wide variety of chart types to visualize your data
including bar charts, scatter plots, geospatial charts, and more.

For a complete list of available chart types, see
:ref:`chart-type-reference`.

Tutorials
---------

After you :ref:`launch MongoDB Charts <launch-charts>`, the following
tutorials will help you get started building visualizations with your
data and explore key features offered by |charts|:

:ref:`Movie Details Tutorial <movie-details-tutorial-overview>`
  Visualize a data set containing details on movies, such as cast,
  critic reviews, and release.

:ref:`Order Data Tutorial <order-data-tutorial-overview>`
  Visualize a data set containing sales data from a mock office supply
  store. The tutorial illustrates how to visualize inventory, customer
  analytics, and total sales.
