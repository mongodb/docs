Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a database command with the
{+driver-short+}. You can use database commands to perform a variety of
administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics,
initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   We recommend using driver methods instead of executing database
   commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()``
   method inside the shell is the preferred method to issue database
   commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell and
   drivers.

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, you must specify the command and any relevant
parameters in a command document, then pass the command document to a
command execution method. The {+driver-short+} provides the following methods
to run database commands:

- ``command()``, which returns the command response as a
  ``Document`` type. You can use this method with any database command.
- ``runCursorCommand()``, which returns the command response as an iterable
  ``RunCommandCursor`` type. You can use this method only if your database command
  returns multiple result documents.

The following code shows how you can use the ``command()``
method to run the ``hello`` command, which returns information about
the current member's role in the replica set, on a database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const result = await myDB.command({ hello: 1 });

For a full list of database commands and corresponding parameters, see
the :ref:`Additional Information section <addl-info-runcommand>`.

.. note:: Read Preference

   ``command()`` and ``runCursorCommand()`` do not obey the read
   preference you may have set on your ``Db`` object elsewhere in
   your code. By default, these methods use the ``primary`` read
   preference.
   
   You can set a read preference for command execution by
   passing an options object to either method. The ``command()`` method
   takes a ``RunCommandOptions`` object, and the ``runCursorCommand()`` method
   takes a ``RunCursorCommandOptions`` object.

   The following code shows how to specify a read preference and pass it
   as an option to the ``command()`` method:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      const commandOptions = { readPreference: "nearest" };
      const result = await myDB.command(commandDoc, commandOptions);
   
   For more information on read preference options, see :manual:`Read
   Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the Server manual.

Response
--------

Each method returns a ``Document`` object or a cursor that contains
the response from the database after the command has been executed. Each
database command performs a different function, so the response content
can vary across commands. However, every response contains documents
with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - <command result>
     - Provides fields specific to the database command. For example,
       ``count`` returns the ``n`` field and ``explain`` returns the
       ``queryPlanner`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Indicates whether the command has succeeded (``1``)
       or failed (``0``).

   * - ``operationTime``
     - Indicates the logical time of the operation. MongoDB uses the
       logical time to order operations.
       
       .. seealso::
  
          To learn more about logical time, see our :website:`blog post about
          the Global Logical Clock </blog/post/transactions-background-part-4-the-global-logical-clock>`.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - Provides a document that returns the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for ordering of operations.

       The document contains the following fields:

       - ``clusterTime``, which is the timestamp of the highest known cluster time for the member.
       - ``signature``, which is a document that contains the hash of the cluster time and the ID
         of the key used to sign the cluster time.

Example
-------

The following code shows how you can use the ``runCursorCommand()`` method to
run the ``checkMetadataConsistency`` command on the ``testDB`` database
and iterate through the results:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/runCommand.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-runcommand
   :end-before: end-runcommand

Output
~~~~~~

The output contains the contents of the cursor object. The documents
describe any metadata inconsistencies in the database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     type: ...,
     description: ...,
     details: {
       namespace: ...,
       info: ...
     }
   }
   {
     type: ...,
     description: ...,
     details: {
       namespace: ...,
       collectionUUID: ...,
       maxKeyObj: ...,
       ...
     }
   }

.. note::

   If you store the command response in a cursor, you see only the
   command result documents when you access the contents of the cursor. You won't
   see the ``ok``, ``operationTime``, and ``$clusterTime`` fields.
