  a. Select your driver and version from the dropdown menus.

  #. The :guilabel:`Connection String Only` tab displays the connection
     string you can use to connect to your |service| cluster.
     The :guilabel:`Full Driver Example` tab displays a code sample for
     your selected driver and version demonstrating a connection to
     your Atlas cluster.

     .. note::

        The connection string displayed in the UI uses a placeholder
        value for the password. Replace that placeholder with your own
        MongoDB password.

     .. important::

        If the password contains reserved URI characters, you must
        escape the characters per :rfc:`RFC 2396 <2396>`.

        .. example::

           If your password is ``@bc123``, you must escape the ``@``
           character when specifying the password in the connection
           string; e.g. ``%40bc123``.

  For details on  driver compatibility with MongoDB, see
  :driver:`Driver Compatibility </driver-compatibility-reference/>`.

  The connection string examples specify the ``test`` database for the
  initial connection. If the user is configured on a different
  database, specify that database in the connection string.
