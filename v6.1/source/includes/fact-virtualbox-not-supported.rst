Oracle offers `experimental support
<https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/admin/hyperv-support.html>`__
for VirtualBox on Windows hosts where Hyper-V is running. However,
Microsoft does not support `VirtualBox on Hyper-V
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v>`__.

Disable Hyper-V if you want to install MongoDB on Windows using VirtualBox.
