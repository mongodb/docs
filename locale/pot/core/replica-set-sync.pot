msgid "In order to maintain up-to-date copies of the shared data set, members of a replica set :term:`sync` or replicate data from other members. MongoDB uses two forms of data synchronization: :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` to populate new members with the full data set, and replication to apply ongoing changes to the entire data set."
