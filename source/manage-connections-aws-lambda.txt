Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following best practices to properly manage connections
between :aws:`AWS Lambda </lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html>`
and |service|:

- Define the client to the MongoDB server outside
  the :aws:`AWS Lambda handler function </lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html>`.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-create-mongoclient-once.rst

  The :ref:`Connection Example <lambda-aws-example>` reuses existing
  database connections to speed up communication with the database and
  keep connection counts to the database at a reasonable level with
  respect to application traffic.

        </java/sync/current/fundamentals/connection/connection-options>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      - If your handler takes a callback as its last argument, set the
        ``callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop`` property on the
        :aws:`AWS Lambda Context </lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-context.html#nodejs-prog-model-context-properties>`
        object to **false**.

        .. code-block:: js

           context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false;

        This allows a Lambda function to return its result to the caller
        without requiring that the MongoDB database connection be closed.
        Setting this property is not applicable for `async handlers
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html>`__.

- Restrict network access to your |service| cluster.
  
  Connect to your |service| cluster over private networking using a
  :doc:`Network Peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` 
  between your |service| cluster and your |aws| Lambda function, or,
  alternatively, a :doc:`private endpoint </security-private-endpoint/>`,
  so that you can allow only private IP addresses from your
  :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list/>`.

  If you don't use private networking, consider connecting to your
  |service| cluster via a `NAT gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html>`__
  with a mapped Elastic IP address. Otherwise, you must
  allow all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to access your service cluster.

  .. warning::

     Adding ``0.0.0.0/0`` to your :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list/>`
     allows cluster access from anywhere in the public internet.
     Ensure that you're using strong credentials for all database
     users when allowing access from anywhere.

.. include:: /includes/functions-max-idle-time.rst

- :doc:`/security/set-up-unified-aws-access` and use |aws| IAM authentication where possible.

  You can connect to your |service| {+clusters+} using |aws| `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__
  instead of hardcoding your credentials in Lambda. Hardcoded credentials are
  viewable by anyone who accesses your AWS Lambda environment, which can pose
  a security risk. With |aws| IAM authentication, |service| accesses |aws| Lambda
  through an `assumed IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html>`__,
  so you don't need credentials in your connection strings.
  
  |service| supports |aws| IAM authentication for {+clusters+} running
  MongoDB version 5.0 or higher. We strongly advise using |aws| IAM
  authentication for Lambda connections if your {+cluster+} meets the
  requirements.

- The amount of memory allocated to a Lambda function defaults to 128 
  MB. You can configure the amount of memory allocated to a Lambda 
  function, between 128 MB and 10,240 MB. Ensure you allocate enough 
  memory. Increase the memory to increase the amount of virtual CPU 
  available and improve MongoDB driver performance. To learn more, see 
  `Memory and computing power <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/computing-power.html>`_.

- Set your :aws:`AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS
  </sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sts-regionalized-endpoints.html>` and
  :aws:`AWS_REGION </sdkref/latest/guide/feature-region.html>` environment
  variables.
