Overview
--------

|service| provides a cloud solution to deploying and maintaining MongoDB
databases. You can build, configure, upgrade, and manage MongoDB deployments
all through the |service| interface. |service| provides and maintains the
dedicated servers on which your databases run.

|service| uses MongoDB 3.2 with the WiredTiger storage engine. |service| does
not support MongoDB Enterprise.

.. admonition:: Question

   Do we need to state somewhere in this manual (probabaly not on this
   page) that you can't bring in existing cluster to |service|. or is
   it self-evident?
