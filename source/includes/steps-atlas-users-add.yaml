     Choose the appropriate role for the user based on the descriptions      below the form.

     .. important::
        Every group must have at least one user with the **Owner**              role. |service| does not let you remove this role from a user           if no other user has it.

     .. note::
        The **Owner** role has access to set :doc:`backup <backup-cluster>` services and update billing information.

     You can optionally enter a JIRA username instead of an email            address.
