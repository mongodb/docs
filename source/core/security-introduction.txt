Maintaining a secure MongoDB deployment requires administrators to
implement controls to ensure that users and applications have
access to only the data that they require. MongoDB provides features that
allow administrators to implement these controls and restrictions for
any MongoDB deployment.

If you are already familiar with security and MongoDB security
practices, consider the :doc:`/administration/security-checklist` for a
collection of recommended actions to protect a MongoDB deployment.

Authentication
--------------

Before gaining access to a system all clients should identify
themselves to MongoDB. This ensures that no client can access the data
stored in MongoDB without being explicitly allowed.

MongoDB includes two mechanism: a password-based challenge and response
protocol and x.509 certificates. Additionally MongoDB includes support
for several external authentication mechanisms to integrate with
existing authentication infrastructure.

When you enable authentication MongoDB, MongoDB will require
authentication for all connections, including all clients and all
other MongoDB instances in a deployment. See
:doc:`/core/authentication` for more information.

Role Based Access Control
-------------------------

Clients should only be able to perform the operations required to
fulfill their approved functions. This is the "principle of least
privilege," and limits the potential risk of a compromised
application.

MongoDB's role-based access control system allows administrators to
control all access and ensure that all granted access applies as
narrowly as possible.

Privileges in MongoDB consist of an *action*, or a set operations
that a user can perform, and a *resource*, or context where
the user can perform that action. Multiple privileges combine to
create a *role*, and users may have one or more role that describes
their access. MongoDB provides several
:doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` and users can
construct specific roles tailored to clients' actual requirements.

See :doc:`/core/authorization` for more information.

Auditing
--------

Auditing provides administrators with the ability to verify that the
implemented security policies are controlling activity in the
system. Retaining audit information ensures that administrators have
enough information to perform forensic investigations and comply with
regulations and polices that require audit data.

See :doc:`/core/auditing` for more information.

Encryption
----------

Transport Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use SSL to encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic. SSL
ensures that MongoDB network traffic is only readable by the intended
client.

See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information.

Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB has a partnership with Gazzang to encrypt and secure sensitive
data within MongoDB. The solution encrypts data in real time, and Gazzang
provides advanced key management that ensures only authorized processes
can access this data. The Gazzang software ensures that the cryptographic
keys remain safe and ensures compliance with standards including HIPAA,
PCI-DSS, and FERPA.

Hardening Deployments and Environments
--------------------------------------

In addition to implementing controls within MongoDB, you should also
place controls around MongoDB to reduce the risk exposure of the
entire MongoDB system. This is a *defense in depth*
strategy.

Hardening MongoDB extends the ideas of least privilege, auditing, and
encryption outside of MongoDB. Reducing risk includes: configuring the
network rules to ensure that only trusted hosts have access to MongoDB, and
that the MongoDB processes only have access to the parts of the
filesystem required for operation.
