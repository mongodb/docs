             For the "global" roles (those whose name starts

             roles are not tied to a project.

      * - roles.orgId
        - string
        - Unique identifier for the organization in which the user has
          the specified role.

          .. cond:: cloud

             .. note::

                The ``users`` resource returns all the roles the user
                has in both |mms| and |service|.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/list-api-user-roles.rst

      * - username
        - string
        - |mms| username of the |mms| user.
