   :description: Modify schema validation rules in MongoDB collections using the `collMod` command to update validation criteria like field requirements and lengths.

After you add schema validation to a collection, you can modify
validation rules at any time. For example, you may decide:

- That documents in a ``users`` collection no longer require an email
  address.

- To increase the minimum length for a ``password`` field from 8
  characters to 12.

To modify a collection's schema validation, use the :dbcommand:`collMod`
command and specify the updated validation in the ``validator`` object.

About This Task
---------------

You can modify all components of a schema validation, including its
rules, validation level, and validation action.

If you update a collection's validation rules, documents inserted prior
to the validation change may no longer be valid. How MongoDB handles
these invalid documents depends on your ``validationLevel``. By default,
MongoDB applies validation checks to all documents, regardless of when
they were inserted.

Steps
-----

The following procedure creates a collection with validation rules and
then modifies those rules.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a collection with validation.

      Create a ``users`` collection with validation rules:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.createCollection("users", {
            validator: {
               $jsonSchema: {
                  bsonType: "object",
                  required: [ "username", "password" ],
                  properties: {
                     username: {
                        bsonType: "string",
                        description: "must be a string and is required"
                     },
                     password: {
                        bsonType: "string",
                        minLength: 8,
                        description: "must be a string at least 8 characters long, and is required"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         } )

   .. step:: Modify the validation schema.

      Run the following :dbcommand:`collMod` command to change the
      ``minLength`` of the ``password`` field from 8 to 12:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         
         db.runCommand( { collMod: "users",
            validator: {
               $jsonSchema: {
                  bsonType: "object",
                  required: [ "username", "password" ],
                  properties: {
                     username: {
                        bsonType: "string",
                        description: "must be a string and is required"
                     },
                     password: {
                        bsonType: "string",
                        minLength: 12,
                        description: "must be a string of at least 12 characters, and is required"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         } )

.. tip::

   You can also use the ``collMod`` command to add validation to an existing
   collection that was not created with validation.

Results
-------

The following sections show the results of the updated validation in
these scenarios:

- When you insert an invalid document.

- When you insert a valid document.

- When a previously valid document becomes invalid because of the
  validation rule changes.

Insert an Invalid Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation attempts to insert an invalid document. The
document is invalid because the ``password`` field is 10 characters
long when the minimum length is 12:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertOne(
      {
         "username": "salesAdmin01",
         "password": "kT9$j4wg#M"
      }
   )

MongoDB returns the following error:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   MongoServerError: Document failed validation
   Additional information: {
     failingDocumentId: ObjectId("62be0adb73c105dde9231299"),
     details: {
       operatorName: '$jsonSchema',
       schemaRulesNotSatisfied: [
         {
           operatorName: 'properties',
           propertiesNotSatisfied: [
             {
               propertyName: 'password',
               description: 'must be a string of at least 8 characters, and is required',
               details: [
                 {
                   operatorName: 'minLength',
                   specifiedAs: { minLength: 12 },
                   reason: 'specified string length was not satisfied',
                   consideredValue: 'kT9$j4wg#M'
                 }
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }

Insert a Valid Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation inserts a valid document, where the ``password``
field is at least 12 characters long:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertOne(
      {
         "username": "salesAdmin01",
         "password": "8p&SQd7T90$KKx"
      }
   )

Handle a Previously Valid Document That Is No Longer Valid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following document that is valid for the first version of
the schema validation, but not the second:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertOne(
      {
         "username": "salesAdmin02",
         "password": "i8U60*VyL8"
      }
   )

The document's ``password`` field is 10 characters. The first version of
the schema validation required a minimum of 8 characters, meaning this
document was valid. However, after updating the validation to require
the ``password`` to be a minimum of 12 characters, the document is no
longer valid.

When a change in schema validation causes previously valid documents to
become invalid, the newly invalid documents remain in the collection.

The way MongoDB handles newly invalid documents depends on the schema's
``validationLevel``. The schema validation in this example uses the
default ``validationLevel`` of ``strict``, meaning the document must
match the new validation rules. MongoDB checks the validation each time
the document is updated.

If the updated schema validation had a ``validationLevel`` of
``moderate``, this document would not need to match the new validation
rules.
