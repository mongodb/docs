Java Driver Concurrency
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Java MongoDB driver is thread safe. If you are using in a web
serving environment, for example, you should create a single ``MongoClient``
instance, and you can use it in every request. The ``MongoClient`` object
maintains an internal pool of connections to the database (default pool
size of 10). For every request to the DB (``find``, ``insert``, etc) the Java
thread will obtain a connection from the pool, execute the operation,
and release the connection. This means the connection (socket) used may
be different each time.

Additionally in the case of a replica set with ``slaveOk`` option
turned on, the read operations will be distributed evenly across all
slaves. This means that within the same thread, a write followed by a
read may be sent to different servers (master then slave). In turn the
read operation may not see the data just written since replication is
asynchronous. If you want to ensure complete consistency in a "session"
(maybe an http request), you would want the driver to use the same
socket, which you can achieve by using a "consistent request". Call
``requestStart()`` before your operations and ``requestDone()`` to
release the connection back to the pool:

.. code-block:: java

   DB db...;
   db.requestStart();
   try {
      db.requestEnsureConnection();

      code....
   } finally {
      db.requestDone();
   }

``DB`` and ``DBCollection`` are completely thread safe. In fact, they are
cached so you get the same instance no matter what.

WriteConcern Option for Single Write Operation
----------------------------------------------

Since by default a connection is given back to the pool after each
request, you may wonder how calling ``getLastError()`` works after a
write. You should actually use a write concern like
``WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`` instead of calling ``getLastError()`` manually.
The driver will then call ``getLastError()`` before putting the
connection back in the pool.

.. code-block:: java

   DBCollection coll...;
   coll.insert(..., WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED);

   // is equivalent to
   
   DB db...;
   DBCollection coll...;
   db.requestStart();
   try {
      coll.insert(...);
      DBObject err = db.getLastError();
   } finally {
      db.requestDone();
   }
