  Begin the configuration process by choosing your
  {+database-deployment+} type. You can deploy a
  {+serverless-instance+} from this page. You can also deploy a {+shared-cluster+} or a
  {+dedicated-cluster+}. Each panel leads to a configuration page where you
  can customize your {+database-deployment+} to your specifications.
 
  {+Serverless-Instances+}
    {+Serverless-instances+} require minimal configuration and are best for
    applications that aren't critical and experience low or variable traffic. To learn
    more about {+serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Choose a
    {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.
 
  {+Shared-Clusters+}
    {+Shared-clusters+} include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
    These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
    learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
    You can begin your project with a{+shared-cluster+} and upgrade to a
    production-ready tier at a future time.

  {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
    Dedicated clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
    ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
    and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
    datasets and high-traffic applications. Dedicated clusters can be
    deployed into a single geographical region or multiple geographical regions.

  Select :guilabel:`Serverless` and click :guilabel:`Create` to customize
  the {+serverless-instance+} configuration prior to deployment. 
  
  If you decide to create a {+shared-cluster+} or a {+dedicated-cluster+} instead, see
  :doc:`Create a New Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` for next steps.
