You can pause and resume archiving from the |service| UI and |api|. When you 
pause, previously archived documents continue to be available on the cloud 
object storage, but archiving activity for the collection on your |service| 
cluster is stopped until you resume archiving. You will continue to incur costs 
for storage on the cloud object storage and for reading data. When you resume 
archiving, data that meets the criteria for archiving is archived. 

You can pause an online archive and create another online archive for the same 
namespace and partition fields as the paused online archive, but only one 
online archive can be ``Active``. So, if you try to resume a paused online 
archive when another online archive for the same namespace is ``Active``, the 
resume operation will fail. You must either delete or pause the ``Active`` 
online archive to resume archiving for the paused online archive.

Pausing and Resuming Through the API
------------------------------------

To pause an active online archive and/or to resume a paused online archive 
through the |api|, send a ``PATCH`` request to the :ref:`onlineArchives 
<api-online-archive>` endpoint with the unique ID of the online 
archive to pause or resume. To learn more about the |api| syntax and options, 
see :ref:`api-online-archive-update-one`.
