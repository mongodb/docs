.. expression:: $divide

   Divides one number by another and returns the result. Pass the
   arguments to :expression:`$divide` in an array.

   The :expression:`$divide` expression has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $divide: [ <expression1>, <expression2> ] }

   The first argument is the dividend, and the second argument is the
   divisor; i.e. the first argument is divided by the second argument.

   The arguments can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as they resolve to numbers. For
   more information on expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

Examples
--------

Consider a ``planning`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "A", "hours" : 80, "resources" : 7 },
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "B", "hours" : 40, "resources" : 4 }

The following aggregation uses the :expression:`$divide` expression to
divide the ``hours`` field by a literal ``8`` to compute the number of
work days:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.planning.aggregate(
      [
        { $project: { name: 1, workdays: { $divide: [ "$hours", 8 ] } } }
      ]
   )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "A", "workdays" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "B", "workdays" : 5 }
