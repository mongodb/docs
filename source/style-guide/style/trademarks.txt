Using MongoDB trademarks correctly protects MongoDB brands and
intellectual property, and promotes our reputation. Using third-party
trademarks correctly protects MongoDB from legal action.

MongoDB Legal has created comprehensive guidelines for using trademarks
at MongoDB. To get a comprehensive view of trademarks, read the
:website:`MongoDB Trademark Standards for Use </legal/trademark-usage-guidelines>`.
If you're interested in only what you need to know to comply with
guidelines in your documentation, review the guidelines in this topic.

.. note::

   Show the trademark (™) or registered trademark (®) symbol for the
   first occurrence of the word in a document.

Examples of MongoDB Trademarks
------------------------------

Following are examples of MongoDB trademarks:

-  MongoDB (when used in connection with service names), such as
   MongoDB Ops Manager or MongoDB Atlas

For a complete list, see the :website:`MongoDB Trademark Standards for Use </legal/trademark-usage-guidelines>`.

Examples of Third-Party Trademarks
----------------------------------

The following table shows examples of third-party trademarks that are
often used in our content.

.. note::

   To see if there is a trademark or registered trademark for a new
   company or software name that you use in your content, it's always a
   good idea to do research on the Internet and make sure that you are
   following any specified trademark guidelines. You can also use the
   `United States Patent and Trademark Office site
   <https://www.uspto.gov/trademark>`_ and search by using their

Trademark Usage Guidelines
--------------------------

Use the following guidelines when showing MongoDB and third-party
trademarks in documentation.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 30 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example - Use
     - Example - Don't use

   * - Show a trademark exactly as it's shown by the owning company
       (MongoDB or third-party). Don't change the capitalization or
       abbreviate the trademark.

       Abbreviations are acceptable only if they're used by the owning
       company and also trademarked.
     - This article describes the process of backing up a Microsoft®
       SQL Server® 2008 database. These actions need to be completed by
       the administrator user or by a user who is part of the SQL
       Server administration user group.
     - This article describes the process of backing up an MS SQL
       Server 2008 database. These actions need to be completed by the
       Administrator user or by a user that's part of the MS SQL Admin
       user group.

   * - Use trademarks as adjectives on first use in the text of an
       article or chapter, and as often as possible after that.

       After first use, you can use the trademark as an noun if it's
       clear that you're referring to that trademark.

       Don't use a trademark as a verb.
     - Each cloud server has a single private IP address. When you use
       the RackConnect® solution, if you need direct access to the
       cloud server from the Internet, you can use the public IP
       assigned to the server in RackConnect.
     - Each cloud server has a single private IP address. When you use
       the RackConnect, if you need direct access to the cloud server
       from the Internet, you can use the public IP assigned to the
       RackConnected cloud server.

   * - Don't combine a trademark with any other term, including another
       trademark. For example, don't attach a trademark to another term
       by using a hyphen or slash.
     - On Linux®, macOS® X, and other operating systems based on
       UNIX®, you usually use the ssh command to connect to a server
       via SSH.
     - On Linux®, macOS® X, and other UNIX®-based operating systems.
       you usually use the ssh command to connect to a server via SSH.

   * - Don't use a trademark as a possessive or as a plural. If
       necessary, form a possessive or plural from the noun that
       follows the trademark (which is used as an adjective).
     - The packaged version of NGINX® from Ubuntu® uses a
       sites-available and sites-enabled layout in the same manner as
       an Apache® installation based on Debian®.
     - Ubuntu®'s packaged version of NGINX uses a sites-available and
       sites-enabled layout in the same manner as a Debian®-based
       Apache® installation.

   * - Always distinguish a third-party trademark from a MongoDB
       product name or trademark. Generally you can do this through
       ensuring that words intervene between the trademarks.

       Show trademarks of different companies together only if a
       license or agreement exists between the two companies. In such
       cases, use italics to distinguish one trademark from the other.
       You can generally do this just on first use of the two terms
       together in the document or article.
