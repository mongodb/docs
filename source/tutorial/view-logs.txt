Overview
--------

|mms| collects log information for both MongoDB and the |mms| agents. For
MongoDB deployments, |mms| provides access to both real-time logs and on-disk
logs.

The MongoDB logs provide the diagnostic logging information for your
:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod>` and 
:manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos>` instances.
The Agent logs provide insight
into the behavior of your |mms| agents.

MongoDB Real-Time Logs
----------------------

The Monitoring Agent collects real-time log information from each MongoDB
deployment by issuing the :manual:`getLog </reference/command/getLog>` command
with every monitoring ping. The :manual:`getLog </reference/command/getLog>`
command collects log entries from the MongoDB RAM cache.

|mms| enables real-time log collection by default. You can disable log
collection for either the whole |mms| project or for individual MongoDB instances. If
you disable log collection, |mms| continues to display previously collected log
entries.

MongoDB On-Disk Logs
--------------------

|mms| can collect on-disk logs even if the MongoDB instance is not running.
The Automation Agent collects the logs from the location specified by the
MongoDB ``systemLog.path`` :manual:`configuration option
</reference/configuration-options>`. The MongoDB on-disk logs are a subset
of the real-time logs and therefore less verbose.

You can configure log rotation for the on-disk logs. |mms| enables log
rotation by default.
