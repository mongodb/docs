Use the :query:`$text` query operator to perform text searches on a
collection with a :ref:`text index <index-feature-text>`.

:query:`$text` will tokenize the search string using whitespace and most
punctuation as delimiters, and perform a logical ``OR`` of all such
tokens in the search string.

For example, you could use the following query to find all stores
containing any terms from the list "coffee", "shop", and "java":

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.find( { $text: { $search: "java coffee shop" } } )
