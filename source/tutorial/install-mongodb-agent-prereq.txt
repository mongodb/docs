This section describes the requirements for the hosts that run the 
:doc:`MongoDB Agent </tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent>`.

Hosts that run {+mdbagent+}s must run on a 64-bit version of one of
the following hardware architectures and operating systems. The 
following table lists the MongoDB Server versions that you can deploy 
with the {+mdbagent+} on the associated platforms:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/v8-agent-platform-support-table.rst 

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Use 64-bit Chip Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+mdbagent+} must run on 64-bit architectures.

Provide Sufficient CPU and RAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB recommends a minimum of 2 CPU cores and 2 GB of RAM for
{+mdbagent+} hosts.

If you :ref:`activate backup <activate-backup>`, all {+mdbagent+}
hosts require *at least* an additional 2 CPU cores and 3 GB of RAM 
beyond basic platform requirements. Each backup job that the 
{+mdbagent+} runs further impacts host performance.

Set Host Network Access
-----------------------

The hosts that serve the MongoDB deployments must:

- Have full network access to each other through their Fully
  Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). Each host must reach each other host
  through the |fqdn|.

- Permit Automation to start |mongod| on a random ephemeral port and
  connect to that port when restoring your deployment from a backup.

.. tabs-platforms::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: windows

      - Find the |fqdn| for each host. Run the following command in
        Powershell:

        .. code-block:: powershell

           net config workstation | findstr /C:"Full Computer name"

      - Download and install the
        `Windows BIND <http://www.isc.org/downloads/>`__ tools.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: debian

      - Find the |fqdn| for each host. Run the following command in
        the shell:

        .. code-block:: sh

           hostname -f

   .. tab::
      :tabid: rhel

      - Find the |fqdn| for each host. Run the following command in
        the shell:

        .. code-block:: sh

           hostname -f

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      - Find the |fqdn| for each host. Run the following command in
        the shell:

        .. code-block:: sh

           hostname -f

- Resolve each |fqdn| to a unique IP address. Run the following
  command in the shell to resolve the |fqdn|:

  .. code-block:: shell

     dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

- Set the Common Name or :rfc:`Subject Alternative Name <3280>` value
  of any |ssl| certificates to the MongoDB host's |fqdn|.

The network configuration must allow each {+mdbagent+} to
make a direct connection to each MongoDB deployment listed on the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page. |mms| does not support port forwarding.

      Disable Windows Firewall Stealth Mode
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      For best performance,
      `Disable Windows Firewall stealth mode <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2586744/disable-stealth-mode>`__
      on the MongoDB hosts on which you installed the {+mdbagent+}.

Set Host Permissions
--------------------

On a Host that Already Runs MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you install the {+mdbagent+} on a host that is running a MongoDB
process, the agent must have:

- Permission to stop any MongoDB processes. The {+mdbagent+} restarts the
  process using the Agent's own set of MongoDB binaries. If you installed
  MongoDB with a package manager, use the same package manager to install
  the {+mdbagent+}. This gives the {+mdbagent+} the same owner as MongoDB.

- ``Read`` and ``Write`` permissions on the MongoDB data directory and
  log directory.

On a Host Before Installing MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy the {+mdbagent+} to a host that doesn't have MongoDB
installed, ensure the user that owns the {+mdbagent+} has ``Read`` and
``Write`` permissions on the MongoDB data and log directories you plan
to use.

Root Access
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-platforms::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: debian

      To install the {+mdbagent+} using a ``deb`` package, log in as
      ``root`` or a user with ``sudo`` privileges.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: rhel

      To install the {+mdbagent+} using a ``.rpm`` package, log in as
      ``root`` or a user with ``sudo`` privileges.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      To install the {+mdbagent+} using a ``.tar`` package, log in as
      ``root`` or a user with ``sudo`` privileges.
