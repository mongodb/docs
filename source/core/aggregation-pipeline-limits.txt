Aggregation operations with the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command have the
following limitations.

Result Size Restrictions
------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

Starting in MongoDB 2.6, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return
a cursor or store the results in a collection. When returning a cursor
or storing the results in a collection, each document in the result set
is subject to the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, currently 16
megabytes; if any single document that exceeds the :limit:`BSON
Document Size` limit, the command will produce an error. The limit only
applies to the returned documents; during the pipeline processing, the
documents may exceed this size. The :program:`db.collection.aggregate()`
method returns a cursor by default starting in MongoDB 2.6

If you do not specify the cursor option or store the results in a
collection, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command returns a single BSON
document that contains a field with the result set. As such, the
command will produce an error if the total size of the result set
exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit.

Earlier versions of the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can only return
a single BSON document that contains the result set and will produce an
error if the total size of the result set exceeds the
:limit:`BSON Document Size` limit.
