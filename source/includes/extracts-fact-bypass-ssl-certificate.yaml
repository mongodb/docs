   By default, the :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` setting
   is ``true``, and a valid trusted certificate is required to connect to
   MongoDB instances using SSL. 

   When the Monitoring Agent is managed by
   the Automation Agent, this setting cannot be set to ``false``.  However,
   you can set ``sslRequireValidServerCertificates`` to ``false``
   if you install and configure the Monitoring Agent manually. When
   :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` is ``false``, you do
   not need to set the ``sslTrustedServerCertificates``
   setting because |mms| will not verify the certificates.

   .. warning::

      Setting :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` to ``false`` 
      makes connections between the Monitoring Agent and MongoDB databases
      susceptible to `man-in-the-middle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>`_
      attacks. Setting ``sslRequireValidServerCertificates`` to ``false``
      is recommended only for testing and not for production.
