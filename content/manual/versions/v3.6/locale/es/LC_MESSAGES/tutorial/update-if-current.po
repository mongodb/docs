"The pattern queries for the document to update. Then, for each field to "
"modify, the pattern includes the field and its value in the returned "
"document in the query predicate for the update operation. This way, the "
"update only modifies the document fields *if* the fields have not changed"
" since the query."

"Another approach is to add a ``version`` field to the documents. "
"Applications increment this field upon each update operation to the "
"documents. You must be able to ensure that *all* clients that connect to "
"your database include the ``version`` field in the query predicate. To "
"associate increasing numbers with documents in a collection, you can use "
"one of the methods described in :doc:`/tutorial/create-an-auto-"
