.. method:: sh.updateZoneKeyRange(namespace, minimum, maximum, zone)

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Associates a range of shard key values with a :term:`zone`.
   :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` takes the following arguments:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``namespace``
   
        - string
   
        - The :term:`namespace` of the sharded collection associate with the ``zone``.
          
          The collection must be sharded for the operation to succeed.
          
          
   
      * - ``minimum``
   
        - document
   
        - The inclusive lower bound of the range of :term:`shard key` values. 
          
          Specify each field of the shard key in the form of ``<fieldname> : <value>``.
          The value must be of the same BSON type or types as the shard key.
          
          
   
      * - ``maximum``
   
        - document
   
        - The exclusive upper bound of the range of :term:`shard key` values. 
          
          Specify each field of the shard key in the form of ``<fieldname> : <value>``.
          The value must be of the same BSON type or types as the shard key.
          
          
   
      * - ``zone``
   
        - string
   
        - The name of the zone to associate with the range of shard key values bounded
          by ``minimum`` and ``maximum``.
          
          
   


   Only issue :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` when connected to a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Behavior
--------

You cannot create a range of shard key values whose lower and upper boundaries
overlap with an existing range for the sharded collection. For example, given
an existing range of ``1`` to ``10``, you cannot create a new range of ``5``
to ``20``, as the new range would overlap with the existing range.

A zone can have multiple ranges of data associated with it, but a range
can at most be associated with a single zone.

See the :ref:`zone <zone-sharding>` manual page for more information on zones
in sharded clusters.

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

After associating a range to a zone, the :ref:`balancer
<sharding-balancing-internals>` must first run in order to migrate any chunks
whose ranges are covered by the zone to shards inside of that zone. Until
balancing completes, some chunks may reside on the wrong shard given the
configured zones for the sharded cluster. See :ref:`zone-sharding-balancer`
for more information.

See the :ref:`sharded cluster balancer <sharding-balancing>` manual page for
more information on how migrations work in a sharded cluster.

Dropped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add a zone range to a collection using :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` and
then later drop the collection or its database, MongoDB does not remove the
zone association. If you later create a new collection with the same name, the
old zone association applies to the new collection.

Security
~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authentication <authentication>`, you
must authenticate as either:

- a user whose privileges include the specified actions on various
  collections in the ``config`` database:

  - :authaction:`find` on the ``config.shards`` collection

  - :authaction:`find` and :authaction:`update` on the ``config.tags``
    collection;

  or, alternatively,

- a user whose privileges include :authaction:`enableSharding` on the
  :ref:`cluster <resource-specific-collection>` resource (available
  starting in version 3.6.16).

The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` or :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in roles have
the appropriate permissions for issuing :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`. See
the documentation page for :ref:`Role-Based Access Control <authorization>`
for more information.

Example
-------

Given a sharded collection ``exampledb.collection`` with a shard key of ``{ a
: 1 }``, the following operation creates a range with a lower bound of ``1``
and an upper bound of ``10`` on the ``alpha`` zone:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1 },
      { a : 10 },
      "alpha"
   )

The following operation removes the previously created range by passing
``null`` to the ``zone`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange( 
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1 },
      { a : 10 },
      null
   )

The ``min`` and ``max`` must match exactly the bounds of the target range.
The following operation attempts to remove the previously created range, but
specifies ``{ a : 0 }`` as the ``min`` bound:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 0 },
      { a : 10 },
      null
   )

While the range of ``{ a : 0 }`` and ``{ a : 10 }`` encompasses the existing
range, it is not an exact match and therefore :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange`
does not remove anything.

Compound Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a sharded collection ``exampledb.collection`` with a shard key of ``{ a
: 1, b : 1 }``, the following operation creates a range covering the lower
bound of ``{ a: 1, b : 1 }`` and an upper bound of ``{ a : 10, b : 10}`` and associates it
with the ``alpha`` zone:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
      "exampledb.collection",
      { a : 1, b : 1 },
      { a : 10, b : 10 },
      "alpha"
   )
