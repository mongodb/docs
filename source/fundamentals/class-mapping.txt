Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to customize the way the {+driver-long+}
maps BSON documents to and from {+language+} classes. You should read this page
to learn more about the default class mapping behavior, or if you need to
customize the way the driver serializes or deserializes your data.

Automatic Class Mapping
-----------------------

When you use a class, rather than a ``BsonDocument``, to represent data in a 
MongoDB collection, the {+driver-short+} automatically creates a **class map**
that it uses to serialize or deserialize your data. It does this mapping by matching 
the name of the field in the document to the name of the property in the class.

.. important::

   The type of the property in your class should match the type of the field in
   the document. The {+driver-short+} instantiates a serializer based on the
   type of the property in your class. If the types don't match when the driver
   attempts to serialize the data, the serializer will throw an exception.

Manually Creating A Class Map
-----------------------------

You can bypass the drivers automatic class mapping, and manually define the
class map by using the ``RegisterClassMap()`` method.

The following example defines a ``Person`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
   }

The following code demonstrates how to register the class map for the ``Person``
class: 

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap => 
   {
       classmap.MapMember(p => p.Name);
       classmap.MapMember(p => p.Age);
       classmap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies);
   });

.. important::

   You must register a class map *before* it's needed in your code. We recommend
   registering class maps prior to initializing a connection with MongoDB.

You can also manually map a subset of class properties, while still
allowing the driver to automatically map the remaining properties. To do this, 
register a class map and call the ``AutoMap()`` method before manually 
specifying your properties.

The following example uses the ``AutoMap()`` method to automatically map the properties
of the ``Person`` class. It then manually maps the ``Hobbies`` property.

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap => 
   {
       classmap.AutoMap();
       classmap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies);
   });

Customize Class Serialization
-----------------------------

You can customize how the driver serializes and deserializes documents at the class
level by using attributes with the class, or by calling methods while registering
a class map.

Ignore Extra Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a BSON document is deserialized to a {+language+} class, the {+driver-short+}
looks at the name of each field in the document and tries to find a matching property
name in the class. By default, if a field in the document doesn't have a match in the class,
the driver throws an exception. However, you can choose to ignore any elements that do 
not have a matching class property by using the ``BsonIgnoreExtraElements`` attribute.
This prevents the driver from throwing an exception, and maps any other fields
that have matching class properties.

The following example shows how to add a ``BsonIgnoreExtraElements`` attribute
to a class.

.. code-block:: csharp

   [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]
   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
   }

You can also ignore any extra elements when registering a class map:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap => 
   {
        classmap.AutoMap();
        classmap.SetIgnoreExtraElements(true);
   });

Using Class Discriminators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify **discriminators** to help identify **polymorphic** classes that
are serialized to the same collection. Polymorphic classes are classes that
inherit properties and methods from a parent class. A discriminator is an
element that's added to a document to identify which class the document was
serialized from.

You can specify a discriminator using the ``BsonDiscriminator`` attribute as
follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

   [BsonDiscriminator("personClass")]
   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
   }

You can also specify a discriminator when registering a class map as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap => 
   {
       classmap.AutoMap();
       classmap.SetDiscriminator("personClass");
   });

.. note:: 

   The driver stores your discriminator in BSON with the field name ``_t``.

A document from the ``Person`` class with the "personClass" discriminator is
stored in the collection as follows:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": "...", "_t": "personClass", "name": "...", "age": "...", "hobbies": [...]}

.. TODO: Link to page on polymorphism/discriminators

Mapping with Constructors
-------------------------

By default the {+driver-short+} requires a class to have a constructor with no 
arguments in order to automatically create a class map. However, you can
instruct the driver to automatically map the class using a constructor that takes one
or more arguments.

The following example uses attributes to instruct the driver to create
a class map with a constructor that accepts multiple arguments.

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       [BsonConstructor]
       public Person(string name, string age)
       {
           Name = name;
           Age = age;
       }
   }

.. tip:: Multiple ``BsonConstructor`` attributes

   If there are more than one constructors with the ``BsonConstructor``
   attribute, the driver uses the constructor that has the most
   parameters with matching fields in the document.

You can also specify the constructor to use when registering your class map:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 17

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       public Person(string name, string age)
       {
           Name = name;
           Age = age;
       }
   }

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap =>
   {
       classmap.AutoMap();
       classmap.MapCreator(p => new Person(p.Name, p.Age));
   });

Customize Property Serialization
--------------------------------

You can customize how the driver serializes specific properties in a class by
using attributes on the property. For more information on ways to customize
properties in your {+language+} class, see :ref:`csharp-custom-serialization`.

Support Extra Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can design your {+language+} class to store any extra elements in your
document that don't have matching class properties. To do this your class must
have a ``BsonDocument`` type property to hold the extra elements.

The following code uses the ``BsonExtraElements`` attribute with the
``ExtraElements`` property to direct the driver to store extra elements:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; 
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
       [BsonExtraElements]
       public BsonDocument ExtraElements {get; set;}
   }

You can also support extra elements when initializing a class map as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classmap => 
   {
       classmap.AutoMap();
       classmap.MapExtraElementsMember(p => p.ExtraElements);
   });

.. note::

   After the driver serializes a class with extra elements back to BSON, the 
   extra elements may not be in the same order as they were in the original 
   document.

Dynamically Serialize Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a method to determine whether or not to serialize a property. For
the driver to automatically use the method when serializing, the method must be
named ``ShouldSerialize<property name>``. When the driver sees a method with
this naming convention, it will use the method to determine whether or not to
serialize properties of the provided property name.

The following example creates a method that only serializes the ``Age`` property
if its value is greater than ``0``. The driver ignores any properties whose
values don't meet this requirement:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       public bool ShouldSerializeAge()
       {
          return Age > 0;
       }
   }

You can also specify the method while registering a class map:

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Employee>(classmap => 
   {
       classmap.AutoMap();
       classmap.MapMember(p => c.Age).SetShouldSerializeMethod(
           obj => ((Person) obj).Age > 0
       );
   });
