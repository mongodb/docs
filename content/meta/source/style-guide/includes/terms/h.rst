.. glossary::

   high availability
     **high-availability**
     Use the spelled out term on first use in an article or document,
     and introduce the abbreviation in parentheses. Hyphenate the
     spelled-out term when it's used as a modifier.

   higher
     **lower**
     :icon-fa4:`exclamation-triangle` Don't use these terms when
     referring to product releases and version numbers. Use
     :term:`earlier` or :term:`later` instead.

   host
     Use *host* instead of :term:`computer` :term:`machine` or
     :term:`box` for any type of system that run software for users'
     computers to access. The system running the software could be a
     physical server, a virtual server, a Docker container, or part of
     a Kubernetes cluster. That uncertainty requires this broader term.
