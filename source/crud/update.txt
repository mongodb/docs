Update Data in MongoDB
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Overview
--------

In this guide, you will update a field in a document.

.. time:: 15

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

- Data inserted from :doc:`Insert Data into MongoDB </crud/insert>`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. tip::

         In this code block, there is a comment to replace the connection URI
         with your own. Replace the URI string with your own
         :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_update_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to query. In
      this case you will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection. 

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_comets.rst

   .. step:: Update all documents in the ``comets`` collection.

      In :doc:`the previous guide </crud/insert>`, you inserted
      documents into the ``comets`` collection. Only the ``radius``
      field is in the metric system, while the other numeric fields
      are in the imperial system.

      The following example illustrates using an update document to convert
      the ``radius`` field from the metric system to the imperial system
      in all documents.

      .. include:: /includes/update_documents.rst

   .. step:: Display your results.

      The ``result`` contains some information about the update
      operation. To verify that you updated documents, print the amount
      of documents the driver updated.

      .. include:: /includes/update_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_update_query.rst
