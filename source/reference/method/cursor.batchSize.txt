cursor.batchSize()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.batchSize()

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method specifies the
   number of documents to return in each batch; MongoDB server returns
   query results in batches. In most cases, the effect of configuring
   the batch size will not affect the user or the application since the
   :program:`mongo` shell and most driver present the results
   seamlessly as though returned in a single batch.

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method takes the
   following parameter:

   :param size:

          The number of documents to return per batch. Do **not** use a
          batch size of ``1``.

   .. note::

      Specifying ``1`` or a negative number is analogous to using the
      :method:`limit() <cursor.limit()>` method.

   Consider the following examples that use the :method:`batchSize()
   <cursor.batchSize()>` method in the :program:`mongo` shell:

   - Set the batch size so that the results of the :method:`find()` are
     returned in batches of ``10``. The effects of the batch size is
     not visible to the user as the :program:`mongo` shell iterate over
     the first 20 documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.animals.find().batchSize(10)
