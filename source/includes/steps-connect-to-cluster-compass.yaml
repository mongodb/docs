  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`group's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the group whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` modal under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of the machine from which you will run Compass on
  the list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address. 
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
    
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| group being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.

  a. Click :guilabel:`Copy` under :guilabel:`Copy the URI Connection String`
     to copy the MongoDB :manual:`URI connection string
     </reference/connection-string>`.
  
  #. Open the Compass application. Compass automatically detects the URI
     connection string in the system clipboard and prompts you to allow it to
     auto-fill the connection details. Click :guilabel:`Yes`.
  
  #. The URI connection string uses a MongoDB user set up for the group as the
     user to authenticate as. Compass autofills the :guilabel:`Username` field
     with that user. Fill in the :guilabel:`Password` field with the password
     for the user.
  
     To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the :guilabel:`Username`
     and :guilabel:`Password` fields with the username and password of a
     different MongoDB user.
  
  #. You can optionally fill in the :guilabel:`Favorite Name` field with a
     name for the connection. When you use Compass in the future, previous
     connections appear in the left pane of the Compass :guilabel:`Connect`
     window under :guilabel:`Favorites`.
  
  #. Click :guilabel:`Connect` to connect Compass to your cluster.
