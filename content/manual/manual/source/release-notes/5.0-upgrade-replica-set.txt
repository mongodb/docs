The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` that is a replica set member from version
|oldversion| to |newversion|.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you upgrade your replica set, check the 
:ref:`5.0 Performance Considerations <5.0-rel-notes-performance>` for any 
potential performance impacts when upgrading to |newversion|.

.. include:: /includes/valid-ttl-config-prereq.rst

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All replica set members must be running version |oldversion|. To upgrade
a replica set from an |olderseries| and earlier, *first* upgrade all
members of the replica set to the latest 4.4-series release and then
follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to
|newversion|.

Confirm Clean Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to upgrading a member of the replica set, confirm that the
member was :ref:`cleanly shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| replica set must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|.

To ensure that all members of the replica set have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|, connect to each
replica set member and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.4" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the primary. A majority of the data-bearing
members must be available:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
:replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a
"rolling" upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available.

Additional Upgrade Procedures
-----------------------------

- To upgrade a standalone, see :ref:`5.0-upgrade-standalone`.
- To upgrade a sharded cluster, see :ref:`5.0-upgrade-sharded-cluster`.
