================================================
Manage Database Users Using X.509 Authentication
================================================

The |k8s-op-short| supports managing database users for deployments
running with |tls| and X.509 internal cluster authentication enabled.

.. important::

   The |k8s-op-short| does not support other authentication mechanisms
   in deployments it creates. In an Operator-created deployment, you
   cannot use |mms| to:

   - Add other authentication methods to users.
   - Manage users *not* using X.509 authentication.

   After enabling X.509 authentication, you can add X.509 users using the |mms| interface or the |k8s-crd|.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before managing database users, you must deploy a
:doc:`replica set <deploy-replica-set>` or
:doc:`sharded cluster <deploy-sharded-cluster>` with |tls| and X.509
enabled.

If you need to generate X.509 certificates for your MongoDB users,
see :ref:`create-x509-certs`.

Delete a Database User
----------------------

To delete a database user, pass the ``metadata.name`` from the user
|k8s-configmap| to the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete mdbu <metadata.name>
