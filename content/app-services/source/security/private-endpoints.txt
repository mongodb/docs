You can use a Private Endpoint to access Atlas App Services from within
your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This is a private connection to Atlas
App Services that does not go over the public internet. Requests from outside of
your VPC return a ``404`` error.

Private Endpoints are only available for Atlas App Services Apps
deployed locally to a region in AWS. They connect to your AWS VPC using
AWS PrivateLink. To learn more, see `What is AWS PrivateLink?
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html>`__
in the AWS documentation.

There are two kinds of App Services Private Endpoints:

- General: Endpoints that use ``services.cloud.mongodb.com`` for Client HTTP
  requests.
- Sync: Endpoints that use ``services.cloud.mongodb.com`` for Sync WebSocket
  connections.

.. important:: 

   :ref:`Custom HTTPS Endpoints <custom-endpoints>` and 
   :ref:`Data API endpoints <data-api-endpoints>` are not supported 
   in private endpoints.


Before You Begin
----------------

Gather the following information:

- Your **VPC ID**, which you can find in the AWS VPC dashboard or
  by running the :aws:`describe-vpcs
  </cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs>` command in the AWS
  CLI.
- Your **Subnet IDs**, which you can find in the AWS VPC dashboard
  or by running the :aws:`describe-subnets
  </cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-subnets>` command in the AWS
  CLI.
  

Set up a private hosted zone for your VPC. You need your VPC ID for this.
Use `ModifyVpcAttribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyVpcAttribute.html>`__
to set the following VPC attributes to true:

- ``EnableDnsHostnames``
- ``EnableDnsSupport``

You must also install and authenticate the AWS CLI.

Add a Private Endpoint
----------------------

You can add a new General Endpoint or Sync Endpoint with the App Services UI or
the Admin API.

Add a General Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a VPC Interface Endpoint

            a. In the App Services UI, navigate to :guilabel:`App Settings`,
               then click the :guilabel:`Private Endpoints` tab.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Add Private Endpoint`, then click
               :guilabel:`General`.
            #. Add your VPC ID and Subnet IDs (comma-separated list) in their
               separate fields, then click :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. Copy the generated :guilabel:`VPC Interface Endpoint Command`.
               The command should look something like this:
            
               .. code-block:: sh

                 aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
                   --vpc-endpoint-type Interface
                   --service-name <App Services Endpoint Service Name> \
                   --vpc-id <your-vpc-id> \
                   --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                   --subnet-ids <your-subnet-ids>
            #. In your terminal, execute the generated AWS CLI command to create
               a VPC Endpoint.
         
         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoint to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoint in your VPC, you
            need to add it to your App. 

            a. Find the **VPC Endpoint ID**, either in the output of the CLI
               command you ran in the previous step or on the endpoint details
               screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This value starts with ``vpce-``.
            #. Copy your new VPC Endpoint's ID and paste it into the ``Your VPC
               Endpoint ID`` field in the App Services UI, then click
               :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. If this is the first Private Endpoint you are creating, you will 
               see a toggle you can use to either restrict or open all access from 
               requests outside your PrivateLink connection. By default, App 
               Services blocks all requests coming from outside your PrivateLink 
               connection. This setting applies to this endpoint and **all 
               additional endpoints you create**. Refer to :ref:`change access 
               restrictions <change_access_restrictions>` for more information.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Finish Endpoint Creation`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a VPC Interface Endpoint

            a. Call the :admin-api-endpoint:`List VPC Private Endpoint Services
               <operation/adminListPrivateEndpointServiceInfo>` endpoint.
            #. Filter the response object to find the entry for your App's
               :ref:`deployment region <deployment-regions>` and the endpoint
               type you want to create.

               .. io-code-block::

                  .. input::
                     :language: sh

                     curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/private_endpoint_service_infos \
                     -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"

                  .. output::

                     :emphasize-lines: 4-5

                     [
                     {
                        "cloud_provider_region": "aws-us-east-1",
                        "service_name": "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0718bec2c0bdeab5c",
                        "endpoint_type": "general"
                     },
                     ...
                     ]
            #. Get the ``service_name`` field from the desired entry in the
               previous step.
            #. Create a VPC Endpoint using the AWS CLI `create-vpc-endpoint 
               <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc-endpoint.html>`__
               command. You need an App Services endpoint service name, VPC ID,
               subnet IDs, and AWS deployment region. The command should look
               something like this:
                  
            .. code-block:: sh

              aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
                --vpc-endpoint-type Interface
                --service-name <App Services Endpoint Service Name> \
                --vpc-id <your-vpc-id> \
                --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                --subnet-ids <your-subnet-ids>

         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoint to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoint in your VPC, you
            need to add it to your App. 

            a. Find the **VPC Endpoint ID**, either in the output of the CLI
               command you ran in the previous step or on the endpoint details
               screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This value starts with ``vpce-``.
            #. When you have your VPC Endpoint's ID, call
               :admin-api-endpoint:`Create a VPC Private Endpoint <operation/adminCreatePrivateEndpoint>`
               with the Endpoint ID, cloud deployment region, and endpoint type.
               For example, using ``aws-us-east-1``:

            .. code-block:: sh

               curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/private_endpoints \
                 -X POST \
                 -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" \
                 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                 -d '{
                   "cloud_provider_region": "<your-cloud-deployment-region>",
                   "cloud_provider_endpoint_id": "<your-vpc-endpoint-id>",
                   "endpoint_type": "general",
                   "comment": "Optional: add a comment describing the endpoint."
                 }'


Add a Sync Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Sync Endpoint must be paired with a General Endpoint.

               then click the :guilabel:`Private Endpoints` tab.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Add Private Endpoint`, then click
               :guilabel:`Sync`.
            #. Add your VPC ID and Subnet IDs (comma-separated list) in their
               separate fields, then click :guilabel:`Next`.

               App Services generates.
         
         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoints to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoints in your VPC, you
            need to add them to your App. 

            a. Find the Sync and General **VPC Endpoint IDs**, either in the
               output of the CLI commands you ran in the previous step or on the
               endpoint details screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This value
               starts with ``vpce-``.
            #. Copy your new VPC Endpoint IDs and paste them into their
               respective ``Your VPC Endpoint ID`` field in the App Services UI,
               then click :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. If this is the first Private Endpoint you are creating, you will 
               see a toggle you can use to either restrict or open all access from

               command. You need an App Services endpoint service name, VPC ID,
               subnet IDs, and AWS deployment region. The command should look
               something like this:

                --subnet-ids <your-subnet-ids>

         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoint to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoint in your VPC, you
            need to add it to your App. 

            a. Find the Sync **VPC Endpoint ID**, either in the
               output of the CLI commands you ran in the previous step or on the
               endpoint details screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This value
               starts with ``vpce-``.
            #. Create a Sync Private Endpoint by calling
               :admin-api-endpoint:`Create a VPC Private Endpoint <operation/adminCreatePrivateEndpoint>`
               with its Endpoint ID, cloud deployment region, and endpoint type.
               For example, using ``aws-us-east-1``:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/private_endpoints \
                  -X POST \
                  -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" \
                  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                  -d '{
                     "cloud_provider_region": "<your-cloud-deployment-region>",
                     "cloud_provider_endpoint_id": "<your-vpc-endpoint-id>",
                     "endpoint_type": "sync",
                     "comment": "Optional: add a comment describing the endpoint."
                  }'
            #. You must also create a General Private Endpoint by following the
               steps for creating a General Private Endpoint on this page.

.. _change_access_restrictions:

Change Access Restrictions
--------------------------
By default, all private Endpoints only handle internal requests. You can choose 
to open access from all requests outside your PrivateLink connection. 

.. important::
  
   This setting is global to all of your endpoints.

You can toggle this setting in three ways:

- In the UI, from the list of endpoints on the :guilabel:`Private Endpoints` 
  tab, click the :guilabel:`Restrict Access` button.

- In the UI, when creating your first Private Endpoint, you have the option to 
  toggle this setting in the :guilabel:`Modify Your VPC Private DNS` step. 

- In the Admin API, call the :admin-api-endpoint:`Toggle Non-VPC Requests
  <operation/allNonVpcClientRequests>` with a boolean value (``true`` to remove
  the default restriction, or ``false`` to reinstate it.)

Private Endpoints Ignore IP Access Lists
----------------------------------------

When you enable private endpoints, you can still enable access to your App
Services application using other methods, such as adding public IPs to
:ref:`IP access lists <ip-access-list>`.

Private IPs do not need to be added to IP access lists, as requests
through private endpoints ignore IP access lists.

Supported SDK Versions
----------------------

The Atlas Device SDKs can access your General and Sync endpoints. However, they
must use a :ref:`version that supports the new domain 
<domain-migration-sdk-versions>`.

Private Endpoint Limitations
----------------------------

- You can't use Private Endpoints with globally deployed Apps or local
  Apps deployed to Azure or GCP.

- You can't use public internet connections to access your App if you
  have a Private Endpoint enabled. All requests must come through the
  Private Endpoint.

- If you :ref:`change your deployment model <change-deployment-models>`,
  then you must create new Private Endpoints for the App's new region.

- You can't simultaneously use Private Endpoints and :ref:`allow
  connections over the MongoDB wire protocol <wire-protocol>`. If one is
  enabled, you can't enable the other.

- By default, Private Endpoints only handle requests that originate from within your VPC.
  You can configure your App to also accept requests from the public internet. To learn how,
  see :ref:`Change Access Restrictions <change_access_restrictions>`.

- All **outbound** requests, such as an App Services trigger calling an 
  external API, go over the public internet.
