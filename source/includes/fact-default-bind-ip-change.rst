Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, bind to localhost by default.
Previously, starting in MongoDB 2.6, only the binaries from the
official MongoDB RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora Linux, and derivatives)
and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives) packages bind to localhost by
default. For more details, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
