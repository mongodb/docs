$comment

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $comment

   The :operator:`$comment` makes it possible to attach a comment to a
   query. Because these comments propagate to the :dbcommand:`profile`
   log, adding :operator:`$comment` modifiers can make your profile
   data much easier to interpret and trace. Use one of the following
   forms:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { <query> } )._addSpecial( "$comment", <comment to add> )
      db.collection.find( { $query: { <query> }, $comment: <comment to add> } )
