|fts| queries might return many results. To make navigating results 
easier, you can use the following :manual:`aggregation pipeline stages 
</core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to paginate your query results:

1. :pipeline:`$skip` bypasses the specified number of documents that 
   pass into the stage and passes the remaining documents to the next 
   stage in the pipeline.

#. :pipeline:`$limit` restricts the number of documents passed to the 
   next stage in the pipeline.

You can extend this method to your applications so that a 
:guilabel:`Next Page` button skips past the first ten results and 
shows the next ten results from that point.

You can also use the :ref:`fts-facet-aggregation-variable` to return 
the total number of search results. You can use this information in 
your applications to show the total number of search results, or the 
number of pages available to your application user.

This tutorial takes you through the following steps:

1. Set up an |fts| index with dynamic mapping for the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.

#. Run an |fts| query using the following:

   - :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit` 
     after the :pipeline:`$search` stage to paginate the results.

   - :ref:`fts-facet-aggregation-variable` to return the 
     total number of search results.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| {+cluster+} meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`Prerequisites 
<fts-tutorials-prereqs>`.

Create the |fts| Index With Dynamic Mapping 
-------------------------------------------

In this section, we create an |fts| index that uses :ref:`dynamic 
mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>` to index the fields in the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
