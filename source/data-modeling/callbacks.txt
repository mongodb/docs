Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to implement **callbacks** in your
{+odm+} models to customize the life cycle of your model instances.

Callbacks are methods that {+odm+} triggers at specified moments of
an object's life cycle. They allow you to initiate specified actions
before or after changes to an object's state.

{+odm+} implements many of the callbacks from Active Record. To learn
more, see `Callbacks
<{+active-record-docs+}/active_record_callbacks.html>`__ in the
Active Record documentation.

Supported Callbacks
-------------------

Mongoid supports the following callbacks on model classes that implement
the :ref:`Document <mongoid-modeling-documents>` module:

-  ``after_initialize``
-  ``after_build``
-  ``before_validation``
-  ``after_validation``
-  ``before_create``
-  ``around_create``
-  ``after_create``
-  ``after_find``
-  ``before_update``
-  ``around_update``
-  ``after_update``
-  ``before_upsert``
-  ``around_upsert``
-  ``after_upsert``
-  ``before_save``
-  ``around_save``
-  ``after_save``
-  ``before_destroy``
-  ``around_destroy``
-  ``after_destroy``

To learn more about any of the preceding callback types, see the
`ActiveRecord::Callbacks
<https://api.rubyonrails.org/{+rails-8-version-docs+}/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html>`__
reference in the Rails API documentation.

You can implement callbacks in both top-level and embedded document
models.

.. note:: Callback Invocation Behavior

   For efficiency, {+odm+} invokes the callback only on the document
   that you performed the persistence action on. This behavior enables
   {+odm+} to support large hierarchies and handle optimized atomic
   updates efficiently by not invoking callbacks throughout the document
   hierarchy.

Take precautions and ensure testability when implementing callbacks for
domain logic, because these designs can lead to unexpected errors when
callbacks in the chain halt execution. We recommend using callbacks for
cross-cutting concerns outside of your program's core functionality,
such as queueing up background jobs.

Document Callbacks
------------------

You must implement and register callbacks on your model classes.
You can register a callback by using ordinary methods, blocks and
``Proc`` objects, or by defining custom callback objects that use
classes or modules.

This example demonstrates how to register callbacks on the ``Contact``
model class in the following ways:

- Includes the ``before_save`` class method, which triggers the
  ``process_phone`` method before a ``Contact`` instance is saved to
  MongoDB. The ``process_phone`` method is defined separately in the class.

- Includes the ``after_destroy`` class method and uses a block to print a
  message when a ``Contact`` instance is deleted.

   :start-after: start-doc-callback
   :end-before: end-doc-callback
   :language: ruby
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 11-13, 16-18

The following code performs data operations that demonstrate the
callback actions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/callbacks.rb
   :start-after: start-doc-ops
   :end-before: end-doc-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Because callback functionality comes from Active Support, you can
alternatively use the ``set_callback`` class method syntax to register
callbacks. The following code demonstrates how to use this syntax to
create a callback that stores original values of the ``name`` field in
the ``aliases`` array:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/callbacks.rb
   :start-after: start-doc-set-syntax
   :end-before: end-doc-set-syntax
   :language: ruby
   :emphasize-lines: 8-12
   :dedent:

Association Callbacks
---------------------

{+odm+} provides the following association callbacks:

- ``after_add``
- ``after_remove``
- ``before_add``
- ``before_remove``

If you register an association callback on your model class, it is
invoked whenever you add or remove a document from any of the following
associations:

- ``embeds_many``
- ``has_many``
- ``has_and_belongs_to_many``

Specify association callbacks as options on the respective association.
You must pass the added or removed document as the parameter to the
specified callback.

The following code demonstrates how to register an association callback
on a ``User`` model class that embeds multiple ``SavedArticle``
instances to limit the number of embedded documents for a single
instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/callbacks.rb
   :start-after: start-association-callback
   :end-before: end-association-callback
   :language: ruby
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 10-15
   :dedent:

Additional Information
----------------------

following references in the Active Record documentation:
