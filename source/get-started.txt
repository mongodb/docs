Overview
--------

The {+driver-short+} is a synchronous API that you can use to interact with MongoDB
from your Java application. This guide shows you how to create an application that
uses the {+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas
and query data in your cluster.

.. tip:: 

   :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </getting-started/>` is a fully managed cloud database service
   that hosts your MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required)
   MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this tutorial to connect a sample Java application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. The tutorial includes the following sections:

- :ref:`java-get-started-download-and-install`: Learn how to install
  the {+driver-short+}.
- :ref:`java-get-started-create-deployment`: Learn how to create
  a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas.
- :ref:`java-get-started-connection-string`: Learn how to retrieve
  your Atlas deployment's connection string.
- :ref:`java-connect-to-mongodb`: Learn how to create an application
  that connects to MongoDB and queries data stored in your deployment.

If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.
