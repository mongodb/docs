.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.explain()

   :returns: A document that describes the process used to return the
             query.

   This method may provide useful insight when attempting to optimize
   a query. When you call the :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` on
   a query, the query system reevaluates the query plan. As a result,
   these operations only provide a realistic account of *how* MongoDB
   would perform the query, and *not* how long the query would take.

   The method's output includes these fields:

   - ``cursor``: The value for cursor can be either ``BasicCursor`` or
     ``BtreeCursor``. The second of these indicates that the given query
     is using an index.

   - ``nscanned``: The number of index entries scanned.

   - ``n``: the number of documents returned by the query. You want the
     value of ``n`` to be close to the value of ``nscanned``. You want to
     avoid a "collection scan," which is a scan where every document in
     the collection is accessed. This is the case when ``nscanned`` is
     equal to the number of documents in the collection.

   - ``millis``: the number of milliseconds require to complete the
     query. This value is useful for comparing indexing strategies.

      optimization strategies.
