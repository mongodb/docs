Remove a Group
==============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. only:: onprem

   Please contact your |mms| administrator to remove a company or group
   from your |mms| account.

.. only:: cloud

   Overview
   --------

   Removing a group deletes all the group's artifacts, including all user
   and monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the group in selection
   lists. If you recreate the group, it is as if the group had not
   existed.

   You can remove a group if:

   - You have the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the group.

   - The group has no outstanding invoices.

   - The group has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to removing
     the group, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.
