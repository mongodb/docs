Subset Mode

You can enable :guilabel:`Subset Mode` in MongoDB Charts to restrict 
the input collection to ``1000`` randomly selected documents. To toggle
:guilabel:`Subset Mode`, use the toggle in the :guilabel:`Preview` 
section. The :guilabel:`Subset Mode` setting for a chart persists when 
the chart renders on a dashboard. So, if you enable subset mode when 
you build a chart, the data that renders in the dashboard is also 
sampled.

.. note::

   When you enable subset mode and you specify a :ref:`filter 
   <charts-filter-documents>`, |charts| takes the sample of ``1000``
   documents *before* it applies the filter. So, |charts| might use 
   fewer than ``1000`` documents to plot the chart.

Use Cases
---------

Consider using :guilabel:`Subset Mode` in the following scenarios:

- When you draft a chart and heavily modify chart options. In this
  situation, :guilabel:`Subset Mode` lets the chart render quickly 
  during the building process. When you feel satisfied with your chart, 
  you can disable :guilabel:`Subset Mode` to have all documents 
  included in your final visualization.

- When you visualize a large data source and the chosen data is
  sufficiently aggregated (e.g. showing averages of fields) so
  you don't need all documents to obtain a useful visualization.
  In this case, if you leave :guilabel:`Subset Mode` enabled for the 
  rendered dashboard, you can still retain a useful chart.

.. note::

   Due to the random nature of sampling, when you have 
   :guilabel:`Subset Mode` enabled, your visualizations might change 
   each time the chart loads.
