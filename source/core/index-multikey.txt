.. default-domain:: mongodb

To index a field that holds an array value, MongoDB adds index items
for each item in the array. These *multikey* indexes allow MongoDB to
return documents from queries using the value of an array. MongoDB
automatically determines whether to create a multikey index if the
indexed field contains an array value; you do not need to explicitly
specify the multikey type.

Consider the following illustration of a multikey index:

.. include:: /images/index-multikey.rst

.. TODO in the following paragraph, is 'however' the correct word for here?
   and while we're at it, should we clarify the first half of the sentence
   as well?

Multikey indexes support all operations supported by other MongoDB
indexes; however, applications may use multikey indexes to select
documents based on ranges of values for the value of an array. Multikey
indexes support arrays that hold both values (e.g. strings, numbers)
*and* nested documents.

Limitations
-----------

Interactions between Compound and Multikey Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you can create multikey :ref:`compound indexes
<index-type-compound>`, at most one field in a compound index may hold
an array. For example, given an index on ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }``, the
following documents are permissible:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {a: [1, 2], b: 1}

   {a: 1, b: [1, 2]}

However, the following document is impermissible, and MongoDB
cannot insert such a document into a collection with the ``{a: 1,
b: 1 }`` index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {a: [1, 2], b: [1, 2]}

If you attempt to insert a such a document, MongoDB will reject the
insertion, and produce an error that says ``cannot index parallel
arrays``. MongoDB does not index parallel arrays because they
require the index to include each value in the Cartesian product of
the compound keys, which could quickly result in incredibly large
and difficult to maintain indexes.

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: The index of a shard key **cannot** be a multi-key index.

Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``hashed`` indexes are not compatible with multi-key indexes.

To compute the hash for a ``hashed`` index, MongoDB collapses
sub-documents and computes the hash for the entire value. For fields
that hold arrays or sub-documents, you cannot use the index to support
queries that introspect the sub-document.

Examples
--------

Index Basic Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
     "name" : "Warm Weather",
     "author" : "Steve",
     "tags" : [ "weather", "hot", "record", "april" ]
   }

Then an index on the ``tags`` field, ``{ tags: 1 }``, would be a
multikey index and would include these four separate entries for that
document:

- ``"weather"``, 

- ``"hot"``,

- ``"record"``, and 

- ``"april"``.

Queries could use the multikey index to return queries for any of
the above values.

.. TODO the following example should be revamped a bit. It's a strange example.

Index Arrays with Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create multikey indexes on fields in objects embedded in
arrays, as in the following example:

Consider a ``feedback`` collection with documents in the following
form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "title": "Grocery Quality",
    "comments": [
       { author_id: ObjectId(...),
         date: Date(...),
         text: "Please expand the cheddar selection." },
       { author_id: ObjectId(...),
         date: Date(...),
         text: "Please expand the mustard selection." },
       { author_id: ObjectId(...),
         date: Date(...),
         text: "Please expand the olive selection." }
    ]
   }

An index on the ``comments.text`` field would be a multikey index
and would add items to the index for all embedded documents in
the array.

With the index ``{ "comments.text": 1 }`` on the ``feedback`` collection,
consider the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.feedback.find( { "comments.text": "Please expand the olive selection." } )

The query would select the documents in the collection that contain
the following embedded document in the ``comments`` array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { author_id: ObjectId(...),
     date: Date(...),
     text: "Please expand the olive selection." }
