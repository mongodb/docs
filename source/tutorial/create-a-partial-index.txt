Create a Partial Index
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.2

Partial indexes only index the documents in a collection that meet a
specified filter expression. By indexing a subset of the documents in a
collection, partial indexes have lower storage requirements and reduced
performance costs for index creation and maintenance. See
:ref:`index-type-partial` for more information about partial indexes and
their use.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/indexes` and :doc:`/administration/indexes`
   for more information.

Prototype
---------

To create a :ref:`partial index <index-type-partial>` on a field, use
the ``partialFilterExpression`` option when creating the index, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( 
      { a: 1 }, 
      { partialFilterExpression: { b: { $gt: 5 } } } 
   )

Example
-------

The following operation creates a sparse index on the ``users``
collection that *only* includes a document in the index if
the ``archived`` field is ``false``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.createIndex( { username: 1 }, { archived: false } )

The index only includes documents where the ``archived`` field is ``false``.

Considerations
--------------

.. note::

   To use the partial index, a query **must** contain the filter expression
   (or a modified filter expression that specifies a subset of the filter
   expression) as part of its query condition. 
   As such, MongoDB will not use the
   partial index if the index results in an incomplete result set for the
   query or sort operation.
