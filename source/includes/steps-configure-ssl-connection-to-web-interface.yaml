  a. Upload your ``.pem`` file to each |application| host. This 
     certificate must be uploaded to each |onprem| host so they can 
     accept |tls-ssl| connections.

  b. Change the owner of the ``.pem`` file to the user and group that 
     own the |onprem| process.

  c. Change the permissions of the ``.pem`` file so only the file 
     owner can read and write the file.

  a. Click :guilabel:`Admin` in the |mms| application to view the 
     ``Admin`` interface.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`General` tab

  #. Click :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Web Server & Email`.

  #. Set the following options under :guilabel:`Web Server` heading:

     .. list-table::
        :stub-columns: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - |url| to Access Ops Manager
          - Provide the full |url| for |application| including port 
            ``8443`` for |https| access.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: ini
                  :copyable: false
               
                  https://opsmanager.example.com:8443

        * - |https| PEM Key File
          - Type the absolute file system path where the ``.pem`` 
            file is located on all |onprem| hosts in this box.

        * - |https| PEM Key File Password
          - If you encrypted the |https| PEM Key File, type the 
            password needed to decrypt it in this box.

        * - Client Certificate Mode
          - Select which client hosts must connect to |onprem| using  |tls-ssl|. |onprem| checks for certificates from these 
            client hosts when they try to connect.
            If you leave this setting as ``None``, connections with 
            |onprem| may be encrypted, but are not *required* to be.

            Accepted values are:

            - ``None``
            - ``Required for Agents Only``
            - ``Required for All Requests``
