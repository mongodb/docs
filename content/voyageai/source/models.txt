{+voyageai+} provides state-of-the-art embedding and reranking models.
MongoDB's :ref:`{+voyage-api+} <voyage-api-and-clients>`
provides access to the latest {+voyageai+} models. This page describes
the available models and when to use them.

   For text embeddings, we recommend:

   - ``voyage-4-large`` for the best quality
   - ``voyage-4-lite`` for the lowest latency and cost
   - ``voyage-4`` for a balance between quality and performance
   - A :ref:`domain-specific model <voyage-domain-specific-models>` if your application
     is in one of the listed domains.

   For other use cases, we recommend:

   - ``voyage-multimodal-3.5`` for text, image, and video embeddings
   - ``voyage-context-3`` for chunk-level and document-level retrieval tasks
   - ``rerank-2.5`` for adding reranking to most applications
   - ``rerank-2.5-lite`` for adding reranking to latency-sensitive applications

Text Embeddings
---------------

{+voyageai+} provides the following text embedding models 
to capture the semantic meaning of text.

For details and example usage, see :ref:`voyage-text-embeddings`.

General-Purpose Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following models for most AI search and retrieval applications.

.. include:: /includes/tables/general-purpose-models-table.rst

.. _voyage-domain-specific-models:

Domain-Specific Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following models for specialized domains to achieve better accuracy.

.. include:: /includes/tables/domain-specific-models-table.rst

Open Models
~~~~~~~~~~~

{+voyage+} also provides the following open-weight models.

.. include:: /includes/tables/open-models-table.rst

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Older Text Embedding Models
   :sub_heading: The following older models are still accessible from the API, but we recommend using the new models for better quality and efficiency.
   :expanded: false

   The latest models perform better than the legacy models in all aspects, such as quality, context length, latency, and throughput.

   .. include:: /includes/tables/older-embedding-models-table.rst

Contextualized Chunk Embeddings
-------------------------------

{+voyageai+} provides the following models 
that generate embeddings while incorporating surrounding context 
for improved retrieval accuracy. 

For details and example usage, see :ref:`voyage-context-chunk-embeddings`.

.. include:: /includes/tables/contextualized-chunk-embeddings-table.rst

Multimodal Embeddings
---------------------

{+voyageai+} provides the following embedding models
that process text, images, and video.

For details and example usage, see :ref:`voyage-multimodal-embeddings`.

.. include:: /includes/tables/multimodal-embeddings-table.rst

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Older Multimodal Models
   :sub_heading: The following older models are still accessible from the API, but we recommend using the new models for better quality and efficiency.
   :expanded: false

   The latest models perform better than the legacy models in all aspects, such as quality, context length, latency, and throughput.

   .. include:: /includes/tables/older-multimodal-models-table.rst

Rerankers
---------

{+voyageai+} provides the following reranking models to
refine your search results.
