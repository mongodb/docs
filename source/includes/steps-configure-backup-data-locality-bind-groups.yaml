  If you are using Automation, :doc:`install the Automation Agent
  </tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>` for the group in Data Center
  1 on each server in Data Center 1. Install the Automation Agent for
  Data Center 2 on each server in Data Center 2. The Automation Agent
  will then install Monitoring and Backup agents as needed.

  If you are not using Automation,
  download and install the Monitoring and Backup agents for the group
  assigned to Data Center 1 by navigating to the :guilabel:`Administration`
  and then :guilabel:`Agents` page while viewing that group in |onprem|.

  Then, switch to the group in Data Center 2 by choosing it from the drop-down
  menu in the top navigation bar in |onprem|, and download and install
  its Monitoring and Backup agents.

  See the following pages for the procedures for installing the agents manually:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-monitoring-agent`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-backup-agent`
