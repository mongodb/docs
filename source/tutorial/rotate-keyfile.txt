If your cluster uses :manual:`keyfile authentication
</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster-with-keyfile-access-control>`,
it is recommended that you :manual:`rotate
</tutorial/rotate-key-replica-set>` the keyfile periodically. |mms|
provides an automated procedure for keyfile rotation with no downtime.

To rotate the keyfile using the API instead of the user interface, see :ref:`rotate-key-api-tutorial`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To perform a rolling keyfile rotation:

- Authentication must be enabled.
- At least one cluster in the project must be configured with the
  :ref:`clusterAuthMode <advanced-options-security>`
  option set to ``keyFile`` or ``sendKeyFile``.
- All clusters in the project must be running MongoDB version 4.2 or
  higher.
