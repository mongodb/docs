=====================================
Retrieve a Snapshot with SCP Delivery
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In addition to the :guilabel:`PULL via Secure HTTP (HTTPS)` delivery method, |mms| Backup supports
snapshot delivery using SCP. With :guilabel:`Push via Secure Copy
(SCP)`, |mms| copies the snapshot directly to the target system.

.. only:: onprem

   For an overview of |onprem|'s internal behavior and a more detailed
   description of the restore types and delivery options, see:
   :doc:`/core/restore-overview`.

Requirements
------------

In order for |mms| to be able to securely copy your snapshots to your
system, you must grant |mms| access to the server, either by providing
a username and password, or by providing a username with an SSH public
key. See: :doc:`/tutorial/generate-key-pair-for-scp-restores` for
instructions.

Additional Information
----------------------

The :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster` and
:doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set` tutorials provide more detailed
instructions for restoring a sharded cluster or replica set using
snapshot.
