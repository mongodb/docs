The `MongoDB Connector for Spark
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/spark-connector>`_ provides
integration between MongoDB and Apache Spark.

With the connector, you have access to all Spark libraries for use with
MongoDB datasets: ``Dataset`` for analysis with SQL (benefiting from
automatic schema inference), streaming, machine learning, and graph
APIs. You can also use the connector with the Spark Shell.

The {+connector-long+} is compatible with the following
