   .. step:: Create a project directory

      In your shell, navigate to where you want to create your
      application, then run the following command to create a
      directory called ``c-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir c-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the
      following commands to create a ``quickstart.c`` application file
      in the ``c-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd c-quickstart
                touch quickstart.c

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd c-quickstart
                type nul > quickstart.c

   .. step:: Create your {+driver-short+} application

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``quickstart.c`` file, which queries
      the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.c
         :language: c

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`c-get-started-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your C application

      In your shell, run the following commands to compile and run this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         gcc -o quickstartc quickstart.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags libmongoc-1.0)
         ./quickstartc   

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." },
         "plot" : "Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace
         and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.",
         ...
         "title" : "The Shawshank Redemption", 
         ...

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``quickstart.c`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
