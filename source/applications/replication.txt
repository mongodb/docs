From the perspective of a client application, whether a MongoDB
instance is running as a single server (i.e. "standalone") or a
:term:`replica set` is transparent. However, MongoDB provides
additional read and write configurations for replica sets.

.. note::

   :term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` where the shards are also
   replica sets provide the same operational semantics with regards to
   write and read operations.

:doc:`/core/replica-set-write-concern`
   Write concern describes the level of acknowledgment requested
   from MongoDB for write operations.

:doc:`/core/read-preference`
   Read preference specifies where (i.e. which members of the replica
   set) the drivers should direct the read operations.

:doc:`/core/read-preference-mechanics`
   Describes the mechanics of read preference.
