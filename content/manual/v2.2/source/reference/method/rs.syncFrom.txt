   Provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom`, which
   allows administrators to configure the member of a replica set that
   the current member will pull data from. Specify the name of the
   member you want to replicate from in the form of ``[hostname]:[port]``.

   See :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` for more details.
