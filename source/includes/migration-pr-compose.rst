* Your data is currently in a MongoDB database.

  This guide focuses on migrating to Atlas from an existing MongoDB deployment
  on Compose.

* Your current MongoDB database is running MongoDB 2.6 or higher.

  Atlas supports the latest versions of MongoDB: 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0.
  If you're running MongoDB version 2.6 or greater, the Atlas Live Migration
  Service can move your data directly into a newer database version.
  Update your `MongoDB drivers <https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers>`_
  and make any necessary code changes at the application level to ensure
  compatibility. If you're running a version older than 2.6, see 
  `Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6 <https://docs.mongodb.com/v2.6/release-notes/2.6-upgrade/index.html>`_
  for upgrade instructions.

* Your current deployment is a MongoDB replica set or sharded cluster.

  If your deployment is currently a standalone instance, you must first
  :manual:`convert it to a replica set </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`.
  
  Live migration of data from sharded clusters is not supported. Your destination
  cluster may be sharded, but your source cluster must be an unsharded replica
  set.

* (Optional) Enabled authentication on your source deployment.

  The migration process requires that authentication is enabled on your
  source cluster. See :manual:`Enable Auth </tutorial/enable-authentication>`
  for instructions on enabling authentication.
  You can verify that authentication is enabled on your source cluster
  using the :manual:`mongo </reference/program/mongo/>` command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo <mongodb-connection-string> -u <mongodb-username> -p --authenticationDatabase admin

* The database user from your source cluster that you will use to perform the migration has the required MongoDB roles.
   
  The user must have the :authrole:`clusterMonitor` and :authrole:`backup` roles. To verify
  that the database user that you intend to use for migration has the appropriate
  roles, run the :manual:`db.getUser() </reference/method/db.getUser>` command against the admin database.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     use admin
     db.getUser("admin")
     {
       "_id" : "admin.admin",
       "user" : "admin",
       "db" : "admin",
       "roles" : [
         {
           "role" : "backup",
           "db" : "admin"
         },
         {
           "role" : "clusterMonitor",
           "db" : "admin"
         }
       ]
     } ...
