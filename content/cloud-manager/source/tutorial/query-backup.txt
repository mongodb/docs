|mms| provides queryable backups. This
functionality allows you to more quickly query specific backup
snapsnots. You can use the queryable backups to:

- Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.

- Compare previous versions of data against the current data.

- Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing data
  from multiple snapshots.

Considerations
--------------

Read-Only Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-duration.rst

Query Restrictions on the Queryable Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot perform the following operations on queryable snapshots:

- :manual:`Map-reduce operations </core/map-reduce>`.

- Queries that require disk usage, such as
  :manual:`running aggregation </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`
  with the ``allowDiskUse`` option to perform large sort
  operations.

Cannot Query Encrypted Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you :ref:`encrypted your snapshots <encrypt-snapshots>`, you
can't query those encrypted snapshots.

Cannot Query Namespace Filtered Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you applied :ref:`namespace filters <namespaces-filter>` to a
snapshot, you can't query that snapshot.

Connection Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections to these instances are over |tls-ssl|  and require
:manual:`x.509 authentication </core/security-x.509>`.  |mms| provides:

- An executable that creates a :ref:`tunnel <query-via-tunnel>` which
  handles the connection, including the client |tls-ssl| and the x.509
  authentication.

- x.509 certificates if you want to handle the connection details
  manually, including the |tls-ssl| and the x.509 authentication.

Prerequisites
-------------

Queryable backups are available for MongoDB 3.2 or later replica
sets or MongoDB 3.2 or later sharded clusters with |csrs|.

.. _query-via-tunnel:

Query Backup (Use Tunnel to Connect)
------------------------------------

.. note::

   The tunnel handles the security (|tls-ssl| and x.509 authentication)
   for connecting to the instance.

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-tunnel.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. _query-via-manual-connection:

Query Backup (Handle |tls| Authentication Manually)
-------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-certificate-duration.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-manual.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.
