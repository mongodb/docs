Resync Backup
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If you receive a ``Backup requires a resync`` alert, then you must resync the
Backup Service for the specified MongoDB instance.

Considerations
--------------

To ensure the Backup oplog does fall behind the deployment's oplog, always
provision adequate machine resources for the agent. If you stop your MMS
agents for maintenance reasons, always restart them in a timely manner.
To provide a buffer for maintenance and for occasional activity bursts,
ensure that the oplog on the :term:`primary` is large enough to contain 24
hours of activity. For more information on the Backup oplog, see the
:ref:`faq-backup`.
