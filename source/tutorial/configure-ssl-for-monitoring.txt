================================================================
Configure the Monitoring Agent to Use SSL with MongoDB Instances
================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the
Monitoring Agent to use SSL to connect to the deployment's
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances.

You must tell the agent which certificate to use to sign MongoDB
certificates. And you must turn on the SSL option for the MongoDB
instances in |mms|.

Prerequisite
------------

The MongoDB instance must use SSL. To use SSL with a ``mongod`` and
``mongos`` instance, you must enable it at compile time, or use `MongoDB
Enterprise <https://www.mongodb.com/products/downloads/mongodb-enterprise>`_.
