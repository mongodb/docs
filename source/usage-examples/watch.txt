=================
Watch for Changes
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can keep track of changes to data in MongoDB, such as changes to a
collection, database, or deployment, by opening a **change stream**. A change
stream allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to them.
The change stream returns **change event** documents when changes occur.
You can open a change stream by calling the ``watch()`` method on
a ``MongoCollection``, ``MongoDatabase``, or ``MongoClient`` object:

.. code-block:: java

   ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch();

The ``watch()`` method optionally takes an **aggregation pipeline**  which
consists of an array of **stages** as the first parameter to filter and
transform the change event output as follows:. 

.. code-block:: java

   List<Bson> pipeline = Arrays.asList(
                           Aggregates.match(
                              Filters.lt("fullDocument.runtime", 15)));
   ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch(pipeline);

The ``watch()`` method returns an instance of ``ChangeStreamIterable``, a class
that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results.
``ChangeStreamIterable`` also inherits methods from its parent class,
``MongoIterable`` which implements the core Java interface ``Iterable``.

You can call ``forEach()`` on the ``ChangeStreamIterable`` to handle
events as they occur, or you can use the ``iterator()`` method which
returns a ``MongoCursor`` instance that you can use to traverse the results.

You can call methods on the ``MongoCursor`` such as ``hasNext()`` to check
whether additional results exist, ``next()`` to return the next document
in the collection, or ``tryNext()``, to immediately return either
the next available element in the change stream or ``null``. Unlike the
``MongoCursor`` returned by other queries, a ``MongoCursor`` associated
with a change stream waits until a change event arrives before
returning a result from ``next()``. As a result, calls to ``next()``
using a change stream's ``MongoCursor`` never throw a
``java.util.NoSuchElementException``.

To configure options for processing the documents returned from the change
stream, use member methods of the ``ChangeStreamIterable`` object returned
by ``watch()``. See the link to the ``ChangeStreamIterable`` API
documentation at the bottom of this example for more details on the
available methods.

How to Process Change Stream Events with a Callback
---------------------------------------------------

To capture events from a change stream, call the ``forEach()`` method
with a callback function as shown below:

.. code-block:: java

   changeStream.forEach(event -> System.out.println("Change observed: " + event));

The callback function triggers when a change event is emitted. You can
specify logic in the callback to process the event document when it is
received.

.. important:: forEach() blocks the current thread

   Calls to ``forEach()`` block the current thread as long as the
   corresponding change stream listens for events. If your program
   needs to continue executing other logic, such as processing requests or
   responding to user input, consider creating and listening to your
   change stream in a separate thread.

.. note::

   For update operation change events, change streams only return the modified
   fields by default rather than the complete updated document. You can configure
   your change stream to also return the most current version of the document
   by calling the ``fullDocument()`` member method of the ``ChangeStreamIterable``
   object with the value ``FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: java

      ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch()
                .fullDocument(FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP);

Example
-------

The following example uses two separate applications to demonstrate how
to listen for changes using a change stream:

- The first application, named ``Watch``, opens a change stream
  on the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.
  ``Watch`` uses an aggregation pipeline to filter changes based on
  ``operationType`` so that it only receives insert and update
  events (deletes are excluded by omission). ``Watch`` uses a callback
  to receive and print the filtered change events that occur on the
  collection.

- The second application, named ``WatchCompanion``, inserts a
  single document into the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
  database. Next, ``WatchCompanion`` updates the document with a new
  field value. Finally, ``WatchCompanion`` deletes the document.

First, run ``Watch`` to open the change stream on the collection and
define a callback on the change stream using the ``forEach()`` method.
While ``Watch`` is running, run ``WatchCompanion`` to generate change
events by performing changes to the collection.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

``Watch``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Watch.java
   :language: java

``WatchCompanion``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/WatchCompanion.java
   :language: java

If you run the applications above in sequence, you should see output from
the ``Watch`` application that is similar to the following. Only the
``insert`` and ``update`` operations are printed, since the aggregation
pipeline filters out the ``delete`` operation:

.. code-block::

   Received a change to the collection: ChangeStreamDocument{
     operationType=OperationType{value='insert'},
     resumeToken={"_data": "825EC..."},
     namespace=sample_mflix.movies,
     destinationNamespace=null,
     fullDocument=Document{{_id=5ec3..., test=sample movie document}},
     documentKey={"_id": {"$oid": "5ec3..."}},
     clusterTime=Timestamp{...},
     updateDescription=null,
     txnNumber=null,
     lsid=null
   }
   Received a change to the collection: ChangeStreamDocument{
     operationType=OperationType{value='update'},
     resumeToken={"_data": "825EC..."},
     namespace=sample_mflix.movies,
     destinationNamespace=null,
     fullDocument=Document{{_id=5ec3..., test=sample movie document, field2=sample movie document update}},
     documentKey={"_id": {"$oid": "5ec3..."}},
     clusterTime=Timestamp{...},
     updateDescription=UpdateDescription{removedFields=[], updatedFields={"field2": "sample movie document update"}},
     txnNumber=null,
     lsid=null
   }

You should also see output from the ``WatchCompanion`` application that
is similar to the following:

.. code-block::

   Success! Inserted document id: BsonObjectId{value=5ec3...}
   Updated 1 document.
   Deleted 1 document.
