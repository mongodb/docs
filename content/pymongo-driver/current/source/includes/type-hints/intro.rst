If your application uses Python 3.5 or later, you can add *type hints*,
as described in `PEP 484 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/>`__, to your code.
Type hints denote the data types of variables, parameters, and function return
values, and the structure of documents.
Some IDEs can use type hints to check your code for type errors and suggest
appropriate options for code completion.
