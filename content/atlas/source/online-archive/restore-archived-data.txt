This page describes how to restore archived data using the :pipeline:`$merge` 
pipeline stage.

   Ensure that your {+cluster+} is adequately provisioned for the amount of data you want
   to restore from your archive. Otherwise, you risk running out of space during or after the
   restoration. Contact :doc:`Support </support>` for additional technical guidance on
   setting up the size of the oplog or for troubleshooting any space issues on your
   |service| {+cluster+}.
