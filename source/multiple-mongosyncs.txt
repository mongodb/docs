There are two ways to synchronize :ref:`sharded clusters
<sharded-cluster>`. You can use either one ``monogosync`` or several
``monogosync`` instances. For best performance with large or heavily
loaded clusters, use multiple ``monogosync`` instances, one
``monogosync`` for each shard in the cluster.

.. _c2c-sharded-config-single:

Configure a Single ``mongosync`` Instance
-----------------------------------------

To configure a single ``mongosync``, follow the :ref:`connection
instructions <c2c-conn-top-level>` for your cluster architecture to
connect to the :binary:`mongos` instance in your cluster.

When you connect a single ``mongosync`` to a sharded cluster do not use
the :urioption:`replicaSet` option or the :option:`id <mongosync --id>`
option.

The rest of this page addresses cluster to cluster synchronization
using multiple ``monogosync`` instances.

.. _c2c-sharded-config:

Configure Multiple ``mongosync`` Instances
------------------------------------------

To configure multiple ``mongosync`` instances:

#. :ref:`Verify cluster configuration <c2c-shard-config-verify>`
#. :ref:`Determine the shard IDs <c2c-shard-config-determine>`
#. :ref:`Connect the instances <c2c-shard-config-connect>`

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Verify cluster configuration

      .. _c2c-shard-config-verify:

      The source cluster and destination cluster must have the same
      number of shards.

   .. step:: Determine the shard IDs

      .. _c2c-shard-config-determine:

      To get the shard IDs, connect to the source cluster
      :binary:`mongos` and run the :dbcommand:`listShards` command.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { listShards: 1 } )

      The information is in the ``shards`` array.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 3,9

           shards: [
             {
               _id: 'shard01',
               host: 'shard01/localhost:27501,localhost:27502,localhost:27503',
               state: 1,
               topologyTime: Timestamp({ t: 1656612236, i: 2 })
             },
             {
               _id: 'shard02',
               host: 'shard02/localhost:27504,localhost:27505,localhost:27506',
               state: 1,
               topologyTime: Timestamp({ t: 1656612240, i: 4 })
             }
           ]

   .. step:: Connect the ``mongosync`` instances

      .. _c2c-shard-config-connect:

      These instructions use a generic connection string. To modify the
      connection string for your cluster architecture, refer to the
      architecture specific :ref:`connection details <c2c-connecting>`.

      .. tip::
       
         A single host server can run multiple ``mongosync`` instances. To
         improve performance, run ``mongosync`` on multiple host servers.

      Each ``mongosync`` instance:

      - Connects to the same ``mongos`` instance in the source cluster.
      - Connects to the same ``mongos`` instance in the destination
        cluster.
      - Connects to a single shard in the source cluster.
      - Specifies a unique port to use for during synchronization.
        Consider designating a range of ports to simplify scripting
        {+c2c-product-name+} operations.

      Run the first ``mongosync`` instance:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         mongosync \
           --cluster0 "mongodb://user:password@cluster0host:27500" \
           --cluster1 "mongodb://user:password@cluster1host:27500" \
           --id shard01 --port 27601

      Run a new ``mongosync`` instance for each shard in the source cluster.
      Edit the ``--id`` and ``--port`` fields for each additional
      ``mongosync`` instance.

      .. code-block:: javascript
        :emphasize-lines: 4

         mongosync \
           --cluster0 "mongodb://user:password@cluster0host:27500" \
           --cluster1 "mongodb://user:password@cluster1host:27500" \
           --id shard02 --port 27602

.. _c2c-sharded-start:

Start Multiple ``mongosync`` Instances
--------------------------------------

Use ``curl`` or another HTTP client to issue the :ref:`start
<c2c-api-start>` command to each of the ``mongosync`` instances.

.. code-block:: shell

   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/start -XPOST --data \
        '{ "source": "cluster0", "destination": "cluster1", \
           "reversible": false, "enableUserWriteBlocking": false }'

   curl monogsync02Host:27602/api/v1/start -XPOST --data \
        '{ "source": "cluster0", "destination": "cluster1", \
           "reversible": false, "enableUserWriteBlocking": false }'

The ``start`` command options must be the same for all of the ``mongosync``
instances.

.. _c2c-sharded-progress:

Check Progress
--------------

The ``mongosync`` instances do not aggregate progress information
across shards. To review synchronization progress for a particular
shard, use ``curl`` or another HTTP client to issue the
:ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>` command to the ``mongosync``
instance synchronizing that shard.

.. code-block:: shell

   curl monogsync02Host:27602/api/v1/progress -XGET

This command checks the progress of the ``mongosync`` instance that is
running on ``monogsync02Host`` and using ``port 27602`` for
synchronization. To check progress on other shards, update the host and
port number then repeat the API call to each ``mongosync`` instance.

.. _c2c-sharded-pause:

Pause a ``mongosync`` Instance
------------------------------

The :ref:`pause <c2c-api-pause>` command will temporarily halt the
synchronization process on a single shard. It does not pause any other
``mongosync`` instances that may be running. Use ``curl`` or another
HTTP client to issue the ``pause`` command to a ``mongosync`` instance.

.. code-block:: shell

   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/pause -XPOST --data '{}'

This command pauses the ``mongosync`` instance that is running on
``monogsync01Host`` and using ``port 27601`` for synchronization. To
pause synchronization on other shards, update the host and port number
then repeat the API call to each ``mongosync`` instance.

.. _c2c-sharded-resume:

Resume Synchronization
----------------------

If one or more ``mongosync`` instances are paused, you can use the
:ref:`resume <c2c-api-resume>` command to resume synchronizing. Run a
separate ``resume`` command against each paused ``mongosync`` instance
to continue synchronizing.

Use ``curl`` or another HTTP client to issue the :ref:`resume
<c2c-api-resume>` command to each ``mongosync`` instance.

.. code-block:: shell

   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/resume -XPOST --data '{}'

This command resumes synchronization on the ``mongosync`` instance that
is running on ``monogsync01Host`` and using ``port 27601``.  To 
resume synchronization on other shards, update the host and port number
then repeat the API call to each ``mongosync`` instance.

.. _c2c-sharded-commit:

Commit Synchronization From  Multiple ``mongosync`` Instances
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you want to complete synchronization, issue the :ref:`progress
<c2c-api-progress>` command and check the values for ``canCommit``
and ``lagTimeSeconds``.

To minimize write blocking on the source cluster, you should only run
the ``commit`` command when the :ref:`lagTimeSeconds
<c2c-api-progress>` value is small enough for your application.

If the ``lagTimeSeconds`` value is small enough, and ``canCommit`` is
``true``, issue the :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` command to commit
synchronization. Repeat the process on all of the ``mongosync``
instances.

The ``commit`` operation is blocking. The ``commit`` command will not
return until ``commit`` has been called on every ``mongosync``
instance.

.. code-block:: shell

   // Check progress
   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/progress -XGET

   // Commit 
   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/commit -XPOST --data '{}'

These commands only check progress and commit synchronization for the
``mongosync`` instance that is running on ``monogsync01Host`` and using
``port 27601``. To synchronize all of the shards, make additional calls
to ``progress`` and  ``commit`` on any other ``mongosync`` instances
that may be running.

.. _c2c-sharded-reverse:

Reverse the Synchronization Direction
-------------------------------------

To reverse synchronization so that the original destination cluster
acts as the source cluster:

- If you have not already done so, issue the :ref:`commit
  <c2c-api-commit>` command to each ``mongosync`` instance and wait
  until all of the commits to finish.
- Issue the :ref:`reverse <c2c-api-reverse>` command to each
  ``mongosync`` instance.

The ``reverse`` operation is blocking. The ``reverse`` command will not
return until ``reverse`` has been called on every ``mongosync``
instance.

.. code-block:: shell

   curl monogsync01Host:27601/api/v1/reverse -XPOST --data '{}'

This command reverses synchronization on the ``mongosync``
instance that is running on ``monogsync01Host`` and using ``port
27601``. Make additional calls to ``reverse`` on any other
``mongosync`` instances that may be running.

.. note::

   Reverse synchronization is only possible if ``reversible`` and
   ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` are both set to ``true`` when the
   :ref:`start API <c2c-api-start>` initiates ``mongosync``.
