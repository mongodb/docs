Although MongoDB supports :ref:`multi-document transactions
<transactions>` for replica sets and sharded clusters, for many scenarios, the 
denormalized data model, as discussed on this page, will continue to be optimal 
for your data and use cases.

Pattern
-------

In MongoDB, a write operation on a single document is atomic. For
fields that must be updated together, embedding the fields within the
same document ensures that the fields can be updated atomically.

For example, consider a situation where you need to maintain
information on books, including the number of copies available for
checkout as well as the current checkout information.

The available copies of the book and the checkout information should be
in sync. As such, embedding the ``available`` field and the
``checkout`` field within the same document ensures that you can update
the two fields atomically.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 9-10

   {
       _id: 123456789,
       title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
       author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
       published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
       pages: 216,
       language: "English",
       publisher_id: "oreilly",
       available: 3,
       checkout: [ { by: "joe", date: ISODate("2012-10-15") } ]
   }

Then to update with new checkout information, you can use the
:method:`db.collection.updateOne()` method to atomically update both
the ``available`` field and the ``checkout`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.updateOne (
      { _id: 123456789, available: { $gt: 0 } },
      {
        $inc: { available: -1 },
        $push: { checkout: { by: "abc", date: new Date() } }
      }
   )

The operation returns a document that contains information on the
status of the operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }

The ``matchedCount`` field shows that ``1`` document matched the update
condition, and ``modifiedCount`` shows that the operation updated ``1``
document.

If no document matched the update condition, then ``matchedCount`` and
``modifiedCount`` would be ``0`` and would indicate that you could not
check out the book.
