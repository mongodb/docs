You can perform multi-document transactions on sharded clusters.

The following page lists concerns specific to running transactions on a
sharded cluster. These concerns are in addition to those listed in
:doc:`/core/transactions-production-consideration`.

Performance
-----------

Single Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactions that target a single shard should have the same
performance as replica-set transactions.

Multiple Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactions that affect multiple shards incur a greater performance
cost.

.. note::

   On a sharded cluster, transactions that span multiple shards will
   error and abort if any involved shard contains an arbiter.

.. _transactions-sharded-clusters-time-limit:

Time Limit
~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a time limit, specify a ``maxTimeMS`` limit on
``commitTransaction``. 

If ``maxTimeMS`` is unspecified, MongoDB will use the
:parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`.

If ``maxTimeMS`` is specified but would result in transaction that
exceeds :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`, MongoDB will use
the :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`.

To modify :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds` for a sharded
cluster, the parameter must be modified for all shard replica set
members.

Read Concerns
-------------

Multi-document transactions support :readconcern:`"local"`,
:readconcern:`"majority"`, and :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern
levels.

For transactions on a sharded cluster, only the
:readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern provides a consistent snapshot
across multiple shards.

For more information on read concern and transactions, see
:ref:`transactions-read-concern`.
