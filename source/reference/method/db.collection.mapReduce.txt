:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.mapReduce(
                            <map>,
                            <reduce>,
                            {
                              out: <collection>,
                              query: <document>,
                              sort: <document>,
                              limit: <number>,

:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` takes the following parameters:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Parameter

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``map``

     - JavaScript or String

     - A JavaScript function that associates or "maps" a ``value`` with
       a ``key`` and emits the ``key`` and value ``pair``. You can
       specify the function as :ref:`BSON type <bson-types>` JavaScript 
       (BSON Type 13) or String (BSON Type 2).
       
       See :ref:`Requirements for the map Function <mapreduce-map-mtd>` 
       for more information.
       
       

   * - ``reduce``

     - JavaScript or String

     - A JavaScript function that "reduces" to a single object all the
       ``values`` associated with a particular ``key``. You can specify
       the function as BSON type JavaScript (BSON Type 13) or String 
       (BSON Type 2).
       
       See :ref:`Requirements for the reduce Function 
       <mapreduce-reduce-mtd>` for more information.
       
       

   * - ``options``

     - document

     - A document that specifies additional parameters to
       :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`.
       
       




The following table describes additional arguments that
:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` can accept.


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``out``

     - string or document

     - Specifies the location of the result of the map-reduce operation.
       You can output to a collection, output to a collection with an
       action, or output inline. You may output to a collection when
       performing map-reduce operations on the primary members of the set;
       on :term:`secondary` members you may only use the ``inline`` output.
       
       See :ref:`out Options <mapreduce-out-mtd>` for more information.
       
       
       

   * - ``query``

     - document

     - Specifies the selection criteria using :ref:`query operators
       <query-selectors>` for determining the documents input to the
       ``map`` function.
       
       

   * - ``sort``

     - document

     - Sorts the *input* documents. This option is useful for
       optimization. For example, specify the sort key to be the same as
       the emit key so that there are fewer reduce operations. The sort key
       must be in an existing index for this collection.
       
       

   * - ``limit``

     - number

     - Specifies a maximum number of documents for the input into the
       ``map`` function.
       
       

   * - ``finalize``

     - Javascript or String

     - Optional. A JavaScript function that modifies the output after
       the ``reduce`` function. You can specify the function as BSON type
       JavaScript (BSON Type 13) or String (BSON Type 2).
       
       See :ref:`Requirements for the finalize Function
       <mapreduce-finalize-mtd>` for more information.
       
       

   * - ``scope``

     - document

     - Specifies global variables that are accessible in the ``map``,
       ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` functions.
       
       

   * - ``jsMode``

     - boolean

     - Specifies whether to convert intermediate data into BSON
       format between the execution of the ``map`` and ``reduce``
       functions.
       
       Defaults to ``false``.
       
       If ``false``:
       
       - Internally, MongoDB converts the JavaScript objects emitted
         by the ``map``
         function to BSON objects. These BSON
         objects are then converted back to JavaScript objects when
         calling the ``reduce`` function.
       
       - The map-reduce operation places the intermediate BSON objects
         in temporary, on-disk storage. This allows the map-reduce
         operation to execute over arbitrarily large data sets.
       
       If ``true``:
       
       - Internally, the JavaScript objects emitted during ``map``
         function remain as JavaScript objects. There is no need to
         convert the objects for the ``reduce`` function, which
         can result in faster execution.
       
       - You can only use ``jsMode`` for result sets with fewer than
         500,000 distinct ``key`` arguments to the mapper's ``emit()``
         function.
       
       

   * - ``verbose``

     - boolean

     - Specifies whether to include the ``timing`` information in the
       result information. Set ``verbose`` to ``true`` to include
       the ``timing`` information.
       
       Defaults to ``false``.

       This option is ignored. The result
       information always excludes the ``timing`` information.
       You can view timing information by running
       :method:`db.collection.explain()` with
       :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` in the ``"executionStats"``
       or ``"allPlansExecution"`` ``verbosity`` modes.
       

   * - ``collation``

     - document

     - Optional. 
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option.rst
       
       
   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Enables :dbcommand:`mapReduce` to bypass document validation
       during the operation. This lets you insert documents that do not
       meet the validation requirements.

Output
------

The output of the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` method is
identical to that of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command. See the
:ref:`Output <mapReduce-output>` section of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
command for information on the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`
output.

Restrictions
------------

:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` no longer supports
:ref:`afterClusterTime <afterClusterTime>`. As such,
:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` cannot be associatd with
:ref:`causally consistent sessions <causal-consistency>`.
