Overview
--------

Enabling access control requires authentication of every user. Once
authenticated, users only have the privileges as defined in the roles
granted to the users.

To enable access control, use either the command line option ``--auth`` or
:setting:`security.authorization` configuration file setting.

.. note::

   The tutorial enables access control and uses the :ref:`default
   authentication mechanism <authentication-mechanism-default>`. To
   specify a different authentication mechanism, see
   :doc:`/core/authentication-mechanisms`.

You can also enable client access control by :doc:`enabling internal
authentication </tutorial/enable-internal-authentication>` of replica
sets or sharded clusters. For instructions on enabling internal
authentication, see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-internal-authentication`.

Considerations
--------------

With access control enabled, ensure you have a user with :authrole:`userAdmin`
or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role in the ``admin`` database.

This tutorial assumes a :term:`standalone` environment.

The :doc:`/tutorial/enable-internal-authentication` tutorial has steps
specific to enabling access control on replica sets and sharded clusters.

You can create users before enabling access control or you can create
users after enabling access control. If you enable access control before
creating any user, MongoDB provides a :ref:`localhost exception
<localhost-exception>` which allows you to create a user administrator in
the ``admin`` database. Once created, authenticate as the user
administrator to create additional users as needed.

Procedures
----------

Add Users Before Enabling Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure first adds a user administrator to a MongoDB
instance running without access control and then enables access control.

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-admin-then-enable-authentication.rst

If you need to disable access control for any reason, restart the MongoDB
instance without the ``--auth`` command line option, or if using a
configuration file, the :setting:`security.authorization` setting.

Add Users After Enabling Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure first enables access control, and then uses
:ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to add a user
administrator.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication.rst
