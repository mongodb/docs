You can build AI features and applications by using {+avs+}. 
Use the following pages to learn how to implement
common use cases and design patterns.

Semantic Search
---------------

{+avs+} allows you to perform semantic search over text, images, 
multimodal, and other data types by indexing and searching over
data that you've converted into vector embeddings.

To get started, see :ref:`vector-search-tutorial`.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
------------------------------------

RAG allows you to combine language models with your own data by 
retrieving relevant context before generating 
responses. This pattern allows you to build AI applications that provide 
more accurate and domain-specific responses grounded in your custom data.

To learn more and get started, see :ref:`avs-rag`.

You can also implement RAG locally, without the need for |api| keys from LLM providers.
To learn more, see :ref:`local-rag`.

AI Agents
