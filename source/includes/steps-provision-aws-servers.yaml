  Deploy one machine for every :program:`mongod`.

  :program:`mongos` instances require minimal resources, and can run
  on the same machine as a :program:`mongod`.

  Give the servers a common prefix in order to specify them as a group
  when deploying new clusters or replica sets.

stepnum: 8
ref: security

  The security group must allow traffic on the ports you use for your
  deployment, as described in :ref:`aws-checklist`. The security
  groups populated here come directly from your AWS account. MMS
  cannot create a new security group: if you would like a new group
  listed in this menu, you must create it in the AWS console.

  When make all of your selections, click :guilabel:`Next`.

title: Select storage settings.
stepnum: 9
ref: storage
content: |
  Select a :guilabel:`Root Volume Size (GiB)` large enough for the
  deployment's needs. We recommend a root volume of at least 25 GB.
  The root volume stores the operating system, the downloaded MongoDB
  versions, and the Automation Agent log files.

  In the :guilabel:`Data Directory` field, enter the path MongoDB will use
  to store data, and in the :guilabel:`Location of Data` field select
  which volume holds the data. We do not recommend storing your data on
  the Root Volume. For machines in the ``m1`` or ``m2`` series, we
  recommend attaching an EBS Volume. For machines in the ``c3`` series, we
  recommend storing the data on the SSD instance stores.

  When you finish modifying the settings, click :guilabel:`Provision Machine`.

  The systems may not be fully operational for several minutes.
