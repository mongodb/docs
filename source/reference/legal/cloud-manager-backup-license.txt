This License Agreement (the "**Agreement**") establishes the terms on
which **MongoDB, Inc.** ("**Company**") grants a license to Company’s
proprietary backup software solely in machine-readable, executable,
object-code form and related documentation (the "**Backup Software**")
to you the licensee ("**You**" or "**Your**") solely on the condition
that You accept all of the terms in this Agreement. By clicking through
any applicable acceptance screen, or otherwise accessing, installing, or
using the Backup Software, you are indicating your acceptance of this
Agreement, and if you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you
may not access, install, or use the Backup Software. If You are an
employee or agent of a company (the "**Customer**"), You hereby agree
that You enter into this Agreement on behalf of the Customer and that
You have the authority to bind the Customer to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. If you enter, or have entered, into a separate
agreement with Company for use of the MongoDB Enterprise database
software for other purposes (besides backup), the terms of that
agreement will control with respect to the uses authorized therein.

1. **LICENSE.** Subject to Your full and ongoing compliance with all
   terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to You having

   You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,

   Backup Subscription to install and use the Backup Software in your
   internal environment, and solely for the intended purpose of the
   Backup Software. For clarity, this license is limited to the backup
   solution in the MongoDB Enterprise Server and does not include any
   other features of the MongoDB Enterprise Server. We may monitor your
   use of, or use technological measures designed to prevent
   unauthorized or illegal use of, the MongoDB Enterprise Server
   software to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

   (iii) decompile, disassemble, translate, reverse engineer or
   otherwise attempt to derive source code from any portion of the
   Backup Software, except and solely to the extent that the foregoing
   restriction is impermissible pursuant to applicable law or third
   party license; (iv) remove, alter or obscure any proprietary notices
   of Company, its licensors or suppliers included in the Backup
   Software; or (v) publicly disseminate performance information about

   consent to our collection of such data, and to our storage,
   processing, and analysis of such data for our own internal business

   REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.

#. **ESSENTIAL BASIS OF AGREEMENT.** The Parties acknowledge and agree
   that the disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability set
   forth in Section 9 form an essential basis of this Agreement, and
   that, absent any of such disclaimers, exclusions or limitations of
   liability, the terms of this Agreement, including, without
   limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different.

#. **GENERAL.** This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in
   accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to
   conflicts of law principles thereof or to the United Nations
   Convention on the International Sale of Goods. For purposes of all

   irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
   federal courts located within the State of New York. Company may
   assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or
   without notice to You. You may not assign this Agreement, or any part
   of it, to any other party. Any attempt by You to do so is null and
   void. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable,
   that provision will be enforced to the extent permissible by law and
   the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. No
   waiver under this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set
   forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom
   enforcement of such waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall
   constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
   described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
   granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Any
   delay or forbearance by either party in exercising any right
   hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of that right. This Agreement
   is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us
   and supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
   any other communications between You and Company in relation to the
   subject matter of this Agreement.
