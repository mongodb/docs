If you are using Windows as your operating system, you might encounter an issue in which the
{+driver-short+} is unable to locate an ``X.509`` authentication certificate in memory.
This error displays the following error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   No credentials are available in the security package

To resolve this issue, add the following code to your application. This code generates
any ``X.509`` certificates required by your application and stores them to disk:

.. code-block:: csharp

   using (X509Certificate2 certWithKey = certOnly.CopyWithPrivateKey(key))
   {
      return new X509Certificate2(certWithKey.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12));
   }
