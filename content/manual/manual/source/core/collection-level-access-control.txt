Collection-level access control allows administrators to grant users
privileges that are scoped to specific collections.

Administrators can implement collection-level access control through
:ref:`user-defined roles <user-defined-roles>`. By creating a role with
:ref:`privileges <privileges>` that are scoped to a specific collection
in a particular database, administrators can provision users with roles
that grant privileges on a collection level.

Privileges and Scope
--------------------

A privilege consists of :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>`
and the :ref:`resources <resource-document>` upon which the
actions are permissible; i.e. the resources define the scope of the
actions for that privilege. 

By specifying both the database and the collection in the
:ref:`resource document <resource-specific-db-collection>` for a
privilege, administrator can limit the privilege actions just to a
specific collection in a specific database. Each privilege action in a
role can be scoped to a different collection.

For example, a user defined role can contain the following privileges:

.. code-block:: javascript

   privileges: [
     { resource: { db: "products", collection: "inventory" }, actions: [ "find", "update", "insert" ] },
     { resource: { db: "products", collection: "orders" },  actions: [ "find" ] }
   ]

The first privilege scopes its actions to the ``inventory`` collection
of the ``products`` database. The second privilege scopes its actions
to the ``orders`` collection of the ``products`` database.

As a best practice, avoid assigning ``createCollection`` privileges to users
who don't have read privileges on the collection.
