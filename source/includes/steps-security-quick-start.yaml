  In the :guilabel:`How would you like to authenticate your 
  connection?` section of the :guilabel:`Quickstart` page, you can 
  configure one of the following options for your cluster. 

  .. tabs:: 

     .. tab:: Username and Password
        :tabid: pwd

        a. Click :guilabel:`Username and Password`. 
        #. Set the new user's :guilabel:`Username` and 
           :guilabel:`Password`.

           .. note::

              If you use special characters in your password, you must
              escape them in the connection string that you use to 
              connect to your cluster. To learn more, 
              see :ref:`special-pass-characters`.

           You can't change a username after you create the user. You 
           can click the :guilabel:`Edit` button to edit the password.

        #. Click :guilabel:`Create User`.

     .. tab:: Certificate 
        :tabid: cert

        a. Click :guilabel:`Certificate`. MongoDB uses X.509 
           certificates for passwordless authentication.
        #. Specify the Common Name (CN) for the new user.
        #. *Optional*. Toggle the :guilabel:`Download certificate 
           when user is added` to :guilabel:`On` to download the 
           certificate after creating the user. 

           If you choose to download the certificate, you must also 
           specify certificate expiration. To specify the duration, 
           choose the duration for the certificate from 
           the dropdown. You can set the certificate expiration to 
           ``3``, ``6``, ``12``, or ``24`` months.
        #. Click :guilabel:`Add User`. 

           The new user is granted :authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write` role by default.

  You can enable access for any network that needs to read and write 
  data to your cluster. To enable access, you can configure access from 
  your local environment or the cloud environment for your cluster.

  .. tabs:: 

     .. tab:: Local Environment
        :tabid: local 

        a. Choose :guilabel:`My Local Environment` to add network IP 
           addresses to the project IP Access List. |service| allows 
           only client connections to the database deployment from 
           entries in the project's IP access list. You can modify the 
           IP addresses in the access list at any time.
        #. Enter the IP address and a description to associate with the 
           IP address in the :guilabel:`IP Address` and 
           :guilabel:`Description` fields respectively, or click 
           :guilabel:`Add My Current IP Address`.

           You can specify either a single IP address or a CIDR-notated 
           range of addresses.
        #. Click :guilabel:`Add Entry`.

     .. tab:: Cloud Environment
        :tabid: cloud

        .. note:: 

           Network Peering and Private Endpoint are available only for 
           ``M10`` or higher cluster. 

        a. Choose :guilabel:`Cloud Environment` to configure network 
           access between |service| and your cloud or on-premise 
           environment.
        #. Enter the IP address and a description to associate with the 
           IP address in the :guilabel:`IP Address` and 
           :guilabel:`Description` fields respectively, or click 
           :guilabel:`Add My Current IP Address`.

           You can specify either a single IP address or a CIDR-notated 
           range of addresses.
        #. Click :guilabel:`Add Entry`.
        #. *Optional*. For ``M10`` and higher clusters, you can set up 
           |vpc| peering and private endpoint by clicking the 
           corresponding :guilabel:`Configure in New Tab` button.

           To learn more about setting up: 

           - |vpc| Peering connection, see :ref:`vpc-peering`.
           - Private endpoint, see :ref:`private-endpoint`.

  Once you have completed setting up database and network access for 
  the first cluster in your project, |service| disables access to 
  :guilabel:`Quickstart`. You can enable it to revisit these 
  configurations from a consolidated page.

  A dialog displays prompting you to specify whether you wish to see 
  the :guilabel:`Quickstart` page in your navigation. You can select 
  or deselect the :guilabel:`Hide Quickstart guide in the navigation` 
  checkbox to hide or add :guilabel:`Quickstart` to your navigation.

  Alternatively, you can hide or add :guilabel:`Quickstart` to your 
  navigation from your :guilabel:`Project Settings` page by toggling 
  the :guilabel:`Atlas Security Quickstart` in the :guilabel:`Project 
  Settings` page to :guilabel:`Off` or :guilabel:`On` respectively.
