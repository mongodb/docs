.. default-domain:: mongodb

Aggregation groups values of multiple documents together as input to a
specified set of operations that return single result. MongoDB provides
three ways to perform aggregation: the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-reduce function
</core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`simple aggregation methods and commands
</reference/simple-aggregation>`.

   :doc:`/core/aggregation`
      Describes the different approaches to aggregation in MongoDB.

      :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline`
         Describes the :ref:`aggregation pipeline
         <aggregation-pipeline>` and the :ref:`expressions
         <aggregation-expressions>` that calculate values within the
         pipeline.

      :doc:`/core/map-reduce`
         Describes how to use :dbcommand:`mapReduce` to perform complex
         aggregation tasks.

      :doc:`/reference/simple-aggregation`
         Additional aggregation commands outside the :doc:`aggregation
         pipeline </core/aggregation>` and :term:`map-reduce`.

   :doc:`/tutorial/aggregation-examples`
      Provides practical examples and tasks that display the
      capabilities of aggregation.

   :doc:`/reference/aggregation`
      Provides references and comparisons of the main aggregation
      functions and operations.
