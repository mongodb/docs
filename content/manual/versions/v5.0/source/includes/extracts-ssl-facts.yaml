   If you specify ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` or 
   ``net.tls.allowInvalidCertificates: true``, an invalid certificate is
   sufficient only to establish a TLS connection but it is
   *insufficient* for authentication.

   If ``--tlsCAFile``/``net.tls.CAFile`` (or
   their aliases ``--sslCAFile``/``net.ssl.CAFile``) is not specified
   and you are not using x.509 authentication, you must set the 
   :parameter:`tlsUseSystemCA` parameter to ``true``. This makes MongoDB use 
   the system-wide CA certificate store when connecting to a TLS-enabled server.

   To use x.509 authentication, ``--tlsCAFile`` or ``net.tls.CAFile``
   must be specified unless you are using ``--tlsCertificateSelector``
   or ``--net.tls.certificateSelector``.

   If ``--tlsCAFile`` or ``net.tls.CAFile`` 
   (or their aliases ``--sslCAFile`` or ``ssl.CAFile``) are not
   specified, the system-wide CA certificate store will be used when
   connecting to an TLS/SSL-enabled server. In previous versions of
   MongoDB, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` exited with an error that it
   could not validate the certificate.

   .. warning::

      Although available, avoid using the
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` option if possible. If the use of
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` is necessary, only use the option
      on systems where intrusion is not possible.

      If :binary:`~bin.mongosh` (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl`) runs with the
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` option,
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl`) will not attempt to validate
      the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability to expired
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
      well as to foreign processes posing as valid
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. If you
      only need to disable the validation of the hostname in the
      TLS/SSL certificates, see ``--sslAllowInvalidHostnames``.

ref: ssl-facts-mongo-ssl-hostname-verification
content: |

   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` verifies that the hostname (specified
   in :option:`--host <mongosh --host>` option or the connection string)
   matches the ``SAN`` (or, if ``SAN`` is not present, the ``CN``) in
   the certificate presented by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos`. If ``SAN`` is present, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
   does not match against the ``CN``. If the hostname does not match
   the ``SAN`` (or ``CN``), :binary:`~bin.mongosh` will fail to
   connect.
