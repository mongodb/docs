   The client certificate must have the following
   properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
     for both the client and the server.

   - Client certificates must contain the following fields:

     .. code-block:: none

        keyUsage = digitalSignature
        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

   - Each unique MongoDB user must have a unique certificate.

   - The ``subject`` of a client x.509 certificate, which contains the 
     Distinguished Name (``DN``), must be **different** than the ``subject``\s 
     of :ref:`member x.509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>`.

     .. important::  
    
        If a client x.509 certificate's subject matches the ``O``, ``OU``, and 
        ``DC`` attributes of the :ref:`x509-member-certificate` (or
        :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`, if set) exactly, the client 
        connection is accepted, full permissions are granted, and a warning 
        message appears in the log. 
        
        Only :ref:`cluster member x509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>` 
        should use the same ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` attribute combinations.


     .. versionadded:: 4.2

        If the MongoDB deployment has :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` 
        set, the client x.509 certificate's subject must not match that value.

     .. warning::

        If a client x.509 certificate's subject has the same ``O``,
        ``OU``, and ``DC`` combination as the
        :ref:`x509-member-certificate` (or
        :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` if set), the client
        connection is rejected. Only
        :ref:`cluster member x509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>`
        should use same ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` combinations as this
        grants full permissions.

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

ref: x509-certificate-member
content: |

   The member certificate (:setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`, if
   specified, and :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile`), used to
   verify membership to the sharded cluster or a replica set, must have
   the following properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
     certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

   - The Distinguished Name (``DN``), found in the member certificate's
     ``subject``, must specify a non-empty value for *at least one* of the
     following attributes: Organization (``O``), the Organizational Unit
     (``OU``) or the Domain Component (``DC``).
 
   - The Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit
     attributes (``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) must
     match those from both the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` and
     :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` certificates for the other
     cluster members (or the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`
     value, if set).
     
     To match, the certificate must match all specifications of these
     attributes, or even the non-specification of these attributes. The
     order of the attributes does not matter.

     In the following example, the two ``DN``\'s contain matching
     specifications for ``O``, ``OU`` as well as the non-specification of
     the ``DC`` attribute.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        C=US, ST=CA, O=MongoDB, OU=Dept1, CN=host2

     However, the following two ``DN``\'s contain a mismatch for the
     ``OU`` attribute since one contains two ``OU`` specifications and
     the other, only one specification.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,OU=Sales,O=MongoDB
        CN=host2,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB

   - Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
     Name (``SAN``) entries must match the server hostname for other cluster
     members. Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when comparing ``SAN``\s, MongoDB can 
     compare either DNS names or IP addresses. In previous versions, MongoDB 
     only compares DNS names.

     For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the following
     subjects:

     .. code-block:: bash

        subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US

   - If the certificate used as the ``certificateKeyFile`` includes 
     ``extendedKeyUsage``, the value must include both
     ``clientAuth`` ("TLS Web Client Authentication") and ``serverAuth``
     ("TLS Web Server Authentication").

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth, serverAuth

   - If the certificate used as the ``clusterFile`` includes 
     ``extendedKeyUsage``, the value must include ``clientAuth``.

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
   
     You can also use a certificate that does not include the Extended
     Key Usage (EKU).

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

ref: x509-member-auth-configuration
content: |

   In addition to any TLS/SSL configurations as appropriate for your
   deployment, include the following to specify x.509 for internal
   authentication for each member of your replica set (i.e. the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances) or sharded cluster (i.e. the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances):

   - :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode` or :option:`--clusterAuthMode
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` set to ``x509``

   - :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` or :option:`--tlsClusterFile
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` (*both new in MongoDB 4.2*)

   However, if no cluster file is specified, members can use their
   certificate key file specified in
   :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` or
   :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`
   (*both new in MongoDB 4.2*) for membership authentication. This
   :setting:`certificate key file <net.tls.certificateKeyFile>` is used
   by :binary:`~bin.mongod` (and :option:`mongos 
   <mongos --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`) instances to prove their identity
   to clients, but can also be used for membership authentication. To
   use for both client authentication and membership authentication,
   the certificate must either:

   - Omit ``extendedKeyUsage`` or

   - Specify ``extendedKeyUsage`` values

   .. note::
      
      Athough still available, :setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` (and the
      correponding :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod
      --sslClusterFile>`) and :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` (and the
      corresponding :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongod --sslPEMKeyFile>`)
      are :ref:`deprecated as of MongoDB 4.2 <4.2-tls>`.
      
      For deployments using MongoDB version 4.0 and earlier, use
      :setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` (or the corresponding
      :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>`) and
      :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` (or the corresponding
      :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongod --sslPEMKeyFile>`).

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.
