Overview

.. _`MongoDB Download Center`: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs

Although the recommended procedure to install is through the
:ref:`package manager <install-community-redhat-pkg>`, you can also
install by directly downloading the ``.tgz`` file. The following
tutorial downloads the ``.tgz`` tarball directly to install MongoDB
{+version+} Community Edition on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux,
or Oracle Linux [#oracle-linux]_ versions 6, 7, and 8.

.. admonition:: Production Notes
   :class: note

   Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
   :doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

.. [#oracle-linux] 
   
   MongoDB only supports Oracle Linux running the  Red Hat Compatible
   Kernel (RHCK). MongoDB does **not** support the Unbreakable
   Enterprise Kernel (UEK).

Directory Paths
```````````````

To Use Default Directories
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. container::

   By default, MongoDB runs using the |mongod-user| user account and
   uses the following default directories:

   - |mongod-datadir| (the data directory)

   - ``/var/log/mongodb`` (the log directory)

   |arrow| If you installed via the package manager,
      The default directories are created, and the owner and group for
      these directories are set to |mongod-user|.

   |arrow| If you installed by downloading the tarballs,
      The default MongoDB directories are not created. To create the
      MongoDB data and log directories:

      .. tip::

        Depending on your user permission, you may need to use ``sudo``
        to perform these operations.

      .. code-block:: sh

        mkdir -p /var/lib/mongo
        mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb

      By default, MongoDB runs using the |mongod-user| user account. Once
      created, set the owner and group of these directories to |mongod-user|:

      .. code-block:: sh

         chown -R mongod:mongod <directory>

To Use Non-Default Directories
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. container::

   To use a data directory and/or log directory other than the default
   directories:

   .. tip::

     Depending on your user permission, you may need to use ``sudo``
     to perform these operations.

   #. Create the new directory or directories.


   #. Edit the the configuration file ``/etc/mongod.conf`` and modify the
      following fields accordingly:

      - :setting:`storage.dbPath` to specify a new data directory path (e.g. ``/some/data/directory``)

      - :setting:`systemLog.path` to specify a new log file path (e.g. ``/some/log/directory/mongod.log``)

   #. Ensure that the user running MongoDB has access to the directory or
      directories:

      .. code-block:: sh

         chown -R mongod:mongod <directory>

      If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you **must**
      give the new user access to these directories.

   #. Configure SELinux if enforced.  See :ref:`install-rhel-configure-selinux`.
