  the indexed field using the :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>` operator. 
- Supports dynamically and statically indexing
  :ref:`numbers <bson-data-types-number>` in arrays and querying the
  indexed :ref:`numbers <bson-data-types-number>` in arrays using the
  :ref:`range <range-ref>` operator only. 
- Supports dynamically and statically indexing
  :ref:`dates <bson-data-types-date>` in  arrays and querying the indexed
  :ref:`dates <bson-data-types-date>` in arrays using the :ref:`range <range-ref>`
  operator only. 
- Supports dynamically and statically indexing :ref:`objectIds
  <objectId-ref>` and arrays of :ref:`objectIds <objectId-ref>` and
  querying the indexed :ref:`objectIds <objectId-ref>` using the
  :ref:`equals <equals-ref>` operator.  
- Supports dynamically and statically indexing :ref:`booleans
  <boolean-ref>` and arrays of :ref:`booleans <boolean-ref>` and

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improves performance for :ref:`storedSource 
  <fts-stored-source-definition>`.

.. _fts20220725:

02 August 2022 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrades to |fts|, which include the following: 

  - Querying improvements

    - Supports ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\D``, ``\s``, and ``\S`` regular 
      expressions in the regex query. However, |fts| doesn't return 
      results for characters other than ``s``, ``S``, ``w``, ``W``, 
      ``d``, and ``D`` in the regex query. We recommend using 
      backslashes according to `regex standards <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#bs>`__.

    - Updates to :ref:`email tokenizer <uaxUrlEmail-tokenizer-ref>`  
      top-level domains from the `IANA 
      <https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db>`__ Root Zone Database.

  - Highlighting improvements

    - Passage selector truncates long snippets to show a shorter 
      snippet, which fixes the cause for queries failing when the 
      passage is long.

  - Explain output for some queries might look different. If you use 
    :ref:`explain <explain-ref>`, verify that the changes don't break 
    logic in your environment.

  In addition to the preceding list of changes, you might notice some 
  indexing and querying performance changes. 

- Introduces :ref:`moreLikeThis <more-like-this-ref>` operator to retrieve documents 
  similar to one or more input documents.

  <fts-return-stored-source-option>`.

.. _fts20220309:

  and delete |fts| indexes using the |service| UI or API.
