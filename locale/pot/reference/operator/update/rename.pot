#: ../source/reference/operator/update/rename.txt:40
msgid "The :update:`$rename` operator logically performs an :update:`$unset` of both the old name and the new name, and then performs a :update:`$set` operation with the new name. As such, the operation may not preserve the order of the fields in the document; i.e. the renamed field may move within the document."
