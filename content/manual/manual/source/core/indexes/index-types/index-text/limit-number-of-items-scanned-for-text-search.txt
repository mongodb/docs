   :description: Improve text search query performance by creating a compound text index with an equality match to limit scanned entries.

If you perform text search queries on a large dataset, a single-field
text index may scan a large number of entries to return results, which
can result in slow queries.

To improve query performance, you can create a :ref:`compound text index
<compound-text-index-example>` and include an equality match in your
text search queries. If the compound index contains the field used in
your equality match, the index scans fewer entries and returns results
faster.

About this Task
---------------

In this example, a store manager queries an ``inventory`` collection
that contains these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.insertMany( [ 
      { _id: 1, department: "tech", description: "lime green computer" },
      { _id: 2, department: "tech", description: "wireless red mouse" },
      { _id: 3, department: "kitchen", description: "green placemat" },
      { _id: 4, department: "kitchen", description: "red peeler" },
      { _id: 5, department: "food", description: "green apple" },
      { _id: 6, department: "food", description: "red potato" }
   ] )


The manager performs text search queries for items within a specific
department.

A compound text index on the ``department`` and ``description`` fields
limits the index keys scanned to only documents within the specified
``department``. The compound text index provides improved performance
compared to a single-field text index on the ``description`` field.

Procedure
---------

Create a compound index on the ``inventory`` collection that contains
the following fields:

- An ascending or descending index key on the ``department`` field
- A ``text`` index key on the ``description`` field

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.createIndex(
      {
        department: 1,
        description: "text"
      }
   )

Results
-------

After you create the compound index, text search queries only scan
documents that match a specified equality condition on the
``department`` field.

For example, the following query scans documents with ``department``
equal to ``kitchen`` where the ``description`` field contains the string
``green``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { department: "kitchen", $text: { $search: "green" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [ { _id: 3, department: 'kitchen', description: 'green placemat' } ]

View Number of Documents Examined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see how many documents were scanned to return the query, view the
query's :ref:`executionStats`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find(
      {
         department: "kitchen", $text: { $search: "green" }
      }
   ).explain("executionStats")
   
The number of index keys examined is indicated in the
:data:`totalKeysExamined <explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined>`
field. Queries that examine more index keys generally take longer to
complete.

With the compound index on ``department`` and ``description``, the query
only examines **one** index key. There is only one document in the
collection where ``department`` is ``kitchen`` and the ``description``
contains the string ``green``.

However, if the query used a single-field text index only on the
``description`` field, the query would examine **three** index keys.
There are three documents in the collection where the ``description``
field contains the string ``green``.

In a small collection like the one used in the preceding example, there
isn't a noticeable difference in performance between single-field and
compound text indexes. However, in larger collections, increased index
entry scans can noticeably hinder performance. For best performance,
create text indexes that limit the number of index entries scanned to
best fit your equality matches.
