You add shards to a :term:`sharded cluster` after you create the cluster
or any time that you need to add capacity to the cluster. If you have not
created a sharded cluster, see :ref:`sharding-procedure-setup`.

All shards must be :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`.

Capacity Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding a shard to a cluster, always ensure that the cluster has
enough capacity to support the migration required for balancing the
cluster without affecting legitimate production traffic.

DDL Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add a shard while your cluster executes a DDL operation
(operation that modifies a collection such as
:dbcommand:`reshardCollection`), the operation that adds a shard only
executes after the concurrent DDL operation finishes. 

Add a Shard to a Cluster
------------------------

You interact with a sharded cluster by connecting to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance.

1. In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance. For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongos` is accessible at
   ``mongos0.example.net`` on port ``27017``, issue the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongosh --host mongos0.example.net --port 27017

#. Add a shard replica set to the cluster using the :method:`sh.addShard()`
   method, as shown in the example below. Issue :method:`sh.addShard()`
   separately for each shard. Specify the name of the replica set and a 
   member of the set.

   .. note:: Optional
   
      You can instead use the :dbcommand:`addShard` database
      command, which lets you specify a name and maximum size for the
      shard. If you do not specify these, MongoDB automatically assigns
      a name and maximum size. To use the database command, see
      :dbcommand:`addShard`.

   The following example illustrates adding a shard with
   :method:`sh.addShard()`:

   To add a shard replica set named ``rs1`` with a member
   running on port ``27018`` on ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the
   following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27018" )

   .. note:: It might take some time for :term:`chunks <chunk>` to
      migrate to the new shard.
