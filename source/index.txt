Overview
--------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-short+}, the official MongoDB
driver for asynchronous Java applications.

Get Started
-----------

Learn how to install the driver, establish a connection to MongoDB, and begin
working with data in the :ref:`java-rs-getting-started` tutorial.

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

Learn how to create and configure a connection to a MongoDB deployment
in the :ref:`java-rs-connect` section.

Databases and Collections
-------------------------

Learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to work with MongoDB databases and collections
in the :ref:`java-rs-databases-coll` section.

Write Data to MongoDB
---------------------

Learn how you can write data to MongoDB in the :ref:`java-rs-write` section.

Read Data
---------

Learn how you can retrieve data from MongoDB in the :ref:`java-rs-read` section.

Optimize Queries with Indexes
-----------------------------

Learn how to work with common types of indexes in the :ref:`java-rs-indexes`
section.

Transform Your Data with Aggregation
------------------------------------

Learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform aggregation operations in the
:ref:`java-rs-aggregation` section.

Secure Your Data
----------------

Learn about ways you can authenticate your application and encrypt your data in
the :ref:`java-rs-security` section.

Configure Operations on Replica Sets

Learn how to work with specialized data formats and custom types in the
:ref:`java-rs-data-formats` section.

What's New
----------

For a list of new features and changes in each version, see the :ref:`<java-rs-whats-new>`
section.

Issues & Help
-------------

Learn how to report bugs, contribute to the driver, and find help in the
:ref:`<java-rs-issues-and-help>` section.

Compatibility
-------------

For compatibility tables that show the recommended {+driver-short+}
version to use for specific Java and {+mdb-server+} versions, see the
:ref:`java-rs-compatibility` section.

Upgrade Driver Versions
-----------------------

Learn about changes you must make to your application to upgrade driver
versions in the :ref:`<java-rs-upgrade-driver>` section.

API Documentation
-----------------

For detailed information about types and methods in the {+driver-short+}, see
the `API documentation <{+api-root+}/mongodb-driver-reactivestreams/>`__.

If you need to make synchronous calls between your application and MongoDB, use
the :driver:`MongoDB Java Driver </java/sync/current/>` instead of the
{+driver-short+}.
