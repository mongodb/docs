Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! MongoDB is an open-source,
document-oriented database designed for ease of development and
scaling.

The Manual introduces MongoDB and continues to describe the query

and application development patterns, among other topics relevant to
users and administrators of MongoDB. The Manual also has a thorough
