# Requirements

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

# Instructions

1) Download the license file for the desired version (for example, https://github.com/10gen/ops-manager-kubernetes/blob/1.19.1/licenses.csv).
2) Place the licenses.csv file in `/docs-k8s-operator/tools/license-tool/Î„`.
3) Change to the tool directory: `cd tools/license-tool/`.
4) Run the tool: `cargo run`.
5) Paste the output into the docs at `source/third-party-licenses.txt`.

# Troubleshooting

If you run into an error with `cargo run`, 
try adding the following text to `~/.carg/config`
(create this file if it does not exist):

```
[net]
git-fetch-with-cli = true
```
