  :setting:`mms.monitoring.agent.standbyCollectionFactor` configures the
  frequency at which the standby agents check to see if they have become
  the primary agent. By default, the standby agents check every 14
  seconds. See the
  :setting:`mms.monitoring.agent.standbyCollectionFactor` reference for
  details.

  |mms| promotes a standby agent to primary after not hearing from the
  current primary for at least the interval specified by
  :setting:`mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis`. The default
  delay is 90 seconds (90000 milliseconds), which is also the minimum.

  You can tune :setting:`mms.monitoring.agent.standbyCollectionFactor`
  and :setting:`mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis` by editing
  :ref:`conf-mms.properties`.
