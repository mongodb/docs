Prerequisite
------------

Get and Install the TLS Certificate on Each MongoDB Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquire a |tls| certificate for each host serving a MongoDB process.
This certificate must include the |fqdn| for the hostname of this
MongoDB host. The |fqdn| can be the Common Name or the Subject
Alternative Name of this host. You must install this |tls| certificate
on the MongoDB host.

Procedures
----------

.. important::
   
   You must complete:

   1. :ref:`Set Existing Deployments to Use TLS <set-existing-ssl>`,
      then
   2. :ref:`Enable TLS for the Project <set-project-ssl>`

   before you click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.

.. _set-existing-ssl:

Set Existing Deployments to Use |tls|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   With the :guilabel:`Client Certificate Mode` setting, you can set
   if the client must present a |tls| certificate to connect to the
   deployments in your project. If you enable |tls| for your
   project, all deployment must use |tls|.

If you wish to enable |tls| for existing MongoDB deployments in your
|mms| project:

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-existing-deployment.rst

.. _set-project-ssl:

Enable |tls| for the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-group.rst

- If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that used
  Automation, the {+mdbagent+} manages the |tls| settings.

- If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that did not
  use Automation but you had Backup Agents, Monitoring Agents, or
  both, you *can* set your *Backup Agent and Monitoring
  Agent-specific* settings during the Agent update or through the
  following procedure:

  1. Navigate to :guilabel:`Deployment` :icon-fa5:`arrow-right`
     :guilabel:`Agents` :icon-fa5:`arrow-right`
     :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings` :icon-fa5:`arrow-right`
     :guilabel:`Custom Configurations` :icon-fa5:`arrow-right`
     :guilabel:`Edit Custom Configuration`.

  2. Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt`.

  3. Under the :guilabel:`Backup Configurations` section:

     a. Type the desired
        :ref:`setting <mongodb-agent-backup-settings>`
        in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and its corresponding value
        in the :guilabel:`Value` box.

     #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
        :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

     #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

  4. Under the :guilabel:`Monitoring Configurations` section:

     a. Type the desired
        :ref:`setting <mongodb-agent-monitoring-settings>`
        in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and the corresponding value
        in the :guilabel:`Value` box.
