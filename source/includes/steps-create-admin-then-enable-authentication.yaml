title: Start MongoDB without access control.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: start-without-auth
pre: |
  For example, the following starts a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
  without access control.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
post: |
  For details on starting a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes` or
  :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-shard-cluster`.
---
stepnum: 2
title: Connect to the instance.
level: 4
ref: connect
pre: |
   For example, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the instance.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongo --port 27017 
post: |
   Specify additional command line options as appropriate to connect the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to your deployment, such as ``--host``.
---
stepnum: 3
title: Create the user administrator.
level: 4
ref: create-user-admin
pre: |
  Add a user with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role.
  For example, the following creates the user ``myUserAdmin`` on the
  ``admin`` database:
action:
  pre: |
    
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myUserAdmin",
        pwd: "abc123",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
      }
    )
---
title: Re-start the MongoDB instance with access control.
level: 4
stepnum: 4
ref: restart-with-auth
pre: |
  Re-start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with the ``--auth`` command
  line option or, if using a configuration file, the
  :setting:`security.authorization` setting.
  
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
---
title: Authenticate as the user administrator.
level: 4
stepnum: 5
ref: auth-as-admin
action:
  - pre: |
      Either connect a new :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the MongoDB
      instance with the ``-u <username>``, ``-p <password>``, and
      the ``--authenticationDatabase <database>``:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "abc123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"
    post: |
      The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell executes a number of commands at start
      up. As a result, when you log in as the user administrator, you may
      see authentication errors from one or more commands. You may ignore
      these errors, which are expected, because the
      :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role does not have permissions to
      run some of the start up commands.
  - pre: |
      Or, in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected without authentication,
      switch to the authentication database, and use :method:`db.auth()`
      method to authenticate:
    language: javascript
    code: |
         use admin
         db.auth("myUserAdmin", "abc123" )
