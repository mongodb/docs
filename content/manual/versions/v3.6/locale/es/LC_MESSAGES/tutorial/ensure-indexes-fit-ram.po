"Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the value of"
" the indexed field increments with every insert, and most queries select "
"recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the parts of the "
"index that hold the most recent or \"right-most\" values in RAM. This allows"
" for efficient index use for read and write operations and minimize the "
"amount of RAM required to support the index."
