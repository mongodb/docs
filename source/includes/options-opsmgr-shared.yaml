  string **must** include the authentication credentials for the
  :parameter:`authentication mechanism <authenticationMechanisms>` 
  used on the |application| database.

  See the following example connection strings:

  Replica Sets
    If you use a :term:`replica set` for the database's :doc:`backing
    instance </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`, specify the
    connection string using either:

    - The standard connection string format, or
    - The |dns| seedlist connection string format.

    Standard Connection String Format
      Specify all members of the replica set, as shown in the
      following example. If you omit the port number, |onprem| uses
      the default ``27017`` port for all hosts.

      .. code-block:: ini

         mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://db1.example.com:40000,db2.example.com:40000,db3.example.com:40000

      .. note::

         |onprem| does not require the :ref:`replicaSet
         <replica-set-options>` option in the |uri|.

    DNS Seedlist Connection String Format
      *Starting in {+onprem+} 4.4.*

      Specify the |dns| SRV record that describes your database's
      backing instance replica set. You must preface the connection
      string with ``mongodb+srv:`` instead of ``mongodb:``.

      .. code-block:: ini

         mongo.mongoUri=mongodb+srv://db.example.com/

      .. important::

         You must create a |dns| SRV record that |mms| can resolve to
         connect to the application database using the |DNS| seedlist
         string format.

         To learn how to create a |dns| SRV record, see :manual:`DNS
         Seedlist Connection Format
         </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`
         in the MongoDB Manual.

  Default MongoDB Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using the MongoDB ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or
    ``MONGODB-CR`` challenge-response mechanisms, the connection string
    must include authentication credentials. The |application| must
    authenticate as a MongoDB user with the following roles:

    - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`

    - :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase`.

    - :authrole:`clusterAdmin` if the database is a sharded cluster,
      otherwise :authrole:`clusterMonitor`

    Prefix the hostname with the MongoDB username and password in the
    form ``<username>:<password>@``

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodbuser1:password@mydb1.example.com:40000

  x.509 Certificate Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication, you
    must first add the value of the *subject* from the client
    certificate as a MongoDB user, as described in :manual:`Use x.509
    Certificates to Authenticate Clients
    </tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication>` in the MongoDB
    manual. The client certificate is contained in the PEM file you
    specify in the :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFile` setting. Once you
    have created the user, prefix the host specified in
    :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` with the name of the new user and append
    ``authMechanism=MONGODB-X509`` after the specified port:

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://<new_mongodb_user>@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=MONGODB-X509

  |ldap| Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using |ldap|, prefix the hostname with the
    MongoDB username and password in the form
    ``<username>:<password>@``, and append the
    ``authMechanism=PLAIN&authSource=$external`` options after the
    port:

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodbuser1:password@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=PLAIN&authSource=$external

  Kerberos Authentication
    For a MongoDB instance using Kerberos, prefix the hostname with the
    Kerberos user principal and specify the authentication mechanism,
    ``authMechanism=GSSAPI``, after the port.

    Kerberos user principal names have the form ``<username>@<KERBEROS
    REALM>``. You must escape the user principal, replacing symbols
    with the |url| encoded representation. A Kerberos user principal of
    ``username@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM`` would therefore become
    ``username%40REALM.EXAMPLE.COM``.

    .. code-block:: ini

       mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://username%40REALM.EXAMPLE.COM@mydb1.example.com:40000/?authMechanism=GSSAPI

    To enable Kerberos authentication between the |application| and the
    :ref:`backup-database`, review the following settings:

    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.conf`
    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.kdc`
    - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.realm`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.debug`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.keyTab`
    - :setting:`mms.kerberos.principal`
