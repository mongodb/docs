Each :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`, :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, and
:bic:`mongosqld </reference/mongosqld>` instance keeps an account of
its activity in its own log file. |service| retains the last 30 days
of :manual:`log messages </reference/log-messages>` and
:manual:`system event audit messages </reference/audit-message>`. The
Performance Advisor retains at most 7 days of logs. If you terminate a
{+cluster+}, the logs that {+cluster+} generated persist, and you can
download these logs at any point until the end of their retention periods.

.. note::

   ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}, {+Flex-cluster+}, and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} (deprecated)
   don't provide downloadable logs.

To learn about recommendations for auditing
and logging, including the events that we recommend auditing, see
:ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging-recs` in the {+atlas-arch-center+}.
