LangChain is an open-source framework that simplifies the creation of 
LLM applications through the use of "chains." Chains are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined for a variety of AI use cases, including
|rag|.

By integrating {+avs+} with LangChain, you can use 
|service| as a vector database and use {+avs+} to
implement |rag| by retrieving semantically similar documents 
from your data. To learn more about |rag|,
see :ref:`ai-key-concepts`.
