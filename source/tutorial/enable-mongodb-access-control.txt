Overview
--------

When you select an Authentication Mechanism for your |mms| group, this
enables access control for all the deployments in your |mms| group.

With access control enabled, MongoDB users must authenticate to the
MongoDB process. Once authenticated, the users only have privileges
granted by their assigned roles.

Considerations
--------------

With access control enabled, you must :doc:`create MongoDB users
</tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>` so that clients can access your
databases.

When you enable access control, |mms| automatically creates users for
the agents. The user created for the Automation Agent has privileges to
administrate and manage other users. As such, the first user you create
can be any type of user.

.. admonition:: Recommendation

   To avoid inconsistencies, use the |mms| interface to manage users
   and roles for MongoDB deployments.

For more information on MongoDB access control, see the
:manual:`Authentication </core/authentication>` and
:manual:`Authorization </core/authorization>` pages in the MongoDB
manual.

Enable MongoDB Access Control
-----------------------------

|mms| supports various authentication mechanisms.

You can select multiple available mechanisms.

See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication` for detailed
instructions for configuring the different authentication mechanisms.

Next Steps
----------

See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-mongodb-users` to create MongoDB users and
roles and assign privileges to those roles.
