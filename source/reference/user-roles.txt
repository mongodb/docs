User Roles

Overview
--------

User roles allow you to grant a user the set of privileges needed to
perform tasks. Roles also let you limit the user's access beyond the
resources and operations needed.

.. only:: hosted

   If you use LDAP authentication for MMS, you must create LDAP groups for each
   available role described below then assign users to LDAP groups. There is no
   round trip synchronization between your LDAP server and MMS.

To assign user roles, see :ref:`assigning-roles-to-users`. You cannot
assign your own roles.
