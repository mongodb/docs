title: "Populate all |onprem| servers with the necessary MongoDB binaries and archives."
ref: populate-with-binaries
content: |
  On *all* your |onprem| servers, including those with enabled Backup Daemons:

  a. Copy all of the archived binaries to the directory specified in
     :setting:`Versions Directory`. The versions directory stores all of
     the archived and extracted MongoDB binaries |onprem| needs to install
     and upgrade MongoDB deployments.

     By default, the versions directory is found in the following
     locations on the following platforms.
      
     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Operating System
          - Versions Directory Default Path

        * - RHEL, Ubuntu
          - 
            .. code-block:: sh

               /opt/mongodb/mms/mongodb-releases

        * - Linux Archive
          - 
            .. code-block:: sh
           
               <userSelected>/mongodb-releases
 
        * - Windows
          - 
            .. code-block:: powershell
           
               C:\MMSData\MongoDBReleases

     To specify a different path for your versions directory, use the
     :setting:`Versions Directory` setting on your |onprem| application.

  #. Navigate to the versions directory.

  #. Extract all of the archived binaries.

     .. note:: 
        Automation uses the archived binaries; Backup uses the
        extracted binaries. Both must be available in the versions directory.

title: "Ensure that the |mms| user can read files in the Versions Directory. (Linux only)"
ref: mongodb-mms-as-owner
content: |

  The ``mongodb-mms`` user needs the read permissions to the versions
  directory.

  .. example::

     On a Linux platform, you should issue the ``chown`` command to change
     ownership for **all** files in the directory to ``mongodb-mms``:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo chown -R mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms <path-to-the-versions-directory>

     Set the permissions to:

     * ``read`` and ``write`` for the owner
     * ``read`` for the group 
     * ``none`` for all

     This enables |mms| can correctly read and extract the archived binaries.

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo chmod -R 640 <path-to-the-versions-directory>

     The resulting listing of the versions directory should look like this:

     .. code-block:: sh

        -rw-r----- 1 mongodb-mms mongodb-mms 116513825 Apr 27 15:06 mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.9.tgz

title: "Download the version manifest for |onprem|."
ref: download-version-manifest
content: |

   The version manifest provides |onprem| with a list of all released
   MongoDB versions available to your |onprem| servers.

   a. From a computer that can access both the Internet and the |onprem|
      servers, download the version manifest from |manifestlink|.

   b. Open the manifest JSON file.

   c. Select all of the contents and copy them to the clipboard.
   
   As |company| releases new versions of MongoDB, you must update the
   version manifest.

  a. In |onprem|, click :guilabel:`Back To Group` in the upper left to exit

     then :guilabel:`Version Manager`.

  d. Select the checkboxes for the versions of MongoDB that you have made
     available on the |application| server.
post: |

  .. important::
     
     For the selected versions, ensure that you have downloaded and
     placed both the archived and extracted binaries in the versions
     directory. Otherwise, |onprem| fails a pre-flight check when
     starting in :guilabel:`Local Mode`. See also :ref:`Start Ops
     Manager When All Versions Are Not Downloaded
     <fix-local-mode-start-failure>`.
