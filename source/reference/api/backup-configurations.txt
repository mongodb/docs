Overview
--------

A backup configuration determines the settings used to back up a sharded cluster
or replica set. The ``backupConfigs`` resource lets you view and update backup
configurations. In certain cases, you can also create backup configurations, as
described in the :ref:`update-backup-config-via-api` section.
The ``backupConfigs`` resource supports only the ``GET`` and ``PATCH`` methods.

To update or create a backup configuration, you must issue the request from an
IP address on your user account's :ref:`whitelist
<whitelist-for-api-operations>`. The ``backupConfigs`` resource accepts
``PATCH`` requests only from whitelisted IP addresses.

Endpoints
---------

Get All Backup Configurations for a Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

   GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/backupConfigs

Get a Single Backup Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get a single backup configuration by cluster ID. ``CLUSTER-ID`` must be
the ID of either a replica set or a sharded cluster.

.. code-block:: none

   GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/backupConfigs/CLUSTER-ID

.. _update-backup-config-via-api:

Update a Backup Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the state of an existing backup configuration you use the ``PATCH`` method.
Send **only those fields** where you will change the value.

You **cannot** modify the ``username`` and ``password`` fields for a replica
set or sharded cluster that is managed by |mms| Automation.

``PATCH`` changes are generally asynchronous and will result in a response
status code of ``202 (Accepted)``. Additionally, if you issue a ``GET``
request for a backup configuration after a successful ``PATCH``, the
returned entity may not immediately reflect the update given the
asynchronous nature of these state transitions.

.. code-block:: none

   PATCH /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/backupConfigs/CLUSTER-ID

When modifying the ``statusName`` property, these are the acceptable
transitions:

- ``STARTED``: valid if the current status is ``STOPPED`` or
  ``INACTIVE``.

- ``STOPPED``: valid if the current status is ``STARTED``.

- ``TERMINATING``: valid if the current status is ``STOPPED``.

You **cannot** change the ``statusName`` to ``INACTIVE`` or
``PROVISIONING``.

Every :term:`sharded cluster` and :term:`replica set` has a backup configuration that is
set to ``INACTIVE`` by default. If you :doc:`have already activated
Backup for your account </tutorial/enable-backup>`, then you can back up
a cluster or replica set through the API by changing the ``statusName``
property to ``STARTED``.

   Rotate and Retrieve the KMIP Master Key
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   MongoDB recommends periodically rotating the KMIP master key used
   to encrypt backup data.  Use the ``PUT`` method with the following
   endpoint to rotate the KMIP master key.  Issue one ``PUT`` request
   for each shard and another ``PUT`` request for the config server
   replica set.

   .. code-block:: none

      PUT /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/backupConfigs/CLUSTER-ID/encryptionKey

   Use the ``GET`` method with the same endpoint to retrieve the ID of the
   current KMIP master key.

   .. code-block:: none

      GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/backupConfigs/CLUSTER-ID/encryptionKey 


Sample Entity
-------------

If you issue a ``PATCH`` request, send only those fields whose values are
being changed.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 10 10 80
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Name
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``groupId``
        - string
        - ID of the group that owns this backup configuration.

      * - ``clusterId``
        - string
        - ID of the cluster that this backup configuration is for.

      * - ``statusName``
        - string
        - The current (or desired) status of the backup configuration. Possible
          values are:

          - ``INACTIVE``
          - ``PROVISIONING``
          - ``STARTED``
          - ``STOPPED``
          - ``TERMINATING``

      * - ``storageEngineName``
        - string
        - The storage engine used for the backup. Possible values are:

          - ``MEMORY_MAPPED``
          - ``WIRED_TIGER``

      * - ``authMechanismName``
        - string
        - The name of the authentication mechanism to use when connecting to the
          sync source database. Only present when using authentication. Possible
          values are:

          .. include:: /includes/possibleValues-api-authMechanismName.rst

      * - ``username``
        - string
        - The username to use to connect to the sync source
          database. Only present when backing up :program:`mongod`
          instances that require clients to authenticate.

          You can send this field to |mms| only when updating the backup
          configuration for a replica set or sharded cluster that is **not**
          managed by |mms| Automation.

      * - ``password``
        - string
        - The password to use to connect to the sync source
          database. Only present when backup the :program:`mongod`
          instances that require clients to authenticate.
          ``GET`` requests do *not* include this field.

          You can send this field to |mms| only when updating the backup
          configuration for a replica set or sharded cluster that is **not**
          managed by |mms| Automation.

      * - ``encryptionEnabled``
        - boolean
        - Specifies whether encryption is enabled for the backup configuration.
          You must include the ``syncSource`` field when enabling encryption
          for a backup configuration. For existing backups in a group, enabling
          encryption requires an initial backup sync to recreate the backups’
          head databases. See :doc:`Encrypted Backup Snapshots 
          </tutorial/encrypt-snapshots>` for more information, including
          a list of prerequisites.

      * - ``encryptionKeyUUID``
        - string
        - The ID of the KMIP master key. This key is used to encrypt
          and restore the head databases for an encrypted backup.

      * - ``sslEnabled``
        - boolean
        - Is SSL enabled for the sync source database?

      * - ``syncSource``
        - string
        - The :program:`mongod` instance to get backup data
          from. Possible values are either a specific hostname or one of:
          ``PRIMARY`` and ``SECONDARY``. This field is only used when
          updating a backup configuration. It is not returned by a
          ``GET`` request.

      * - ``provisioned``
        - boolean
        - Reports if |mms| has provisioned the resources needed to store a backup. This
          field is only present when the amount of data to be backed up exceeds a
          certain threshold.

      * - ``excludedNamespaces``
        - string array
        - A list of database names and collection names to omit from the
          backup. Each string is a namespace in the form of ``<database>`` or
          ``<database>.<collection>``. If this field is present the
          ``includedNamespaces`` field cannot be present.

          You must send the new full list of excluded namespaces, including any
          that were already listed.

          If the new list removes any namespaces from the previous list, you must
          also set the ``syncSource`` field, as the removal of an excluded
          namespace necessitates a full resync. Without the ``syncSource`` field,
          the request will fail.

          If the new list only adds to the previous list, you do not need to set
          ``syncSource``.

      * - ``includedNamespaces``
        - string array
        - A list of database names and collection names to include in the
          backup. Each string is a namespace in the form of ``<database>``
          or ``<database>.<collection>``. Any namespace **not listed** in this
          array **will not be backed up**. If this field is present the
          ``excludedNamespaces`` field cannot be present.

          You must send the new full list of included namespaces, including any
          that were already listed.

          If the new list adds any namespaces to the previous list, you must
          also set the ``syncSource`` field, as the addition of an included
          namespace necessitates a full resync. Without the ``syncSource`` field,
          the request will fail.

          If the new list only removes namespaces from the previous list, you do
          not need to set ``syncSource``.
