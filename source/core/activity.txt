Activity Tab
============

Overview
--------

The :guilabel:`Activity` tab displays event notifications, including alert
messages. Use the tab's :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page to configure
alerts.

The Activity Tab Pages
----------------------

The :guilabel:`Activity` tab provides these pages:

- **All Activity** displays event messages, including alerts. You can
  download the event messages by clicking the gear icon on this page.

- **Closed Alerts** displays alerts that users have closed explicitly or
  where the metric has dropped below the threshold of the alert.

- **Alert Settings** displays alert configurations. An alert configuration
  defines a set of conditions and metrics that trigger an alert. From this
  page you can create, edit, and delete alerts. MMS creates certain alert
  configurations automatically.
