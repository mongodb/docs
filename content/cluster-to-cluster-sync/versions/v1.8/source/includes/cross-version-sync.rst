Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can perform version migration from 
certain lower major version source clusters to certain higher major
version destination clusters. 

Cross-version migration requires additional preparation and
configuration when migrating from a pre-6.0 release. To perform a cross-version 
migration from a pre-6.0 version of the MongoDB Server using
``mongosync``, please `contact <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your
account team to inquire about Professional Services.
