title: Use the mongodump command to dump a single database.
step: 1
ref: dump-database
action:
  - pre: |
      Use the unpacked snapshot restore directory as the :ref:`dpath` switch
      and the single database name as the :ref:`db` switch in the
      :program:`mongodump` command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongodump --dbpath <path_to_unpacked_restore_directory> --db <database_of_interest>

title: Use the mongorestore command to import the single database dump.
step: 2
ref: import-database
action:
  - pre: |
      You also can specify the :ref:`db` switch. However, the :ref:`db` switch
      is optional because the dump contains only the single database. Enter
      this :program:`mongorestore` command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongodump --dbpath <path_to_unpacked_restore_directory> --db <database_of_interest>
  - post: |
      You also may specify the :ref:`--drop` switch to drop all collections
      from the target database before you restore them from the dumped backup.
