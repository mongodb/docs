     * - Field
       - Action

     * - :guilabel:`Enable TLS`
       - Toggle this slider to :guilabel:`Yes`.

     * - :guilabel:`TLS CA File Path`
       - The |tls| |certauth| file is a ``.pem``-format certificate
         file that contains the root certificate chain from the
         |certauth|. The {+mdbagent+} uses this same |certauth| file
         to connect to every item in your deployment.

         Type the file path to the |tls| |certauth| file on every host
         running a MongoDB process:

         - Type the file path on all Linux hosts in the first box.

         - Type the file path on all Windows hosts in the second box.

         This enables the :setting:`net.tls.CAFile` setting for the
         MongoDB processes in the project.

     * - :guilabel:`Client Certificate Mode`
       - Specify whether client |tls| certificates are optional or
         required for every MongoDB deployment in the project.

            * - :guilabel:`OPTIONAL`
              - You may choose which MongoDB deployments in this
                project use |tls|\-encrypted network connections.

                   * - |mongod| :parameter:`tlsMode`
                     - All Agents Connect with |tls|

                   * - ``allowTls``, ``preferTls``, or ``requireTls``
                     - Yes

                   * - ``None``
                     - No

            * - :guilabel:`REQUIRED`
              - Every MongoDB deployment in this project starts with
                |tls|\-encrypted network connections. All Agents
                must use |tls| to connect to any MongoDB
                deployment.

  a. In the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` list, click the same
     authentication mechanisms that you did for the project.

  b. Follow the procedure to configure the {+mdbagent+} to use that
     authentication method:

     - :doc:`SCRAM-SHA </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-scram>`
     - :doc:`X.509 Certificates </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-x509>`
     - :doc:`LDAP </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap>`
     - :doc:`Kerberos </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-kerberos>`

  .. note::

     If you had |tls| certificates for Legacy Agents, see
     **What if I had TLS certificates for Legacy Backup or Monitoring
     Agents?** at the end of this procedure for guidance.
