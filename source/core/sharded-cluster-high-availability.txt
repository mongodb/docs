A :ref:`production <sharding-production-architecture>` :term:`cluster`
has no single point of failure. This section introduces the
availability concerns for MongoDB deployments in general and
highlights potential failure scenarios and available resolutions.

Application Servers or :program:`mongos` Instances Become Unavailable
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If each application server has its own :program:`mongos` instance, other
application servers can continue to access the database. Furthermore,
:program:`mongos` instances do not maintain persistent state, and they
can restart and become unavailable without losing any state or data.
When a :program:`mongos` instance starts, it retrieves a copy of the
:term:`config database` and can begin routing queries.

A Single :program:`mongod` Becomes Unavailable in a Shard
---------------------------------------------------------

:doc:`Replica sets </replication>` provide high availability for shards.
If the unavailable :program:`mongod` is a :term:`primary`, then the
replica set will :ref:`elect <replica-set-elections>` a new primary. If
the unavailable :program:`mongod` is a :term:`secondary`, and it
disconnects the primary and secondary will continue to hold all data. In
a three member replica set, even if a single member of the set
experiences catastrophic failure, two other members have full copies of
the data. [#recovery-window]_

Always investigate availability interruptions and failures. If a system
is unrecoverable, replace it and create a new member of the replica set
as soon as possible to replace the lost redundancy.

.. [#recovery-window] If an unavailable secondary becomes available
   while it still has current oplog entries, it can catch up to the
   latest state of the set using the normal :term:`replication process
   <sync>`; otherwise, it must perform an :term:`initial sync`.

All Members of a Shard Become Unavailable
-----------------------------------------

If all members of a replica set shard are unavailable, all data
held in that shard is unavailable. However, the data on all other shards
will remain available, and it is possible to read and write data to the
other shards. However, your application must be able to deal with
partial results, and you should investigate the cause of the
interruption and attempt to recover the shard as soon as possible.

.. _sharding-config-servers-and-availability:

A Config Server Replica Set Member Become Unavailable
-----------------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   .. include:: /includes/fact-mirrored-config-servers-deprecated.rst

:doc:`Replica sets </replication>` provide high availability for the
config servers. If an unavailable config server is a :term:`primary`,
then the replica set will :ref:`elect <replica-set-elections>` a new
primary.

If the replica set config server loses its primary and cannot elect a
primary, the cluster's metadata becomes *read only*. You can still read
and write data from the shards, but no :ref:`chunk migration
<sharding-balancing>` or :doc:`chunk splits
</tutorial/split-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` will occur until a primary
is available. If all config databases become unavailable, the cluster can
become inoperable.

Renaming Mirrored Config Servers and Cluster Availability
---------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-rename-config-servers-requires-cluster-restart.rst

To avoid downtime when renaming config servers, use DNS names
unrelated to physical or virtual hostnames to refer to your
:ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`.

Generally, refer to each config server using the DNS alias (e.g. a
CNAME record). When specifying the config server connection string to
:program:`mongos`, use these names. These records make it possible to
change the IP address or rename config servers without changing the
connection string and without having to restart the entire cluster.

Shard Keys and Cluster Availability
-----------------------------------

The most important consideration when choosing a :term:`shard key`
are:

- to ensure that MongoDB will be able to distribute data evenly among
  shards, and

- to scale writes across the cluster, and

- to ensure that :program:`mongos` can isolate most queries to a specific
  :program:`mongod`.

Furthermore:

- Each shard should be a :term:`replica set`, if a specific
  :program:`mongod` instance fails, the replica set members will elect
  another to be :term:`primary` and continue operation. However, if an
  entire shard is unreachable or fails for some reason, that data will
  be unavailable.

- If the shard key allows the :program:`mongos` to isolate most
  operations to a single shard, then the failure of a single shard
  will only render *some* data unavailable.

- If your shard key distributes data required for every operation
  throughout the cluster, then the failure of the entire shard will
  render the entire cluster unavailable.

In essence, this concern for reliability simply underscores the
importance of choosing a shard key that isolates query operations to a
single shard.

.. _config-database-string-error:

Config Database String Error
----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, config servers can be deployed as replica sets
   by default. The :program:`mongos` instances for the sharded cluster
   must specify the same config server replica set name but can specify
   hostname and port of different members of the replica set.

   If using the deprecated topology of three mirrored :program:`mongod`
   instances for config servers, :program:`mongos` instances in a sharded
   cluster must specify identical :setting:`~sharding.configDB` string.

Cursor Fails Because of Stale Config Data
-----------------------------------------

.. DOCS-425

A query returns the following warning when one or more of the
:program:`mongos` instances has not yet updated its cache of the
cluster's metadata from the :term:`config database`:

.. code-block:: none

   could not initialize cursor across all shards because : stale config detected

This warning *should* not propagate back to your application. The
warning will repeat until all the :program:`mongos` instances refresh
their caches. To force an instance to refresh its cache, run the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command.
