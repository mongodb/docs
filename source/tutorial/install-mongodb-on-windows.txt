The following tutorial uses the MongoDB installer ``.msi`` to install
|mdb-edition| {+version+} on Windows. To install using the
``msiexec.exe`` from the command line (``cmd.exe``), see
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended` instead.

Prerequisites
-------------

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB requires x86-64 architecture and supports the following:

- Windows 7/Server 2008 R2

- Windows 8/2012 R2 and later

See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more information.

Windows Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- Windows 2012 Server and Windows 10 need 
  `KB2999226 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`__ 
  to provide Universal C Runtime support for Windows.

- Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 need 
  `KB2731284 <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`__ to resolve
  an issue with memory mapped files on Windows.

Production Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
:doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

Install |mdb-edition|
---------------------

.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on Azure using Atlas, our fully-managed
   database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything from a free
   sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster. `Set up a free
   cluster now
   <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?utm_source=install-mongodb-on-windows&utm_campaign=20-docs-in-20-days&utm_medium=docs>`_.
   
You can install using the MongoDB Installer wizard. The installation process installs both the MongoDB binaries as well as
the default :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>` :file:`<install
directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

Run |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, you can install and configure MongoDB as a
:guilabel:`Windows Service` during the install, and the MongoDB service
is started upon successful installation. MongoDB is configured using
the configuration file :file:`<install directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

Start |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start/restart the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Start`.

Stop |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.


#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

Remove |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB

Run |mdb-edition| from the Command Interpreter
------------------------------------------------

You can run |mdb-edition| from the `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) instead of as a service.
 
Open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`.
 
.. important::

   You must open the command interpreter as an
   :guilabel:`Administrator`.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), the
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within the :ref:`same release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 4.0.1 to 4.0.2).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 4.0 to 4.2) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute
paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add 
``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then
omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
