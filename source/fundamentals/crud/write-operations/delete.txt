Delete a Document

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

In this section, we show you how to call the write operations to **remove**
documents from a collection in your MongoDB database.

Delete
------

If you want to remove existing documents from a collection, you can
use ``deleteOne()`` to remove one document or ``deleteMany()`` for one or
more documents. These methods accept a query document that matches the
documents you want to delete.

You can specify the document or documents to be deleted by the
``deleteOne()`` or ``deleteMany()`` write operations in a JSON object as
follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const doc = {
     pageViews: {
       $lt: 10,
       $gt: 32768
     }
   };

To delete the first matching document using the ``deleteOne()`` method or
to delete all matching documents using the ``deleteMany()`` method, pass the
document as the method parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const deleteResult = await collection.deleteOne(doc);
   const deleteManyResult = await collection.deleteMany(doc);

You can print the number of documents deleted by the operation by
accessing the ``deletedCount`` field of the result for each of the
method calls above as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   console.dir(deleteResult.deletedCount);
   console.dir(deleteManyResult.deletedCount);

Upon successful delete, these statements should print the number of documents
deleted by the associated operation.

For fully runnable examples and additional information on the available
options, see our usage examples for
