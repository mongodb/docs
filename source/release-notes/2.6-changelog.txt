Querying
~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`SERVER-13566` Using the OplogReplay flag with extra predicates can yield incorrect results
- :issue:`SERVER-13611` Missing sort order for compound index leads to unnecessary in-memory sort
- :issue:`SERVER-13618` Optimization for sorted $in queries not applied to reverse sort order
