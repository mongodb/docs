Recommended Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While MongoDB supports a variety of platforms, the following operating
systems are recommended for production use:

- Amazon Linux 2
- Debian 9 and 10
- RHEL / CentOS 6, 7, and 8
- SLES 12 and 15
- Ubuntu LTS 16.04 and 18.04
- Windows Server 2016 and 2019

.. seealso:: :ref:`prod-notes-platform-considerations`

Use the Latest Stable Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure you have the latest stable release.

All MongoDB releases are available on the `MongoDB Download Center`_
page. The `MongoDB Download Center`_ page is a good place to verify the
current stable release, even if you are installing via a package
manager.

For other MongoDB products, refer either to the `MongoDB Download Center`_
page or their `respective documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/?tck=docs_server>`_.

.. _`MongoDB Download Center`: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server

MongoDB ``dbPath``
------------------

The files in the :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory must correspond
to the configured :term:`storage engine`. :binary:`~bin.mongod` will not start if
:setting:`~storage.dbPath` contains data files created by a storage
engine other than the one specified by :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>`.

:binary:`~bin.mongod` must possess read and write permissions for the specified
:setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

.. _prod-notes-concurrency:

Concurrency
-----------

.. _prod-notes-wired-tiger-concurrency:

WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` supports concurrent access by
readers and writers to the documents in a collection. Clients can read
documents while write operations are in progress, and multiple threads
can modify different documents in a collection at the same time.

.. seealso:: :ref:`prod-notes-ram` provides information about how WiredTiger
   takes advantage of multiple CPU cores and how to improve operation
   throughput.


Data Consistency
----------------

Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal`.
Journaling guarantees that MongoDB can quickly recover :doc:`write
operations </crud>` that were written to the journal
but not written to data files in cases where :binary:`~bin.mongod`
terminated due to a crash or other serious failure.

Leave journaling enabled in order to ensure that :binary:`~bin.mongod` will
be able to recover its data files and keep the data files in a valid
state following a crash. See :doc:`Journaling </core/journaling/>` for
more information.

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/introduction-write-concern.rst

See the :doc:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern>` document for more
information about choosing an appropriate write concern level for your
deployment.

Networking
----------

Use Trusted Networking Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always run MongoDB in a *trusted environment*, with network rules that
prevent access from *all* unknown machines, systems, and networks. As
with any sensitive system that is dependent on network access, your
MongoDB deployment should only be accessible to specific systems that
require access, such as application servers, monitoring services, and
other MongoDB components.

.. important::
   By default, :doc:`authorization </core/authorization>` is not
   enabled, and :binary:`~bin.mongod` assumes a trusted environment. Enable
   :setting:`~security.authorization` mode as needed. For more
   information on authentication mechanisms supported in MongoDB as
   well as authorization in MongoDB, see :doc:`/core/authentication`
   and :doc:`/core/authorization`.

For additional information and considerations on security, refer to the
documents in the :doc:`Security Section </security>`, specifically:

- :doc:`/administration/security-checklist`
- :doc:`/core/security-hardening`

For Windows users, consider the `Windows Server Technet Article on TCP
Configuration <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349797.aspx>`_
when deploying MongoDB on Windows.

Disable HTTP Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

Earlier versions of MongoDB provide an HTTP interface to check the status of the server
and, optionally, run queries. The HTTP interface is disabled by default. Do
not enable the HTTP interface in production environments.

.. _prod-notes-connection-pools:

Manage Connection Pool Sizes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid overloading the connection resources of a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance by adjusting the connection pool size to suit
your use case. Start at 110-115% of the typical number of current database
requests, and modify the connection pool size as needed. Refer to the
:ref:`connection-pool-options` for adjusting the connection pool size.

The :dbcommand:`connPoolStats` command returns information regarding
the number of open connections to the current database for
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in sharded clusters.

See also :ref:`prod-notes-ram`.

Hardware Considerations
-----------------------

MongoDB is designed specifically with commodity hardware in mind and
has few hardware requirements or limitations. MongoDB's core components
run on little-endian hardware, primarily x86/x86_64 processors. Client
libraries (i.e. drivers) can run on big or little endian systems.

.. _prod-notes-ram:

Allocate Sufficient RAM and CPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At a minimum, ensure that each :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance has access to two real cores or
one multi-core physical CPU.

WiredTiger
``````````

The :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine is multithreaded and can take advantage
of additional CPU cores. Specifically, the total number of active threads
(i.e. concurrent operations) relative to the number of available CPUs can impact
performance:

- Throughput *increases* as the number of concurrent active operations
  increases up to the number of CPUs.

- Throughput *decreases* as the number of concurrent active operations
  exceeds the number of CPUs by some threshold amount.

The threshold depends on your application. You can determine the
optimum number of concurrent active operations for your application by
experimenting and measuring throughput. The output from
:binary:`~bin.mongostat` provides statistics on the number of active
reads/writes in the (``ar|aw``) column.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-configure-cache.rst

Compression and Encryption
``````````````````````````

When using encryption, CPUs equipped with AES-NI instruction-set
extensions show significant performance advantages.
If you are using MongoDB Enterprise with the
:ref:`encrypted-storage-engine`, choose a CPU that supports AES-NI for
better performance.

.. seealso:: :ref:`prod-notes-concurrency`

Use Solid State Disks (SSDs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB has good results and a good price-performance ratio with
SATA SSD (Solid State Disk).

Use SSD if available and economical.

Commodity (SATA) spinning drives are often a good option, as the
random I/O performance increase with more expensive spinning drives
is not that dramatic (only on the order of 2x). Using SSDs or
increasing RAM may be more effective in increasing I/O throughput.

.. _production-numa:

MongoDB and NUMA Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running MongoDB on a system with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) can
cause a number of operational problems, including slow performance for
periods of time and high system process usage.

When running MongoDB servers and clients on NUMA hardware, you should configure
a memory interleave policy so that the host behaves in a non-NUMA fashion.
MongoDB checks NUMA settings on start up when deployed on Linux (since version
2.0) and Windows (since version 2.6) machines. If the
NUMA configuration may degrade performance, MongoDB prints a warning.

.. seealso::

   - `The MySQL "swap insanity" problem and the effects of NUMA
     <http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/>`_
     post, which describes the effects of
     NUMA on databases. The post introduces NUMA and its goals, and
     illustrates how these goals are not compatible with production
     databases. Although the blog post addresses the impact of NUMA for
     MySQL, the issues for MongoDB are similar.

   - `NUMA: An Overview <https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2513149>`_.

Configuring NUMA on Windows
```````````````````````````

On Windows, memory interleaving must be enabled through the machine's BIOS.
Consult your system documentation for details.

Configuring NUMA on Linux
`````````````````````````

On Linux, you must disable *zone reclaim* and also ensure that your
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances are started by
``numactl``, which is generally configured through your platform's init
system. You must perform both of these operations to properly disable
NUMA for use with MongoDB.

#. Disable *zone reclaim* with one of the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo sysctl -w vm.zone_reclaim_mode=0

#. Ensure that :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` are
   started by ``numactl``. This is generally configured through your
   platform's init system. Run the following command to determine which
   init system is in use on your platform:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ps --no-headers -o comm 1

   - If "``systemd``", your platform uses the **systemd** init
     system, and you *must* follow the steps in the **systemd** tab
     below to edit your MongoDB service file(s).

   - If "``init``", your platform uses the *SysV Init* system, and you
     *do not* need to perform this step. The default MongoDB init script
     for SysV Init includes the necessary steps to start MongoDB
     instances via ``numactl`` by default.

   - If you manage your own init scripts (i.e. you are not using either
     of these init systems), you *must* follow the steps in the
     **Custom init scripts** tab below to edit your custom init
     script(s).

     |

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: systemd
         :tabid: systemd-numa-steps

         You must use ``numactl`` to start each of your
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, including all
         :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`,
         :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and clients. Edit the default
         **systemd** service file for each as follows:

         #. Copy the default MongoDB service file:

            .. code-block:: sh

               sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service /etc/systemd/system/

         #. Edit the ``/etc/systemd/system/mongod.service`` file, and
            update the ``ExecStart`` statement to begin with:

            .. code-block:: sh

               /usr/bin/numactl --interleave=all

            .. example::

               If your existing ``ExecStart`` statement reads:

               .. code-block:: sh
                  :copyable: false

                  ExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

               Update that statement to read:

               .. code-block:: sh
                  :copyable: false

                  ExecStart=/usr/bin/numactl --interleave=all /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

         #. Apply the change to ``systemd``:

            .. code-block:: sh

               sudo systemctl daemon-reload

         #. Restart any running ``mongod`` instances:

            .. code-block:: sh

               sudo systemctl stop mongod
               sudo systemctl start mongod

         #. If applicable, repeat these steps for any
            :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

      .. tab:: Custom init scripts
         :tabid: custom-scripts-numa-steps

         You must use ``numactl`` to start each of your
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, including all
         :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`,
         :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and clients.

         #. Install ``numactl`` for your platform if not already
            installed. Refer to the documentation for your operating
            system for information on installing the ``numactl``
            package.

         #. Configure each of your custom init scripts to start each
            MongoDB instance via ``numactl``:

            .. code-block:: sh

               numactl --interleave=all <path> <options>

            Where ``<path>`` is the path to the program you are starting
            and ``<options>`` are any optional arguments to pass to that
            program.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh
                  :copyable: false

                  numactl --interleave=all /usr/local/bin/mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf

For more information, see the `Documentation for /proc/sys/vm/*
<http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt>`_.

Disk and Storage Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swap
````

MongoDB performs best where swapping can be avoided or kept to a
minimum, as retrieving data from swap will always be slower
than accessing data in RAM. However, if the system hosting MongoDB runs
out of RAM, swapping can prevent the Linux OOM Killer from terminating
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

Generally, you should choose one of the following swap strategies:

#. Assign swap space on your system, and configure the kernel to only
   permit swapping under high memory load, or
#. Do not assign swap space on your system, and configure the kernel to
   disable swapping entirely

See :ref:`Set vm.swappiness <set-swappiness>` for instructions on
configuring swap on your Linux system following these guidelines.

.. note::

   If your MongoDB instance is hosted on a system that also runs other
   software, such as a webserver, you should choose the first swap
   strategy. Do *not* disable swap in this case. If possible, it is
   highly recommended that you run MongoDB on its own dedicated system.

RAID
````

For optimal performance in terms of the storage layer, use disks
backed by RAID-10. RAID-5 and RAID-6 do not typically provide
sufficient performance to support a MongoDB deployment.

.. _production-nfs:

Remote Filesystems
``````````````````

With the WiredTiger storage engine, WiredTiger objects may be stored on
remote file systems if the remote file system conforms to ISO/IEC
9945-1:1996 (POSIX.1). Because remote file systems are often slower
than local file systems, using a remote file system for storage may
degrade performance.

If you decide to use NFS, add the following NFS options to your
``/etc/fstab`` file: ``bg``, ``nolock``, and ``noatime``.

Separate Components onto Different Storage Devices
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

For improved performance, consider separating your database's data,
journal, and logs onto different storage devices, based on your application's
access and write pattern. Mount the components as separate filesystems
and use symbolic links to map each component's path to the device
storing it.

For the WiredTiger storage engine, you can also store the indexes on a
different storage device. See
:setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.directoryForIndexes`.

.. note::

   Using different storage devices will affect your ability to create
   snapshot-style backups of your data, since the files will be on
   different devices and volumes.

.. _virtualized-disks-scheduling:

Scheduling
``````````

Scheduling for Virtual or Cloud Hosted Devices
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For local block devices attached to a virtual machine instance via
the hypervisor or hosted by a cloud hosting provider, the guest operating system
should use a *noop* scheduler for best performance. The
*noop* scheduler allows the operating system to defer I/O scheduling to
the underlying hypervisor.

Scheduling for Physical Servers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For physical servers, the operating system should use a *deadline*
scheduler. The *deadline* scheduler caps maximum latency per request
and maintains a good disk throughput that is best for disk-intensive
database applications.

Architecture
------------

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :doc:`Replica Set Architectures </core/replica-set-architectures>`
document for an overview of architectural considerations for replica
set deployments.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`Sharded Cluster Production Architecture
</core/sharded-cluster-components>` for an
overview of recommended sharded cluster architectures for production
deployments.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/administration/production-checklist-development`

Compression
-----------

WiredTiger can compress collection data using one of the following
compression library:

- :term:`snappy`
      Provides a lower compression rate than ``zlib`` or
      ``zstd`` but has a lower CPU cost than either.

- :term:`zlib`
      Provides better compression rate than ``snappy`` but has a
      higher CPU cost than both ``snappy`` and ``zstd``.

- :term:`zstd` (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2) 
      Provides better compression rate than both ``snappy`` and
      ``zlib`` and has a lower CPU cost than ``zlib``.

By default, WiredTiger uses :term:`snappy` compression library. To
change the compression setting, see
:setting:`storage.wiredTiger.collectionConfig.blockCompressor`.

WiredTiger uses :term:`prefix compression` on all indexes by default.

Clock Synchronization
---------------------

MongoDB :doc:`components </reference/program>` keep logical clocks for
supporting time-dependent operations. Using `NTP <http://www.ntp.org/>`_
to synchronize host machine clocks mitigates the risk of clock drift
between components. Clock drift between components increases the
likelihood of incorrect or abnormal behavior of time-dependent
operations like the following:

- If the underlying system clock of any given MongoDB
  component drifts a year or more from other components in the same
  deployment, communication between those members may become unreliable
  or halt altogether.

  The :parameter:`maxAcceptableLogicalClockDriftSecs` parameter controls
  the amount of acceptable clock drift between components. Clusters with
  a lower value of ``maxAcceptableLogicalClockDriftSecs`` have a
  correspondingly lower tolerance for clock drift.

- Two cluster members with different system clocks may return 
  different values for operations that return the current 
  cluster or system time, such as :method:`Date()`, 
  :variable:`NOW`, and :variable:`CLUSTER_TIME`.

- Features which rely on timekeeping may have inconsistent or
  unpredictable behavior in clusters with clock drift between MongoDB
  components. 
  
  For example, :ref:`TTL indexes <index-feature-ttl>` rely
  on the system clock to calculate when to delete a given document. If
  two members have different system clock times, each member could
  delete a given document covered by the TTL index at a different
  time. Since :ref:`sessions` use TTL indexes to control their
  lifespan, clock drift could result in inconsistent or unpredictable
  session timeout behavior.

NTP synchronization is required for deployments running MongoDB lower
than ``3.4.6`` or ``3.2.17`` with the Wired Tiger storage engine, where
clock drift could lead to :issue:`checkpoint hangs <WT-3227>`. The issue
was fixed in MongoDB :ref:`3.4.6+ <3.4.6-changelog>` and MongoDB
:ref:`3.2.17+ <3.2.17-release-notes>`, and is resolved in all point
release of MongoDB 3.6, 4.0, and 4.2.

.. _prod-notes-platform-considerations:

Platform Specific Considerations
--------------------------------

MongoDB on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _prod-notes-linux-file-system:

Kernel and File Systems
```````````````````````

When running MongoDB in production on Linux, you should use Linux
kernel version 2.6.36 or later, with either the XFS or EXT4 filesystem.
If possible, use XFS as it generally performs better with MongoDB.

With the :ref:`WiredTiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`, using
XFS is **strongly recommended** for data bearing nodes to avoid
performance issues that may occur when using EXT4 with WiredTiger.

- In general, if you use the XFS file system, use at least version
  ``2.6.25`` of the Linux Kernel.

  .. Required for fallocate()

- If you use the EXT4 file system, use at least version
  ``2.6.28`` of the Linux Kernel.

- On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, use at least version
  ``2.6.18-194`` of the Linux kernel.

System C Library
````````````````

MongoDB uses the `GNU C Library <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>`_
(glibc) on Linux. Generally, each Linux distro provides its own
vetted version of this library. For best results, use the latest update
available for this system-provided version. You can check whether you have
the latest version installed by using your system's package manager. For
example:

- On :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS, the following
  command updates the system-provided GNU C Library:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo yum update glibc

- On Ubuntu / Debian, the following command updates the system-provided
  GNU C Library:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo apt-get install libc6

``fsync()`` on Directories
``````````````````````````

.. important::
   MongoDB requires a filesystem that supports ``fsync()``
   *on directories*. For example, HGFS and Virtual Box's shared
   folders do *not* support this operation.

.. _set-swappiness:

Set ``vm.swappiness`` to ``1`` or ``0``
```````````````````````````````````````

“Swappiness” is a Linux kernel setting that influences the behavior of
the Virtual Memory manager. The ``vm.swappiness`` setting ranges from
``0`` to ``100``: the higher the value, the more strongly it prefers
swapping memory pages to disk over dropping pages from RAM.

- A setting of ``0`` disables swapping entirely
  [#swappiness-kernel-version]_.

- A setting of ``1`` permits the kernel to swap only to avoid
  out-of-memory problems.

- A setting of ``60`` tells the kernel to swap to disk often, and is the
  default value on many Linux distributions.

- A setting of ``100`` tells the kernel to swap aggressively to disk.

MongoDB performs best where swapping can be avoided or kept to a
minimum. As such you should set ``vm.swappiness`` to either ``1`` or
``0`` depending on your application needs and cluster configuration.

.. [#swappiness-kernel-version]

   With Linux kernel versions previous to ``3.5``, or
   :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS kernel versions
   previous to ``2.6.32-303``,  a ``vm.swappiness`` setting of ``0``
   would still allow the kernel to swap in certain emergency situations.

.. note::

   If your MongoDB instance is hosted on a system that also runs other
   software, such as a webserver, you should set ``vm.swappiness`` to
   ``1``. If possible, it is highly recommended that you run MongoDB on
   its own dedicated system.

- To check the current swappiness setting on your system, run:

  .. code-block:: sh

     cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

- To change swappiness on your system:

  #. Edit the ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` file and add the following line:

     .. code-block:: sh

        vm.swappiness = 1

  #. Run the following command to apply the setting:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo sysctl -p

.. note::

   If you are running RHEL / CentOS and using a ``tuned`` performance
   profile, you must also edit your chosen profile to set
   ``vm.swappiness`` to ``1`` or ``0``.

.. _linux-recommended-configuration:

Recommended Configuration
`````````````````````````

For **all** MongoDB deployments:

- Use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize time among
  your hosts. This is especially important in sharded clusters.

For the **WiredTiger** storage engines,
consider the following recommendations:

- Turn off ``atime`` for the storage volume containing the :term:`database
  files <dbpath>`.

- Set the file descriptor limit, ``-n``, and the user process limit
  (ulimit), ``-u``, above 20,000, according to the suggestions in the
  :doc:`ulimit </reference/ulimit>` reference. A low ulimit will affect
  MongoDB when under heavy use and can produce errors and lead to
  failed connections to MongoDB processes and loss of service.

- Disable Transparent Huge Pages. MongoDB performs better with
  normal (4096 bytes) virtual memory pages. See :doc:`Transparent Huge
  Pages Settings </tutorial/transparent-huge-pages>`.

- Disable NUMA in your BIOS. If that is not possible, see
  :ref:`MongoDB on NUMA Hardware <production-numa>`.

- Configure SELinux for MongoDB **if** you are **not** using the
  default MongoDB directory paths or :doc:`ports
  </reference/default-mongodb-port>`.

  See: :ref:`Configure SELinux for
  MongoDB <install-rhel-configure-selinux>` and :ref:`Configure SELinux
  for MongoDB Enterprise <install-enterprise-rhel-configure-selinux>`
  for the required configuration.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-selinux-server-side-js.rst

.. _readahead:

For the **WiredTiger** storage engine:

- Set the readahead setting between 8 and 32 regardless of storage
  media type (spinning disk, SSD, etc.).

  Higher readahead commonly benefits sequential I/O operations.
  Since MongoDB disk access patterns are generally random, using higher
  readahead settings provides limited benefit or potential performance
  degradation. As such, for optimal MongoDB performance, set
  readahead between 8 and 32, unless testing shows a measurable,
  repeatable, and reliable benefit in a higher readahead value.
  `MongoDB commercial support 
  <https://support.mongodb.com/welcome?tck=docs_server>`_ can
  provide advice and guidance on alternate readahead configurations.

MongoDB and TLS/SSL Libraries
`````````````````````````````

On Linux platforms, you may observe one of the following statements in
the MongoDB log:

.. code-block:: none

   <path to TLS/SSL libs>/libssl.so.<version>: no version information available (required by /usr/bin/mongod)
   <path to TLS/SSL libs>/libcrypto.so.<version>: no version information available (required by /usr/bin/mongod)

These warnings indicate that the system's TLS/SSL libraries are different
from the TLS/SSL libraries that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` was compiled against.
Typically these messages do not require intervention; however, you can
use the following operations to determine the symbol versions that
:binary:`~bin.mongod` expects:

.. code-block:: sh

   objdump -T <path to mongod>/mongod | grep " SSL_"
   objdump -T <path to mongod>/mongod | grep " CRYPTO_"

These operations will return output that resembles one the of the
following lines:

.. code-block:: none

   0000000000000000      DF *UND*       0000000000000000  libssl.so.10 SSL_write
   0000000000000000      DF *UND*       0000000000000000  OPENSSL_1.0.0 SSL_write

The last two strings in this output are the symbol version and symbol
name. Compare these values with the values returned by the following
operations to detect symbol version mismatches:

.. code-block:: sh

   objdump -T <path to TLS/SSL libs>/libssl.so.1*
   objdump -T <path to TLS/SSL libs>/libcrypto.so.1*

This procedure is neither exact nor exhaustive: many symbols used by
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from the ``libcrypto`` library do not begin with
``CRYPTO_``.

.. _production-virtualization:

MongoDB on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For MongoDB instances using the WiredTiger storage engine, performance
on Windows is comparable to performance on Linux.

MongoDB on Virtual Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes considerations when running MongoDB in some of
the more common virtual environments.

For all platforms, consider :ref:`virtualized-disks-scheduling`.

:abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` :abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)`
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

There are two performance configurations to consider:

- Reproducible performance for performance testing or benchmarking, and
- Raw maximum performance

To tune performance on :abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)` for either
configuration, you should:

- Enable :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`
  `Enhanced Networking <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking>`_
  for your instance. Not all instance types support Enhanced Networking.

  To learn more about Enhanced Networking, see to the
  `AWS documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking>`_.

If you are concerned more about reproducible performance on
:abbr:`EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)`, you should also:

- Use provisioned :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)`
  for the storage, with separate devices for journal and data. Do not
  use the ephemeral (:abbr:`SSD (Solid State Disk)`) storage available
  on most instance types as their performance changes moment to moment.
  (The ``i`` series is a notable exception, but very expensive.)

- Disable :abbr:`DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling)` and
  :abbr:`CPU (central processing unit)` power saving modes.

  .. seealso::

     `Amazon documentation on Processor State Control <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/processor_state_control.html>`_

- Disable hyperthreading.

  .. seealso::

     `Amazon blog post on disabling Hyper-Threading <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/disabling-intel-hyper-threading-technology-on-amazon-linux/>`_.

- Use ``numactl`` to bind memory locality to a single socket.

.. _windows-azure-production-notes:

Azure
`````

Use `Premium Storage
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage/>`_.
Microsoft Azure offers two general types of storage:
Standard storage, and Premium storage. MongoDB on Azure has better
performance when using Premium storage than it does with Standard
storage.

The TCP idle timeout on the Azure load balancer is 240 seconds by
default, which can cause it to silently drop connections if the TCP
keepalive on your Azure systems is greater than this value.  You
should set ``tcp_keepalive_time`` to 120 to ameliorate this problem.

.. note::
   You will need to restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   processes for new system-wide keepalive settings to take effect.

VMware
``````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/vm-memory-considerations-vmware.rst

Ensure that virtual machines stay on a specific ESX/ESXi host by
setting VMware's `affinity rules <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-2FB90EF5-7733-4095-8B66-F10D6C57B820.html>`_.
If you must manually migrate a virtual machine
to another host and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance on the virtual machine is the
:term:`primary`, you must first :method:`step down <rs.stepDown>` the primary and then
:method:`shut down the instance <db.shutdownServer>`.

Follow the `networking best practices for vMotion
<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-7DAD15D4-7F41-4913-9F16-567289E22977.html>`_
and the `VMKernel
<https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2054994>`_.
Failure to follow the best practices can result in performance problems
and affect :doc:`replica set </core/replica-set-high-availability>` and
:doc:`sharded cluster </tutorial/troubleshoot-sharded-clusters>` high
availability mechanisms.

It is possible to clone a virtual machine running MongoDB.
You might use this function to
spin up a new virtual host to add as a member of a replica
set. If you clone a VM with journaling enabled, the clone snapshot will
be valid. If not using journaling, first stop :binary:`~bin.mongod`,
then clone the VM, and finally, restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Performance Monitoring
----------------------

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB offers :doc:`free Cloud monitoring
   </administration/free-monitoring>` for standalones and replica sets.
   For more information, see :doc:`/administration/free-monitoring`.


iostat
~~~~~~

On Linux, use the ``iostat`` command to check if disk I/O is a bottleneck
for your database. Specify a number of seconds when running iostat to
avoid displaying stats covering the time since server boot.

For example, the following command will display extended statistics and
the time for each displayed report, with traffic in MB/s, at one second
intervals:

.. code-block:: bash

   iostat -xmt 1

Key fields from ``iostat``:

- ``%util``: this is the most useful field for a quick check, it
  indicates what percent of the time the device/drive is in use.

- ``avgrq-sz``: average request size. Smaller number for this value
  reflect more random IO operations.

bwm-ng
~~~~~~

`bwm-ng <http://www.gropp.org/?id=projects&sub=bwm-ng>`_ is a
command-line tool for monitoring network use. If you suspect a
network-based bottleneck, you may use ``bwm-ng`` to begin your
diagnostic process.
