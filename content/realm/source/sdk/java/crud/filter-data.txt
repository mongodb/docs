.. _java-client-query-engine:

Query Engine
------------

To filter data in your realm, use the Realm query engine. 

There are two ways to access the query engine with the Java SDK:

- :ref:`Fluent interface <java-query-fluent-interface>`
- :ref:`Realm Query Language <java-realm-query-language>`

.. _java-query-fluent-interface:

Fluent Interface
----------------

The Java SDK uses a :wikipedia:`Fluent interface <Fluent_interface>`
to construct multi-clause queries that are passed to the query engine.

See `RealmQuery API
<https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/api/io/realm/RealmQuery.html>`__
for a complete list of available methods.

There are several types of operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <java-client-collections>`.
Filters work by **evaluating** an operator expression for
every object in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

An **expression** consists of one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s).
- A literal string, number, or date.

About the Examples In This Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section use a simple data set for a
task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
priority (higher is more important) and a count of
minutes spent working on it. A ``Project`` has zero or more
``Tasks``.

See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
``Task``, below:

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``between``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is between or equal to the right-hand range. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is within the right-hand date range.

   * - | ``equalTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``greaterThan``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``greaterThanOrEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is in the right-hand list.

   * - | ``lessThan``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``lessThanOrEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``notEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``and``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``not``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``or``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

            :copyable: false

      .. tab::
         :tabid: java

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/sync/QueryEngineTest.snippet.logical-operators.java
            :language: java
            :copyable: false

.. _java-string-operators:

String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``beginsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the right-hand string expression.

   * - ``contains``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``endsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``equalTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find
   projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' and
   projects with names that contain 'ie':

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
     
      .. tab::
         :tabid: kotlin

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/sync/QueryEngineTest.snippet.string-operators.kt
            :language: kotlin
            :copyable: false

      .. tab::
         :tabid: java

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/sync/QueryEngineTest.snippet.string-operators.java
            :language: java
            :copyable: false

.. note:: Case-insensitive Character Limitations

   Case-insensitive string operators only support the
   ``Latin Basic``, ``Latin Supplement``, ``Latin Extended A``, and
   ``Latin Extended B (UTF-8 range 0â€“591)`` character sets. Setting
   the case insensitive flag in queries when using ``equalTo``,
   ``notEqualTo``, ``contains``, ``endsWith``, ``beginsWith``, or
   ``like`` only works on English locale characters.

Aggregate Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <java-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``average``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection.

   * - | ``max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Long running projects.

Filter, Sort, Limit, Unique, and Chain Queries
----------------------------------------------

About the Examples in This Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section use two Realm object types: ``Teacher``
and ``Student``.

See the schema for these two classes below:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/TeacherKt.snippet.complete.kt

         :copyable: false

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/StudentKt.snippet.complete.kt

         :copyable: false

   .. tab::

         :copyable: false

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/Student.snippet.complete.java
         :language: java
         :caption: Student.java
         :copyable: false

.. _java-client-filters:

Filters
~~~~~~~

You can build filters using the operator methods of the
:wikipedia:`fluent interface <Fluent_interface>` exposed by the
:java-sdk:`RealmQuery <io/realm/RealmQuery.html>` class:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.filters.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.filters.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

This gives you a new instance of the class :java-sdk:`RealmResults <io/realm/RealmResults.html>`,
containing teachers with the name "Ms. Langtree" or "Mrs. Jacobs".

``RealmQuery`` includes several methods that can execute queries:

- :java-sdk:`findAll() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#findAll-->` blocks until
  it finds all objects that meet the query conditions

- :java-sdk:`findAllAsync() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#findAllAsync-->`
  returns immediately and finds all objects that meet the query
  conditions asynchronously on a background thread

- :java-sdk:`findFirst() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#findFirst-->` blocks
  until it finds the first object that meets the query conditions

- :java-sdk:`findFirstAsync() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#findFirstAsync-->`
  returns immediately and finds the first object that meets the query
  conditions asynchronously on a background thread

Queries return a list of references to the matching Realm
objects using the :ref:`RealmResults <java-results-collections>` type.

.. _java-link-queries:

Link Queries
`````````````

When referring to an object property, you can use **dot notation** to refer
to child properties of that object. You can refer to the properties of
:ref:`embedded objects <java-embedded-objects>` and :ref:`relationships
<java-client-relationships>` with dot notation.

For example, consider a query for all teachers with a student named
"Wirt" or "Greg":

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.link-queries.kt

         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.link-queries.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

You can even use dot notation to query inverse relationships:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.link-queries-inverse.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.link-queries-inverse.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

.. _java-sort-results:

Sort Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Realm applies the ``distinct()``, ``sort()`` and
   ``limit()`` methods in the order you specify. Depending on the
   data set this can alter the query result. Generally, you should
   apply ``limit()`` last to avoid unintended result sets.

You can define the order of query results using the
:java-sdk:`sort() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#sort-java.lang.String->`
method:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.sort.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.sort.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

Sorts organize results in ascending order by default. To organize results
in descending order, pass ``Sort.DESCENDING`` as a second argument.
You can resolve sort order ties between identical property values
by passing an array of properties instead of a single property: in the
event of a tie, Realm sorts the tied objects by subsequent
properties in order.

.. note:: String Sorting Limitations

   Realm uses non-standard sorting for upper and lowercase
   letters, sorting them together rather than sorting uppercase first.
   As a result, ``'- !"#0&()*,./:;?_+<=>123aAbBcC...xXyYzZ`` is the
   actual sorting order in Realm. Additionally, sorting
   strings only supports the ``Latin Basic``, ``Latin Supplement``,
   ``Latin Extended A``, and ``Latin Extended B (UTF-8 range 0â€“591)``
   character sets.

.. _java-limit-results:

Limit Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can cap the number of query results to a specific maximum number
using the :java-sdk:`limit() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#limit-long->`
method:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.limit.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.limit.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

Limited result collections automatically update like any other query
result. Consequently, objects might drop out of the collection as
underlying data changes.

.. tip:: Pagination is Not Necessary for Realm Optimization

   Some databases encourage paginating results with limits to avoid
   reading unnecessary data from disk or using too much memory.

   Since Realm queries are lazy, there is no need to
   take such measures. Realm only loads objects from query
   results when they are explicitly accessed.

.. tip:: Deleted Notifications in Limited Results

   :ref:`Collection notifications <java-collection-notifications>`
   report objects as deleted when they drop out of the result set.
   This does not necessarily mean that they have been deleted from the
   underlying realm, just that they are no longer part of the
   query result.

.. _java-unique-results:

Unique Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reduce query results to unique values for a given field or fields
using the :java-sdk:`distinct()
<io/realm/RealmQuery.html#distinct-java.lang.String->` method:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.unique.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.unique.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

You can only call ``distinct()`` on integer, long, short, and ``String``
fields; other field types will throw an exception. As with sorting,
you can specify multiple fields to resolve ties.

.. _java-chain-queries:

Chain Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply additional filters to a results collection by calling the
:java-sdk:`where() <io/realm/RealmResults.html#where-->` method:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.chain-queries.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable: false

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/local/FilterDataTest.snippet.chain-queries.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

The ``where()`` method returns a ``RealmQuery`` that you can resolve into
a ``RealmResults`` using a ``find`` method. Filtered results can only
return objects of the same type as the original results set, but are
otherwise able to use any :ref:`filters <java-client-filters>`.

.. _java-filter-with-realm-query-language:
.. _java-realm-query-language:

Query with Realm Query Language
-------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.4.0

You can also query realms using Realm Query Language, a string-based
query language to constrain searches when retrieving objects from a realm.

You can use :java-sdk:`RealmQuery.rawPredicate()
<io/realm/RealmQuery.html#rawPredicate-java.lang.String->`.
For more information about syntax, usage and limitations,
refer to the :ref:`Realm Query Language reference <rql>`.

Realm Query Language can use either the class and property names defined
in your Realm Model classes or the internal names defined with ``@RealmField``.
You can combine raw predicates with other raw predicates or type-safe
predicates created with ``RealmQuery``:
