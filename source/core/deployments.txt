The following examples illustrate some possible MongoDB and |onprem|
deployments.

Considerations
--------------

For best performance on any of these installs, configure each backup
host with two disk partitions: one for the snapshot store or File
System Store and one for the head databases.

.. _on-prem-minimal-deployment-diagram:

Test Install on a Single Host
-----------------------------

For a test deployment, you can deploy all of the |onprem| components to
a single host, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/install-simple-test-deployment`.

.. include:: /images/opsmanager-test.rst

.. note::

   If you would like to test backup services, use the |application| to
   configure them. When
   :doc:`configuring </reference/config/ui-settings>` |onprem|,
   you can specify the backup settings. The Backup Daemon service
   creates the :term:`head databases <head database>` dynamically in
   that directory. The Backup Daemon service then manages these head
   databases.

Production Installs
-------------------

Redundant Metadata and Snapshots
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This deployment provides redundancy for the
:ref:`mms-application-database` and :ref:`backup-database` in the
event of host failure. The deployment runs the database in a MongoDB
:term:`replica set` with three data-bearing members with copies of the
data.

.. important::

   This deployment provides high availability for the |application|.
   |onprem| uses a ``w:2``
   :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`, and can
   tolerate the loss of one data-bearing node from the
   :ref:`mms-application-database`. To make the deployment more
   durable, :manual:`enable journaling </reference/configuration-options#storage.journal.enabled>`.

.. include:: /images/opsmanager-medium.rst

.. note::

   All hosts must satisfy the combined
   :doc:`hardware and software requirements </core/requirements>` for
   both the systems specified in the **System Requirements** column.

     - System Requirements
     - Purpose

   * - 1

     -
       - |application|

       store secondary.

     -
       - |application| database

       - snapshot store

     - Hosts the |application| Database and snapshot store secondary
       replica set members.

       Replica sets provide data redundancy and are
       strongly recommended, but are not required for |onprem|.

For an example tutorial on installing the minimally viable |onprem|
installation, see :doc:`/tutorial/install-basic-deployment`.

.. _highly-available-deployment:

Highly Available |application| and Multiple snapshot stores
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This |onprem| deployment runs multiple instances behind a load
balancer to provide high availability for |onprem|.
This deployment scales out to add an additional snapshot store.

.. include:: /images/opsmanager-large.rst

The deployment includes:

- two hosts that serve the |application| and the |application|
  Database

- four hosts that serve |application| with Backup enabled and Backup
  Databases

- additional hosts to serve the remaining members of each replica set

Deploy an |http| Load Balancer to balance the |http| traffic for the
|application|. |onprem| does not supply an |http| Load Balancer. You
must provision, deploy, and configure it yourself. A load balancer
placed before of the |application| hosts must not return cached
content.

All of the software services need to be able to communicate with
the |application| Databases and the snapshot stores.
Configure your firewalls to allow traffic between these hosts
on the :doc:`appropriate ports </reference/firewall-configuration>`.

.. note::

   All hosts must satisfy the combined
   :doc:`hardware and software requirements </core/requirements>` for
   both the systems specified in the **System Requirements** column.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 45 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Host
     - System Requirements
     - Purpose

   * - **1 & 2**

     -
       - |application|

       - |application| Database

     - Serves the primary and secondary for the |application| database.

   * - **3**, **4**, **5** & **6**

     -
       - |application|

       - snapshot store

     - Serves the primary and secondary for the two snapshot stores.

       Only the Backup Daemon needs to communicate with the head
       databases. As such, their :setting:`net.bindIp` value is
       ``127.0.0.1`` to prevent external communication.
       :setting:`net.bindIp` specifies the IP address that
       :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` listens to for
       connections coming from applications.

   * - **7** & **8**

     -

       - |application| database

       - snapshot store

     - Serve the remaining replica set members for the |application|
       Database and the two snapshot stores.
