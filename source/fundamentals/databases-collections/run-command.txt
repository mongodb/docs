Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run a database command. You can use database commands to perform a
variety of administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server
statistics, initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   If possible, we recommend using these methods instead of executing
   database commands.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. The shell provides helper methods
   that might not be available in the driver.
   
   If there are no available helpers in the driver or the shell, you
   can use the ``db.runCommand()`` shell method or the driver's
   ``RunCommand()`` and ``RunCommandAsync()`` methods, which are described in this
   guide.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :ref:`<csharp-quickstart>`.

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, create a ``BsonDocument`` object that specifies
the command and pass it as a parameter to the ``RunCommand()`` or ``RunCommandAsync()`` 
method. You can specify the type returned by these methods by specifying the type parameter.
You can use the ``BsonDocument`` type to return the command response, or you can specify your
own strongly typed class to deserialize the command response.

The following example runs the ``hello`` command on a database, which returns information
about the server. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to
see the corresponding code.

.. tabs::
    
   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: distinct-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-hello
         :end-before: end-hello

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: run-command-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-hello-async
         :end-before: end-hello-async

.. tip::

   To view a full list of database commands and their corresponding
   parameters, see :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` in 
   the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _csharp-command-read-pref:

Set a Read Preference
----------------------

The ``RunCommand()`` method does not inherit the read preference you might
have set on your ``MongoDatabase`` instance. By default, ``RunCommand()``
uses the ``primary`` read preference.

You can set a read preference for the command execution by passing a ``ReadPreference``
instance as a parameter to ``RunCommand()``, as shown in the following example. Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code.
   
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: distinct-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-read-pref
         :end-before: end-read-pref

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: run-command-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-read-pref-async
         :end-before: end-read-pref-async

.. tip::

   To learn more about read preference options, see :manual:`Read
   Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _csharp-command-response:

Response
--------

The raw command response document returned by the ``RunCommand()`` method contains the
following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``<command result>``
     - Fields specific to the database command. For example,
       the ``hello`` command returns the ``topologyVersion`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Indicates whether the command has succeeded (``1.0``) or failed (``0.0``). The
       driver raises a ``MongoCommandException`` if the ``ok``
       value is ``0.0``.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - A document that contains the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for the ordering of operations. This field only
       applies to commands run on replica sets or sharded clusters.

   * - ``operationTime``
     - The logical time of the operation execution. This field only
       applies to commands run on replica sets or sharded clusters.

.. tip::

   To learn more about logical time, see the Wikipedia entry on
   the :wikipedia:`logical clock <w/index.php?title=Logical_clock&oldid=1072010149>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example runs the ``dbStats`` command to retrieve
storage statistics for the ``sample_restaurants`` database, then prints the
command results by using the ``ToJson()`` method on the returned ``BsonDocument`` object.
Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding
code.

.. tabs::
    
   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: distinct-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-print-command
         :end-before: end-print-command

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: run-command-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/databases-collections/RunCommand.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-print-command-async
         :end-before: end-print-command-async

The output of this command includes information about the data stored in
the database, as shown in the result returned by the previous example:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   { "db" : "sample_restaurants", "collections" : 2, "views" : 0, "objects" : 
   NumberLong(25438), "avgObjSize" : 548.95172576460413, "dataSize" : NumberLong(13964234),
   "storageSize" : NumberLong(8056832), "totalFreeStorageSize" : NumberLong(0),
   "numExtents" : NumberLong(0), "indexes" : 2, "indexSize" : NumberLong(1044480),
   "indexFreeStorageSize" : NumberLong(0), "fileSize" : NumberLong(0), "nsSizeMB" : 0, "ok" : 1 }
