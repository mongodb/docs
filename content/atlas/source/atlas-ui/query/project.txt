=============================
Set Which Fields Are Returned
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If the query bar displays the :guilabel:`Project` option, you can
specify which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all
fields are returned.

Set a Projection
----------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

   .. step:: Set the projection.

      a. Select the collection.
      
      #. In the Query Bar, click :guilabel:`Options`.

      #. Enter the projection document into the :guilabel:`Project` 
         field.

         To include fields:
         
         Specify the field name and set to ``1`` in the project 
         document.

         .. example::

            .. code-block:: javascript

               { year: 1, name: 1 }

            Only the fields specified in the project document are 
            returned. The ``_id`` field is returned unless it is set 
            to  ``0`` in the :guilabel:`Project` document.

         To exclude fields:
         
         Specify the field name and set to ``0`` in the project 
         document.

         .. example::

            .. code-block:: javascript

               { year: 0, name: 0 }

            All fields except for the fields specified in the project
            document are returned.

         As you type, the :guilabel:`Find` button is disabled and the
         :guilabel:`Project` label turns red until a valid query is 
         entered.

How Does the |service| Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

:pipeline:`$project` corresponds to choosing specific fields to return
in a :abbr:`SQL (Structured Query Language)` ``SELECT`` statement.

.. example::

   You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see only the headlines
   and authors of those articles.

   SQL
      .. code-block:: sql

         SELECT headline, author FROM article;

   MongoDB Aggregation
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.article.aggregate(
           { $project : { headline : 1, author : 1 } }
         );

   |service| Project Option
      .. code-block:: javascript

         { headline : 1, author : 1 }
