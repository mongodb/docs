=====================================
Add Monitored Processes to Automation
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Automated management lets you deploy, reconfigure, and upgrade your
MongoDB databases directly from the |mms| console.

If |mms| is already monitoring your MongoDB processes, you can add them to
automation using these procedures. If you have processes that are not yet
monitored by |mms|, you must first :doc:`add them to monitoring
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>` and then perform the steps here.

Automation relies on an Automation Agent, which must be installed on each
server that hosts a process you will add to Automation. The Automation
Agents regularly poll |mms| to determine the goal configuration, deploy
changes as needed, and report deployment status back to |mms|.

To add processes to Automation you install the Automation Agents and then
add the processes to Automation through the |mms| interface.

Considerations
--------------

Automation Agents can run only on 64-bit architectures.

Automation supports most but not all available MongoDB options. Automation
supports the options described in
:doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options`.

Prerequisites
-------------

|mms| is Monitoring the Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| must be currently monitoring the MongoDB processes, and the
Monitoring Agent must be running. The processes must appear in the |mms|
:guilabel:`Deployment` tab. If this is not the case, see
:doc:`/tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring`.

Procedures
----------

Install the Automation Agent on Each Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the Automation Agent on each server that hosts a monitored MongoDB
process.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the Automation Agent. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
Automation Agent.

For additional information on installing the agent, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.
