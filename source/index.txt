   - **New online course**. `Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas
     <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M123/about?jmp=docs>`_.

`MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com?jmp=docs>`_ is a cloud
service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments,
including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB
instances.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-version.rst

|service| deploys each cluster across a minimum of three availability
zones and with mandatory security.

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of
:ref:`security-tls`, :ref:`virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
<security-vpc>` with :ref:`IP whitelists <add-to-whitelist>`, and
:ref:`user authentication and authorization
<mongodb-users>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.

Next Steps
----------

To get started, see :doc:`getting-started`.

.. Do we need to list key features, or is that marketing content?

.. Perhaps at end, a see also for self managed, point them to cloudmgr.
