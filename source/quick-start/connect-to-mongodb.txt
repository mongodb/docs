Connect to MongoDB
==================

   :description: Connect to MongoDB using the MongoDB Node.js Driver by creating an application, assigning a connection string, and running a query to retrieve data.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Node.js Application

      Create a file to contain your application called ``index.js`` in your
      ``node_quickstart`` project directory. 
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``index.js`` file:
      
      .. code-block:: js

         const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

         // Replace the uri string with your connection string.
         const uri = "<connection string uri>";

         const client = new MongoClient(uri);

         async function run() {
           try {
             const database = client.db('sample_mflix');
             const movies = database.collection('movies');

             // Query for a movie that has the title 'Back to the Future'
             const query = { title: 'Back to the Future' };
             const movie = await movies.findOne(query);

             console.log(movie);
           } finally {
             // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
             await client.close();
           }
         }
         run().catch(console.dir);

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string uri>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`node-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Node.js Application

      In your shell, run the following command to start this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         node index.js

      The output includes details of the retrieved movie document:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
           _id: ...,
           plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
           genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
           ...
           title: 'Back to the Future',
           ...
         }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, check whether you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``index.js`` file, and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
