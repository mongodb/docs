   :description: Encrypt specific document fields using PyMongo's in-use encryption to protect sensitive data before sending it to MongoDB.

Overview
--------

You can use {+driver-short+} to encrypt specific document fields by using a
set of features called **in-use encryption**. In-use encryption allows
your application to encrypt data *before* sending it to MongoDB
and query documents with encrypted fields.

In-use encryption prevents unauthorized users from viewing plaintext
data as it is sent to MongoDB or while it is in an encrypted database. To
enable in-use encryption in an application and authorize it to decrypt
data, you must create encryption keys that only your application can
access. Only applications that have access to your encryption
keys can access the decrypted, plaintext data. If an attacker gains
access to the database, they can only see the encrypted ciphertext data
because they lack access to the encryption keys.

You might use in-use encryption to encrypt fields in your MongoDB
documents that contain the following types of sensitive data:

- Credit card numbers
- Addresses
- Health information
- Financial information
- Any other sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII)

MongoDB offers the following features to enable in-use encryption:

- :ref:`Queryable Encryption <subsection-qe>`
- :ref:`Client-side Field Level Encryption <subsection-csfle>`

.. _subsection-qe:

Queryable Encryption
--------------------

Queryable Encryption is the next-generation in-use encryption feature,
first introduced as a preview feature in {+mdb-server+} version 6.0 and
as a generally available (GA) feature in MongoDB 7.0. Queryable
Encryption supports searching encrypted fields for equality and encrypts
each value uniquely.

.. important:: Preview Feature Incompatible with MongoDB 7.0
   
   The implementation of Queryable Encryption in MongoDB 6.0 is incompatible with the GA version introduced in MongoDB 7.0. The Queryable Encryption preview feature is no longer supported.

To learn more about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable
Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>` in the Server manual.

.. _subsection-csfle:

Client-side Field Level Encryption
----------------------------------

Client-side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) was introduced in MongoDB
Server version 4.2 and supports searching encrypted fields for equality.
CSFLE differs from Queryable Encryption in that you can select either a
deterministic or random encryption algorithm to encrypt fields. You can only
query encrypted fields that use a deterministic encryption algorithm when
using CSFLE. When you use a random encryption algorithm to encrypt
fields in CSFLE, they can be decrypted, but you cannot perform equality
queries on those fields. When you use Queryable Encryption, you cannot
specify the encryption algorithm, but you can query all encrypted
fields.

When you deterministically encrypt a value, the same input value
produces the same output value. While deterministic encryption allows
you to perform queries on those encrypted fields, encrypted data with
low cardinality is susceptible to code breaking by frequency analysis.
