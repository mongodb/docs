The following tutorial guides you through launching the |charts-short|
:abbr:`SaaS (Software as a Service)` application. Alternatively, you
can install and run |charts-short| locally by following the guide
on `this page
<https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/current/installation/>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

|charts| is accessible through MongoDB |service|. You will need a
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas user account </tutorial/manage-users/>`
to complete this procedure. To learn more about creating an |service|
user, see the |service| :atlas:`Getting Started </getting-started/>` documentation.

You will also need an |service| cluster to visualize data using
|charts-short|. The steps on this page guide you through creating an
|service| cluster.

.. important::

   Each instance of the |charts| application is tied to a single
   |service| :atlas:`project </tutorial/manage-projects/>`__,
   and can only visualize data from |service| clusters within the same
   project.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access |charts|, your :atlas:`Atlas user </tutorial/manage-users/>`
must have appropriate permissions to read data from the clusters
in your |service| project. This means that your |service| user
can have any
:atlas:`Project Role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`
except ``Project Read Only``, which does not grant the appropriate
permissions.

When you first register an |service| account, you are granted
the ``Project Owner`` role on your initial project. For information
on configuring additional users and roles, see
:atlas:`Atlas Access </tutorial/manage-users/>` in the
|service| documentation.

Moving Forward
--------------

Now that you have configured a data source, you are ready to begin
visualizing your data. The next steps are to
:doc:`create a dashboard </dashboards>`, and then
:doc:`build charts </build-charts>` to populate your dashboard.

For complete walkthroughs of |charts| and its features, including
downloadable data sets to visualize, see the following
:doc:`Tutorials </tutorials>`.
