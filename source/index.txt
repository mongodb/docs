==================
The MongoDB Manual
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! This resource starts with the basics of
MongoDB and goes on to describe the query language, advanced
clustering configurations, administration, and more.  It also includes
a thorough glossary and command reference.

This manual is under heavy development, and the ":doc:`/about`" page
provides links and a more through overview of MongoDB and the Document
project.

The MongoDB Manual will eventually replace the existing
:ref:`MongoDB Wiki <mongodb-wiki>`. For the moment, both sets of
documentation will coexist and link to one another. So, as you explore
the manual, don't be surprised if you find yourself moving between
documentation sites.

Getting Started
---------------

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database designed for
ease of development and scalability, with particular emphasis on
Internet applications and infrastructure.  If you're brand new to
MongoDB, this is the place to start.

1. :doc:`Installing MongoDB <installation>`
2. :wiki:`The MongoDB Tutorial <Tutorial>`
3. :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </faq/fundamentals>`

MongoDB has an :wiki:`active community <community>`. You'll get a
quick response to any question posted to the `MongoDB User Mailing List`_

.. _`MongoDB User Mailing List`: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mongodb-user

For Developers
--------------

If you want to build an application on MongoDB, you'll start by
picking a :doc:`language and driver <applications/drivers>`. Most of
the drivers include their own tutorials, but to get the most of any
driver, you have to understand a few core MongoDB concepts. The wiki's
:wiki:`developer docs <Developer+Zone>` outlines these topics.

Of the developer docs, those covering CRUD (create, read, update, and
delete) are particularly helpful:

1. :wiki:`Creating documents <Inserting>`
2. :wiki:`Queries <Querying>`
3. :wiki:`Updates <Updating>`
4. :wiki:`Deletes <Removing>`

As you become familiar with CRUD in MongoDB you will also want to
learn about indexing in MongoDB, by reading the following
documents:

- :doc:`/core/indexes`
- :doc:`/administration/indexes`
- :doc:`/applications/indexes`

:wiki:`indexing <Indexes>` data in MongoDB.

To continue learning about :doc:`application development
</applications>` with MongoDB skim the :doc:`developer FAQs
<faq/developers>` and consider the :doc:`use case documentation
</use-cases>` in addition to the core :doc:`Using MongoDB
documentation </applications>`. Also consider the following tutorials:

- :ref:`tutorials-development-patterns`
- :ref:`tutorials-application-development`

For Administrators
------------------

If you're administering MongoDB, you'll need to know at least the
basics of :wiki:`querying <Querying>` MongoDB and :wiki:`using the
shell <Overview+-+The+MongoDB+Interactive+Shell>`. You can then browse
the wiki's extensive :wiki:`administration docs <Admin+Zone>` and the
Manual's :doc:`administration </administration>` section.

First have a look at :doc:`configuration </administration/configuration>`. Then
familiarize yourself with MongoDB's clustered deployment options:

1. :doc:`Replication <replication>`
2. :doc:`Sharding <sharding>`

Most deployments consist of a single replica set. Scaling the
database on existing hardware usually involved sharding. If you
are deploying MongoDB to production, be sure to familiarize
yourself with the following topics:

1. :doc:`Backups </administration/backups>`
2. :doc:`Monitoring </administration/monitoring>`
3. :wiki:`Hardware and System Settings <Production+Notes>`

Also consider the :ref:`Administration Tutorials
<tutorials-administration>`.

Reference
---------

This manual features a detailed reference, including a glossary of
terms, a command reference, a query operator reference, and a man page
for all of the tools bundled with MongoDB.

MongoDB Wiki
------------

This manual will eventually replace the :wiki:`MongoDB Wiki <>`. Until
then, you'll have to use both to get the best information on
MongoDB. The following pages from the wiki are especially useful:
