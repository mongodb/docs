  In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection` column, update any values that
  need to be changed in the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 10 70
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Field
       - Necessity
       - Contents

     * - S3 Bucket Name
       - Required
       - Enter the name of the |s3| bucket where you want to host the
         the |s3os|.

     * - Region Override
       - Conditional
       - Type the region where your |s3| bucket resides.

         Use this field only if your |s3|\-compatible store's 
         **S3 Endpoint** doesn't support region scoping. Don't provide 
         a value for this field with |aws| |s3| buckets.

     * - S3 Endpoint
       - Required
       - Enter the |url| for this |aws| |s3| or |s3|-compatible bucket.

         What |url| you write depends upon:

         1. Your :guilabel:`S3 Bucket Name` and
         2. If you checked :guilabel:`Path Style Access`.

         .. example::

            You created an |s3| bucket called ``mybucket`` on |aws| in
            the **US East** region.

            .. list-table::
               :widths: 20 40 40
               :header-rows: 1
               :stub-columns: 1

               * - Path Style Access
                 - Checked
                 - Not Checked

               * - S3 Endpoint
                 - ``s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com``
                 - ``mybucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com``

               * - Requests to Bucket
                 - ``https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mybucket``
                 - ``https://mybucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com``

     * - S3 Max Connections
       - Required
       - Enter a positive integer indicating the maximum number of
         connections to this |aws| |s3| or |s3|-compatible bucket.

     * - Path Style Access
       - Optional
       - Click if you want your |aws| |s3| or |s3|\-compatible bucket
         to use a path-style |url| endpoint
         (``s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>``) instead of a
         virtual-host-style |url| endpoint
         (``<bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com``).

         To review the |s3| bucket
         |url| conventions, see the
         :aws:`AWS S3 documentation </AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`

     * - Server Side Encryption
       - Optional
       - Click to enable :aws:`server-side encryption
         </AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`.
         Clear to disable server-side encryption.

     * - S3 Authorization Mode
       - Required
       - Select the method used to authorize access to the |s3| bucket
         specified in :guilabel:`S3 Bucket Name`.

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 20 80
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Keys
              - |mms| uses :guilabel:`AWS Access Key` and
                :guilabel:`AWS Secret Key` to authorize access to your
                |s3| bucket.
            * - IAM Role
              - |mms| uses an |aws| |iam| role to authorize access to
                your |s3| bucket. :guilabel:`AWS Access Key` and
                :guilabel:`AWS Secret Key` fields are ignored. To
                learn more, see the :aws:`AWS documentation
                </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#attach-iam-role>`

     * - Keys with Custom CA Bundle
       - Conditional
       - Click :guilabel:`Choose file` to add a custom |certauth|
         chain. This chain can validate against a self-signed
         certificate on the |s3| bucket.

         |mms| displays this field when you set
         :guilabel:`S3 Authorization Mode` to :guilabel:`Keys`.

     * - AWS Access Key
       - Conditional
       - Enter your |aws| Access Key ID.

         |mms| displays this field when you set
         :guilabel:`S3 Authorization Mode` to :guilabel:`Keys`.

     * - AWS Secret Key
       - Conditional
       - Enter your |aws| Secret Access Key.

         |mms| displays this field when you set
         :guilabel:`S3 Authorization Mode` to :guilabel:`Keys`.

         .. note::

            |mms| doesn't display the existing Secret Access Key.

     * - <hostname>:<port>
       - Required
       - Enter in one or more hosts that comprise the |s3| Snapshot
         Store metadata database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

         .. admonition:: S3 Oplog Hosting Concerns
            :class: important

            - |onprem| uses this metadata store as a sync store. Make
              sure to provision this store with sufficient storage
              space.

            - If you change these hosts, the |s3os| they host must have
              the same data as the original |s3os|. Changing the host
              to a new |s3os| results in data loss.

         - If the |s3os| metadata database is a Replica
           Set or Sharded Cluster, type a comma-separated list of
           |mongod| instances (for a Replica Set) or |mongos|
           instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

           .. example::

              ``host1.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27018``

         - If the |s3os| metadata database is a standalone MongoDB
           instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

     * - MongoDB Auth Username
       - Optional
       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-username.rst

     * - MongoDB Auth Password
       - Optional
       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-password.rst

         .. include:: /includes/warning-plaintext-password.rst

         .. note::

            |onprem| doesn't display the existing
            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.

     * - Encrypted Credentials
       - Optional
       - Select if the credentials for the database were encrypted
         using the
         :doc:`credentialstool </tutorial/encrypt-user-credentials>`.
         The credentials include the Username, Password, |aws| Access
         Key ID and |aws| Secret Key.

     * - Use |tls-ssl|
       - Optional
       - Select if the |s3os| database only accepts connection
         encrypted using |tls|.

         Beyond this checkbox, to connect this |s3os|
         using |tls|, you must enable
         :manual:`TLS on the S3 oplog store database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

     * - Connection Options
       - Optional
       - Enter any additional :manual:`configuration file options
         </reference/configuration-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
         This field supports unescaped values only.

         To review the proper syntax, see :manual:`Connection String
         URI Format </reference/connection-string>` in the MongoDB
         manual.

     * - Assignment Labels
       - Optional
       - Enter a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
         |s3os|\s to specific projects.

     * - Write Concern
       - Required
       - Select your preferred
         :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

         .. include:: /includes/list-tables/write-concerns.rst

  To enable this |s3os|, select :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled`.

  This is selected by default so the |s3os| can be assigned backup
  jobs. If you clear this checkbox, |mms| creates the |s3os| but you
  cannot assign backups to it.

  If you change any connection string values or the Write Concern,
  restart all the |onprem| instances including those running Backup
  Daemons.

  .. warning::

     Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for
     an existing |s3os| requires you to restart all |onprem|
     components, including those only running the Backup Daemon to
     apply those changes. Connection parameters include:

     - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
     - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`
     - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`
     - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
     - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

     If you change to another |s3os| host, |mms| doesn't copy the data
     on the existing |s3os| to the other |s3os|.
