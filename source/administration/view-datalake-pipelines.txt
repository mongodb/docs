View {+adl+} Pipelines 
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can view all of your {+dl+} pipelines through the |service| |ui| 
and {+dl+} Pipelines |api|. You can also retrieve all of your completed 
{+dl+} pipeline data ingestion jobs from the |api|.

View {+adl+} Pipelines from the |service| UI 
-----------------------------------------------------

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

   .. step::  Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` on the left-hand navigation.

      The page displays all the {+dl+} pipelines in the project. For 
      each {+dl+} pipeline, the service also displays the following 
      information: 

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 20 80 
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Column Name 
           - Description 

         * - Pipeline Name
           - Name of your {+dl+} pipeline. Each pipeline can produce 
             multiple datasets. You can expand the name to view the 
             datasets in the pipeline.

         * - Data Source
           - Source for the data in the pipeline datasets. For data 
             from a collection on the |service| cluster, this column 
             shows the cluster name, the database name, and the 
             collection name separated by ``|``.
           
         * - Data Size
           - Size of data for each dataset.
           
         * - :guilabel:`Last Run Time`
           - Date and time when the pipeline ran to ingest data for 
             each dataset.
           
         * - :guilabel:`Status`
           - Status of the pipeline. Value can be one of the following 
             for a pipeline: 

             - ``Active`` - indicates that the pipeline is active
             - ``Paused`` - indicates that data ingestion for the 
               pipeline is paused
           
         * - :guilabel:`Frequency`
           - Frequency at which cluster data is ingested and stored 
             for querying.
           
         * - :guilabel:`Actions`
           - Actions you can take for each pipeline. You can click 
             one of the following: 

             - :icon-fa4:`paused` to pause data ingestion and 
               :icon-fa5:`arrow-right` to resume data ingestion. You 
               can't pause on-demand ingestion of data.
             - :icon:`pencil` to edit the data ingestion schedule for 
               the pipeline. 
             - :icon-fa4:`fa4-ellipsis-v` to do the following:
             
               - Delete a pipeline. You can't undo this action. If you 
                 delete a pipeline, {+adl+} deletes the datasets, 
                 including the data, and removes the datasets from the 
                 {+fdi+}\s where they are referenced. If you delete a 
                 dataset inside a pipeline, {+adl+} removes the dataset 
                 from the {+fdi+} storage configuration where the 
                 dataset is referenced. 
               - Trigger an on-demand pipeline run. 

View {+adl+} Pipelines from the API 
-------------------------------------------

To retrieve all your {+dl+} pipelines for a project through the |api|, 
send a ``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} 
</Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``pipelines`` endpoint. To learn more about 
the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax and parameters for retrieving all of 
your {+dl+} pipelines, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return All Data Lake 
Pipelines from One Project </returnAllDataLakePipelinesFromOneProject>`.

To retrieve one of your {+dl+} pipelines through the |api|, send a 
``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` 
``pipelines`` endpoint with the name of the {+dl+} pipeline that you 
want to retrieve. To learn more about the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax 
and parameters for retrieving one of your {+dl+} pipelines, see 
:oas-atlas-op:`Return One Data Lake Pipeline 
</returnOnePipelineInOneProject>`.

View {+adl+} Pipeline Runs from the API 
-----------------------------------------------

To retrieve all the completed {+dl+} pipeline data ingestion jobs for a 
project through the |api|, send a ``GET`` request to the 
:oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``runs`` endpoint. To 
learn more about the |api| syntax and options for the ``runs`` 
endpoint, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return All Data Lake Pipeline Runs from 
One Project </returnAllDataLakePipelineRunsFromOneProject>`.

To retrieve the details of one of your completed {+dl+} pipeline data 
ingestion jobs through the |api|, send a ``GET`` request to the 
:oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``runs`` endpoint with 
the unique identifier of the completed {+dl+} pipeline data ingestion 
job that you want to retrieve. To learn more about the |api| syntax and 
options for the ``runs`` endpoint, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Data 
Lake Pipeline Run </returnOnePipelineRunInOneProject>`.
