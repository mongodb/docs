You can distribute MongoDB Sharded Clusters over 
multiple |k8s| Clusters. With multi-cluster functionality, you can:

- Improve the resilience of your deployment by distributing it across multiple 
  |k8s| clusters, each in a different geographic region. 
- Configure your deployment for geo sharding by deploying primary nodes of 
  specified shards in different |k8s| clusters that are located closer to the 
  application or clients that depend on that data, reducing latency.  
- Tune your deployment for improved performance. For example, you can deploy 
  read-only analytical nodes for all or specified shards in different 
  |k8s| clusters or with customized resource allocations.

Additionally, you can configure shard, mongos, and config server details at 
different levels. This means that you can define a top-level, default 
configuration for shards, config server and mongos, and customize them for 
each |k8s| cluster independently. Additionally, it is possible to customise 
individual shards to suit your specific needs. 

.. important:: 
   
   The multi-cluster sharded cluster functionality makes it possible to deploy
   MongoDB resources across multiple |k8s| clusters in multiple geographic regions; 
   however, doing so will likely increase latency for replication operations.


To learn more about the specific configuration options for the multi-cluster 
sharded cluster topology, see the :ref:`sharded cluster reference <sharded-cluster-settings>`.

Limitations
-----------

- Hashicorp Vault support is not available for |k8s| Secret injection.
- The |k8s-op-short| doesn't automatically shift resources from failed |k8s| 
  clusters into healthy ones. In case of a member cluster failure, you must 
  redistribute resources across remaining healthy |k8s| clusters manually by 
  updating the CRD resource deployed to the central cluster.
- In case of a member cluster failure, you must first manually scale down failed 
  clusters to zero to remove unhealthy processes. Then you can redistribute resources 
  across remaining healthy |k8s| clusters manually by updating the CRD 
  resource deployed to the central cluster. See :ref:`Disaster Recovery <disaster-recovery-ref>` 
  to learn more.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Prepare your |k8s| clusters for a multi-cluster deployment.
  
  - Install and configure the |k8s-op-short| for multi-cluster deployments in one of your |k8s| clusters. 
  - Option 1: Deploy a :ref:`service mesh across member clusters <multi-cluster-diagram-with-service-mesh>`. 
    You can find a detailed procedure in steps 1 - 6 of the :ref:`Ops Manager Multi-Cluster Deployment Guide <deploy-om-multi-cluster>`. 
    Note that this procedure is opinionated, and only one of many possible configurations. 
  - Option 2: Configure your |k8s| clusters for a :ref:`non-service mesh deployment <mcsc-non-service-mesh>`.

- :ref:`Deploy a config map <create-k8s-project>` with Ops Manager or Cloud Manager and 
  MongoDB project details to your central cluster, which |k8s-op-short| 
  requires to deploy the MongoDB database resource.
- :ref:`Create credentials <create-k8s-credentials>` for Ops your Manager or Cloud Manager instance and your 
  MongoDB organization and project. 

Example Sharded Cluster Deployment
----------------------------------

When applied to your central cluster, the example below deploys a sharded 
MongoDB cluster with 3 shards that are configured as follows:

- Each shard has nodes distributed over all |k8s| clusters (1 node per cluster).
  
- By default each shard's Replica Set:
  
  - Has 3 voting members in total deployed across 3 clusters (1 node in each cluster)
  - The primary shard is preferred to be in ``kind-e2e-cluster-1``.
  
- With a ``shardOverride`` for shard ``sc-0``, we change the default values (specified in ``spec.shard``) to the following:
  
  - 5 members in total
  - 2 members in ``kind-e2e-cluster-1``
  - 2 members in ``kind-e2e-cluster-2``
  - 1 member in ``kind-e2e-cluster-3``
  - When possible, the primary shard is preferred to be in ``kind-e2e-cluster-2``

- Customized default storage settings for all shards in all clusters as defined in ``spec.shardPodSpec``
- A Config Server Replica Set with 3 members, with 1 member in each cluster
- 3 mongos instances deployed in total, with 1 instance in each cluster

The default configuration consists of three shards, each with
one member on each of the three clusters, for a total of three members per shard. 
But in the overrides we change shard ``sc-0`` to have five members, two on cluster 
``1``, two on cluster ``2``, and cluster ``3`` still has one shard as per the 
default. 

.. note:: Only unidirectional scaling is supported.

   When you scale shard, config server, or mongos replicas you can only scale 
   resources up or down in order to ensure the correctness of scaling. This rule 
   applies to both single |k8s| cluster deployments and those that are 
   distributed across multiple |k8s| clusters. Additionally, in multi-cluster 
   deployments the unidirectional scaling rule applies to all resource types.
   For example, you can't add more nodes (scaling up) to shards while simultaneously 
   removing (scaling down) config servers or mongos. You can no longer "move" one 
   node from one cluster to another without changing the total number of members. 
   Rather, you must first perform a scale-up operation and then execute a separate 
   change for scaling down. 

This example configuration also shifts (with ``shardOverrides``) the primary to cluster ``2``, 
for the shard ``sc-0``, which can reduce latency for users operating in the region where  cluster ``2`` 
is located. In this way, you still have resilience across the clusters 
(and their regions), but if the data in shard ``0`` is data most relevant to the 
users in in which cluster ``2`` is deployed, they'll experience lower latency.

Shard Overrides 
---------------

To deploy a sharded cluster to multiple |k8s| clusters, you apply the sharded 
cluster configuration (MongoDB custom resource yaml) to your operator cluster - 
the |k8s| cluster on which your MongoDB Operator instance is deployed. This 
configuration's ``spec.shard`` definition is considered your deployment's base 
shard definition.

If you would like to customize specific shards on specific |k8s| clusters, 
you can use shard overrides to update the base shard defintion for a given shard. 

The following tables list fields that you can define in order to update or 
extend your base shard definition. The fields are listed in order of precedence. 
The topmost field in a given table represents the setting with the lowest 
precedence, and the bottommost field, if defined, overrides all other fields 
(e.g. specific shard, on a specific cluster).

Additionally, the override policy denoted for each field type describes whether that 
specific field is overridden by the newly defined value, or whether the complete 
object in which that field is defined is overidden. If the entire object is overridden, 
any fields defined in the base shard definition that are not also explicitly 
defined in the override definition are removed.The ``merge`` value indicates 
that a single field is updated, and the ``replace`` value indicates that the 
complete parent object is overridden.

.. note:: Deprecation of ShardSpecificPodSpec

   The ``ShardSpecificPodSpec`` field is deprecated, but is still supported. 
   It was previously used to specify Persistence and Pod Template parameters, 
   per shards, for single cluster sharded cluster. Now that it is deprecated, you should :ref:`migrate <update-from-deprecated-example>` to 
   ``ShardOverrides.PodSpec``, and ``ShardOverrides.StatefulSetConfiguration``.
   See the provided example YAML file for guidance on updating from 
   ``shardSpecificPodSpec`` and ``shardOverrides`` for a single cluster deployments.
