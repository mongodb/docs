Overview
--------

Atlas App Services serves hosted files through a :wikipedia:`Content Delivery Network
(CDN) <Content_delivery_network>` in order to minimize the latency
between receiving a request for a resource and returning the requested
resource.

When a client requests a resource that's hosted in App Services, the CDN server
that processes the request checks for a cached copy of the file. If the
server finds a valid cached copy of the resource, it returns it to the
client. Otherwise, it forwards the request to App Services and caches the
returned file before returning it to the client.

The CDN caching process decreases the latency for end users when they
request a resource but may cause users to receive an out-of-date
version of a resource if the file has changed since the CDN server
cached it. You can *flush* the CDN cache in order to make it drop all
cached files and start serving the latest version of each file.

.. note:: Automatic Cache Invalidation
   
   The CDN automatically refreshes cached files periodically. You can
   configure the caching behavior for an individual file by adding a a
   :ref:`Cache-Control <metadata-cache-control>` attribute to the file.

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To purge the CDN cache with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a local copy of your
            application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Deploy with the Reset CDN Cache Flag

            To purge the CDN cache, re-deploy your application configuration with the
            ``--reset-cdn-cache`` flag:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>" --reset-cdn-cache
