==========================
Atomicity and Transactions
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single
document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents
*within* a single document.

.. _atomicity-isolated-operator:

``$isolated`` Operator
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-isolate-operator.rst

The :update:`$isolated` operator does **not** work on sharded clusters.

For an example of an update operation that uses the :update:`$isolated`
operator, see :update:`$isolated`. For an example of a remove operation
that uses the :update:`$isolated` operator, see
:ref:`isolate-remove-operations`.

Transaction-Like Semantics
--------------------------

Since a single document can contain multiple embedded documents,
single-document atomicity is sufficient for many practical use cases.
For cases where a sequence of write operations must operate as if in a
single transaction, you can implement a :doc:`two-phase commit
</tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits>` in your application.

However, two-phase commits can only offer transaction-*like* semantics.
Using two-phase commit ensures data consistency, but it is possible for
applications to return intermediate data during the two-phase commit or
rollback.

For more information on two-phase commit and rollback, see
:doc:`/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits`.

.. _concurrency-control:

Concurrency Control
-------------------

Concurrency control allows multiple applications to run concurrently
without causing data inconsistency or conflicts.

An approach may be to create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
on a field (or fields) that should have only unique values (or unique
combination of values) prevents duplicate insertions or updates that
result in duplicate values. For examples of use cases, see
:ref:`update() and Unique Index <update-with-unique-indexes>` and
:ref:`findAndModify() and Unique Index <upsert-and-unique-index>`.

Another approach is to specify the expected current value of a field in
the query predicate for the write operations. For an example, see
:doc:`Update if Current </tutorial/update-if-current>`.

The two-phase commit pattern provides a variation where the query
predicate includes the :ref:`application identifier
<2-phase-commits-concurrency>` as well as the expected state of the
data in the write operation.
