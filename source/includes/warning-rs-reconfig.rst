.. warning::

   The :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method can force the current
   primary to step down, which causes an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`.
   When the primary steps down, the :program:`mongod` closes all client
   connections. While this typically takes 10-20 seconds, attempt to
   make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods. To
   successfully reconfigure a replica set, a majority of the members
   must be accessible.
