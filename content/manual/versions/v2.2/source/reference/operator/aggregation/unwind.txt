.. pipeline:: $unwind

   Peels off the elements of an array individually, and returns a
   stream of documents. :pipeline:`$unwind` returns one document for
   every member of the unwound array within every source
   document. Take the following aggregation command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $project : {
              author : 1 ,
              title : 1 ,
              tags : 1
          }},
          { $unwind : "$tags" }
      );

   .. note::

      The dollar sign (i.e. ``$``) must proceed the field
      specification handed to the :pipeline:`$unwind` operator.

   In the above aggregation :pipeline:`$project` selects
   (inclusively) the ``author``, ``title``, and ``tags`` fields, as
   well as the ``_id`` field implicitly. Then the pipeline passes the
   results of the projection to the :pipeline:`$unwind` operator,
   which will unwind the ``tags`` field. This operation may return
   a sequence of documents that resemble the following for a
   collection that contains one document holding a ``tags`` field
   with an array of 3 items.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
           "result" : [
                   {
                           "_id" : ObjectId("4e6e4ef557b77501a49233f6"),
                           "title" : "this is my title",
                           "author" : "bob",
                           "tags" : "fun"
                   },
                   {
                           "_id" : ObjectId("4e6e4ef557b77501a49233f6"),
                           "title" : "this is my title",
                           "author" : "bob",
                           "tags" : "good"
                   },
                   {
                           "_id" : ObjectId("4e6e4ef557b77501a49233f6"),
                           "title" : "this is my title",
                           "author" : "bob",
                           "tags" : "fun"
                   }
           ],
           "OK" : 1
      }

   A single document becomes 3 documents: each document is identical
   except for the value of the ``tags`` field. Each value of ``tags``
   is one of the values in the original "tags" array.

   .. note::

      :pipeline:`$unwind` has the following behaviors:

      - :pipeline:`$unwind` is most useful in combination
        with :pipeline:`$group`.

      - You may undo the effects of unwind operation with the
        :pipeline:`$group` pipeline operator.

      - If you specify a target field for :pipeline:`$unwind` that
        does not exist in an input document, the pipeline ignores the
        input document, and will generate no result documents.

      - If you specify a target field for :pipeline:`$unwind` that is
        not an array, :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` generates an error.

      - If you specify a target field for :pipeline:`$unwind` that
        holds an empty array (``[]``) in an input document, the
        pipeline ignores the input document, and will generates no
        result documents.
