   .. step:: Load the sample data.

      If you haven't already, complete the 
      steps to :ref:`load sample data into your Atlas {+cluster+} 
      <sample-data>`.

   .. step:: Instantiate the vector store.

      Paste and run the following code in your notebook 
      to create a vector store instance
      named ``vector_store`` from the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` 
      namespace in |service|. This code uses the 
      ``from_connection_string`` method to create the ``MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch``
      vector store and specifies the following parameters:

      - Your |service| {+cluster+}'s connection string.
      - An OpenAI embedding model as the model used to convert text into 
        vector embeddings. By default, this model is ``text-embedding-ada-002``.
      - ``sample_mflix.embedded movies`` as the namespace to use.
      - ``plot`` as the field that contains the text.
      - ``plot_embedding`` as the field that contains the embeddings.
      - ``dotProduct`` as the relevance score function.
