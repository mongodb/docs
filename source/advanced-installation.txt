Additional Options for Integrators
----------------------------------

In the event that you are building the BSON C++ library and/or the C++ driver to
embed with other components and you wish to avoid the potential for collision with
components installed from a standard build or from a distribution package manager,
you can make use of the ``BSONCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME`` and ``MONGOCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME``
options to ``cmake``.

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DBSONCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME=custom_bsoncxx        \
       -DMONGOCXX_OUTPUT_BASENAME=custom_mongocxx

The above command would produce libraries named ``libcustom_bsoncxx.so`` and ``libcustom_mongocxx.so`` (or with the extension appropriate for the build platform).  Those libraries could be placed in a standard system directory or in an alternate location and could be linked to by specifying something like ``-lcustom_mongocxx -lcustom_bsoncxx`` on the linker command line (possibly adjusting the specific flags to those required by your linker).

Install with Package Managers
-----------------------------

You can use the following package managers to install the {+driver-short+}:

- :ref:`vcpkg <cpp-install-vcpkg>`
- :ref:`Conan <cpp-install-conan>`
- :ref:`Homebrew <cpp-install-homebrew>`

.. _cpp-install-vcpkg:

Vcpkg Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not already have Vcpkg installed, install it with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   $ cd vcpkg
   $ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

Optionally, to install with Visual Studio integration:

.. code-block:: bash

   vcpkg integrate install

Install the driver. You may need to ``git pull`` to get the latest version of
the driver.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./vcpkg install mongo-cxx-driver

You can use the toolchain file, ``vcpkg.cmake``, to instruct CMake where to find
the development files, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/<path to vcpkg repo>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

You can find the header files in:

.. code-block:: none

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/include/

The library files are in:

.. code-block:: none

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/lib/

.. _cpp-install-conan:

Conan Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package Specifier: ``mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0``

If you do not already have Conan installed, then install it and run the Conan
initalization command below:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install conan
   $ conan profile detect --force

Add the following to your ``conanfile.txt``:

.. code-block:: none

   [requires]
   mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0
   [generators]
   CMakeDeps
   CMakeToolchain

Install the driver via Conan, and build your project:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conan install conanfile.txt --output-folder=build --build=missing
   $ cmake \
     -B build \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   $ cmake --build build

.. _cpp-install-homebrew:

Homebrew Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MacOS users can use Homebrew to install the C++ driver by running
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install mongo-cxx-driver

For an Apple Silicon Mac
`````````````````````````

Headers can be found in:

.. code-block:: none

   /opt/homebrew/include/mongocxx/v_noabi/
   /opt/homebrew/include/bsoncxx/v_noabi/

Library files can be found in:

.. code-block:: none

   /opt/homebrew/lib/

For an Intel Mac
`````````````````

Headers can be found in:

.. code-block:: none

   /usr/local/include/mongocxx/v_noabi/
   /usr/local/include/bsoncxx/v_noabi/

Library files can be found in:

.. code-block:: none

   /usr/local/lib/

Install the MongoDB C Driver
----------------------------

The mongocxx driver builds on top of the `MongoDB C driver <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/c/>`__.

The build of mongocxx-{+full-version+} automatically downloads and installs the C driver if the
C driver is not detected. To use an existing install of the C driver, set
``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` to the directory containing the C driver install. For information
about the minimum required ``libmongoc`` version for each version of the C++ driver, see
:ref:`cpp-libmongoc-compatibility`.

Unless you know that your package manager offers a sufficiently recent version, you
will need to download and build from the source code. Get a tarball from
the `C Driver release <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases>`__
page.

Follow the instructions for building from a tarball at
`Installing libmongoc <http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html>`__.

Industry best practices and some regulations require the use of TLS 1.1
or newer. The MongoDB C Driver supports TLS 1.1 on Linux if OpenSSL is
at least version 1.0.1. On macOS and Windows, the C Driver uses native
TLS implementations that support TLS 1.1.

Advanced Configuration (Static Configurations)
----------------------------------------------

The following sub-sections detail advanced options for configuring the C++ driver and/or its
dependencies as static libraries rather than the typical shared libraries.  These options will
produce library artifacts that will behave differently.  Ensure you have a complete understanding
of the implications of the various linking approaches before utilizing these options.

Configuring with ``mongocxx`` 3.2.x or Newer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users have the option to build ``mongocxx`` as a static library. **This is not recommended for novice
users.** A user can enable this behavior with the ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF

Configuring with ``mongocxx`` 3.5.0 or Newer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users have the option to build ``mongocxx`` as both static and shared libraries. A user can enable
this behavior with the ``-DBUILD_SHARED_AND_STATIC_LIBS`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DBUILD_SHARED_AND_STATIC_LIBS=ON

Users have the option to build ``mongocxx`` as a shared library that has statically linked
``libmongoc``. **This is not recommended for novice users.** A user can enable this behavior with the
``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS_WITH_STATIC_MONGOC`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS_WITH_STATIC_MONGOC=ON

Disabling Tests
---------------

Pass ``-DENABLE_TESTS=OFF`` as a cmake option to disable configuration of test targets.

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake .. -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
   cmake --build .. --target help
   # No test targets are configured.

Installing to Non-Standard Directories
--------------------------------------

To install the C++ driver to a non-standard directory, specify ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to the desired
install path:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/mongo-cxx-driver

Consider also specifying the ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=`` option to the ``lib`` directory of the install.
This may enable libmongocxx.so to locate libbsoncxx.so:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                             \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                       \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/mongo-cxx-driver    \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=$HOME/mongo-cxx-driver/lib

If the C driver is installed to a non-standard directory, specify ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` to the install
path of the C driver:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/mongo-c-driver        \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/mongo-cxx-driver

.. note::
    
   If you need multiple paths in a CMake PATH variable, separate them with a semicolon like this: ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/your/cdriver/prefix;/some/other/path"``

Configuring with ``mongocxx`` 3.1.x or 3.0.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of the ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` option, users must specify the ``libmongoc`` installation
directory by using the ``-DLIBMONGOC_DIR`` and ``-DLIBBSON_DIR`` options:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DLIBMONGOC_DIR=$HOME/mongo-c-driver            \
       -DLIBBSON_DIR=$HOME/mongo-c-driver              \
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/mongo-cxx-driver
