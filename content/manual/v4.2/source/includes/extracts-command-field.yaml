  A document containing the full command object associated with this
  operation. 

  For example, the following output contains the command object for a
  :dbcommand:`find` operation on a collection named ``items`` in a
  database named ``test``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     "command" : {
       "find" : "items",
       "filter" : {
         "sku" : 1403978
       },
       ...
       "$db" : "test"
     }
  
  The following example output contains the command object for a
  :dbcommand:`getMore` operation generated by
  a command with cursor ID ``19234103609`` on a collection named
  ``items`` in a database named ``test``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     "command" : {
         "getMore" : NumberLong("19234103609"),
         "collection" : "items",
         "batchSize" : 10,
         ...
         "$db" : "test"
     },

  If the command document exceeds {{truncThreshold}}, the
  document has the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "command" : {
       "$truncated": <string>,
       "comment": <string>
     }

  The ``$truncated`` field contains a string summary of the document excluding
  the document's ``comment`` field if present. If the summary still exceeds
  {{truncThreshold}} then it is further truncated, denoted by an ellipsis
  (...) at the end of the string.

  The ``comment`` field is present if a comment was passed to the operation.
