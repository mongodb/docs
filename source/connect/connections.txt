Connections List
----------------

The :guilabel:`Connections` list in the sidebar contains your
:ref:`favorite <favorite-connections>` and saved connections. Favorite
connections have a :icon-fa5:`star` next to the connection name and
always appear at the top of the connections list.

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

To connect to a saved or favorite deployment, hover over the name of the
connection in the :guilabel:`Connections` list, then click "Connect". 
Once you connect, Compass shows a success toast and displays a green dot 
next to the connection name. 

If a connection error occurs, Compass shows a toast with error
information and displays a red triangle next to the connection name. To
see additional error information, click :guilabel:`Review` in the error
toast. 

To add a new connection to Compass, click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button at
the top of the :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` to open the
:guilabel:`New Connection` modal. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

To switch between connections, click the name of the connection you want
to interact with to open the :guilabel:`Databases` tab. When you open a
database, MongoDB opens a new tab and labels it with the name of the
MongoDB instance that contains that database. For more information about
the :guilabel:`Databases` tab and instructions on viewing a database,
see :ref:`Databases <compass-database-tab>`.

Connection Options
------------------

To see connection options, hover over the name of the connection in the
:guilabel:`Connections` list. Then, click on the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h`
icon to open a menu with the following items:

- View :ref:`performance metrics <performance-tab>`
- Show connection information
- Refresh databases
- Disconnect
- Copy connection string
- Favorite (or Unfavorite)
- Duplicate
- Remove

To open the MongoDB Shell, click the :icon-lg:`Shell` icon on the right
of the connection name.
