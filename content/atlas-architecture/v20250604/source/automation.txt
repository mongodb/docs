|service-fullname| provides tools that enable programmatic management of the deployment, 
scaling, and maintenance of your Atlas {+clusters+}. 
{+service+} provides the flexibility to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using either imperative or declarative programming.
For example, developers can write imperative scripts that call functions from our {+atlas-go-sdk+} client, 
or manage {+service+} resources using declarative {+iac+} tools like the {+ak8so+}, Terraform, {+aws-cf+}, or the {+aws-cdk+}. 

{+service+}'s {+iac+} tools are especially useful at the enterprise scale. 
We recommend that our enterprise customers use {+iac+} tools for the following benefits: 

- **Consistency**: {+iac+} tools enable repeatability across environments, so that deployments
  generate consistent results. 
- **Scalability**: {+iac+} tools enable :ref:`auto-scaling <arch-center-scalability>` to automatically adjust 
  the tier or storage capacity of {+clusters+} in response to real-time use. 
- **Reduced Human Error**: {+iac+} tools automate operational overhead, reducing manual interventions 
  that produce common human errors.
- **Faster Development**: {+iac+} tools streamline operations to promote more efficient development. 
- **Improved Change Management**: {+iac+} tools support reviews and standardization of infrastructure,
  allowing for better change management practices and compliance. 

Features for Atlas Automation
-----------------------------

You can automate the configuration, provisioning, and management of
|service| building blocks like database users and roles, and |service|
{+clusters+}, projects, and organizations. You can also automate
various configuration and management tasks for {+cluster+} resources, including 
enabling auto-scaling compute and storage, creating and updating
multi-cloud {+clusters+}, monitoring {+cluster+} performance and health,
automating backups and restores, defining backup policies, and more.

You can align your choice of tools with your preferred workflow to
ensure seamless integration of |service-fullname| into your existing
processes. The following |service-fullname| tools allow you to easily
deploy and manage |service| at scale with repeatable, accurate, and
scalable processes. 

{+atlas-admin-api+} 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides a |rest|\ful interface that allows you
to leverage your preferred client such as cURL or Postman to
directly interact with |api| endpoints that correspond to |service|
resources. They can also be directly called in your favorite
programming language or bash script.

To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-admin-api-access`.

{+atlas-cli+} 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables you to manually or programmatically create, manage, and automate
tasks related to |service| resources from a unified command line tool.

To learn more, see the following resources:

- :ref:`Atlas CLI <atlascli>`
- :ref:`Quick Start <atlas-cli-quick-start>`
- :ref:`atlas-cli-ephemeral-cluster`

You can also use the {+atlas-cli+}
examples in the {+atlas-arch-center+} such as the :ref:`Org, Project,
and Cluster<arch-center-hierarchy>` examples to get started.

.. _arch-center-iac:

HashiCorp Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provisions |service| resources across cloud providers (|aws|, |azure|,
|gcp|) in the workflow of your choice. It allows you to integrate
|service| into your continuous delivery workflows with the official
plugin.

Alternatively, you can use the :abbr:`CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for
Terraform)` to deploy |service| in preferred languages such as
JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go. 

To learn more, see :ref:`getting-started-terraform` and the
`MongoDB Atlas Provider Terraform docs <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs>`__. You can also use the Terraform examples in the
{+atlas-arch-center+} such as the :ref:`Org, Project, and
Cluster<arch-center-hierarchy>` examples to get started. 

.. include:: /includes/complete-examples.rst

{+atlas-go-sdk+} Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-go-sdk+} client simplifies interaction with the
{+atlas-admin-api+} by providing pre-built functions and full |api|
endpoint coverage. The SDK provides platform-specific and GoLang
language-specific tools, libraries, and documentation to help build
applications quickly and easily.  

To learn more, see :ref:`Atlas Go SDK <atlas-admin-sdk>`.

CloudFormation Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resources to manage |service| include:
      
- :github:`JSON and YAML templates
  <mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/tree/master/examples>` allow you to leverage
  multiple different types of |service| resources in the |aws|
  CloudFormation Public Registry.   
- `AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) <https://constructs.dev/search?q=&keywords=MongoDB&offset=0&tags=mongodb-published>`__
  defines infrastructure using familiar programming languages such as
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go. 

To learn more, see `Deploy MongoDB Atlas with AWS CloudFormation <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deploy-mongodb-atlas-aws-cloudformation/>`__.

|ak8so| 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows you to deploy and manage |service| resources using you existing
Kubernetes tools. The Operator enables management of |service| through
custom resources applied into Kubernetes, which the Operator uses to
configure |service|.  

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-ref`.

Recommendations for {+service+} Automation
------------------------------------------

If you already have an existing tool integrated into your deployment
workflow that you use today, we recommend that you use that tool for
automation. For example, if your developers and operations team are
already deploying to Kubernetes, apply {+service+} configurations through
the same tooling and pipelines and use the |ak8so| to automate updating
{+service+}. 

If you don't already have an existing tool integrated into your
development workflow, we recommend an :ref:`IaC tool <arch-center-iac>` 
because they provide more robust options for infrastructure provisioning
and state management.

You can also use a combination of multiple tools. For example, use {+iac+}
tools for provisioning and state management, and leverage the
{+atlas-admin-api+}, {+atlas-go-sdk+}, and {+atlas-cli+} for quick administrative
tasks that are ephemeral in nature. The {+atlas-cli+} is great for
local development as well as integration into a suite of tests as part
of your CI/CD pipeline for application development because it improves
response times and reduces costs.
