================================================
Convert a Standalone mongod to a Replica Set
================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


A :term:`standalone` :binary:`mongod` instance is useful for testing and
development. A standalone instance isn't a good choice for a production
deployment because it can be a single point of failure. A :ref:`replica
set <replication>`, also known as a *cluster*, provides redundancy and
availability. Always use a replica set in production.

If you have a standalone server with data that you want to use in
production, convert the standalone server to a replica set first. 

.. important::

   If you convert a development server to a replica set for production
   use, consult the :ref:`security checklist <security-checklist>`
   before you expose your cluster to the internet. 

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you convert your standalone instance, consider whether a
:ref:`replica set <replication>` or a :ref:`sharded cluster
<sharding-background>` is more appropriate for your workload.

A sharded cluster is a special kind of cluster. A sharded cluster
provides redundancy and availability; it also distributes data across
:ref:`shards <shards-concepts>`. Shards are usually hosted on multiple
servers and allow for horizontal scaling.


Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Shut down the standalone instance.

      Use :binary:`mongosh` to :ref:`connect <mdb-shell-connect>` to
      your ``mongod`` instance.

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongosh

      Switch to the ``admin`` database and run :dbcommand:`shutdown`.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use admin
         db.adminCommand( 
            {
               shutdown: 1,
               comment: "Convert to cluster"
            }
         )      

   .. step:: Name the replica set. 
        
      If you configure your ``mongod`` instance from the command line,
      use the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option to set a
      name for your replica set.

      A typical command line invocation might include:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Purpose
           - Option

         * - Cluster name
           - :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
      
         * - Network details
           -  :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
      
         * - Data path
           - :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
       
         * - Authentication details 
           - :option:`--authenticationDatabase <mongosh
             --authenticationDatabase>`, :option:`--username
             <mongosh --username>`, :option:`--password <mongosh
             --password>`
      
      Update the example code with the settings for your deployment.

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongod --replSet rs0 \
                --port 27017 \ 
                --dbpath /path/to/your/mongodb/dataDirectory \
                --authenticationDatabase "admin" \
                --username "adminUserName" \
                --password

      If you use a configuration file to start ``mongodb``, add a
      ``replication`` section to your configuration file. Edit the
      ``replSetName`` value to set the name of your replica set. 

      .. code-block:: shell

         replication:
            replSetName: rs0              

   .. step:: Initialize the replica set.
    
       To initialize the replica set, use ``mongosh`` to reconnect to
       your server instance. Then, run :method:`rs.initiate()
       <rs.initiate>`.

       .. code-block:: javascript

          rs.initiate()

       You only have to initiate the replica set once.

       To view the replica set configuration, use :method:`rs.conf()`.
       
       To check the status of the replica set, use :method:`rs.status()`.

   .. step:: Add nodes to the replica set.

      The new replica set has a single, primary node. The next step is
      to add new nodes to the replica set. Review the documentation on
      clusters before you add additional nodes:

      - :ref:`Replica set architectures
        <replica-set-deployment-overview>`
      - :ref:`Adding members to a replica set
        <server-replica-set-deploy-expand>`

      When you are ready to add nodes, use :method:`rs.add()`.
