- Uses a compound :pipeline:`$search` stage to:

  - Specify that ``address.location`` results ``must`` be within 
    a ``Polygon`` defined by a set of ``coordinates``.

  - Give preference to results for properties of type ``condominium``.

- Uses a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

  - Exclude all fields except ``name``, ``address`` and ``property_type``.

  - Add a relevance ``score`` to each returned document.
