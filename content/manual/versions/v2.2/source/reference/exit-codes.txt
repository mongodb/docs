MongoDB will return one of the following codes and statuses when
exiting. Use this guide to interpret logs and when troubleshooting
issues with :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

.. error:: 0

   Returned by MongoDB applications upon successful exit.

   .. symbol: EXIT_CLEAN

.. error:: 2

   The specified options are in error or are incompatible
   with other options.

   .. symbol: EXIT_BADOPTIONS 2

.. error:: 3

   Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` if there is a mismatch between hostnames
   specified on the command line and in the :data:`local.sources`
   collection. :binary:`~bin.mongod` may also return this status if
   :term:`oplog` collection in the ``local`` database is not readable.

   .. symbol: EXIT_REPLICATION_ERROR = 3

.. error:: 4

   The version of the database is different from the version supported
   by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` (or :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`) instance.  The
   instance exits cleanly.  Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
   :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>` option to upgrade the
   database to the version supported by this :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance.

   .. symbol: EXIT_NEED_UPGRADE = 4

   receives a Control-C, Close, Break or Shutdown event.

   .. symbol: EXIT_KILL = 12

.. error:: 14

   error, an uncaught exception or uncaught signal.  The system exits
   without performing a clean shut down.

.. error:: 20

   *Message:* ``ERROR: wsastartup failed <reason>``

   Returned by MongoDB applications on Windows following an error in the

    .. symbol: EXIT_NET_ERROR = 48
