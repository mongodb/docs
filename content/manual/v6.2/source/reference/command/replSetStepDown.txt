Description

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   .. |command-method| replace:: command
   .. |stepdown-secs| replace:: ``replSetStepDown: <seconds>``
   .. |behavior-ref| replace:: :ref:`replSetStepDown-behavior`

   .. include:: /includes/stepdown-intro.rst

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`rs.stepDown` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   The :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` can only run on the ``admin`` database.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
      { 
        replSetStepDown: <seconds>,
        secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: <seconds>,
        force: <true|false>
      } 
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``replSetStepDown``
     - number
     - The number of seconds to step down the primary, during which time the
       stepdown member is ineligible for becoming primary. If you specify a
       non-numeric value, the command uses ``60`` seconds.
       
       The stepdown period starts from the time that the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` receives the command. The stepdown period must
       be greater than the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs``.
 
   * - ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs``
     - number
     - Optional. The number of seconds that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will wait for
       an electable secondary to catch up to the primary.
       
       When specified, ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` overrides the default
       wait time of either ``10`` seconds or if ``force: true``, ``0``
       seconds.
       
   * - ``force``
     - boolean
     - Optional. A boolean that determines whether the primary steps down if no electable
       and up-to-date secondary exists within the wait period.
       
       If ``true``, the primary steps down even if no suitable secondary
       member exists; this could lead to :doc:`rollbacks
       </core/replica-set-rollbacks>` if a secondary with replication lag
       becomes the new primary.
       
       If ``false``, the primary does not step down if no suitable secondary
       member exists and the command returns an error.
       
       Defaults to ``false``.

Behavior

Examples
--------

Step Down with Default Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds.

The operation waits up to the default ``10`` seconds for a
secondary to catch up. If no suitable secondary exists, the primary
does not step down and the command errors.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/rs-stepdown-write-fail.rst


.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120 } )

Specify Wait Time for Secondary Catch Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds, waiting up to ``15`` seconds for
an electable secondary to catch up. If no suitable secondary exists,
the primary does not step down and the command errors.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/rs-stepdown-write-fail.rst


.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120, secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: 15 } )

Specify Secondary Catch Up with Force Step Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds, waiting up to ``15`` seconds for
an electable secondary to catch up. Because of the ``force: true``
option, the primary steps down even if no suitable secondary exists.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120, secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: 15, force: true } )
