Overview
--------

The {+driver-short+} uses the `context package
<https://pkg.go.dev/context>`__ from the Go standard library to allow
applications to signal timeouts and cancellations for any **blocking method**
call. A blocking method relies on an external event, such as a network
input or output, to proceed with its task.

An example of a blocking method is the ``InsertOne()``
method. If you want to perform an insert operation on a ``Collection``
within 10 seconds, you can use a Context with a timeout. If the
operation doesn't complete within the timeout, the method returns
an error.

.. code-block:: go

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    client.Database("db").Collection("items").InsertOne(ctx, bson.D{{"x",1}})
    
If the Context passed into an operation does not have a deadline, you
can set a ``Timeout`` option on your ``Client`` and the operation
derives the timeout specification from this setting. To learn more
about using the single timeout setting, see the
:ref:`golang-timeout-setting` in the Connection Options guide.

Expiration
----------

The driver considers a Context expired when an operation exceeds its
timeout or is canceled. The driver checks the Context expiration with
the ``Done()`` method.

The following sections describe when and how the driver checks for
expiration.

Server Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver might block a method call if it can't select a server for
an operation.

In this scenario, the driver loops until it finds a server to use for the
operation. After each iteration, the driver returns a server selection
timeout error if the Context expired or the selection process took
longer than the ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS`` setting.

To learn more about how the driver selects a server, see the
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior`.

Connection Checkout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver might block a method call if there are no available
connections to check out.

After selecting a server, the driver tries to check out a connection
from the server's connection pool. If the Context expires while checking
out a connection, the method returns a timeout error.

Connection Establishment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver might block a method call if it must create a new
connection.

When the driver creates a new connection to perform an operation, the
Context sets a timeout for the establishment process. The driver sets the
timeout to either the Context expiration or connection timeout, whichever is
shorter.

The following example sets the connection timeout to *1* second and the
Context deadline to *2* seconds. Because the connection timeout is
shorter, the establishment process expires after *1* second.

.. code-block:: go
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 5

    opts := options.Client()
    opts.SetConnectTimeout(1*time.Second)
    client, err := mongo.Connect(opts)

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    client.Database("<db>").Collection("<collection>").InsertOne(ctx, bson.D{{"x",1}})

Socket Read and Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the driver retrieves a connection for an operation, it sets the
socket’s read or write deadline to either the Context deadline or socket
timeout, whichever is shorter.

If you cancel the Context after the execution of the ``Read()`` or
``Write()`` method but before its deadline, the behavior of the driver
differs based on version.

The driver generates a separate goroutine to listen for Context
cancellation when the ``Read()`` or ``Write()`` method is in progress.
If the goroutine detects a cancellation, it closes the connection. The
pending ``Read()`` or ``Write()`` method returns an error which the
driver overwrites with the ``context.Canceled`` error.

.. important::

    In versions prior to 1.5.0, the driver doesn't detect the Context
    cancellation and waits for the ``Read()`` or ``Write()`` method to
    return.
