program: mongo
name: shell
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Enables the shell interface. If you invoke the {{program}} command
  and specify a JavaScript file as an argument, or use :option:`--eval` to
  specify JavaScript on the command line, the {{role}} option
  provides the user with a shell prompt after the file finishes executing.

program: mongo
name: port
directive: option
args: <port>
description: |
  Specifies the port where the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`

  {{program}} attempts to connect to port ``27017``.
optional: true

program: mongo
name: host
directive: option
args: <hostname>
description: |
  Specifies the name of the host machine where the :program:`mongod` or
  :program:`mongos` is running. If this is not specified,
  {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB process running on
  the localhost.
optional: true
---
program: mongo
name: eval
directive: option
args: <javascript>
description: |
  Evaluates a JavaScript expression that is specified as an argument.
  {{program}} does not load its own environment when evaluating code.
  As a result many options of the shell environment are not available.

  description: |
    Specifies a password with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
    that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the :option:`--username`
    and :option:`--authenticationDatabase` options. To force {{program}} to

program: mongo
name: <db address>
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Specifies the "database address" of the database to connect to. For
  example:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo admin

  The above command will connect the {{program}} shell to the
  :term:`admin database` on the local machine. You may specify a remote
  database instance, with the resolvable hostname or IP address. Separate
  the database name from the hostname using a ``/`` character. See the
  following examples:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo mongodb1.example.net
     mongo mongodb1/admin
     mongo 10.8.8.10/test

  This syntax is the *only* way to connect to a specific database. 

  To specify alternate hosts and a database, you must use this syntax and cannot
  use :option:`--host` or :option:`--port`.
optional: true

program: mongo

  Specifies a JavaScript file to run and then exit. Generally this should
  be the last option specified.

  .. optional:: To specify a JavaScript file to execute *and* allow
     {{program}} to prompt you for a password using
     :option:`--password`, pass the filename as the first parameter with
     :option:`--username` and :option:`--password` as the last options, as
     in the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongo file.js --username username --password

  Use the :option:`--shell` option to return to a shell after the file
  finishes running.

program: mongo
name: ssl
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.2

  Enables connection to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  SSL support enabled.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

program: mongo
name: sslPEMKeyFile
args: <filename>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the ``--ssl`` option to connect
  to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  :setting:`~net.ssl.CAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`~net.ssl.weakCertificateValidation`.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

program: mongo
name: sslPEMKeyPassword
args: <value>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  ``--sslPEMKeyFile``). Use the {{role}} option only if the
  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6
     If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not
     specify the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a
     passphrase. See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

program: mongo
name: sslFIPSMode

directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Directs the {{program}} to use the FIPS mode of the installed OpenSSL
  library. Your system must have a FIPS compliant OpenSSL library to use
  the {{role}} option.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: mongo
name: sslAllowInvalidCertificates
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the
  :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB logs as a
  warning the use of the invalid certificate.
