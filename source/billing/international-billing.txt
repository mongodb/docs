Strong Customer Authentication
------------------------------

|sca| is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make
online payments more secure. All payment service providers are required
to build additional authentication into their checkout flow once |sca|
goes into effect. Customers in European Economic Area (EEA) may be
required to authenticate their credit cards depending on the card's
issuer, starting September 14, 2019. If your credit card issuer
requires authentication, review the following
:ref:`sca-auth-process-cm` to continue paying for |cloud| seamlessly
with a credit card.

Marketing emails have been sent out to affected customers announcing
the policy change and the steps necessary to comply with |sca|.

To authenticate your credit card to comply with Strong Customer
Authentication:

Existing users can edit their :guilabel:`Payment Method` to
authenticate a new credit card or reauthenticate an existing credit
card to comply with |sca|. To learn more, see
:ref:`cm-billing-profile`.

Failed Payment Email
````````````````````

|cloud-short| sends an email after a payment failure with a link to
your invoices. Existing users can authenticate a credit card when
retrying a failed payment. To retry the failed payment from the failed
payment email:

VAT ID Number
-------------

If your organization's billing or invoice address falls within the
European Union, add your |vat| ID Number on the
:guilabel:`Payment Method` or the :guilabel:`Billing Profile` modal.

|mms| displays the |vat| field only if you select a country other
than the United States.
