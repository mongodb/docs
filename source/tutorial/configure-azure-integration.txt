Overview
--------

You can configure |mms| to integrate with Microsoft Azure to provision
servers directly through |mms|. Servers provisioned through |mms| come
with the Automation Agent pre-installed and are ready for deployment of
MongoDB instances.

Prerequisites
-------------

When configuring |mms| for Azure provisioning, you must have:

- Access to your Azure account so that you can upload the |mms| management
  certificate to the account.
