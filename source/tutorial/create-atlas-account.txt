===========================
Create an |service| Account
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page

   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

You will first need to register an |service| account to host your 
data.

Procedure
---------

Register for an account on the |service-fullname|_ landing page. Once 
you register, |service| automatically creates a default
:doc:`organization and project </organizations-projects>` where you
can deploy your first cluster. You can add additional organizations
and projects later.

.. admonition:: |mms-full| Users
   :class: note

   If you are an existing |mms-full| user, you can use your |mms|
   credentials to log in to |service|_. You can then create a new
   |service| project from |mms|. 
   
   Once you have created your |service| project, you can move on to the
   next section.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have an |service| account, proceed to 
:doc:`Deploy a Free Tier Cluster </tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster>`.
