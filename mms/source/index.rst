MMS (MongoDB Monitoring Service) Documentation
==============================================

MMS (MongoDB Monitoring Service) is a service created by 10gen for
monitoring MongoDB deployments. MMS Collects statistics on all key

intuitive web interface.

This manual describes the installation of the MMS agent and operation
of the MMS web console. You can find answers to common questions in
the FAQs, but for all other inquiries please feel free to `open a JIRA
ticket <https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=10181>`_.
