Starting in 1.1, ``mongosync`` supports inclusion filters to specify which
databases and collections to include in sync.  Starting in 1.6, ``mongosync``
also supports exclusion filters and regular expressions.

- With inclusion filters, ``mongosync`` syncs matching
  databases and collections.
- With exclusion filters, ``mongosync`` syncs all databases
  and collections, except for those that match the filters.
- With both inclusion and exclusion filters, ``mongosync`` only syncs
  databases and collections that match the inclusion filters then excludes
  any that also match the exclusion filters.
- With no filters, ``mongosync`` syncs all databases and collections.

.. _c2c-filter-syntax:

Filter Syntax
-------------

The :ref:`c2c-api-start` API endpoint accepts two fields that configure 
filtered sync: ``includeNamespaces`` and ``excludeNamespaces``.
Each field takes an array of filters that specify the databases and collections 
to include or exclude from sync.

.. note::

   If the :ref:`c2c-api-start` call uses both ``includeNamespaces`` and 
   ``excludeNamespaces`` parameters, ``mongosync`` first matches databases
   and collections from the inclusion filters, then excludes those that
   also match an exclusion filter.

Filters have the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   "includeNamespaces": [
       {
          "database": "<database-name>",
          "collections": [
             "<collection-name>"
          ]
          "databaseRegex": {
             "pattern": "<regex-pattern>",
             "options": "<options>"
          },
          "collectionsRegex": {
             "pattern": "<regex-pattern>",
             "options": "<options>"
          }
       }
    ],
    "excludeNamespaces": [
       {
          "database": "<database-name>",
          "collections": [
             "<collection-name>"
          ]
          "databaseRegex": {
             "pattern": "<regex-pattern>",
             "options": "<options>"
          },
          "collectionsRegex": {
             "pattern": "<regex-pattern>",
             "options": "<options>"
          }
       }
    ]

Filters must include either the ``database`` field or the ``databaseRegex`` field.

If you need the filter to match specific collections, you can use either 
the ``collections`` array to specify collections individually or define 
a regular expression using the ``collectionsRegex`` field.

.. _c2c-configure-filter:

Configure a Filter
------------------

.. important::

   Once you start ``mongosync`` with a filter in place, the filter
   cannot be modified. If you do need to create a new filter,
   see: :ref:`c2c-change-filter`.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify Databases and Collections.

      Identify the databases and collections that you want to sync to
      the destination cluster. 

      - When you add a set of databases to the filter, you also exclude any
        other databases in the cluster.
      
      - When you specify a collection in your filter, you also exclude any
        other collections that are in the same database.

   .. step:: Create a Filter.

      The :ref:`c2c-api-start` API accepts two parameters that configure
      optional filters: 
      
      - The ``includeNamespaces`` parameter takes an array of filters, which
        are used to determines which databases and collections ``mongosync`` 
        should include in the sync.
      - The ``excludeNamespaces`` parameter takes an array of filters, which
        are used to determine which databases and collections ``mongosync``
        should exclude from the sync.
     
      If you don't specify a filter, ``mongosync`` performs a full cluster
      sync.

      Create inclusion and/or exclusion filters to identify the databases and
      collections you want to sync.

      For example, this inclusion filter would configure ``mongosync`` to only
      sync collections whose names begin with ``accounts_`` from the ``sales`` 
      database, except for the ``accounts_old`` collection:

      .. code-block:: json

         "includeNamespaces": [
            {
               "database": "sales",
               "collectionsRegex": {
                  "pattern": "^accounts_.+?$",
                  "options": "ms"
               }
         ],
         "excludeNamespaces": [
             {
                 "database": "sales",
                 "collections": [
                     "accounts_old"
                 ]
             }
         ]

      For more information on filters, see :ref:`c2c-filter-syntax`. 

   .. step:: Use the Filter.

      To use the filter, attach the filter json when you make the
      :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` API call to begin syncing.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/start-filtered.sh
         :language: bash

For an example configuration, see: :ref:`c2c-example-start-with-filter`.

.. _c2c-change-filter:

Replace an Existing Filter
--------------------------

You cannot update an existing filter. You must stop the ongoing sync
process, prepare the destination cluster, and restart ``mongosync`` with
a new filter. 

When ``mongosync`` ran your original filter, it created databases with
your data ("user databases") and the
``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use`` system database on the
destination cluster. You must remove those databases before restarting
``mongosync`` with your new filter.

Follow these steps to prepare the destination cluster for a new filter.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Remove ``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use``.

      a. Stop the ``mongosync`` process. 
      
      #. Connect to the destination cluster with :binary:`mongosh`. If
         the destination is a sharded cluster, connect to the
         :binary:`mongos` instance. If the destination is a replica set,
         connect to the primary :binary:`mongod` instance.

      #. Drop the ``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use`` system
         database.

         .. code-block:: javascript
          
            use mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use
            db.dropDatabase()

   .. step:: Remove user databases.

      a. List the databases in the cluster

         .. code-block:: javascript
          
            show databases

      #. Remove user databases. The ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config``
         databases are system databases. You should not edit these
         system databases without instructions from MongoDB support. 
         
         If the ``show databases`` command lists any user databases on
         the destination cluster, you must remove them.

         Repeat this step for each user database list:

         .. code-block:: javascript
          
            use <user database name>
            db.dropDatabase()

         Note: After the first :method:`db.dropDatabase()` operation
         completes, you may need to run it a second time to remove the
         database.

   .. step:: Configure a new filter.

      a. Decide which databases and collections you want to filter on.
         Add the databases and collections to the ``includeNamespaces``
         array. For configuration details, see
         :ref:`c2c-configure-filter`.

      #. Run ``mongosync`` to :ref:`reconnect <c2c-conn-top-level>` to
         the source and destination clusters.

      #. Use the ``/start`` API end point to start syncing. Be sure to 
         attach your new filter when you call ``/start``.

.. _c2c-filter-renaming-collections:

Adding and Renaming Collections
-------------------------------

You can, with some restrictions, add or :method:`rename a collection
<db.collection.renameCollection>` during a filtered sync.

.. warning::

   If your renaming operation violates the renaming restrictions,
   ``mongosync`` stops syncing and reports an error.

   To clean up and restart after an error, follow the steps to
   :ref:`replace an existing filter <c2c-change-filter>`.

Adding and Renaming Within a Single Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add new collections or rename an existing collection if the
entire database is part of the filter. 

You can also rename a collection if the old name and the new name are
both specified in the filter. 

See the :ref:`renaming examples <c2c-example-rename-while-syncing>`.

Renaming Across Different Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only rename a collection across databases if the entire target
database is part of a filter. If the filter specifies individual
collections in the target database, renaming across databases does not
work.

See the :ref:`renaming examples <c2c-example-rename-while-syncing>`.


.. _c2c-filter-with-out:

Filtering with mapReduce and $out
---------------------------------

To use the :pipeline:`$out` aggregation stage or
the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command (when set to create
or replace a collection) with filtering, you must 
filter the whole database and not just
the specified collection.

For example, consider this aggregation pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript

      use library
      db.books.aggregate( [
         { $group : { _id : "$author", titles: { $push: "$title" } } },
         { $out : "authors" }
      ] )

The ``$out`` stage creates the ``authors`` collection in the ``library``
database. If you want to sync the ``authors`` collection, you must
specify the entire ``library`` database in your filter. The filter will
not work if you only specify the ``authors`` collection.

This filter works:

.. code-block:: json

   "includeNamespaces": [
     {
       "database": "library"
     }
   ]

This filter does not work: 

.. code-block:: json

   "includeNamespaces": [
     {
       "database": "library",
       "collections": [ "authors", "books" ]  // DOES NOT WORK WITH $OUT
     }
   ]
