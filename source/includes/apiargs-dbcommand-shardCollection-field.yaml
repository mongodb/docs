  The index specification document to use as the shard key. The shard
  key determines how MongoDB distributes the documents among the shards.

  Unless the collection is empty, the index must exist prior to the
  :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command. If the collection is empty,
  MongoDB creates the index prior to sharding the collection if the
  index that can support the shard key does not already exist.

  When ``true``, the ``unique`` option ensures that the underlying index
  enforces a unique constraint. Hashed shard keys do not support unique
  constraints. Defaults to ``false``.

  Specifies the number of chunks to create
  initially when sharding an *empty* collection with a :ref:`hashed
  shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB will then create and
  balance chunks across the cluster. The ``numInitialChunks`` must be
  less than ``8192`` per shard. If the collection is not empty,
  ``numInitialChunks`` has no effect.

  If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
  has a default :doc:`collation </reference/collation>`,
  you *must* include a collation document with
  ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or
  the ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
  whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
  collation.
