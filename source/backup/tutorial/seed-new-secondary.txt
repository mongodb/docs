Seed a New Secondary from Backup Restore
========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When a natural synchronization of a new secondary host costs too much time or
resources, seeding a secondary from a backup restore is a faster better
alternative. Seeding also does not hit a live mongo instance to retrieve data.

Prerequisites
-------------

To seed a secondary from a backup restore file, you must have:

- A backup restore file.

- The :file:`seedSecondary.sh` file included in the backup restore file.

Considerations
--------------

The seedSecondary.sh file will not be in the backup restore if you have
blacklisted dbs or collections or have resynced your backup after the snapshot
(or for config servers). In these cases, including the script would cause an
inconsistent secondary. In the case of a blacklist, your secondary would not
include some collections which would cause problems for your deployment.

Seeding a new secondary from a backup restore requires an oplog window on the
current primary that spans back to the snapshot's timestamp.
