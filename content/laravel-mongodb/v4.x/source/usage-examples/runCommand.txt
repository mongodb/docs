You can run a MongoDB command directly on a database by calling the ``command()``
method on a database connection instance.

To run a command, call the ``command()`` method and pass it a document that
contains the command and its parameters.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions on the database connection
instance that uses the ``sample_mflix`` database:

- Creates a database connection instance that references the ``sample_mflix`` 
  database
- Specifies a command to retrieve a list of collections and views in the
  ``sample_mflix``  database
- Prints the value of the ``name`` field of each result returned by the command

The example calls the ``command()`` method to run the ``listCollections`` command. This method
returns a cursor that contains a result document for each collection in the database.
