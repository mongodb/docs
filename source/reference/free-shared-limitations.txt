Operational Limitations
-----------------------

The following table lists the operational limitations of |service|
``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Configuration Option
     - Limitation

   * - :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>`
     - |service| ``M0`` Free Tier clusters do not support the
       ``allowDiskUse`` option for the
       :manual:`aggregation command </reference/command/aggregate>`
       or its
       :manual:`helper method </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`.

       On Free Tier and shared clusters, aggregation fields that represent
       database and collection names (such as :manual:`$merge
       </reference/operator/aggregation/merge/>` into and
       :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out/>` values) cannot
       accept :manual:`expressions
       </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#aggregation-expressions>` as values.

       - ``M0``: 100 per second
       - ``M2``: 200 per second
       - ``M5``: 500 per second

   * - Query Utilization
     - The percentage of time that a query is running over any five
       minute period must remain under 100% on ``M0`` Free Tier and
       ``M2/M5`` shared clusters .

   * - Connections
     - ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters are allowed a
       maximum of 500 connections.

   * - Data Transfer Limits

     - ``M0/M2/M5`` clusters limit the total data transferred into
       or out of the cluster as follows:

       - ``M2``: 20 GB in and 20 GB out per week

       - ``M5``: 50 GB in and 50 GB out per week

       |service| throttles the network speed of clusters which
