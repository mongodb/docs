  To deploy a cross-region cluster, toggle
  :guilabel:`Configure clusters across multiple regions (M10 and up)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  .. admonition:: AWS Only
     :class: note

     If this is the first ``M10+`` dedicated paid cluster for the selected
     region or regions *and* you plan on creating one or more :abbr:`VPC
     peering connections`, please review the documentation on :doc:`VPC
     Peering Connections </security-vpc-peering>` before continuing.

  The following options are available when configuring cross-region
  clusters:

  .. _deploy-across-multiple-regions:

  :guilabel:`Deploy across multiple regions`
     Click :guilabel:`Add a node` to add a new row for region selection
     and select the region from the dropdown. Specify the desired
     number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region.

     The first row lists the :guilabel:`Preferred Region`. |service|
     prioritizes nodes in the preferred region for primary elegibility.

     .. admonition:: Backup Data Center Location
        :class: note

        If this is the first cluster in the project *and* you
        intend to enable
        :ref:`continuous snapshot backups <create-cluster-backups>`,
        |service| selects the backup data center location for the
        project based on the geographical location of the
        cluster's :guilabel:`Preferred Region`. See
        :doc:`Backup a Cluster </backup-cluster>` for more information.

     When selecting a :guilabel:`Region`, regions marked as
     :guilabel:`Recommended` provide higher availability compared to
     other regions. For more information, see:

     - :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`.

     Each node in the selected regions can participate in
     :term:`elections <election>`, and can become the :term:`primary`
     as long as the majority of nodes in the replica set are available.
     The total number of electable nodes across all regions, excluding
     read-only regions, must be 3, 5, or 7.

     You can also use this option to increase the replication factor of
     single-region clusters by modifying the number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for
     your :guilabel:`Preferred Region` only. You do not have to add additional
     regions to modify the replication factor of your :guilabel:`Preferred
     Region`.

     To remove a region, click the :guilabel:`X` next to that region.
     You cannot remove the :guilabel:`Preferred Region`.

     |service| provides checks for whether your selected cross-regional
     configuration provides availability during partial or whole regional
     outages.

  .. _deploy-read-only-replicas:

  :guilabel:`Deploy read-only replicas`
     Click :guilabel:`Add a node` to deploy read-only nodes to the
     selected region.

     Each node in the region cannot participate in :term:`elections
     <election>`, and cannot become the :term:`primary`. Read-only regions do
     not provide high availability.

     To remove a read-only region, click the :guilabel:`X` next to that region.

  .. note::

     Having a large number of regions or having nodes spread across
     long distances may lead to long election times or replication lag.

content: |

  The cloud provider and region, or physical location, of your MongoDB
  cluster. The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
  options for the available instance sizes, network latency for clients
  accessing your cluster, and the :doc:`cost of running the cluster

ref: cluster-option-clusterInstance
content: |

  Select your preferred cluster instance size. The selected instance
  size dictates the  memory, storage, and IOPS specification for each
  data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the cluster.

  |service| categorizes the instance sizes into tiers as follows:

  :guilabel:`Shared Clusters`
    Sandbox replica set clusters for getting started with MongoDB.
    These instances deploy to a shared environment with access to a
    subset of |service| features and functionality. For complete
    documentation on shared cluster limits and restrictions,
    see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

    |service| provides an option to deploy
    one ``M0`` Free Tier replica set per project. You can
    :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an
    ``M2+`` paid cluster at any time.

    ``M2`` and ``M5`` instances are low-cost shared starter clusters
    with the same features and functionality as ``M0``, but with
    increased storage and the ability to deploy into a subset of regions
    on  Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and
    Microsoft Azure.

    .. admonition:: Beta
       :class: alert-info

       Support for ``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters is available as a Beta
       feature. These clusters do not yet support backups.

    .. note::

       * |service| deploys MongoDB 4.0 for all instances in the Shared
         Clusters tier. However, Shared Clusters do not support
         all functionality in MongoDB 4.0. See :ref:`atlas-free-tier`
         for details.

    |service| supports shared cluster deployment in a subset of
    Cloud Providers and Regions. |service| greys out any
    shared cluster instance sizes not supported by the selected
    cloud service provider and region. For a complete list of
    regions that support shared cluster deployments, see:

    - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
    - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
    - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Development Clusters`
    Instances that support development environments and low-traffic
    applications.

    These instances support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
    provide full access to |service| features and functionality.

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Production Clusters`
    Instances that support production environments with high traffic
    applications and large datasets.

    These instances support replica set and sharded cluster
    deployments with full access to |service| features and functionality.

    Some instances have variants, denoted by the |angle| character.
    When you select these instances, |service| lists the variants
    and tags each instance to distinguish their key characteristics.

    .. |angle| unicode:: U+276F

  .. _nvme-storage:

  :guilabel:`NVMe Storage on AWS`
    For applications which require low-latency and high-throughput IO,
    |service| offers storage options on AWS which leverage
    locally attached ephemeral :abbr:`NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)`
    :abbr:`SSDs (Solid State Drive)`. The following instance sizes
    have an NVMe option, with the size fixed at the cluster tier:

    - ``M40``
    - ``M50``
    - ``M60``
    - ``M80``
    - ``M200``
    - ``M400``

    Clusters with NVMe storage use :doc:`Cloud Provider Snapshots
    </backup/cloud-provider-snapshots>` for backup. Backup cannot
    be disabled for NVMe clusters.

    NVMe clusters use a :manual:`hidden secondary node
    </core/replica-set-hidden-member>` consisting of a provisioned
    volume with high throughput and IOPS to facilitate backup.

ref: cluster-option-customizeStorage
content: |

  Each cluster tier comes with a default set of resources.
  Select your preferred storage customizations under the
  :guilabel:`Customize Your Storage` heading.

  |service| can provide the following storage configuration options,
  depending on the selected cloud provider and instance size.

  - :guilabel:`Storage Capacity`
    The size of the server root volume. To change this, either:

    - Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
      disk size, *or*

    - Specify the exact disk size in the text box.

    Changes to storage capacity affects :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

  - :guilabel:`Cluster Class (AWS only)`
    Clusters of size M40 and larger on AWS offer multiple options,
    including:

    - :guilabel:`Low CPU`
    - :guilabel:`General`
    - :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD`

      Locally attached ephemeral :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>`
      offer the highest level of speed and performance.

    Select the :guilabel:`Class` box with your preferred speed.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-auto-expand-storage.rst

  - :guilabel:`Storage Speed (AWS only)`
    |service| clusters on AWS of size M30 and greater allow you to
    customize the maximum :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)`
    rate of your cluster. To provision the IOPS rate of your cluster,
    check the box marked :guilabel:`Provision IOPS` and either:

    - Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
      IOPS rate, *or*

    - Specify the exact IOPS rate in the text box.

    Changes to IOPS provisioning affect :ref:`cost
    <instance-storage-speed>`.

  .. _configuration-storage-considerations:

  .. important::

     For cluster tiers up to and including M40, |service| enforces a
     50:1 ratio of disk storage to RAM to facilitate consistent
     performance of clusters with large datasets. For cluster tiers of
     M50 and higher, the enforced ratio is 100:1. For example, to
     support 3 TB of disk storage you must select a cluster tier with
     at least 32 GB of RAM (M50 or higher).

     |service| has a 4 TB disk storage limit on all replica sets and
     shards, regardless of cluster tier. To expand total cluster
     storage beyond 4 TB, enable :ref:`sharding
     <cluster-option-sharding>`.

     For clusters with :guilabel:`Auto-Expand Storage` enabled,
     |service| respects the calculated maximum storage for the
     selected cluster tier. Users whose disk storage reaches the
     allowable limit receive notification by email.

  .. admonition:: Configure Encryption at Rest using your Key Management for your |service| Project
     :class: note

     You must configure the |service| project for Encryption at Rest
     using your Key Management before enabling the feature for your
     |service| clusters. To learn more,
     see :ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

     |service| supports the following Encryption at Rest providers:

     - :ref:`AWS Key Management Services <security-aws-kms>`
     - :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`

  .. important::

     If you want to switch from one Encryption at Rest provider on your
     cluster to another, you must first disable Encryption at Rest for
     your cluster, then re-enable it with your desired Encryption at
     Rest provider. See :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`.

  |service| encrypts all cluster storage and snapshot volumes,
  ensuring the security of all cluster data at rest
  (Encryption at Rest). |service|
  :authrole:`Project Owners <project Owner>` can configure
  an additional layer of encryption on their data at rest using the
  MongoDB
  :manual:`Encrypted Storage Engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
  and their |service|-compatible Encryption at Rest provider.

  To enable |service| Encryption at Rest for this cluster,
  toggle :guilabel:`Encryption At Rest with WiredTiger Encrypted Storage Engine (M10 and up)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  |service| Encryption at Rest using your Key Management supports
  ``M10`` or greater replica set clusters backed by
  :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` or
  :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` only.  Support for clusters deployed
  on Google Cloud Project (GCP) is in development. |service| Encryption
  at Rest supports encrypting :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` **only**.
  You cannot enable Encryption at Rest on a cluster using
  :ref:`backup-continuous`.

  |service| clusters using Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
  incur an increase to their hourly run cost. For more information on
  |service| billing for advanced security features, see
  :ref:`advanced-security`.

  .. important::

     If |service| cannot access the |service| project key management
     provider or the encryption key used to encrypt a cluster, then that
     cluster becomes inaccessible and unrecoverable.
     Exercise extreme caution before modifying, deleting, or disabling
     an encryption key or key management provider credentials used by
     |service|.

  You can configure the following :binary:`~bin.mongod` runtime options
  on ``M10+`` paid tier clusters:

  .. _set-oplog-size:

  :guilabel:`Set Oplog Size` :icon:`asterisk`
    Modify the :term:`oplog` size of the cluster. For sharded
    cluster deployments, this modifies the oplog size of each
    shard in the cluster. This option corresponds to modifying
    the :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB <replication.oplogSizeMB>`
    configuration file option for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the
    cluster.

    You can check the oplog size by connecting to your cluster
    via the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and authenticating as a user
    with the :authrole:`Atlas admin` role. Run the
    :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo() <rs.printReplicationInfo>` method
    to view the current oplog size and time.

    .. warning::

       Reducing the size of the oplog requires removing data from the
       oplog. |service| cannot access or restore any oplog
       entries removed as a result of oplog reduction. Consider the
       ramifications of this data loss before reducing the oplog.

  :guilabel:`Enforce Index Key Limit`
    Enable or disable enforcement of the 1024-byte index key limit.
    Documents can only be updated or inserted if, for all
    indexed fields on the target collection, the corresponding index
    entries do not exceed 1024 bytes. If disabled,
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes documents that breach the limit
    but does *not* index them. This option corresponds to
    modifying the
    :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong <param.failIndexKeyTooLong>`
    parameter via the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

  :guilabel:`Allow Server-Side JavaScript`
    Enable or disable execution of operations that perform server-side
    execution of JavaScript. This option corresponds to modifying
    the :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` configuration file option
    for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

  :guilabel:`Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version` :icon:`asterisk`
    Sets the minimum TLS version the cluster accepts for incoming
    connections. This option corresponds to configuring the
    :setting:`net.ssl.disabledProtocols` configuration file option
    for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

    .. admonition:: TLS 1.0 Deprecation
       :class: note

       For users considering this option as a method for enabling the
       deprecated Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 protocol version, please read
       :ref:`faq-tls-1.0-deprecation` before proceeding. |service|
       deprecation of TLS 1.0 improves your security of data-in-transit
       and aligns with industry best practices. Enabling TLS 1.0 for any
       |service| cluster carries security risks. Consider enabling TLS
       1.0 only for as long as required to update your application stack
       to support TLS 1.1 or later.

  :guilabel:`Require Indexes for All Queries`
    Enable or disable the execution of queries that require a collection
    scan to return results. This option corresponds to modifying the
    :parameter:`notablescan <param.notablescan>` parameter via the
    :dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in
    the cluster.

  :icon:`asterisk` |service| performs uses a rolling deployment process
  to apply modifications to these options. For sharded clusters,
  this involves a rolling restart of all shards and the config
  server replica set. To learn more about how |service| supports
  high availability during maintenance operations, see
  :ref:`high-availability`.
