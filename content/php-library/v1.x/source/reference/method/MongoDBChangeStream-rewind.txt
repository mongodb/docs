Definition
----------

.. phpmethod:: MongoDB\ChangeStream::rewind()

   Rewinds the change stream and attempts to load the first event.

   .. code-block:: php

      function rewind(): void

   This method should be called at the start of change stream iteration.

   .. note::

      Rewinding the change stream does not guarantee that there will be a
      current event to access. You should still call
      :phpmethod:`MongoDB\ChangeStream::valid()` to check for a current event
      at each step of iteration. After initially rewinding the change stream,
      :phpmethod:`MongoDB\ChangeStream::next()` should be used to iterate
      further.

Errors/Exceptions
-----------------

:php:`MongoDB\Driver\Exception\LogicException
<mongodb-driver-exception-logicexception>` if this method is called after a call
to :phpmethod:`MongoDB\ChangeStream::next()` (i.e. the underlying
:php:`MongoDB\Driver\Cursor <class.mongodb-driver-cursor>` has already been
advanced).
