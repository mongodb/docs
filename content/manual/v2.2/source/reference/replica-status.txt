The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` provides an overview of the
current status of a :term:`replica set`. Issue the following command against
the :term:`admin database`, in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { replSetGetStatus: 1 } )

You can also use the following helper in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
access this functionality

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status()

The value specified (e.g ``1`` above,) does not impact the output of
the command. Data provided by this command derives from data included
in heartbeats sent to the current instance by other members of the
replica set: because of the frequency of heartbeats, these data can be
several seconds out of date.

.. note::

   The :binary:`~bin.mongod` must have replication enabled and be a member
   of a replica set for the for :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` to
   return successfully.

.. seealso:: ":method:`rs.status()`" shell helper function,
   ":doc:`/replication`".

Fields
------

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.set

   The ``set`` value is the name of the replica set, configured in the
   :setting:`replSet` setting. This is the same value as
   :data:`~local.system.replset._id` in :method:`rs.conf()`.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.date

   The value of the ``date`` field is an :term:`ISODate` of the
   current time, according to the current server. Compare this to the
   value of the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat` to find the
   operational lag between the current host and the other hosts in the
   set.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.myState

   The value of :data:`~replSetGetStatus.myState` reflects state of the current
   replica set member. An integer between ``0`` and ``10`` represents
   the state of the member. These integers map to states, as described
   in the following table:

   .. include:: /includes/replica-states.rst

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members

   The ``members`` field holds an array that contains a document for
   every member in the replica set. See the ":ref:`Member Statuses
   <repl-set-member-statuses>`" for an overview of the values included
   in these documents.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.syncingTo

   The ``syncingTo`` field is only present on the output of
   :method:`rs.status()` on :term:`secondary` and recovering members,
   and holds the hostname of the member from which this instance is
   syncing.

.. _repl-set-member-statuses:

Member Statuses
---------------

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.name

   The ``name`` field holds the name of the server.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.self

   The ``self`` field is only included in the document for the
   current ``mongod`` instance in the members array. It's value is
   ``true``.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.errmsg

   This field contains the most recent error or status message received from
   the member. This field may be empty (e.g. ``""``) in some cases.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.health

   The ``health`` value is only present for the other members of the
   replica set (i.e. not the member that returns
   :method:`rs.status`.) This field conveys if the member is up
   (i.e. ``1``) or down (i.e. ``0``.)

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.state

   The value of the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state` reflects state of this
   replica set member. An integer between ``0`` and ``10`` represents
   the state of the member. These integers map to states, as described
   in the following table:

   .. include:: /includes/replica-states.rst

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.stateStr

   A string that describes :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state`.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.uptime

   The :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.uptime` field holds a value that reflects the number of
   seconds that this member has been online.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :method:`rs.status()` data.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime

   A document that contains information regarding the last operation
   from the operation log that this member has applied.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime.t

      A 32-bit timestamp of the last operation applied to this member
      of the replica set from the :term:`oplog`.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime.i

      An incremented field, which reflects the number of operations in
      since the last time stamp. This value only increases if there
      is more than one operation per second.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optimeDate

   An :term:`ISODate` formatted date string that reflects the last
   entry from the :term:`oplog` that this member applied. If this
   differs significantly from :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat` this
   member is either experiencing "replication lag" *or* there have not
   been any new operations since the last update. Compare
   ``members.optimeDate`` between all of the members of the set.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat

   The ``lastHeartbeat`` value provides an :term:`ISODate` formatted
   date of the last heartbeat received from this member. Compare this
   value to the value of the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.date` field to track
   latency between these members.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :method:`rs.status()` data.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.pingMS

   The ``pingMS`` represents the number of milliseconds (ms) that a
   round-trip packet takes to travel between the remote member and the
   local instance.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :method:`rs.status()` data.
