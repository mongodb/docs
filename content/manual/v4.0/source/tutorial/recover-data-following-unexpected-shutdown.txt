=================================================
Recover a Standalone after an Unexpected Shutdown
=================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


.. warning:: 

   The following procedure applies to standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance.

   Do not use this tutorial to recover a member of a :term:`replica
   set`. Instead, you should either restore from a :doc:`backup
   </core/backups>` or resync from another member of the set, as
   described in :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.

.. tip::

   .. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

Disk-level data corruption or missing data files can prevent
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance from starting, and journal files may be
insufficient to recover automatically:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   2018-10-24T18:05:18.248-0400 W STORAGE  [initandlisten] Detected unclean shutdown - mongod.lock is not empty.

   ...

   2018-10-24T17:24:53.122-0400 E STORAGE  [initandlisten] Failed to get the cursor for uri: table:collection-2-6854866147293273505
   2018-10-24T17:24:53.122-0400 E STORAGE  [initandlisten] This may be due to missing data files. ...

   ***aborting after fassert() failure

In such cases, your :setting:`~storage.dbPath` contains a non-empty
:file:`mongod.lock` file.

The following procedure uses :option:`mongod --repair` to recover from
these cases:

.. warning::

   Only use :option:`mongod --repair` (and the related operations
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command and
   :method:`db.repairDatabase()` method) if you have no other options.
   The operations remove and do not save any corrupt data during the
   repair process.
     
Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, for WiredTiger, :option:`mongod --repair`:

- Rebuilds all indexes.

- Discards corrupt data.

- Creates empty/stub files for missing data/metadata files.

For MMAPv1, :option:`mongod --repair`:

- Rebuilds all indexes.

- Discards corrupt data.

Procedure
---------

.. important::

   Run the repair operation as the same user that normally runs the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process to avoid changing the permissions of the
   MongoDB data files.

.. include:: /includes/steps/recover-data-with-repairpath.rst

.. note::

   For WiredTiger, if the repair fails to complete for any reason, you
   must restart the instance with the :option:`--repair <mongod
   --repair>` option to complete the repair.

.. [#manual-removal]

   Generally, you should not manually remove the ``mongod.lock`` file.
   Instead, use the above procedure to recover the database. In dire
   situations, you can remove the file, start the database using the
   possibly corrupt files, and attempt to recover data from the
   database. However, it is impossible to predict the state of the
   database in these situations.
