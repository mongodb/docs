Restore a Completed Snapshot
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To restore a :term:`snapshot`, |mms| creates and
displays a download link to the appropriate snapshot in
the snapshot storage.

After clicking the download link, |mms| streams the snapshot to the
target snapshot host.

      1. The user selects a snapshot:

         - Through the |mms| application:

           1. Click on a snapshot.
           #. Submit their request.

         - Through the :doc:`API </reference/api/restorejobs/get-one-single-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`:

           1. Find the cluster to restore.
           #. :doc:`Create new Restore Job </reference/api/restorejobs/create-one-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`
              for that cluster.

      #. |mms| creates a RestoreJob document.

      #. The :term:`Backup Daemon` service picks up the RestoreJob
         document and sets the status of this RestoreJob document to
         :guilabel:`Waiting for Customer...`.

      #. With the status set to :guilabel:`Waiting for Customer...`,
         |mms| creates a |url|.

      #. The user clicks the :guilabel:`get link` link, then
         :guilabel:`Download` in the |mms| application to
         download the :term:`snapshot`.

      #. |mms| sets the RestoreJob document status to
         :guilabel:`Transferring...` and starts streaming the
         :term:`snapshot` in the requested format from the
         :term:`Snapshot Store` to the target snapshot host. Each
         Snapshot Store streams its snapshot components through |mms|:

         - A :term:`blockstore <backup blockstore database>` streams
            the blocks.
         - An :term:`S3 snapshot store` streams the blocks.
         - A :term:`file system store` streams the files.
