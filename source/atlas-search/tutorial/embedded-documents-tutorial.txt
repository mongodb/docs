This tutorial demonstrates how to index and run |fts| queries 
against fields that are inside an array of documents, even when the array of
documents is nested itself. To enable queries against these fields, you index the document 
fields as the :ref:`embeddedDocuments <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` type. 

The tutorial on this page demonstrates queries against fields in the following types of arrays:

- Array of documents.
- Array of documents inside a document.
- Array of documents inside an array of documents.

   About the Collection
   --------------------

   The ``schools`` sample collection contains three
   documents. Each document contains the  ``name``
   and ``mascot`` of the school, the``first`` and ``last``
   name of each teacher, the ``classes`` that they teach including the
   ``subject`` and ``grade``, and the various ``clubs`` available.

   About the Index
   ---------------

   The index for this collection specifies the following documents in arrays: 

   - Documents in the arrays at the ``teachers`` and ``teachers.classes``
     paths are indexed as :ref:`embeddedDocuments
     <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>`, and the fields inside the
     documents are :ref:`dynamically <static-dynamic-mappings>` indexed.
     
   - Documents in the arrays at the ``teachers`` path are also indexed as
     the :ref:`document <bson-data-types-document>` type to support
     :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>`, and the fields inside the 
     documents are dynamically indexed. 
     
   - Document in the ``clubs`` field is indexed as the :ref:`document
     <bson-data-types-document>` type with :ref:`dynamic mappings 
     <static-dynamic-mappings>` enabled and the arrays of documents in the 
     ``clubs.sports`` field are indexed as the ``embeddedDocuments`` 
     type with dynamic mappings enabled.

   About the Queries

Run Queries Against Embedded Documents
--------------------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates sample |fts| queries against fields 
in embedded documents. To learn more about these queries, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-details`.

You can complete this tutorial by using either of the following methods:

- Use the pre-configured {+playground+}.
- Load, configure, and run it in your own {+cluster+}.

Select the tab that corresponds to your preferred method:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+playground+}
      :tabid: playground

      On the :ref:`Atlas Search Playground <fts-playground>`, we have set up
      an embedded documents :ref:`collection
      <embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection>`, pre-configured an
      :ref:`index <embedded-documents-tutorial-index>` for the fields in the
      collection, and defined a :ref:`query
      <embedded-documents-tutorial-queries>` that you can run against the
      collection. You can also modify the collection, index, and query in the 
      {+playground+}. 

      .. include:: /includes/fts/embedded-document/procedures/fts-embedded-document-tutorial-playground.rst

   .. tab:: {+service+} {+Cluster+}
      :tabid: cluster

      To demonstrate how to run queries against embedded documents, this
      tutorial walks you through the following steps: 

      1. Create a sample collection named ``schools`` with embedded documents 
         in your |service| {+cluster+}.
      #. Set up an |fts| index with :ref:`embeddedDocuments
         <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` fields configured at the
         following paths:
         
         - ``teachers`` field
         - ``teachers.classes`` field 
         - ``clubs.sports`` field
        
      #. Run :pipeline:`$search` queries that search the embedded documents in
         the ``schools`` collection using the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator with 
         the :ref:`embedded-document-ref` and :ref:`text-ref` operators.

      #. Run a :pipeline:`$searchMeta` query against an embedded document
         field to get a count.
