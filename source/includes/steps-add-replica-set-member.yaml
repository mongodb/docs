  To add a member, use the plus sign (``+``) icon to increase the number
  of members in the :guilabel:`MongoDs Per Replica Set` field.

  You can configure the member as a normal replica set member, as a
  :manual:`hidden </core/replica-set-hidden-member>`, :manual:`delayed
  </core/replica-set-delayed-member>`, or :manual:`priority-0
  </core/replica-set-priority-0-member>` secondary, or as an
  :manual:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`.

  .. warning::

     If your replica set uses :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` (or
     :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`), you must create and
     install the necessary :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`
     certificates on the new replica set member host then set the
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` settings for the
     :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` process for the new
     replica set member on that host. Automation does not create and
     install the certificates and configure these settings
     automatically. If you do not configure
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new member, you cannot
     add it to the existing :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`-enabled
     replica set. To learn how to enable
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new replica set member,
     see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.

  |mms| adds the new replica set member to the host with the fewest
  replica set members. If you want |mms| to serve the new member from a
  specific host, you can move the member to any host that belongs to the
  deployment.

  a. Click on the :guilabel:`Servers` tab.
  b. Find the new member. It has three dots along the left side of its
     name instead of a lock icon.
  c. Click and drag this member to any host that shows :guilabel:`Drag
     processes between servers` in the server tile status box.

     - If the host can accept the new member, :guilabel:`Drag processes
       between servers` changes to :guilabel:`Drop process here`. You
       can drop the member on that host.

     - If the host is using the same port the new member is using,
       :guilabel:`Drag processes between servers` changes to a caution
       notice that says :guilabel:`Port Change Required`. You can drop
       the member on that host. |mms| automatically changes the port
       number to an open port.

     - If the host cannot accept the new member because the host is
       unmanaged, :guilabel:`Drag processes between servers` changes to
       a warning notice that says :guilabel:`Server Not Managed`. You
       cannot drop the member on that host until you manage that host.

       To learn how to manage a host, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes`.
