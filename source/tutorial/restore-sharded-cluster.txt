Overview

.. important::

   In version 3.4, MongoDB removes support for SCCC config servers. To
   upgrade your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

   The following procedure applies to |version| config servers.

You can restore a :term:`sharded cluster` either from :doc:`snapshots
</tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots>` or from :term:`BSON`
:doc:`database dumps
</tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>` created by the
:program:`mongodump` tool. This document describes procedures to
