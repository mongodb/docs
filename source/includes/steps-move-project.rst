      .. note:: Billing a Moved Project
      
         An :authrole:`Organization Owner` of two different Organizations
         can move projects between those Organizations at any time. Usage in
         any particular project during any particular hour is accrued to the
         Organization under which the project was at that time.
      
         .. example::
      
            An :authrole:`Organization Owner` owns the **Telecomm** and
            **Storage** Organizations in |service|. They decide to move
            their **Backup** project from **Telecomm** to **Storage** at
            11:40 am.
      
            The **Telecomm** project is billed for the full 11:00 to 11:59
            am hour. **Storage** starts getting billed at 12:00 pm.
