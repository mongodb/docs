     You'll use this username and password combination to grant a user
     access to databases and collections in your cluster in this
     |service| project. 

     To use a password auto-generated by |service|, click
     :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.

     .. note::

        If you use special characters in your password, you will
        need to escape them later in the connection string that you
        will use to connect to your cluster. To learn
        more, see :ref:`special-pass-characters`.
