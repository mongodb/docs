stepnum: 4

ref: select-host
content: |

   Use the following procedure to add the host if it doesn't appear
   in the :guilabel:`Hostname` list:

   a. In :guilabel:`Hostname`, select :guilabel:`New Server`.

      If no hosts have yet been added to the project, the :guilabel:`Hostname`
      list does not appear. Click :guilabel:`Install Agent` instead.

   b. In the :guilabel:`Add New Server` dialog, select your operating
      system and click :guilabel:`Next`.

   c. Follow the instructions to install an Automation Agent on the new
      host.  See :doc:`Install or Update the Automation Agent </tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>`
      for more information.

   .. note::

     When adding a new member to a replica set, set ``Build Indexes``
     to ``True`` if you want the member's ``mongod`` to build indexes.
     You cannot change this value after the Automation Agent adds the
     new member to the replica set. See :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes <rsconf.members[n].buildIndexes>`
     for more information.

   .. warning::

     If your replica set uses :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` (or
     :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`), you must create and
     install the necessary :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`
     certificates on the new replica set member host then set the
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` settings for the
     :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` process for the new
     replica set member on that host. Automation does not create and
     install the certificates and configure these settings
     automatically. If you do not configure
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new member, you cannot
     add it to the existing :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`-enabled
     replica set. To learn how to enable
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new replica set member,
     see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.

   d. In the :guilabel:`Replica Set Configuration` section, complete the
      following fields for the new member:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70
    

         * - :guilabel:`Auth Schema Version`
           - Select the schema for storing the user data for your
             deployment. See :manual:`Upgrade to SCRAM </release-notes/3.0-scram/>`
             for more information.

         * - :guilabel:`Feature Compatibility` (Optional)
           - Select the :manual:`feature compatibility set </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
             This field appears if your deployment MongoDB version is
             ``3.4`` or later.

         * - :guilabel:`Version`
           - Select the MongoDB version for your replica set.

             .. note::
            
                If the dropdown menu does not include the MongoDB version
                you want for your deployment, you must enable it in the
                :doc:`Version Manager
                </tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version>`.

         * - :guilabel:`Data Directory`
           - Specify the full path of the directory where the ``mongod``
             process will store data files.

         * - :guilabel:`Log File`
           - Specify the location and name of the log file for the ``mongod``
             process on the new host.
