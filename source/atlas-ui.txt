Overview
--------

After loading your data or :ref:`our sample data <sample-data>`, you can
use the {+atlas-ui+} to interact with the data in the following ways: 

- :ref:`Manage Databases <atlas-ui-dbs>` in your
  {+database-deployments+}.

- :ref:`Manage Collections <atlas-ui-collections>` in your
  {+database-deployments+}.

- :ref:`Manage Documents <atlas-ui-docs>` in your collections.

- :ref:`Manage Indexes <atlas-ui-indexes>` on your collections.

- :ref:`Create and run aggregation pipelines <atlas-ui-agg-pipeline>` to
  process data in your collections.

- :ref:`Shard Global Clusters <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>`
  to distribute large datasets evenly.

.. note:: 
   
   The {+atlas-ui+} supports all features for
   {+serverless-instances+} except the :guilabel:`Search` tab. 

   To learn more, see :ref:`serverless-instance-limitations`.

{+atlas-ui+} Read Behavior
--------------------------

The {+atlas-ui+} reads from the primary unless the primary is
unavailable. If the primary is unavailable, the {+atlas-ui+}
reads from a non-hidden, non-delayed secondary member.
