Overview
--------

:term:`Collections <collection>` are groupings of MongoDB documents,
similar to an :abbr:`RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)`
table. A collection exists within a single database.

Even if a collection does not contain any documents, it still comes with
a resource cost in the form of an undroppable :manual:`default _id index
</indexes/#default-id-index>`. Although this index does not take up much
space on its own (especially for small collections) if you have
thousands of collections these indexes can add up in resources and
strain your database allocation.

If your deployment contains unnecessary or an increasing number of
collections, you should consider restructuring your data to reduce the
number of collections and ultimately reduce the resource requirements
of your application.

Example
-------

Consider a ``temperatures`` database that stores collections of
temperature readings obtained from a sensor. The sensor takes readings
every half hour from 10 AM to 10 PM. Each day's readings are stored in a
separate collection, named by the reading date:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // temperatures.march-09-2020

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-09T010:00:00Z",
     "temperature": 29
   }
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-09T010:30:00Z",
     "temperature": 30
   }
   ...
   {
     "_id": 25,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-09T022:00:00Z",
     "temperature": 26
   }

.. code-block:: javascript

   // temperatures.march-10-2020

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-10T010:00:00Z",
     "temperature": 30
   }
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-10T010:30:00Z",
     "temperature": 32
   }
   ...
   {
     "_id": 25,
     "timestamp": "2020-03-10T022:00:00Z",
     "temperature": 28
   }

With each passing day, the number of collections in the database
increments. Since the number of collections is unbounded, there is an
ever-growing need from the database to maintain these collections and
their corresponding indexes. If the database eventually reaches a point
where it is managing thousands of collections and indexes, it may result
in performance degradation.

Additionally, this approach does not easily facilitate queries across
multiple days. To query data from multiple days to obtain temperature
trends over longer periods of time, you would need to perform a
:pipeline:`$lookup` operation, which is not as performant as querying
data in the same collection.

Updated Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead, a better approach to structure this data is to store
all temperature readings in a single collection, and have each
day's readings in a single document. Consider this updated schema,
where all temperatures are in a single collection:
``temperatures.readings``:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   // temperatures.readings

   {
     "_id": ISODate("2020-03-09"),
     "readings": [
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-09T010:00:00Z",
         "temperature": 29
       },
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-09T010:30:00Z",
         "temperature": 30
       },
       ...
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-09T022:00:00Z",
         "temperature": 26
       }
     ]
   }
   {
     "_id": ISODate("2020-03-10"),
     "readings": [
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-10T010:00:00Z",
         "temperature": 30
       },
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-10T010:30:00Z",
         "temperature": 32
       },
       ...
       {
         "timestamp": "2020-03-10T022:00:00Z",
         "temperature": 28
       }
     ]
   }

This updated schema requires much fewer resources than the original
schema. Now, rather than requiring an index for every single day
that temperatures are read, the default ``_id`` index on this collection
helps facilitate queries by date.

How to Check for Unnecessary Collections
----------------------------------------

Mongo Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the number of collections in your database, you can
run the following command from the :binary:`~mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getCollectionNames().length

The :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>` method also
returns the number of collections in your database, along with useful
database statistics such as the total size of your data and indexes.

MongoDB Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Explorer
`````````````

The |service| :ref:`Data Explorer <data-explorer>` provides a high-level
overview of collections in your databases. The Data Explorer shows
the total size of a collection, including the size of a collection's
indexes. If the majority of a collection's size is comprised of
indexes, you can consider consolidating that collection's data into
another collection and dropping the original collection. Refer to the
:pipeline:`$merge` documentation for an approach to merging data
from one collection into another.

Additionally, if the Data Explorer reveals that you have empty
collections, you can drop those collections directly from the
Data Explorer.

Real-Time Performance Panel
```````````````````````````

The |service| :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel
<real-time-metrics-status-tab>` shows which collections receive the most
activity. You can use this tool to ensure that before you drop a
collection, it is not being actively used by your application.
