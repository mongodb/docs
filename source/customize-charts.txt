|charts| provides various options to customize the format and display
of your visualizations. You can use these options to display your data
in the proper format, show data labels to relay precise measurements,
and many other formatting techniques.

|charts| provides three types of customization options:

General Customizaton Options
  :ref:`General Customization Options <general-customization>` modify
  high-level aspects of the chart such as its colors and data labels.
  These options affect the overall look and format of your data.

Field-Level Options
  :ref:`Field-Level Options <field-level-options>` modify how
  |charts-short| renders data fields, such as specific formatting
  for numbers and dates. These options apply to individual data fields
  :ref:`encoded <encoding-channels>` into your chart, rather than the
  chart as a whole. The field-level customization options available
  depend on the data type and
  :ref:`channel type <charts-channel-type-table>` of the field you are
  customizing.

Value Axis Options
  :ref:`Value Axis Options <value-axis-options>` modify the
  chart's axes, such as their scale and their minimum and maximum
  values. These options only affect the chart's axes, and not how
  |charts-short| formats data points in the visualization.

Geospatial Customization Options
  :ref:`Geospatial customization options <geospatial-customization>`
  modify options specific to :ref:`geospatial charts
  <geo-spatial-charts>`, including viewport options, data marker size
  and opacity, and heatmap radius.

To customize a chart, click the :guilabel:`Customization` tab above the
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` in the
:doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`:

Your chart automatically updates as you modify customization options.
