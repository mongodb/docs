If a cluster experiences an activity spike and generates an extremely large
quantity of log messages, |service| may stop collecting and storing new logs
for a period of time.

.. note::

   Log analysis rate limits apply only to the Performance Advisor UI, 
   the Query Profiler UI, and the Access Tracking UI. 
   :oas-atlas-op:`Downloadable log files

   complete.
