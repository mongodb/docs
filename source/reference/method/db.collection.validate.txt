-----------

.. method:: db.collection.validate(full)

   Validates a collection. The method scans a collection's data
   structures for correctness and returns a single :term:`document` that
   describes the relationship between the logical collection and the
   physical representation of the data.

   The :method:`~db.collection.validate()` method has the following
   parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.collection.validate-param.rst

   The :method:`~db.collection.validate()` method output provides an
   in-depth view of how the collection
   uses storage. Be aware that this command is potentially resource
   intensive and may impact the performance of your MongoDB
   instance.

   The :method:`~db.collection.validate()` method is a wrapper
   around the :dbcommand:`validate` :term:`database
   command`.
