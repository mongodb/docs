:program:`mongosync` temporarily alters some collection characteristics
during synchronization. The original values are restored during the
:ref:`commit process <c2c-api-commit>`. However, a permanent system
failure could disrupt synchronization before the sync is committed. If
the sync ends prematurely, you must manually reset the collection
characteristics on the destination cluster.

Manually revert the following temporary changes:

- :ref:`Unique indexes set as non-unique <c2c-dr-unique>`
- :ref:`TTL indexes with expireAfterSeconds set to MAX_INT
  <c2c-dr-ttl>`
- :ref:`Hidden indexes set as non-hidden <c2c-dr-hidden>`
- :ref:`Capped collections with size/max set to the maximum possible
  value <c2c-dr-capped>`
- :ref:`Write blocking <c2c-dr-write-blocking>`

.. _c2c-dr-unique:

Unique Indexes
--------------

:program:`mongosync` replicates writes in parallel, which can cause
transient uniqueness violations on the destination cluster. To avoid
these errors, unique indexes are replicated as non-unique. If
synchronization ends early, manually resolve any uniqueness violations
and convert the non-unique indexes back to unique indexes.

Prepare the Index for Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each non-unique index on the destination cluster that should be
unique, run :dbcommand:`collMod` with ``prepareUnique`` set to
``true``.

After running ``collMod``, the index rejects any new writes that
would introduce duplicate keys.

Resolve Uniqueness Violations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There may still be uniqueness conflicts in the index after you run
``prepareUnique``. To find conflicts and convert the index to a unique
index, run ``collMod`` with ``unique`` set to ``true`` on each of the
non-unique indexes that you want to set as unique.

If the call to ``collMod`` succeeds, there are no uniqueness violations
on that index and the index is converted to an unique index.

If the call to ``collMod`` fails with a ``CannotConvertIndexToUnique``
error, correct the uniqueness violations and rerun ``collMod``.

See: `Convert an Existing Index
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/reference/command/collMod/#convert-an-existing-index-to-a-unique-index>`__

.. _c2c-dr-ttl:

TTL Indexes
-----------

During synchronization, ``expireAfterSeconds`` is set
to ``MAX_INT`` for :ref:`TTL indexes
<index-feature-ttl>`. To reset ``expireAfterSeconds``, use the
``collMod`` command. See: :ref:`Change Expiration Value for Indexes
<ex-change-exp-value>`.


.. _c2c-dr-hidden:

Hidden Indexes
--------------
During synchronization, :ref:`hidden indexes <index-type-hidden>` are
not hidden on the destination cluster. Use the ``collMod`` command to
hide indexes that should be hidden.

.. _c2c-dr-capped:

Capped Collections
------------------

During synchronization, :ref:`capped collections
<manual-capped-collection>` are set to the maximum allowable size. Use
the ``collMod`` command to set the correct maximum size.

.. _c2c-dr-write-blocking:

Write blocking
--------------

When write blocking is enabled as part of the :ref:`/start
<c2c-api-start>` command, ``mongosync`` blocks user writes on the
destination cluster during replication. If replication ends
prematurely, you must manually unblock writing on the destination.

After writing is enabled, you can redirect writes from your client
application to the destination cluster.

To enable writes, update :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
       {
           setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
           global: false
       }
   )
