Read operation selects documents from a collection. MongoDB
provides the :ref:`find() <find>` method to perform read operations.
Additionally, the :ref:`Aggregation Framework <aggregation>` also
provides read operations that involve various aggregation functions,
such as ``SUM``.

.. _find:

Find()
------

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method is the primary
method to select documents from a collection. The find() method returns
a cursor to the selected documents. The :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` method can accept a selection criteria on
document fields, including array fields and subdocuments, to limit the
selection.

The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method offers the
flexibility to specify the fields to return through the include/exclude
flags of the ``projection`` document. For instance, if selecting 11 out
of 15 fields, with the :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method, you
can choose to specify the 4 to exclude rather than the 11 to include.

.. _aggregation:

Aggregation Framework
---------------------

The Aggregation Framework provides a rich set of tools for performing
various sequence of operations, not the least of which is the read operation.

Although the Aggregation Framework is discussed in detail in its own
section, a brief introduction to the aggregation read operation is
provided here for completeness.
