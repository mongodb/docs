Overview
--------

When reconfiguring primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) replica sets or
changing to a PSA architecture, you need to take special care in the
following cases:

- You want to reconfigure a secondary in an existing three-member
  replica set with a PSA architecture to become a voting, data-bearing
  node with a non-zero priority.
- You want to add a new voting, data-bearing node with a non-zero
  priority to an existing two-member replica set that contains one
  primary and one arbiter.

.. warning::

   If the secondary you are adding is lagged and the resulting replica
   set is a PSA configuration, the first configuration change will
   change the number of nodes that need to commit a change with
   :writeconcern:`"majority"`. In this case, your commit point will lag
   until the secondary has caught up.

This document outlines the procedure for reconfiguring your replica set
in these specific cases **without** using the designated helper method
:method:`rs.reconfigForPSASet`.

Procedure
---------

If you are performing one of the preceding operations, it is necessary
to reconfigure your replica set in two steps:

1. Reconfigure the replica set to add or modify a secondary with
   ``{ votes: 1, priority: 0 }``.
2. Once the added or modified secondary has caught up with all
   committed writes, reconfigure the secondary to have a non-zero
   priority ``{ votes: 1, priority: <num> }``.

The two-step approach avoids the possibility of rolling back
committed writes in the case of a failover to the new secondary
before the new secondary has all committed writes from the previous
primary.

To run the :method:`rs.reconfigForPSASet()` method, you must connect
to the :term:`primary` of the replica set.
