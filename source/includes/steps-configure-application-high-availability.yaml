   load balancer and environment.

title: "Update each |application| server with the load balanced URL."
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: update-load-balanced-url
content: |
  On each server, edit the ``conf-mms.properties`` file to
  configure the ``mms.centralUrl`` property to point to the load balancer URL.

  The ``conf-mms.properties`` file is located in the
  ``<install_dir>/conf/`` directory. See :doc:`/reference/configuration`
  for more information.

title: "Update each |application| server with the replication hosts information."
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: update-replication-hosts
pre: |
  On each server, edit the ``conf-mms.properties`` file to
  set the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` property to the :manual:`connection string
  </reference/connection-string/>` of the :ref:`mms-application-database`. You
  *must* specify at least **3** hosts in the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  connection string. For example:
action:
  language: ini
  code: |
    mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://<mms0.example.net>:<27017>,<mms1.example.net>:<27017>,<mms2.example.net>:<27017>/?maxPoolSize=100

title: "Start one of the |application-s|."
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: start-app
pre: |
  For example, if you installed the |application| with an
  ``rpm`` or ``deb`` package, issue the following:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    service mongodb-mms start

title: "Copy the ``gen.key`` file."
stepnum: 5
ref: copy-gen-key
level: 4
content: |
  The ``gen.key`` file is located in ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` for
  installations from a package manager and in ``${HOME}/.mongodb-mms/``
  for installations from an archive.

  Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the running |application|'s server to the
  appropriate directory on the other |application| servers.
