    permissible by law and the remaining provisions will remain in full
    force and effect.  No waiver under this Agreement shall be valid or
    binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party
    against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought.  Any such waiver
    shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
    described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
    granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Any
    delay or forbearance by either party in exercising any right
    hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of that right. This Agreement
    is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us
    and supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
    any other communications between You and Company in relation to the
    subject matter of this Agreement.
