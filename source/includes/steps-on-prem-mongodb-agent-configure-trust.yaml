  Copy your |tls| certificate to your |mms| configuration directory:

  .. include:: /includes/list-table-mongodb-agent-conf-dir-locations.rst

  .. tabs-platforms::
     :hidden:
     
     .. tab::
        :tabid: windows

     .. tab::
        :tabid: linux

        Then, set the system user (username of the {+mdbagent+}) as the 
        owner of the |tls| certificate. Grant that user read and write 
        permissions on the certificate.

        .. include:: /includes/fact-example-linux-mdbagent.rst

     .. tab::
        :tabid: rhel

        Then, set the ``mongod`` system user as the owner of 
        the |tls| certificate. Grant that user read and write 
        permissions on the certificate.

        .. include:: /includes/fact-example-linux-mdbagent.rst

     .. tab::
        :tabid: debian

        Then, set the ``mongodb`` system user as the owner of 
        the |tls| certificate. Grant that user read and write 
        permissions on the certificate.
