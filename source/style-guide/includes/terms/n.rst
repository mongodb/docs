   name server
     Use as two words.

   namespace
     Use as one word.

   non (prefix)
     Don't hyphenate words beginning with *non*, such as *nonnumeric*
     and *nonzero*, unless a hyphen is necessary to avoid confusion
     or the root word is a proper noun.

     Don't use *non* to negate an entire phrase, as in *non-security
     related* (use *unrelated to security* instead).

     Also, don't attach *non* to a trademark, such as *non-Windows*.

   not applicable
   NA
     Use the abbreviation *NA* to mean *not applicable*. For example,
     if you have a table cell for which no information is available
     and space constraints prevent spelling out *Not applicable* or
     *None*, use *NA*.

   number sign (#)
     Use *number sign* to refer to the # symbol. Don't use *pound
     sign* or *hash sign*.
