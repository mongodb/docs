Introduction
------------
The official MongoDB Node.js driver allows Node.js applications to
connect to MongoDB and work with data. The driver features an asynchronous
API which allows you to access method return values through Promises or
specify callbacks to access them when communicating with MongoDB.

.. note::

   These docs are for version 4.0 of the MongoDB Node.js driver. If
   you are looking for an older version of the MongoDB Node.js driver
   docs, `see the legacy Node.js driver documentation
   <http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/>`_.
   For the main MongoDB documentation, see the :manual:`MongoDB Manual
   </>`.
