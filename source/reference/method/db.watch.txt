Definition
----------

.. method:: db.watch( pipeline, options )

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

      Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) set to
      ``"4.0"`` or greater. For more information on fCV, see
      :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

   Opens a :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` for a database
   to report on all its non-``system`` collections.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.watch-param.rst

   The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.watch-options.rst

   :returns:
      A :term:`cursor` over the change event documents.
      See :doc:`/reference/change-events` for examples of change
      event documents.

   .. seealso::  :method:`db.collection.watch()` and :method:`Mongo.watch()`

Behavior
--------

- You cannot run :method:`db.watch()` on the ``admin``, ``local``, or
  ``config`` database.

- :method:`db.watch()` only notifies on data changes that have
  persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-cursor-open.rst


- You can run :method:`db.watch()` for a database that does not exist.
  However, once the database is created and you drop the database, the
  change stream cursor closes.

- :method:`db.watch()` is available for replica sets and sharded
  clusters:

  - For a replica set, you can issue :method:`db.watch()` on any
    data-bearing member.

  - For a sharded cluster, you must issue :method:`db.watch()` on a
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

- You can only use :method:`db.watch()` with the :ref:`Wired Tiger
  storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`find` and :authaction:`changeStream` privilege actions on
the :ref:`database resource <resource-document>`. That is, a user must
have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants the following :ref:`privilege
<privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream"] }
 
Example
-------

The following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell opens a
change stream cursor on the ``hr`` database. The returned cursor
reports on data changes to all the non-``system`` collections in that
database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("hr").watch()

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         printjson(watchCursor.next());
      }
   }

:ref:`change-stream-output`.
