The "Settings" section of the MMS console enables users to personalize
their console and activate or deactivate a variety of features. The
following sections correspond to a tab on the Settings page.

Personalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Personalization` page allows users to configure the console 
to suit their needs and preferences. 

- **Chart Refresh**: sets the rate at which the data displayed in the
  charts on your dashboards or on the "Hosts Statistics" page refreshes.

- **Default Chart Display Type**: sets the default metric that will
  appear in your charts. You can choose from the average per second, or
  the total. This determines the default "display" on
  the "Hosts Statistics" and "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Chart Epoch Type**: sets the scale for the chart data, 
  either 1 day, 1 hour, 5 minutes, or 1 minute. This determines the
  default "resolution" selection on the "Host Statistics" and 
  "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Chart Window**: sets the time period displayed by default 
  in the charts on the "Hosts Statistics" and "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Dashboard**: sets the default dashboard on the "Dashboard"
  page. You can select from a list of all of your dashboards.

- **Homepage**: sets which page of the MMS console you will see when
  you log into MMS. You can choose from the "Hosts" page, or the
  "Dashboard" page.

- **Separate Opcounter Charts**: allows you to control the presentation
  of Opcounter Charts. If enabled, MMS charts each opcounter type
  separately. Otherwise, each opcounter type is overlaid together in a
  single chart.

- **Group Change**: sets which page of the MMS console you will see when
  you select a different group. You can select the
  "Hosts" page or the "Dashboard" page. Alternatively, select "Current" 
  and MMS will not change pages when you select a different group.

- **Display Chart Annotations**: toggles the presence of chart
  annotations. Chart annotations overlay information about significant
  system events on the charts. For example, with chart annotations MMS
  will draw a red vertical line over the charts.

- **User Time Zone**: sets your local time zone.

- **Log Data Collection For All Hosts**: activates or deactivates
  the collection of log data for all hosts. This overwrites the
  statuses set on the individual hosts. MMS displays log data
  in the "Logs" tab of the "Host Statistics" page.

- **User Language**: allows you to select the language the MMS Console 
  will display in.

- **User Date Format**: allows you to select your preferred
  date format.

- **Group Time Zone**: sets your group's time zone. 

MMS Agent
~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`MMS Agent` provides links for downloading the
pre-configured MMS agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats. It also
provides links to download the unconfigured agent for :ref:`automated
agent installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

Backup Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Backup Agent` provides links for downloading the
pre-configured Backup agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats, on a
variety of platforms. The `MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
<http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-backup-service>`_ requires this
agent.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` allows you to specify the hostname to
use for servers with multiple aliases. This prevents servers from
appearing multiple times under different names.

DB Stats
~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`DB Stats` allows you to enable or disable the collection of
DB Stats.  For more information, see ":ref:`How does MMS gather
database statistics? <db-stats-warning>`".

Exposed DB Host Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you set :guilabel`Exposed DB Host Check`, MMS will periodically
try to connect to your Mongo instance. If your configuration is
secure, this should fail. If the attempt is successful, MMS sends
you an alert.

Duplicate Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Duplicate Hostnames` allows you to reset and remove all
detected duplicate hosts. This is useful if your server environment
has drastically changed and you believe a host is incorrectly marked
as a duplicate.

Email Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Email Settings` makes it possible to opt-in to, or opt-out
of receiving 10gen's e-mail newsletters about MMS.

API Key
~~~~~~~

:guilable:`API Key` displays the MMS API Key for your MMS group. Keep
this key private. Use the API key to support :ref:`automated agent
installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

Secret Key
~~~~~~~~~~

:guilable:`Secret Key` displays the MMS Secret Key for your
group. Keep this key private. Use the Secret key to support
:ref:`automated agent installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

Backup and Restore Public Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilable:Backup and Restore Private Key` enables users who have
signed up for the `MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
<http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-backup-service>`_ to generate a
new public key that MMS will use to connect via SSH and transmit a
snapshot of your data.

Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two-Factor Authentication is only used with `MongoDB Backup and
Restore Service
<http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-backup-service>`_. Two-Factor
Authentication enables you to configure the service to require
two-factor authentication. To enable two-factor authentication, click
on "Set", and then input your mobile phone number. You will receive an
SMS text message with an authentication code the MMS interface will
prompt you for when you complete the setup.
