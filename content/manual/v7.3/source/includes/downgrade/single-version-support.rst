MongoDB only supports single-version downgrades. You cannot downgrade to a 
release that is multiple versions behind your current release. 

For example, you may downgrade a |newseries| to a |oldseries| deployment. 
However, further downgrading that |oldseries| deployment to a |olderseries| 
deployment is not supported.
