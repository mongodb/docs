   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and 
   `Render <https://docs.render.com/migrate-mongodb-static-hosting-to-render>`__
   for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies used.

Render is a cloud application platform that helps developers flexibly deploy and
scale their apps and services. You can host your static sites on Render
alongside the rest of your stack (frontend and backend). All static sites
deployed on Render are served over a global CDN with automatic management of TLS
certificates.

You can auto-deploy from a Git repo, preview changes before you merge a pull
request, roll back changes when you need to, and more. Render hosts static sites
for free.

See Render's `MongoDB Static Hosting Migration Guide <https://docs.render.com/migrate-mongodb-static-hosting-to-render>`__
for details on how to migrate to Render.
