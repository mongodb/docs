Modeling application data for MongoDB should consider various
operational factors that impact the performance of MongoDB. For
instance, different data models can allow for more efficent queries,
increase the throughput of insert and update operations, or distribute
activity to a sharded cluster more effectively.

When developing a data model, analyze all of your application's
:doc:`read and write operations </crud>` in conjunction with the
following considerations.

.. _data-model-atomicity:
.. _data-modeling-atomicity:

Atomicity
---------

In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single
document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents
*within* a single document. When a single write operation modifies
multiple documents (e.g. :method:`db.collection.updateMany()`), the
modification of each document is atomic, but the operation as a whole
is not atomic.

Embedded Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The embedded data model combines all related data in a single document
instead of normalizing across multiple documents and collections. This
data model facilitates atomic operations.

See :ref:`data-modeling-atomic-operation` for an example data model
that provides atomic updates for a single document.

Multi-Document Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For data models that store references between related
pieces of data, the application must issue separate read and write
operations to retrieve and modify these related pieces of data.

Sharding
--------

MongoDB uses :term:`sharding` to provide horizontal scaling. These
clusters support deployments with large data sets and high-throughput
operations. Sharding allows users to :term:`partition <data partition>` a
:term:`collection` within a database to distribute the collection's
documents across a number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or
:term:`shards <shard>`.

To distribute data and application traffic in a sharded collection,
MongoDB uses the :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`. Selecting the proper
:ref:`shard key <shard-key>` has significant implications for
performance, and can enable or prevent query isolation and increased
write capacity. It is important to consider carefully the field or
fields to use as the shard key.

See :doc:`/sharding` and
:doc:`/core/sharding-shard-key` for more information.

.. _data-model-indexes:

Indexes
-------

Use indexes to improve performance for common queries. Build indexes on
fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that return
sorted results. MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the
``_id`` field.

As you create indexes, consider the following behaviors of indexes:

- Each index requires at least 8 kB of data space.

- Adding an index has some negative performance impact for write
  operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes
  are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes.

- Collections with high read-to-write ratio often benefit from
  additional indexes. Indexes do not affect un-indexed read operations.

- When active, each index consumes disk space and memory. This usage
  can be significant and should be tracked for capacity planning,
  especially for concerns over working set size.

See :doc:`/applications/indexes` for more information on indexes as
well as :doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan/`. Additionally, the MongoDB
:doc:`database profiler </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` may
help identify inefficient queries.

.. _data-model-large-number-of-collections:

Large Number of Collections
---------------------------

In certain situations, you might choose to store related information in
several collections rather than in a single collection.

Consider a sample collection ``logs`` that stores log documents for
various environment and applications. The ``logs`` collection contains
documents of the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { log: "dev", ts: ..., info: ... }
   { log: "debug", ts: ..., info: ...}

If the total number of documents is low, you may group documents into
collection by type. For logs, consider maintaining distinct log
collections, such as ``logs_dev`` and ``logs_debug``. The ``logs_dev``
collection would contain only the documents related to the dev
environment.

Generally, having a large number of collections has no significant
performance penalty and results in very good performance. Distinct
collections are very important for high-throughput batch processing.

When using models that have a large number of collections, consider
the following behaviors:

- Each collection has a certain minimum overhead of a few kilobytes.

- Each index, including the index on ``_id``, requires at least 8 kB of
  data space.

- For each :term:`database`, a single namespace file (i.e.
  ``<database>.ns``) stores all meta-data for that database, and each
  index and collection has its own entry in the namespace file. See
  places :ref:`namespace length limits <limit-namespace-length>` for
  specific limitations.

.. _faq-developers-embed-documents:

Collection Contains Large Number of Small Documents
---------------------------------------------------

You should consider embedding for performance reasons if you have a
collection with a large number of small documents. If you can group
these small documents by some logical relationship *and* you frequently
retrieve the documents by this grouping, you might consider
"rolling-up" the small documents into larger documents that contain an
array of embedded documents.

"Rolling up" these small documents into logical groupings means that
queries to retrieve a group of documents involve sequential reads and
fewer random disk accesses. Additionally, "rolling up" documents and
moving common fields to the larger document benefit the index on these
fields. There would be fewer copies of the common fields *and* there
would be fewer associated key entries in the corresponding index. See
:doc:`/indexes` for more information on indexes.

However, if you often only need to retrieve a subset of the documents
within the group, then "rolling-up" the documents may not provide
better performance. Furthermore, if small, separate documents represent
the natural model for the data, you should maintain that model.

.. _faq-small-documents:

Storage Optimization for Small Documents
----------------------------------------

Each MongoDB document contains a certain amount of overhead. This
overhead is normally insignificant but becomes significant if all
documents are just a few bytes, as might be the case if the documents
in your collection only have one or two fields.

Consider the following suggestions and strategies for optimizing
storage utilization for these collections:

- Use the ``_id`` field explicitly.

  MongoDB clients automatically add an ``_id`` field to each document
  and generate a unique 12-byte :term:`ObjectId` for the ``_id``
  field. Furthermore, MongoDB always indexes the ``_id`` field. For
  smaller documents this may account for a significant amount of
  space.

  To optimize storage use, users can specify a value for the ``_id`` field
  explicitly when inserting documents into the collection. This
  strategy allows applications to store a value in the ``_id`` field
  that would have occupied space in another portion of the document.

  You can store any value in the ``_id`` field, but because this value
  serves as a primary key for documents in the collection, it must
  uniquely identify them. If the field's value is not unique, then it
  cannot serve as a primary key as there would be collisions in the
  collection.

- Use shorter field names.

  .. note::

     Shortening field names reduces expressiveness and does not provide
     considerable benefit for larger documents and where document
     overhead is not of significant concern. Shorter field names do not
     reduce the size of indexes, because indexes have a predefined
     structure.

     In general, it is not necessary to use short field names.

  MongoDB stores all field names in every document. For most
  documents, this represents a small fraction of the space used by a
  document; however, for small documents the field names may represent
  a proportionally large amount of space. Consider a collection of
  small documents that resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { last_name : "Smith", best_score: 3.9 }

  If you shorten the field named ``last_name`` to ``lname`` and the
  field named ``best_score`` to ``score``, as follows, you could save 9
  bytes per document.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { lname : "Smith", score : 3.9 }

- Embed documents.

  In some cases you may want to embed documents in other documents and
  save on the per-document overhead. See
  :ref:`faq-developers-embed-documents`.

Data Lifecycle Management
-------------------------

Data modeling decisions should take data lifecycle management into
consideration.

The :doc:`Time to Live or TTL feature </tutorial/expire-data>` of
collections expires documents after a period of time. Consider using
the TTL feature if your application requires some data to persist in
the database for a limited period of time.

Additionally, if your application only uses recently inserted
documents, consider :doc:`/core/capped-collections`. Capped collections
provide *first-in-first-out* (FIFO) management of inserted documents
and efficiently support operations that insert and read documents based
on insertion order.
