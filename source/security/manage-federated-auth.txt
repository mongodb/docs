The following procedure walks you through linking a |saml| |idp| to |service|.

.. include:: /includes/roles-required-fed-auth.rst

Procedure
---------

.. important:: Two-Stage Configuration

   Depending on your Identity Provider, some circular logic may apply
   when linking it to a Service Provider like |service|. To
   link your |idp| to |service|:

   - Your IdP needs values from |service| and
   - |service| needs values from your IdP.

   To simplify setup, |service| prompts you to enter placeholder values
   for the IdP and |service| configurations. You will replace these
   values later in the procedure.

.. _configure-idp-app:

Configure An External Identity Provider Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Federated Authentication, you must have an external
|saml| |idp| application. In the |saml| |idp|,
you must perform the following:

1. Create a new application for |service|.

#. Configure initial |saml| values for the new application:

   a. Set placeholder values for the following fields:

      - :guilabel:`SP Entity ID or Issuer`
      - :guilabel:`Audience URI`
      - :guilabel:`Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL`

   b. Set valid values for the following fields:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1
         :widths: 40 60

         * - Field
           - Value

         * - :guilabel:`Signature Algorithm`
           - Algorithm used to encrypt the |idp| signature. 
             |service| supports the following signature algorithm 
             values:

             - ``SHA-1``
             - ``SHA-256``

         * - :guilabel:`Name ID`
           - Valid email address.

             .. important::

                :guilabel:`Name ID` is both your email address 
                and username.

         * - :guilabel:`Name ID Format`
           - - ``urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified``
             - ``urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress``

   c. Create attributes with the following Attribute Names for the
      following SAML Attribute Values:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1
         :widths: 40 60

         * - SAML Attribute Name
           - SAML Attribute Value

         * - ``firstName``
           - First Name
         * - ``lastName``
           - Last Name
         * - ``memberOf``
           - User Groups

      .. note::

         The names of these attributes are case sensitive. Type these
         attribute names as shown in
         :wikipedia:`camelCase <Camel_case>`.

   d. Save these values.

Once you have completed the initial setup for your |idp| application,
you link the |idp| to |service| to federate your users' logins.

Apply Your Identity Provider to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Prerequisite

   This procedure assumes you already have an external |idp|. To learn
   how to configure an |idp|, see :ref:`configure-idp-app`.

You can configure Federated Authentication in |service| from the
:guilabel:`Federation Management Console`. Use this console to:

- Configure :guilabel:`Identity Providers` to authenticate users
  belonging to specified organizations.
- Connect |service| :guilabel:`Organizations` to your |idp|.
- Verify and associate :guilabel:`Domains` with your |idp| to force
  users to authenticate using that IdP.

Open the Management Console
```````````````````````````

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-open-fed-auth-console.rst

From the Management Console:
````````````````````````````

1. Click :guilabel:`Configure Identity Providers`.

#. If you do not have any Identity Providers configured yet, click
   :guilabel:`Setup Identity Provider`. Otherwise, on the
   :guilabel:`Identity Providers` screen, click
   :guilabel:`Add Identity Provider`.

#. Enter or select the following |saml| Protocol Settings.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 10 60

      * - Field
        - Necessity
        - Description

      * - :guilabel:`Configuration Name`
        - Required
        - Human-readable label that identifies this configuration.

      * - :guilabel:`Configuration Description`
        - Optional
        - Human-readable label that describes this configuration.

      * - :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI`
        - Required
        - Identifier for the issuer of the
          `SAML Assertion <http://saml.xml.org/assertions>`__.

          .. include:: /includes/fact-fed-auth-placeholder-values.rst

      * - :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL`
        - Required
        - URL of the receiver of the |saml| AuthNRequest.

          .. include:: /includes/fact-fed-auth-placeholder-values.rst

      * - :guilabel:`IdP Signature Certificate`
        - Required
        - |pem|-encoded public key certificate of the |idp|. You can
          obtain this value from your |idp|.

          You can either:

          - Upload the certificate from your computer, or

          - Paste the contents of the certificate into a text box.

      * - :guilabel:`Request Binding`
        - Required
        - |saml| Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send
          the AuthNRequest. Can be either:

          - ``HTTP POST``
          - ``HTTP REDIRECT``

      * - :guilabel:`Response Signature Algorithm`
        - Required
        - Response algorithm used to sign the |saml| AuthNRequest. Can
          be either:

          - ``SHA-256``
          - ``SHA-1``

#. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

Configure Your Identity Provider with Atlas Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having set up your |idp| in |service|, you can provide the required
|service| metadata to your |idp|.

1. On the :guilabel:`Identity Provider` screen in |service|, click
   :guilabel:`Download metadata` to download the metadata required
   by your |idp|. |service| provides the data as an ``.xml`` file.

   .. figure:: /images/customer-fed-download-metadata-border.png
      :width: 550px
      :alt: Image showing how to download metadata

   .. note::

      |service| provides the :guilabel:`Assertion Consumer Service URL`
      and :guilabel:`Audience URI` if you wish to manually copy and
      save these values. These values are included in the metadata
      download.

   .. note::

      The SAML trust model requires certificate exchange over trusted 
      channels during setup and doesn't require CA-signed 
      certificates. During federated authentication, all traffic 
      between |service-fullname| and the browser runs over TLS using a 
      CA-signed certificate. Therefore, ``metadata.xml`` provides only 
      a self-signed certificate for request signing and signature 
      validation. 

#. Upload the metadata to your |idp|.

   You now have the necessary information to replace the
   placeholder :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI` and
   :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL` values set when you set up the
   initial |idp| mapping in |service|.

#. In |service|, modify the placeholder values set for
   :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI` and :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL` for
   the linked |idp| with the proper values from your |idp|.

#. .. include:: /includes/optional-idp-relay-state-step.rst

#. Return to |service| and click :guilabel:`Finish`.

.. important::

   Once you link your |idp| to |service|, it shows as
   :guilabel:`Inactive` in the
   :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` until you
   :ref:`map at least one domain <atlas-manage-fed-domain-map>` to the
   |idp|.

Next Steps
----------

After you successfully linked your |idp| to |service|, you must
:ref:`map one or more domains to your Identity Provider
<atlas-manage-fed-domain-map>`. |service| authenticates users from these
domains through your |idp|.
