Aggregation
-----------

Union All (``$unionWith`` Stage)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :pipeline:`$unionWith` aggregation stage,
providing the ability to combines pipeline results from multiple
collections into a single result set.

For details, see :pipeline:`$unionWith`.

Custom Aggregation Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB provides the following new operators
that allow users to define custom aggregation expressions:

- :group:`$accumulator`

- :expression:`$function`

With the addition of these new operators, you can use aggregation to
write custom JavaScript expressions instead of relying on
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :query:`$where`.

.. note::

   Even before version 4.4, various map-reduce expressions could also
   be rewritten using :doc:`other aggregation pipeline operators
   </meta/aggregation-quick-reference>`, such as :pipeline:`$group`,
   :pipeline:`$merge`, etc., without requiring custom functions.
   
For more information, see
:doc:`/reference/map-reduce-to-aggregation-pipeline`.

       :ref:`accumulator operator <agg-operators-group-accumulators>`.

   * - :expression:`$binarySize`
    
     - Returns the size of a given string or binary data value's
       content in bytes.

   * - :expression:`$bsonSize`
     - Returns the size in bytes of a given document (i.e. bsontype
       ``Object``) when encoded as :term:`BSON`.
     
   * - :expression:`$first`

     - Returns the first element in an array.

   * - :expression:`$function`

   * - :expression:`$isNumber`

     - Returns boolean ``true`` if the specified expression resolves
       to an :bsontype:`integer <Int32>`, :bsontype:`decimal
       <Decimal128>`, :bsontype:`double <Double>`, or :bsontype:`long
       <Int64>`.  
       
       Returns boolean ``false`` if the expression resolves to any other
       :doc:`BSON type </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`, ``null``, or
       a missing field

     - Replaces the first instance of a matched string in a given input.

   * - :expression:`$replaceAll`

     - Replaces all instances of a matched string in a given input.

General Aggregation Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$out``
````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$out` can output to a collection in
a different database. In earlier versions, :pipeline:`$out` can output
to a collection to the same database where the aggregation is run.

``$indexStats``
```````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4 (also available starting in 4.2.4),
:pipeline:`$indexStats` includes the following fields in its output:

.. container::

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 35 65
   
      * - Field
        - Description

      * - :ref:`shard <indexStats-output-shard>`

        - Name of the shard, if applicable.

      * - :ref:`spec <indexStats-output-spec>`
        - Index specification document

      * - :ref:`building <indexStats-output-building>`
        - A boolean flag that indicates if the index is currently being built.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-planCache-changes.rst

Replica Sets
------------

Resumable Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, a secondary performing initial sync can attempt
to resume the sync process if interrupted by a *transient* (i.e.
temporary) network error, collection drop, or collection rename. The
sync source must also run MongoDB 4.4 to support resumable initial sync.
If the sync source runs MongoDB 4.2 or earlier, the secondary must
restart the initial sync process as if it encountered a non-transient
network error.

By default, the secondary tries to resume initial sync for 24 hours.
MongoDB 4.4 adds the
:parameter:`initialSyncTransientErrorRetryPeriodSeconds` server
parameter for controlling the amount of time the secondary attempts to
resume initial sync. If the secondary cannot successfully resume the
initial sync process during the configured time period, it selects a new
healthy source from the replica set and restarts the initial
synchronization process from the beginning. 

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, the secondary would restart the entire initial
sync if it encountered an error during the process.

Rollback Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-rollback-directory.rst

Minimum Oplog Retention Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-minimum-oplog-retention-period.rst

To configure the minimum oplog retention period when starting the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, either:

- Add the :setting:`storage.oplogMinRetentionHours` setting to the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` :ref:`configuration
  file <configuration-options>`.

  *-or-*

- Add the :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours 
  <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>` command line option.

To configure the minimum oplog retention period on a running
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`. Setting
the minimum oplog retention period while the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
is running overrides any values set on startup. You must update
the value of the corresponding configuration file setting or
command line option to persist those changes through a server
restart.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/replica-set-oplog`

Sharded Clusters
----------------

Refinable Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in 4.4, MongoDB provides the
   :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. With the new command,
   you can refine a collection's shard key by adding a suffix field or
   fields to the existing key. Refining a collection's shard key allows
   for a more fine-grained data distribution and can address situations
   where the existing key has led to :ref:`jumbo (i.e. indivisible)
   chunks <jumbo-chunks>` due to insufficient cardinality.

   For example, you may have an existing ``orders`` collection with the
   shard key ``{ customer_id: 1 }``. You can change the shard key by
   adding a suffix ``order_id`` field to the shard key so that ``{
   customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }`` becomes the new shard key, allowing
   data distribution by both ``customer_id`` and ``order_id`` fields.

   To use the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, the sharded
   cluster must have :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>`
   of ``4.4``. For more information, see the
   :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command.

   .. note::

      After you refine the shard key, it may be that not all documents in
      the collection have the suffix field(s). To populate the missing
      shard key field(s), see :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

      Before refining the shard key, ensure that all or most documents in
      the collection have the suffix fields, if possible, to avoid having
      to populate the field afterwards.

   In earlier versions, once you select a shard key, you cannot modify the
   shard key.

**Missing Shard Keys**

.. container::

   With the ability to refine a shard key with a suffix, it may be that
   not all documents in the collection have the suffix fields. Starting in
   version 4.4, documents in a sharded collection can be missing the shard
   key fields. In earlier versions, shard key fields must exist in every
   document for a sharded collection. For details, see
   :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

Hedged Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   To minimize latencies, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, by default, can
   use :ref:`hedge reads <mongos-hedged-reads>`. With hedged reads, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can route read operations to multiple
   members per each queried shard and return results from the first
   respondent per shard. By default, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
   support using hedged reads. To turn off a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance's support for hedged reads, set the
   :parameter:`readHedgingMode` parameter for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.


   Hedged reads are specified per operation as part of the read
   preference. Non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences
   </core/read-preference>` support hedged reads. Read preference
   :readmode:`nearest` specifies hedged read by default.

   For more information, see:

   - :ref:`mongos-hedged-reads`

   - :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-mongos`

Hedged Read Parameters
``````````````````````

.. container::

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Parameter
        - Description

      * - :parameter:`readHedgingMode`

        - Enables or disables :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance's support for
          hedged reads.

      * - :parameter:`maxTimeMSForHedgedReads`

        - Specifies the maximimum time limit (in milliseconds) for the
          additional read sent to :ref:`hedge a read operation
          <mongos-hedged-reads>`.

Hedged Read Option for Read Preference
``````````````````````````````````````

.. container::

   To specify hedged read for a read preference, MongoDB 4.4 introduces
   the :ref:`read-preference-hedged-read`. To set using a MongoDB
   driver, refer to the driver :ecosystem:`read preference API
   documentation</drivers>`.

   The following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods can accept hedge
   options to enable hedged read for the specified read preference:

   - :method:`cursor.readPref()`

   - :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` 

Hedged Read Metrics
```````````````````

.. container::

   The command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` and its corresponding
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`db.serverStatus()` return
   :serverstatus:`hedgingMetrics`.

``balancerCollectionStatus`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   MongoDB 4.4 provides the command :dbcommand:`balancerCollectionStatus`
   and the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method
   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()` that return information about
   whether the chunks of a sharded collection are balanced (i.e. do not
   need to be moved) as of the time the command is run or need to be
   moved. With the command, users can verify that initial chunk creation
   and migration has finished.

Improved ``mongos`` Startup Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongos` adds the following new
default startup behavior:

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` will now preload a sharded cluster's routing
  table on startup, rather than doing so on-demand for the first
  incoming client connection.

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` will now prewarm its connection pool to shard
  hosts on startup, rather than doing so on-demand for incoming
  client connections.

This behavior results in faster servicing of initial client
connections after a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is started or
restarted. In particular, this allows sites that employ multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances to restart them as necessary, or add new
ones, without initial client requests to those instances needing to wait
on connection establishment.

Both routing table preloading and connection pool prewarming are enabled
by default.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following parameters for controlling this behavior:

- :parameter:`loadRoutingTableOnStartup` 

  - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)
  - Enables or disables support for preloading the routing table on
    startup for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

- :parameter:`warmMinConnectionsInShardingTaskExecutorPoolOnStartup`

  - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled) 
  - Enables or disables support for prewarming the connection pool on
    startup for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

- :parameter:`warmMinConnectionsInShardingTaskExecutorPoolOnStartupWaitMS`

  - *Default*: ``2000`` (2 seconds)
  - Sets the timeout in milliseconds before client connections
    to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` are allowed regardless of established
    connection pool size.

Improved Routing Table Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is no longer required after
executing the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` or :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`
commands. These two commands now automatically refresh a sharded
cluster's routing table as needed when run. Manually issuing the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command is still recommended in the cases
described under
:ref:`flushRouterConfig Considerations<flushrouterconfig-considerations>`.

.. _4.4-rel-notes-sharding-compound-hashed:

Compound Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can shard a collection using a compound
shard key with a single hashed field. Prior to 4.4, MongoDB did not
support compound shard keys with a hashed field.

Compound hashed sharding supports features like :ref:`zone sharding
<zone-sharding>`, where the prefix (i.e. first) non-hashed field or
fields support zone ranges while the hashed field supports more even
distribution of the sharded data. For example, the following operation
shards a collection on a compound hashed shard key that supports zoned
sharding:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "examples.compoundHashedCollection",
     { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB" : 1, "fieldC" : "hashed" }
   )

Compound hashed sharding also supports shard keys with a hashed prefix
for resolving data distribution issues related to :ref:`monotonically
increasing fields <shard-key-monotonic>` For example, the
following operation shards a collection on a compound hashed shard key
where the hashed field is the shard key prefix:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "examples.compoundHashedCollection",
     { "_id" : "hashed", "fieldA" : 1}
   )

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding` , :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-compound-hashed-index`

General Sharded Clusters Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Index Consistency Checks
````````````````````````

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :doc:`config server
   </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` primary, by default, checks for
   index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections. The
   command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns the field
   :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` to report on index
   inconsistencies when run on the config server primary.

   To configure the index consistency checks, MongoDB provides the
   following parameters:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 40 65
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Description

      * - :parameter:`enableShardedIndexConsistencyCheck`
    
        - Enable or disable the index consistency checks. 

      * - :parameter:`shardedIndexConsistencyCheckIntervalMS`

        - The interval at which the config server's primary checks the
          index consistency of sharded collections.

Concurrent ``removeShard`` Operations
`````````````````````````````````````

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can have more than one
   :dbcommand:`removeShard` operation in progress.

   In earlier versions, :dbcommand:`removeShard` returns an error if
   another :dbcommand:`removeShard` operation is in progress.

Shard Key Limit
```````````````

.. container::

   Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB removes the 512-byte limit on the
   shard key size. For MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, a shard key cannot
   exceed 512 bytes.

Partial Results
```````````````

.. container::

   Starting in 4.4, if the :dbcommand:`find` or subsequent
   :dbcommand:`getMore` commands return partial results due to the
   unavailability of the queried shard(s), the output includes a
   boolean flag ``partialResultsReturned``.

Transactions
------------

Transactions Support Collection and Index Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4 with
:ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``, you
can:

- Create collections inside of a
  :doc:`multi-document transaction </core/transactions>`.

- Create indexes inside of a multi-document transaction in the
  following scenarios:

  - The index is specified on a non-existing collection. In this case,
    the collection is created implicitly.

  - The index is specified on an empty collection which was
    created earlier in the same transaction.

For more details, see :ref:`transactions-create-collections-indexes`.

With fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, operations that affect the database
catalog, such as creating or dropping a collection or an index, are not
allowed in transactions. For details on transaction restrictions, see
:ref:`transactions-ops-restricted`.

.. note::

   You can only run the :method:`~db.createCollection()` and
   :method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()` methods when using read
   concern level of :readconcern:`"local"`. If you specify a read
   concern level other than :readconcern:`"local"`, the transaction
   fails.

   - :ref:`transactions-operations-ref`

Security Improvements
---------------------

.. _4.4-rel-notes-certificate-expiration-warning:

x.509 Certificates Nearing Expiry Trigger Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
logs a warning on connection if the presented x.509 certificate
expires within ``30`` days of the ``mongod/mongos`` system clock.
Specifically, the following connections to a ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` 
can trigger x.509 certificate expiry warnings:

- A :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or an application using a 
  :ecosystem:`MongoDB driver </drivers>` establishing a 
  :ref:`TLS connection <ssl-clients>` *or* performing 
  :ref:`x.509 client authentication <x509-client-authentication>` with
  a certificate expiring in less than 30 days. (i.e. 
  the certificate specified to :option:`mongo --tlsCertificateKeyFile 
  <mongo --tlsCertificateKeyFile>` or 
  :urioption:`tlsCertificateKeyFile`).

- A :binary:`~bin.mongod` cluster member performing 
  :ref:`x.509 membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  with a certificate expiring in less than 30 days. (i.e. the 
  certificate specified to 
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`,
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterCertificateSelector`,
  :option:`mongod --tlsClusterFile <mongod --tlsClusterFile>` or
  :option:`mongod --tlsClusterCertificateSelector 
  <mongod --tlsClusterCertificateSelector>`).

- A :binary:`~bin.mongos` cluster member performing
  :ref:`x.509 membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  with a certificate expiring within 30 days. (i.e. the certificate 
  specified to
  (i.e. the 
  certificate specified to 
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`,
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterCertificateSelector`,
  :option:`mongos --tlsClusterFile <mongos --tlsClusterFile>` or
  :option:`mongos --tlsClusterCertificateSelector`).

The warning log message resembles the following:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   <Timestamp> W NETWORK [connection] Peer certificate <Certificate Subject Name> expires...

Consider proactively renewing client x.509 certificates nearing
expiration to ensure continued connectivity to the cluster.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :parameter:`tlsX509ExpirationWarningThresholdDays`
parameter for controlling certificate expiration warning threshold. Set
the parameter to ``0`` to disable the warning. For complete
documentation, see :parameter:`tlsX509ExpirationWarningThresholdDays`.

Platform Support
----------------

- MongoDB 4.4 removes support for:

  - Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2

  - Windows 8 / Server 2012

  - Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2

  - macOS 10.12
  
See :ref:`prod-notes-supported-platforms`.

.. _4.4-rel-notes-tcp-fast-open:

Support for TCP Fast Open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` support TCP Fast Open (TFO) connections by
default. TFO requires both the client and the ``mongod/mongos``
host machines support and enable TFO:

Windows
  The following Windows operating systems support TFO:

  - Microsoft Windows Server 2016 or later.
  - Microsoft Windows 10 Update 1607 or later.

macOS
  macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and later support TFO

Linux
  Linux operating systems running Linux Kernel 3.7 or later can
  support inbound TFO connections.

  Linux operating systems running Linux Kernel 4.11 or later can
  support both inbound and outbound TFO connections.

  Set the value of ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen`` to enable 
  support for inbound and/or outbound TFO connections:

  - Set to ``1`` to enable only outbound TFO connections
  - Set to ``2`` to enable only inbound TFO connections
  - Set to ``3`` to enable inbound and outbound TFO connections.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following parameters for controlling 
TFO:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenServer` 
     - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)
     
       Enables or disables support for inbound TFO connections to the
       ``mongod/mongos``

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenClient`
     - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)

       *Linux Operating System Only* 
       
       Enables or disables support for outbound TFO connections
       from the ``mongod/mongos``.

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenQueueSize`
     - *Default*: ``1024``

       Control the size of the queue of pending TFO connections.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following counters to the output of 
:dbcommand:`serverStatus` and :method:`db.serverStatus()`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Counter
     - Description

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.kernelSetting` 
     - *Linux only* 
     
       Indicates kernel support for TFO.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.serverSupported` 
     - Indicates operating system support for incoming TFO connections.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.clientSupported` 
     - Indicates operating system support for outgoing TFO connections.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.accepted` 
     - Indicates the total number of accepted incoming TFO connections 
       to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` since the
       ``mongod/mongos`` last started.

A complete discussion of TFO is outside the scope of this documentation.
For more information on TFO, start with the following external 
resources:

- `RFC7413 TCP Fast Open <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7413>`__
- `TCP Fast Open (en.wikipedia.org) <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TCP_Fast_Open&oldid=922380898>`__

General Improvements
--------------------

.. _4.4-rel-notes-sort-memory-limit:

Blocking Sort Limit Increased
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order for a
given :method:`cursor.sort()` operation, MongoDB must perform a blocking
sort on the data. A blocking sort indicates that MongoDB must consume
and process all input documents to the sort before returning results.
Blocking sorts do not block concurrent operations on the
collection or database.

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB returned an error if a blocking sort
operations required more than 32 megabytes of system memory. Starting in
MongoDB 4.4, blocking sort operations increase the limit on system
memory to use for the sort operation to 100 megabytes. For blocking sort
operations which require more than 100 megabytes of system memory,
MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query specifies
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).

For more information on sorting and index use, see
:ref:`sort-index-use`.

``allowDiskUse()`` Support for Queries with Large In-Memory Sorts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order,
MongoDB must perform a blocking sort operation on the data. A blocking
sort indicates that MongoDB must consume and process all input documents
to the sort before returning results. Blocking sorts do not block
concurrent operations on the collection or database.

.. versionadded:: 4.4

If MongoDB requires using more than 100 megabytes of system memory for
the blocking sort operation, MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query
specifies :method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).
:method:`~cursor.allowDiskUse()` allows MongoDB to use temporary files
on disk to store data exceeding the 100 megabyte system memory limit
while processing a blocking sort operation.
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` has no effect on sort operations
resolved using an index *or* blocking sort operations which require less
than 100 megabytes of system memory.

If using the :dbcommand:`find` database command, specify the optional
parameter ``allowDiskUse: true`` to allow MongoDB to use temporary files
on disk to store data exceeding the 100 megabyte system memory limit
while processing a blocking sort operation

For instructions on enabling :method:`~cursor.allowDiskUse` for queries
issued through a MongoDB driver, defer to the documentation for your
preferred :ecosystem:`MongoDB 4.4-compatible driver </drivers>`.

db.auth() Can Prompt for Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
:ref:`db-auth-syntax-username-password` prompts for the password if
you do not pass in the password or the :method:`passwordPrompt()`
method for the ``<password>``.

Support for ``$natural`` Sort on Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-natural-sort-views.rst

Validation Changes for ``$meta``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-projection-sort-meta.rst

Support for Diagnostic Backtrace Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
processes running on Linux will now log a backtrace for each of their
running threads upon receipt of a ``SIGUSR2`` signal. This backtrace can
be analyzed for diagnostic information or provided to MongoDB support as
needed. This functionality is currently available only on the ``x86_64``
architecture. For more information on using this feature, see
:ref:`sigusr2-diagnostic-backtrace`.

Updated ``ulimit`` Startup Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will log a startup
warning if a platform's configured ``ulimit`` value for number of open
files is under ``64000``. Previously, a warning would only be
logged if this value was under ``1000``. See
:ref:`recommended-ulimit-settings` for more information.

New ``replanReason`` Database Profiler Output Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :data:`replanReason<system.profile.replanReason>`
field to
:doc:`database profiler output </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
and :doc:`diagnostic log messages </reference/log-messages>`. The
``replanReason`` field contains the reason the query system evicted a
:ref:`cached plan <query-plans-query-optimization>`.


``dbStats`` and ``collStats`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command and its :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
helper :method:`db.stats()` return:

- :data:`~dbStats.totalSize`, which is the sum of
  :data:`~dbStats.storageSize` and :data:`~dbStats.indexSize`.

The :dbcommand:`collStats` command, its :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
helper :method:`db.collection.stats()`, and the :pipeline:`$collStats`
aggregation stage return:

- :data:`~collStats.totalSize`, which is the sum of
  :data:`~collStats.storageSize` and :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize`.

- :data:`~collStats.freeStorageSize`, which is the amount of storage
  available for reuse.

Delete and Hint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :dbcommand:`delete` command and the
associated :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods
:method:`db.collection.deleteOne()` and
:method:`db.collection.deleteMany()` can accept a ``hint`` argument to
specify the index to use.

Additionally, starting in MongoDB 4.4, when a :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
command has ``remove`` set to ``true``, the command can accept a
``hint`` argument to specify the index to use.

See:

- :dbcommand:`delete`
- :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`
- :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()`
- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`

``dropIndexes`` Can Abort In-Progress Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an index specified to :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` is still building,
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes` attempts to abort the in-progress build.
Aborting an index build has the same effect as dropping the built index.
Prior to MongoDB 4.4, :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` would return an error if
the collection had any in-progress index builds. This behavior also
applies to the shell helpers :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` and
:method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()`.

- The indexes specified to :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` /
  :method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` must be the entire set of
  in-progress builds associated to a given index builder, i.e. the
  indexes built by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes` or
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.

- The index specified to :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` must be
  the only index associated to the index builder, i.e. the indexes built
  by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes` or
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.

To drop a specific index out of a set of related in-progress builds,
wait until the index builds complete and specify that index to
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes` or its shell helpers.

For more complete documentation, see:

- :ref:`dropIndexes-cmd-index-builds` for the :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command.
- :ref:`dropIndexes-method-index-builds` for the :method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` method.
- :ref:`dropIndex-method-index-builds` for the :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` method.

JavaScript Execution on ``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB allows JavaScript execution on
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. To disable JavaScript execution on a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance:

- Set
  :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` configuration option to false, or 

- Specify the :option:`--noscripting <mongos --noscripting>`
  command-line option.

Earlier versions of MongoDB do not allow JavaScript execution on
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Deprecation of ``geoHaystack`` Index and ``geoSearch`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-geo-deprecation.rst

Global Default Read and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` 4.4+
   :class: note

   Each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set or sharded cluster
   *must* have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <set-fcv>` set to at
   least ``4.4`` to configure global default read and write concern.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, replica sets and sharded clusters support
configuring global default read and write concern settings. Clients
which do not explicitly specify a given read or write concern setting
inherit the corresponding global default setting.

To configure default global default read or write concern, MongoDB adds
the :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` administrative command. For replica
sets, issue the command against the :term:`primary` member. For sharded
clusters, issue the command from a :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

To retrieve the global default read or write concern settings, MongoDB
adds the :dbcommand:`getDefaultRWConcern` administrative command.

.. _4.4-rel-notes-compound-hashed-index:

Compound Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds support for creating compound indexes with a single
:ref:`hashed field <index-type-hashed>`. MongoDB 4.2 and earlier
only supported single field hashed indexes.

The following operation creates a compound hashed index on ``country``
and ``_id``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.examples.createIndex( { "country" : 1, "_id" : "hashed" } )

Compound hashed indexes require :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion
<view-fcv>` set to ``4.4``.

.. seealso:: :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-sharding-compound-hashed`

Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/4.4-compatibility`.

.. _4.4-upgrade:

Upgrade Procedures
------------------

.. admonition:: Feature Compatibility Version

   To upgrade from 4.2 deployment, the 4.2 deployment must have
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.2``. To check the version:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   For specific details on verifying and setting the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` as well as information on other
   prerequisites/considerations for upgrades, refer to the individual
   upgrade instructions:

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.4-upgrade-standalone`

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.4-upgrade-replica-set`
