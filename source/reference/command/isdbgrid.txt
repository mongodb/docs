.. dbcommand:: isdbgrid

   This command verifies that a process is a :program:`mongos`.

   If you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when connected to a
   :program:`mongos`, the response document includes the ``isdbgrid``
   field set to ``1``. The returned document is similar to the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "isdbgrid" : 1, "hostname" : "app.example.net", "ok" : 1 }

   If you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when connected to a
   :program:`mongod`, MongoDB returns an error document. The
   :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command is not available to :program:`mongod`.
   The error document, however, also includes a line that reads
   ``"isdbgrid" : 1``, just as in the document returned for a
   :program:`mongos`. The error document is similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         "errmsg" : "no such cmd: isdbgrid",
         "bad cmd" : {
               "isdbgrid" : 1
         },
         "ok" : 0
      }

   You can instead use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command to determine
   connection to a :program:`mongos`. When connected to a
   :program:`mongos`, the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command returns a document that
   contains the string ``isdbgrid`` in the ``msg`` field.
