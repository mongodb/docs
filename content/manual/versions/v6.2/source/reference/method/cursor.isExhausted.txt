   :returns: Boolean.

   :method:`cursor.isExhausted()` returns ``true`` if the cursor
   is closed *and* there are no remaining objects in the batch.

   Use :method:`~cursor.isExhausted()` to support iterating cursors
   that remain open even if there are no documents remaining in the
   current batch, such as :method:`tailable <cursor.tailable()>` or
   :method:`change stream <db.collection.watch()>` cursors.

Example
-------

Consider the following ``while`` loop iterating through updates to
a :method:`change stream <db.collection.watch()>` cursor:

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.collection.watch();

   while (watchCursor.hasNext()) {
      watchCursor.next();
   }

A change stream cursor can return an empty batch if no new data changes
have occured within a set period of time. This causes the while loop
to exit prematurely as :method:`cursor.hasNext()` returns ``false``
when it detects the empty batch. However, the change stream cursor 
is still open and able to return more documents in the future.

Use :method:`cursor.isExhausted()` to ensure the while loop only exits
when the cursor is closed *and* there are no documents remaining in the
batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.collection.watch();

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()) {
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         watchCursor.next();
      }
   }
