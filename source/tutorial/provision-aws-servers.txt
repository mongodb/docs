========================
Add AWS Servers to |mms|
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that you can provision EC2
servers directly from the |mms| interface. When you provision an EC2 server
from |mms|, |mms| automatically installs the Automation Agent to the
server and is ready to deploy managed MongoDB instances on this
system.

Prerequisites
-------------

To provision EC2 servers through |mms|, you must first :doc:`Configure AWS
Integration </tutorial/configure-aws-settings>`.

.. _aws-machine-size:

AWS Machine Size
----------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines have sufficient capacity in terms of memory (RAM) and
storage. The root volume should have at least 25 gigabytes.

|mms| does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the ``m3.medium``
instance. |mms| currently supports the AWS Linux and Ubuntu
operating systems.

   three different deployment tutorials:
