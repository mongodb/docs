Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a **change stream** to monitor real-time
changes to your database. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+} feature that
allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a collection, database,
or deployment.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>`.

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method. The instance on which you
call the ``watch()`` method on determines the scope of events that the change
stream listens for. You can call the ``watch()`` method on the following
classes:

- ``MongoClient``: To monitor all changes in the MongoDB deployment
- ``Database``: To monitor changes in all collections in the database
- ``Collection``: To monitor changes in the collection

The following example opens a change stream on the ``restaurants`` collection
and outputs changes as they occur. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous`
tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.py
         :start-after: start-open-change-stream
         :end-before: end-open-change-stream
         :language: python
   
   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams-async.py
          :start-after: start-open-change-stream
          :end-before: end-open-change-stream
          :language: python

To begin watching for changes, run the application. Then, in a separate
application or shell, modify the ``restaurants`` collection. The following
example updates a document with a ``name`` field value of ``Blarney Castle``. Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. _pymongo-change-stream-update:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.py
         :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
         :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
         :language: python
   
   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams-async.py
          :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
          :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
          :language: python

When you update the collection, the change stream application prints the change
as it occurs. The printed change event resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   {'_id': {'_data': '...'}, 'operationType': 'update', 'clusterTime': Timestamp(...), 'wallTime': datetime.datetime(...),
   'ns': {'db': 'sample_restaurants', 'coll': 'restaurants'}, 'documentKey': {'_id': ObjectId('...')}, 
   'updateDescription': {'updatedFields': {'cuisine': 'Irish'}, 'removedFields': [], 'truncatedArrays': []}}

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

You can pass the ``pipeline`` parameter to the ``watch()`` method to modify the
change stream output. This parameter allows you to watch for only specified
change events. Format the parameter as a list of objects that each represent an
aggregation stage.

You can specify the following stages in the ``pipeline`` parameter:

- ``$addFields``
- ``$match``
- ``$project``
- ``$replaceRoot``
- ``$replaceWith``
- ``$redact``
- ``$set``
- ``$unset``

The following example uses the ``pipeline`` parameter to open a change stream
that records only update operations. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous`
tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.py
         :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
         :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
         :language: python
   
   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams-async.py
          :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
          :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
          :language: python

To learn more about modifying your change stream output, see the
:manual:`Modify Change Stream Output
</changeStreams/#modify-change-stream-output>` section in the {+mdb-server+}
manual.

Modify ``watch()`` Behavior
---------------------------

The ``watch()`` method accepts optional parameters, which represent
options you can use to configure the operation. If you don't specify any
options, the driver does not customize the operation.

The following table describes the options you can set to customize the behavior
of ``watch()``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``pipeline``
     - | A list of aggregation pipeline stages that modify the output of the
         change stream.

   * - ``full_document``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document after the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`pymongo-change-stream-pre-post-image`.

   * - ``full_document_before_change``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document as it was before the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`pymongo-change-stream-pre-post-image`.
    
   * - ``resume_after``
     - | Directs ``watch()`` to resume returning changes after the
         operation specified in the resume token.
       | Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the ``_id``
         field. Pass the entire ``_id`` field of the change event document that
         represents the operation you want to resume after.
       | ``resume_after`` is mutually exclusive with ``start_after`` and ``start_at_operation_time``.

   * - ``start_after``
     - | Directs ``watch()`` to start a new change stream after the
         operation specified in the resume token. Allows notifications to
         resume after an invalidate event.
       | Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the ``_id``
         field. Pass the entire ``_id`` field of the change event document that
         represents the operation you want to resume after.
       | ``start_after`` is mutually exclusive with ``resume_after`` and ``start_at_operation_time``.
       
   * - ``start_at_operation_time``
     - | Directs ``watch()`` to return only events that occur after the
         specified timestamp.
       | ``start_at_operation_time`` is mutually exclusive with ``resume_after`` and ``start_after``.

   * - ``max_await_time_ms``
     - | The maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the server waits for new
         data changes to report to the change stream cursor before returning an
         empty batch. Defaults to 1000 milliseconds.

   * - ``show_expanded_events``
     - | Starting in {+mdb-server+} v6.0, change streams support change notifications
         for Data Definition Language (DDL) events, such as the ``createIndexes`` and ``dropIndexes`` events. To
         include expanded events in a change stream, create the change stream
         cursor and set this parameter to ``True``.

   * - ``batch_size``
     - | The maximum number of change events to return in each batch of the
         response from the MongoDB cluster.

   * - ``collation``
     - | The collation to use for the change stream cursor.

   * - ``session``
     - | An instance of ``ClientSession``.

   * - ``comment``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation.

.. _pymongo-change-stream-pre-post-image:

Include Pre-Images and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You can enable pre-images and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses MongoDB v6.0 or later.

By default, when you perform an operation on a collection, the
corresponding change event includes only the delta of the fields
modified by that operation. To see the full document before or after a
change, specify the ``full_document_before_change`` or the ``full_document``
parameters in the ``watch()`` method.

The **pre-image** is the full version of a document *before* a change. To include the
pre-image in the change stream event, set the ``full_document_before_change``
parameter to one of the following values:

- ``whenAvailable``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the pre-image is available.
- ``required``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The **post-image** is the full version of a document *after* a change. To include the
post-image in the change stream event, set the ``full_document`` parameter to
one of the following values:

- ``updateLookup``: The change event includes a copy of the entire changed
  document from some time after the change.
- ``whenAvailable``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the post-image is available.
- ``required``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the post-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method on a collection and includes the post-image
of updated documents by specifying the ``fullDocument`` parameter. Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.py
         :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
         :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
         :language: python
   
   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams-async.py
          :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
          :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
          :language: python

With the change stream application running, updating a document in the
``restaurants`` collection by using the :ref:`preceding update example
<pymongo-change-stream-update>` prints a change event resembling the following:

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 2,5

   {'_id': {'_data': '...'}, 'operationType': 'update', 'clusterTime': Timestamp(...), 'wallTime': datetime.datetime(...),
    'fullDocument': {'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'address': {...}, 'borough': 'Queens', 
    'cuisine': 'Irish', 'grades': [...], 'name': 'Blarney Castle', 'restaurant_id': '40366356'},
    'ns': {'db': 'sample_restaurants', 'coll': 'restaurants'}, 'documentKey': {'_id': ObjectId('...')},
    'updateDescription': {'updatedFields': {'cuisine': 'Irish'}, 'removedFields': [], 'truncatedArrays': []}}
