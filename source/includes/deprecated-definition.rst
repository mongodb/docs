.. note::

   MongoDB marks a version as deprecated when we no longer support it.
   While a deprecated version might still work with the corresponding
   |onprem| release, we will remove the support for this version in the
   future. |mdb-support| doesn't recommend using this version and
   provides limited assistance for using this version with |onprem|.
