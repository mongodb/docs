This section of the style guide provides detailed guidelines about and
instructions for applying markup conventions for reStructuredText (RST)
and Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) files.

ReStructured Text
-----------------

MongoDB documentation uses reStructuredText markup syntax
with `Sphinx extensions <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html>`__.

{+rst+} is a powerful and straightforward lightweight markup language
that, in combination with Sphinx, provides a wide range of facilities
for intelligent and appealing documentation creation. It uses simple
and implicit syntax to introduce a variety of content elements such as
titles, code blocks, vertical lists, and many others. All the source
content formatted using {+rst+} is stored in files with the ``.rst``
extension.

For more information on the {+rst+} conventions the Information
Development team follows, see the following resources:

* `OpenStack RST conventions <https://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/rst-conv.html>`_.

Parts of reStructuredText
-------------------------

A :sphinx-rst:`directive </directives.html?highlight=directive>` defines block-level markup.

Docutils provides the following directives

.. code-block:: rst

   .. directive::

   :role:
