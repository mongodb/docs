This page describes how to troubleshoot common issues that you
might encounter when :ref:`integrating <amazon-bedrock>` {+avs+} 
with Amazon Bedrock.

To troubleshoot issues that are not covered on this page, 
contact |mdb-support|.

General Troubleshooting 
-----------------------

Refer to the following steps for general troubleshooting guidance.

Knowledge Base Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience issues when creating the knowledge base, 
check the following:

- Use the correct hostname and ensure that it
  contains a ``-pl`` suffix on the {+cluster+} if using PrivateLink.

  The hostname is the |url| for your |service| {+cluster+}
  located in its :manual:`connection string
  </reference/connection-string/#find-your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>`.
  The hostname uses the following format:

  .. code-block::

     <clusterName>.mongodb.net

- Specify the same database, collection, and vector index names as the names you specified in |service|.
  Ensure that the database user has access to the database in |service|.

- Specify the correct username and password keys in Secrets Manager, and ensure the |arn|\s are correct.
  To learn more, see :aws:`AWS Secrets Manager concepts </secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html>`.
  
- If you're using PrivateLink, enter the correct PrivateLink service name 
  when configuring the knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock.
    
  .. important::

     The PrivateLink service endpoint must be in the same account as the 
     knowledge base.

- If you encounter permission-related issues, see
  `How do I troubleshoot permission errors that I get when I create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock?
  <https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/bedrock-knowledge-base-permission-errors>`__.

Data Sync and Retrieval Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience issues when syncing or retrieving data from the 
knowledge base, check the following:

- Ensure that the data you want to ingest is in a format
  supported by the foundation model.
  For example, if you're using a text-based model, 
  ensure that the data is in text format.
  
- Ensure that you can connect to your {+cluster+} and that
  its credentials and network access haven't changed.

- Ensure that you specify the correct number of dimensions in your {+avs+} index
  corresponding to the foundation model you've chosen.
  
- If attempting to filter your data, ensure that you've defined 
  metadata fields as :ref:`pre-filters <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter>` 
  in your index definition and that they correspond to the actual fields in 
  your data source.

.. note::

   Each time you add, modify, or remove files from the |s3| bucket for a data source, 
   you must sync the data source so that it's re-indexed to the knowledge base. 
   Syncing is incremental, so Amazon Bedrock only processes the objects in your |s3| bucket 
   that you've added, modified, or deleted since the last sync. 
   To learn more, refer to the :aws:`Amazon Bedrock documentation <bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-sync-ingest.html>`.

Specific Errors
---------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 55 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error Message
     - Troubleshooting Steps

   * - When setting up a knowledge base:
       
       ``AccessDeniedException: User ... is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateRole on resource ... because no identity-based policy allows the iam:CreateRole action``

     - Ensure that you have the IAM permissions to create IAM roles and policies. To learn more, see the 
       :aws:`Amazon Bedrock documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/iam-permissions.html>`.

   * - When trying to sync a data source for a knowledge base:
 
       ``ConflictException: You cannot start an ingestion job on a knowledgeBase with status CREATING.``

     - This occurs when you attempt to sync a data source for a knowledge base 
       that is still in the process of being created. Ensure that the knowledge base 
       is in a **Ready** state before syncing a data source for it.

       To learn how to view the status of your knowledge base, see the
       :aws:`Amazon Bedrock documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-info.html>`.

   * - When attempting to add a knowledge base to an agent:
      
       ``You must save your agent with Agent Resource Role defined before adding a knowledge base.``

     - This occurs if you attempt to add a knowledge base to a new agent 
       that you're creating before you've saved the agent. You must save the agent first, 
       and then add the knowledge base to the agent.

   * - When testing an agent:
       
       ``Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request.``

     - This error occurs when you attempt to use a foundation model that you do not
       have access to. You must request access to Amazon Bedrock models before they're available 
       for use. To learn how to request or modify model access, refer to the 
       :aws:`Amazon Bedrock documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html>`.

   * - When using the Amazon Titan Text Embedding model:
     
       ``BSON field '$vectorSearch.queryVector.####' is the wrong type 'int', expected type 'double'``
       
     - This is a known issue when using {+avs+} with this model. To resolve this issue, 
       contact |mdb-support|.
