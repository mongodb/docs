.. _java-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Realm 
automatically creates a :ref:`user account <user-accounts>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<java-register-a-new-user-account>` and :ref:`confirm 
<java-confirm-a-new-users-email-address>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to a Realm application.

.. _java-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

The Java SDK does not have the ability to delete users through the SDK. 
You can delete users from the server using the :ref:`App Services 
Admin API <admin-api>` ``delete a user`` endpoints. You could optionally 
create an :ref:`Atlas Function <functions>` that uses the Admin API to 
delete a user, and :ref:`call the function from the SDK <cpp-call-a-function>`.

To use your app in the future, the user must sign up for a new account. 
They can use the same credentials (depending on the authentication provider),
but will not have the same User ID as their deleted account.

.. important:: Deleting All User Data

   Deleting a user only deletes the :ref:`user object <user-objects>`, 
   which may contain associated metadata from the associated auth provider. 
   This does not delete :ref:`custom user data <java-custom-user-data>`
   or other user data that your app stores in a linked collection or external services.

   Use the :ref:`Authentication Trigger DELETE event <authentication-event-operation-types>`
   to programmatically clean up other data when you delete a user. For example, 
   you can delete the user's data from your custom user data collection or another service.
