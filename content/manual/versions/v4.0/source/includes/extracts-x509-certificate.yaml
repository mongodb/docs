ref: x509-certificate-client
content: |
   The client certificate must have the following
   properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
     for both the client and the server.

   - Client certificates must contain the following fields:

     .. code-block:: none

        keyUsage = digitalSignature
        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

   - Each unique MongoDB user must have a unique certificate.

   - A client x.509 certificate's subject, which contains the
     Distinguished Name (``DN``), must **differ** from that of a
     :ref:`x509-member-certificate`.
     
     At least one of the Organization (``O``), Organizational Unit
     (``OU``), or Domain Component (``DC``) attributes in the client
     certificate must differ from those in the
     :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` server certificate.

     .. warning::

        If a client x.509 certificate's subject has the same ``O``,
        ``OU``, and ``DC`` combination as the
        :ref:`x509-member-certificate`, the client connection is
        rejected. Only
        :ref:`cluster member x509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>`
        should use the same ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` combinations as
        this grants full permissions.

ref: x509-certificate-member
content: |
   The member certificate, used for internal authentication to verify
   membership to the sharded cluster or a replica set, must have the
   following properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
     certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

   - The Distinguished Name (``DN``), found in the member certificate's
     ``subject``, must specify a non-empty value for *at least one* of the
     following attributes: Organization (``O``), the Organizational Unit
     (``OU``) or the Domain Component (``DC``).

   - The Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit
     attributes (``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) must
     match those from the :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` certificate for
     the other cluster members. To match, the certificate must match
     all specifications of these attributes, or even the
     non-specification of these attributes. The order of the
     attributes does not matter.

     In the following example, the two ``DN``\'s contain matching
     specifications for ``O``, ``OU`` as well as the non-specification of
     the ``DC`` attribute.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        C=US, ST=CA, O=MongoDB, OU=Dept1, CN=host2

     However, the following two ``DN``\'s contain a mismatch for the
     ``OU`` attribute since one contains two ``OU`` specifications and
     the other, only one specification.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,OU=Sales,O=MongoDB
        CN=host2,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB

   - Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
     Name (``SAN``) entries must match the hostname of the server, used by
     the other members of the cluster.

     For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the following
     subjects:

     .. code-block:: sh

        subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US

   - *If* the certificate includes the Extended Key Usage (``extendedKeyUsage``)
     setting, the value must include ``clientAuth`` ("TLS Web Client
     Authentication").

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
   
     You can also use a certificate that does not include the Extended
     Key Usage (EKU).

ref: x509-member-auth-configuration
content: |
   To specify x.509 for internal authentication, in addition to the other
   TLS/SSL configurations appropriate for your deployment, for each member of
   the replica set or sharded cluster, include either:

   - :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode` and :setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile`
     if using a :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, or

   - ``--clusterAuthMode`` and ``--sslClusterFile`` command line
     options.
---
ref: x509-member-certificate-PEMKeyFile
content: |
   To configure MongoDB for client certificate authentication, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` specify a ``PEMKeyFile`` to
   prove its identity to clients, either through
   :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` setting in the configuration file or
   ``--sslPEMKeyFile`` command line option.
   
   If no :setting:`~net.ssl.clusterFile` certificate is specified for
   internal member authentication, MongoDB will attempt to use the
   ``PEMKeyFile`` certificate for member authentication. In order to use
   ``PEMKeyFile`` certificate for internal authentication as well as for
   client authentication, then the ``PEMKeyFile``
   certificate must either:

   - Omit ``extendedKeyUsage`` or

   - Specify ``extendedKeyUsage`` values
     that include ``clientAuth`` in addition to ``serverAuth``.
