MongoDB provides a number of features that allow application
developers and database administrators to customize the behavior of a
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set` deployment so that
MongoDB may be *more* "data center aware," or allow operational
and location-based separation.

MongoDB also supports segregation based on functional parameters, to ensure
that certain :program:`mongod` instances are only used for reporting workloads
or that certain high-frequency portions of a sharded collection only exist on
specific shards.

The following documents, *found either in this section or other sections
of this manual*, provide information on customizing a deployment for
operation- and location-based separation:
