Use Realm with Actors - Swift SDK
=================================

Starting with Realm Swift SDK version 10.39.0, Realm supports built-in 
functionality for using Realm with Swift Actors. Realm's actor support 
provides an alternative to managing threads or dispatch queues to perform 
asynchronous work. You can use Realm with actors in a few different ways:

- Work with realm *only* on a specific actor with an actor-isolated realm
- Use Realm across actors based on the needs of your application

You might want to use an actor-isolated realm if you want to restrict all
realm access to a single actor. This negates the need to pass data across
the actor boundary, and can simplify data race debugging.

You might want to use realms across actors in cases where you want to 
perform different types of work on different actors. For example, you might
want to read objects on the MainActor but use a background actor for large 
writes.

For general information about Swift actors, refer to :apple:`Apple's Actor 
documentation <documentation/swift/actor>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use Realm in a Swift actor, your project must:

- Use Realm Swift SDK version 10.39.0 or later
- Use Swift 5.8/Xcode 14.3

In addition, we strongly recommend enabling these settings in your project:

- ``SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY=complete``: enables strict concurrency checking
- ``OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS=-Xfrontend-enable-actor-data-race-checks``: enables 
  runtime actor data-race detection

About the Examples on This Page
-------------------------------

The examples on this page use the following model:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.model.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-open-actor-confined-realm:

Open an Actor-Isolated Realm
----------------------------

You can use the Swift async/await syntax to await opening a realm.

Initializing a realm with ``try await Realm()`` opens a MainActor-isolated
realm. Alternately, you can explicitly specify an actor when opening a 
realm with the ``await`` syntax.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.await-main-actor-realm.swift
   :language: swift

You can specify a default configuration or customize your configuration when 
opening an actor-isolated realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.actor-confined-realm-with-config.swift
   :language: swift

For more general information about configuring a realm, refer to 
:ref:`ios-configure-and-open-a-realm`.

You can open a synced realm as an actor-isolated realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.actor-confined-synced-realm.swift
   :language: swift

For more general information about opening a synced realm, refer to 
:ref:`ios-configure-and-open-a-synced-realm`.

.. _swift-define-realm-actor:

Define a Custom Realm Actor
---------------------------

You can define a specific actor to manage Realm in asynchronous contexts.
You can use this actor to manage realm access and perform write operations.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.define-realm-actor.swift
   :language: swift

An actor-isolated realm may be used with either local or global actors.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.global-actor-example.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-actor-synchronous-isolated-function:

Use a Realm Actor Synchronously in an Isolated Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a function is confined to a specific actor, you can use the actor-isolated
realm synchronously.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.actor-isolated-realm-synchronous.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-actor-async-nonisolated-function:

Use a Realm Actor in Async Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a function isn't confined to a specific actor, you can use your Realm actor
with Swift's async/await syntax.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.actor-isolated-realm-async.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-write-to-actor-confined-realm:

Write to an Actor-Isolated Realm
--------------------------------

Actor-isolated realms can use Swift async/await syntax for asynchronous
writes. Using ``try await realm.asyncWrite { ... }`` suspends the current task,
acquires the write lock without blocking the current thread, and then invokes
the block. Realm writes the data to disk on a background thread and resumes 
the task when that completes. 

This function from the example ``RealmActor`` defined above shows how you might
write to an actor-isolated realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.write-async.swift
   :language: swift

And you might perform this write using Swift's async syntax:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.actor-isolated-realm-async.swift
   :language: swift

This does not block the calling thread while waiting to write. It does 
not perform I/O on the calling thread. For small writes, this is safe to 
use from ``@MainActor`` functions without blocking the UI. Writes that 
negatively impact your app's performance due to complexity and/or platform 
resource constraints may still benefit from being done on a background thread. 

Asynchronous writes are only supported for actor-isolated Realms or in
``@MainActor`` functions.

.. _swift-realm-cannot-cross-actor-boundary:

Pass Realm Data Across the Actor Boundary
-----------------------------------------

Realm objects are not :apple:`Sendable <documentation/swift/sendable>`, 
and cannot cross the actor boundary directly. To pass Realm data across 
the actor boundary, you have two options:

- Pass a ``ThreadSafeReference`` to or from the actor
- Pass other types that *are* Sendable, such as passing values directly
  or by creating structs to pass across actor boundaries

.. _swift-pass-thread-safe-reference-across-actors:

Pass a ThreadSafeReference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a 
:swift-sdk:`ThreadSafeReference <Structs/ThreadSafeReference.html>` on an 
actor where you have access to the object. In this case, we create a 
``ThreadSafeReference`` on the ``MainActor``. Then, pass the ``ThreadSafeReference`` to the destination actor. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.pass-tsr-across-actor-boundaries.swift
   :language: swift

On the destination actor, you must ``resolve()`` the reference within a 
write transaction before you can use it. This retrieves a version of the 
object local to that actor.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.resolve-tsr-on-actor.swift
   :language: swift

.. important::

   You must resolve a ``ThreadSafeReference`` exactly once. Otherwise,
   the source realm remains pinned until the reference gets
   deallocated. For this reason, ``ThreadSafeReference`` should be
   short-lived.
   
   If you may need to share the same realm object across actors more than 
   once, you may prefer to share the :ref:`primary key <swift-primary-keys>` 
   and :ref:`query for it <ios-find-a-specific-object-by-primary-key>` on 
   the actor where you want to use it. Refer to the "Pass a Primary Key 
   and Query for the Object on Another Actor" section on this page for an example.

Pass a Sendable Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Realm objects are not Sendable, you can work around this by passing 
Sendable types across actor boundaries. You can use a few strategies to
pass Sendable types and work with data across actor boundaries:

- Pass Sendable Realm types or primitive values instead of complete Realm objects
- Pass an object's primary key and query for the object on another actor
- Create a Sendable representation of your Realm object, such as a struct

Pass Sendable Realm Types and Primitive Values
``````````````````````````````````````````````

If you only need a piece of information from the Realm object, such as a
``String`` or ``Int``, you can pass the value directly across actors instead
of passing the Realm object. For a full list of which Realm types are Sendable,
refer to :ref:`concurrency-page-sendable-thread-confined-reference`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.pass-primitive-data-across-actors.swift
   :language: swift

Pass a Primary Key and Query for the Object on Another Actor
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you want to use a Realm object on another actor, you can share the 
:ref:`primary key <swift-primary-keys>` and 
:ref:`query for it <ios-find-a-specific-object-by-primary-key>` on the actor 
where you want to use it.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.query-for-data-on-another-actor.swift
   :language: swift

Create a Sendable Representation of Your Object
```````````````````````````````````````````````

If you need to work with more than a simple value, but don't want the 
overhead of passing around ``ThreadSafeReferences`` or querying objects on 
different actors, you can create a struct or other Sendable representation
of your data to pass across the actor boundary.

For example, your actor might have a function that creates a struct 
representation of the Realm object.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.pass-data-as-struct.swift
   :language: swift

Then, you can call a function to get the data as a struct on another actor.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.get-actor-confined-data-as-struct.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-observe-notifications-on-another-actor:

Observe Notifications on a Different Actor
------------------------------------------

You can observe notifications on an actor-isolated realm using Swift's 
async/await syntax.

Calling ``await object.observe(on: Actor)`` or 
``await collection.observe(on: Actor)`` registers a block to be called 
each time the object or collection changes.

The SDK asynchronously calls the block on the given actor's executor.

For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
processes, the SDK calls the block when the realm is (auto)refreshed 
to a version including the changes. For local writes, the SDK calls the block
at some point in the future after the write transaction is committed.

Like :ref:`other Realm notifications <ios-react-to-changes>`, you can 
only observe objects or collections managed by a realm. You must retain the 
returned token for as long as you want to watch for updates. 

If you need to manually advance the state of an observed realm on the main 
thread or on another actor, call ``await realm.asyncRefresh()``. 
This updates the realm and outstanding objects managed by the Realm to point to
the most recent data and deliver any applicable notifications.

Observation Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You *cannot* call the ``.observe()`` method:

- During a write transaction
- When the containing realm is read-only
- On an actor-confined realm from outside the actor

.. _swift-actor-collection-change-listener:

Register a Collection Change Listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK calls a collection notification block after each write transaction which:

- Deletes an object from the collection.
- Inserts an object into the collection.
- Modifies any of the managed properties of an object in the collection. This 
  includes self-assignments that set a property to its existing value. 

.. important:: Order Matters
   
   In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
   in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
   modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
   result in unexpected behavior.

These notifications provide information about the actor on which the change 
occurred. Like non-actor-isolated :ref:`collection notifications 
<ios-register-a-collection-change-listener>`, they also provide 
a ``change`` parameter that reports which objects are deleted, added, or 
modified during the write transaction. This
:swift-sdk:`RealmCollectionChange <Enums/RealmCollectionChange.html>` 
resolves to an array of index paths that you can pass to a ``UITableView``'s 
batch update methods.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.observe-collection-on-actor.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-actor-object-change-listener:

Register an Object Change Listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK calls an object notification block after each write transaction which:

- Deletes the object.
- Modifies any of the managed properties of the object. This includes 
  self-assignments that set a property to its existing value. 

The block is passed a copy of the object isolated to the requested actor,
along with information about what changed. This object can be safely used
on that actor.

By default, only direct changes to the object's properties produce notifications.
Changes to linked objects do not produce notifications. If a non-nil, non-empty 
keypath array is passed in, only changes to the properties identified by those 
keypaths produce change notifications. The keypaths may traverse link 
properties to receive information about changes to linked objects.
