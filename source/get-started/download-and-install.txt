   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Before you being developing, ensure you have the following dependencies
      installed in your development environment:
      
      - Compiler that supports C++17, such as `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/install/>`__, `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`__,
        or `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`__
      - `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ v3.15 or later
      - `pkg-config <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/>`__

      .. note:: C++17 Polyfills

         This tutorial configures the {+driver-short+} to use the C++17 standard
         library. If you want to install the driver for pre-C++17 configurations,
         you must choose a C++17 polyfill library. To learn more about C++17
         polyfills, see the :ref:`cpp-polyfill-selection` guide.

   .. step:: Download the {+driver-short+}

      To download the latest version of the {+driver-short+} from the ``mongo-cxx-driver`` Github
      repository, run the following commands in your shell from your root directory:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -OL https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases/download/r{+full-version+}/mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}.tar.gz
         tar -xzf mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}.tar.gz
         cd mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}/build

   .. step:: Configure the driver for installation

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run following command from your
      ``mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}/build`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: configure-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cmake ..                                \
                    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release          \
                    -DMONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX=OFF
            
             This command instructs CMake to install ``mongocxx`` into the ``/usr/local`` directory.

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: configure-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                'C:\<path>\cmake.exe' .. \
                    -G "Visual Studio <version> <year>" -A "x64"         \
                    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17                     \
                    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\mongo-cxx-driver  \
             
             This command instructs CMake to install ``mongocxx`` into the ``C:\mongo-cxx-driver``
             directory. Replace the following placeholder values:
             
             - ``<path>``: The path to your CMake executable
             - ``<version>``: Your Visual Studio version number
             - ``<year>``: The year corresponding to your Visual Studio version

   .. step:: Build and install the driver

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run following commands to install
      the driver:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: configure-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cmake --build .
                sudo cmake --build . --target install

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: configure-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
                cmake --build . --target install --config RelWithDebInfo

After you complete these steps, you have the {+driver-short+} installed 
on your machine.
