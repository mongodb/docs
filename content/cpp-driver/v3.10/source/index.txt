Welcome to the MongoDB C++ driver.  On this site, you'll find documentation
to help you get the most from MongoDB and C++.  If you're just starting
out, take a look at these pages first:

Driver Status by Family and Version
-----------------------------------

Stability indicates whether this driver is recommended for production use.
Currently, no drivers guarantee API or ABI stability.

For documentation about previous releases, see the `legacy documentation <https://mongocxx.org/legacy-v1/>`__.

Current Driver
--------------

The mongocxx is a ground-up rewrite of a C++ driver for MongoDB based on
`libmongoc <https://mongoc.org/>`__.  It requires a C++11 compiler.  It is
known to build on x86 and x86-64 architectures for Linux, macOS,
Windows, and FreeBSD.

The mongocxx driver library includes a matching bson package, bsoncxx, that
implements the `BSON specification <http://www.bsonspec.org>`__. This
library can be used standalone for object serialization and deserialization
even when one is not using MongoDB at all.

Releases of the mongocxx driver have version numbers like v3.x.y.

.. note::
    
   There were no v2.x.y C++ drivers to avoid confusion with the deprecated legacy-0.0-26compat-2.x.y drivers.

Compatibility
-------------

MongoDB Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the MongoDB C++ driver for use with a specific version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/lifecycle-schedule-callout.rst

.. include:: /includes/mongodb-compatibility-table-cxx.rst

The driver does not support older versions of MongoDB.

Language Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the MongoDB C++ driver for use with a specific version of C++.

The first column lists the driver version.
