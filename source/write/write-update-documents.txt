Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to update
documents in a MongoDB collection by performing update operations.

An update operation updates one or more documents in a MongoDB collection.
You can perform an update operation by using the ``updateOne()`` or
``updateMany()`` methods.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection
from the ``sample_restaurants`` database in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. 

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>` tutorial.

Update Operations
-----------------

You can perform update operations in MongoDB by using the following methods:

- ``updateOne()``, which updates *the first document* that matches the search criteria
- ``updateMany()``, which updates *all documents* that match the search criteria

Each update method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter** document, which determines the documents to update. For more
  information about using query filters, see the :ref:`Filters
  <java-rs-update-filters>` section.

- **Update** document, which specifies the update operator (the kind of update to
  perform) and the fields and values to change. For more information
  about update operators, see the :ref:`Update Operators
  <java-rs-update-operators>` section.

.. _java-rs-update-filters:

Filters
~~~~~~~

Each update method requires a **query filter**, which specifies the
search criteria that determine which documents to select for updates. To facilitate the creation of filter objects, the
driver provides the ``Filters`` class that provides filter condition helper
methods. 

To view a list of ``Filters`` helpers, see the `Filters
API documentation <{+api+}/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html>`__.
For more information about query filters, see the 
:manual:`Query Filter Documents section </core/document/#query-filter-documents>` in
the MongoDB Server manual. 

.. _java-rs-update-operators:

Update Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change a field in a document, MongoDB provides update operators.
To specify the modification to perform using the update operators,
create an update document. To facilitate the creation of update documents, the driver
provides the ``Updates`` helper class that contains filter condition helper methods.

.. important::

   The ``_id`` field is immutable, so you cannot change the value of the
   ``_id`` field in a document.

To learn more about update operators, see
:manual:`Update Operators </reference/operator/update/>` in the Server manual.

Update One Document
-------------------

To update a single document in a MongoDB collection, call the ``updateOne()``
method and pass your query filter and update operators. Then, pass the
``updateOne()`` result to the static ``Mono.from()`` method from
``Mono``. ``Mono`` is a class from the {+pr+} library. In {+java-rs+}, 
the driver methods return cold ``Publisher`` instances, which means that the
corresponding operation does not happen unless you subscribe to the returned
``Publisher``. This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume them. To learn more
about ``Mono``, see `Mono <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono>`__ in the Project
Reactor documentation.

The following example uses the ``updateOne()`` method to update the ``name``
value of a matching document from ``"Bagels N Buns"`` to ``"2 Bagels 2 Buns"``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Publisher<UpdateResult> updatePublisher = 
            restaurants.updateOne(eq("name", "Bagels N Buns"),
                    set("name", "2 Bagels 2 Buns"));
    Mono.from(updatePublisher).block();

Update Multiple Documents
-------------------------

To update multiple documents in a MongoDB collection, call the ``updateMany()``
method and pass your query filter and update operators. Then, pass the ``updateMany()`` result to the static ``Mono.from()`` method from
``Mono``. ``Mono`` is a class from the {+pr+} library. In {+java-rs+}, 
the driver methods return cold ``Publisher`` instances, which means that the
corresponding operation does not happen unless you subscribe to the returned
``Publisher``. This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume them. To learn more
about ``Mono``, see `Mono <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono>`__ in the Project
Reactor documentation.

The following example uses the ``updateMany()`` method to update all documents that have a ``cuisine`` value of
``"Pizza"`` to have a ``cuisine`` value of ``"Pasta"``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Publisher<UpdateResult> updatePublisher = 
            restaurants.updateMany(eq("cuisine", "Pizza"),
                    set("cuisine", "Pasta"));
    Mono.from(updatePublisher).block();
    
Customize the Update Operation
------------------------------

The ``UpdateOptions`` class contains methods that modify
the behavior of update methods. To use the ``UpdateOptions``
class, construct a new instance of the class, then call one or more of its methods
to modify the update operation. You can chain these method calls together.
To modify the behavior of the update operation, pass the class instance and
chained method calls as the third argument to the
``updateOne()`` or ``updateMany()`` method.

You can use the following optional methods in the ``UpdateOptions`` class
to modify an update operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``arrayFilters(List<? extends Bson> arrayFilters)``
     - | Specifies which array elements an update applies
         to.

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation(Boolean bypassDocumentValidation)``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
      
   * - ``collation(Collation collation)``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``comment(BsonValue comment)``
     - | Attaches a ``Bson`` comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``comment(String comment)``
     - | Attaches a ``String`` comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``hint(Bson hint)``
     - | Sets the index for the operation as a ``Bson`` value. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``hintString(String hint)``
     - | Sets the index for the operation as a ``String`` value.
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``let(Bson variables)``
     - | Specifies a map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``sort(Bson sort)``
     - | Sets the sort criteria to apply to the operation. If multiple
         documents match the query filter that you pass to the
         ``updateOne()`` method, the operation updates the first
         result. You can set this option to apply an order to matched
         documents to have more control over which document is updated.

   * - ``upsert(Boolean upsert)``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-upsert>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``updateMany()`` method to find all documents where the 
``borough`` field has the value ``"Manhattan"``. It then updates the ``borough``
value in these documents to ``"Manhattan (north)"``. Because the ``upsert`` option is
set to ``true``, the {+driver-short+} inserts a new document if the query filter doesn't 
match any existing documents.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Publisher<UpdateResult> updatePublisher = restaurants.updateMany(
            eq("borough", "Manhattan"),
            set("borough", "Manhattan (north)"),
            new UpdateOptions().upsert(true));
    Mono.from(updatePublisher).block();


Return Value
------------

The ``updateOne()`` and ``updateMany()`` methods each return an ``UpdateResult`` 
object. The ``UpdateResult`` type contains the following instance methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | The number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many were updated.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | The number of documents modified by the update operation. If an updated
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.

   * - ``getUpsertedId()``
     - | The ID of the document that was upserted in the database, if the driver
         performed an upsert. Otherwise ``null``.
         
   * - ``wasAcknowledged()``
     - | Returns true if the update was acknowledged.
