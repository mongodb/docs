"MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes truncate floating point numbers to 64-bit "
"integers before hashing. For example, a ``hashed`` index would store the "
"same value for a field that held a value of ``2.3``, ``2.2``, and "
"``2.9``. To prevent collisions, do not use a ``hashed`` index for "
"floating point numbers that cannot be reliably converted to 64-bit "
"integers (and then back to floating point). MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes do"
" not support floating point values larger than 2\\ :sup:`53`."
