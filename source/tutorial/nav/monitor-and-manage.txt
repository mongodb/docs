  to which the user belongs, or the clusters by :ref:`Organizations or Projects <organizations-projects>`.

:ref:`prepare-for-maintenance`
  Before you perform maintenance on your clusters, to maintain cluster availability,
  review the considerations for the ``oplog`` size, priority, fault tolerance,
  and unique index builds, and take action, if necessary.

:ref:`edit-deployment`
  Modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its MongoDB versions,storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You can also modify
  a replica set within a sharded cluster, an individual process within
  a replica set, or a standalone MongoDB processes.

:ref:`manage-bi-connector`
  Modify or shut down a |bic-short| instance.

:ref:`calculate-suggested-indexes`
  Analyze the data on query patterns collected by the database profiler
  and review a scored list of suggested indexes that could improve query
  performance.

:ref:`edit-replica-set`
  Add, remove, and reconfigure members in a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
  directly in the |mms| console.

:ref:`convert-standalone-to-replica-set`
  Convert a :term:`standalone` instance to a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.
  When converted, the replica set will have the former standalone instance as its primary.

:ref:`convert-replica-set-to-sharded-cluster`
  Convert a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
  to a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

:ref:`migrate-member-to-new-hardware`
  Replace one member of a managed :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
  with another member from the |mms| console. Use this process to migrate
  members of replica sets to new underlying servers.

:ref:`add-shard-using-automation`
  Add a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process to a sharded cluster.

:ref:`remove-shard-using-automation`
  Remove a shard from a sharded cluster.

:ref:`unmanage-deployment`
  Disable automation for a deployment.

:ref:`mongodb-processes`
  Start, stop, shut down, and remove MongoDB processes monitored by |mms|.

:ref:`mongodb-versions`
