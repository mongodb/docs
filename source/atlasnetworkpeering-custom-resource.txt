``AtlasNetworkPeering`` Custom Resource

   :class: singlecol

The ``AtlasNetworkPeering`` custom resource defines a :ref:`network
peering connection <ak8so-network-peering>` for a |service|
project. Network peering connections isolate traffic from public
networks for added security.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-crds.rst

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service|
:oas-atlas-tag:`Network Peering API Resource </Network-Peering>`:
   
- Creates a new network peering connection.
- Updates an existing network peering connection.

.. note::

   A network peering connection can belong only to one project. To
   define the same network peering connection for multiple projects,
   create custom resource definitions for each project.

Examples
--------

The following examples illustrate configurations for
``AtlasNetworkPeering`` CRDs.

- The basic example configuration defines a resource that you manage
  with the same |ak8so| instance with which you manage its parent
  {+service+} project.

- The :ref:`Independent CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>` example
  configures the same |vpc| peering connection as the basic example,
  but for a {+service+} project that you manage outside of the |ak8so|
  instance with which you manage the |vpc| peering connection.

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows an ``AtlasNetworkPeering`` custom resource
that defines the ``green-leaf-peering`` connection between the
``my-project`` project |vpc| and your {+aws+} |vpc|. To manage this
resource in the same |ak8so| instance as its parent {+service+}
project, you must identify the project with ``projectRef`` instead of
``externalProjectRef``.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasNetworkPeering
   metadata:
     name: green-leaf-peering
   spec:
     projectRef:
       name: my-project
       namespace: my-operator-namespace
     containerRef:
       id: 72a6d2a69388ba121943ae27
     id: 72a6d2a69388ba121943ae27
     provider: AWS
     awsConfiguration:
       accepterRegionName: us-east-1
       awsAccountId: 389226183042
       routeTableCiderBlock: 10.0.0.0/21
       vpcId: vpc-abc

Independent CRD Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows an ``AtlasNetworkPeering``
:ref:`independent CRD <ak8so-independent-crd>` that configures the
same |vpc| peering connection defined by the :ref:`Basic Example
<atlasnetworkpeering-example-basic>`. To enable resource management
independent of the parent project, you must use an
``externalProjectRef`` instead of a ``projectRef``, and you must
supply a ``connectionSecret`` directly since this resource can't
inherit API credentials from its parent project.

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasNetworkPeering
   metadata:
     name: green-leaf-peering
   spec:
     externalProjectRef:
       projectId: 66e2f2b621571b7e69a89b66
     connectionSecret:
       name: atlas-connection-secret
     containerRef:
       id: 72a6d2a69388ba121943ae27
     id: 72a6d2a69388ba121943ae27
     provider: AWS
     awsConfiguration:
       accepterRegionName: us-east-1
       awsAccountId: 389226183042
       routeTableCiderBlock: 10.0.0.0/21
       vpcId: vpc-abc

Parameters
----------

This section describes the ``AtlasNetworkPeering`` parameters
available in this custom resource definition. 

.. setting:: metadata.name

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Name that the :ref:`atlasnetworkpeering-custom-resource` uses to add
   this network peering connection to a project.

.. setting:: metadata.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   Namespace other than ``default`` that you want to contain the
   ``AtlasNetworkPeering`` custom resource.

.. setting:: spec.connectionSecret.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the opaque |k8s-secret| that contains the organization ID
   and :ref:`API keys <about-org-api-keys>` that |ak8so| uses to
   :ref:`connect <ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref>` to |service|.  If
   unspecified, |ak8so| defaults to one of the following options:

   - The ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` parameter of the parent
     ``atlasProject``
   - The default ``global`` secret, if you haven't defined the
     ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` for the parent ``atlasProject``

   This parameter is required for :ref:`independent CRDs
   <ak8so-independent-crd>`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-label-secret.rst

.. setting:: spec.containerRef.id

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   If this resource represents a new network peering connection, omit
   this parameter.

   ID of the existing network peering container. Provide this field
   only if you want this resource to manage an existing network
   peering connection within |ak8so|. If you prefer that this resource
   starts managing a |k8s| local resource, use the
   ``spec.containerRef.name`` parameter.

.. setting:: spec.containerRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of an existing network peering container which you manage with
   a |k8s| local resource in your project namespace. Provide this
   field only if you want this resource to manage a |k8s| local
   resource. If you prefer that this resource starts managing a network
   peering connection already managed by |ak8so|, use the
   ``spec.containerRef.id`` parameter. If this resource represents a
   new network peering connection, omit this field.

.. setting:: spec.externalProjectRef.id

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   ID of the project to which the network peering connection
   belongs. You must specify the project ID of an existing :ref:`Atlas
   Project <manage-projects>`. You must specify this parameter for network
   peering connections that belong to projects managed by either:

   - A different instance of |ak8so|
   - Tooling other than |ak8so|

   For deployments that belong to projects managed by
   the same instance of |ak8so|, use ``spec.projectRef.name``. These
   parameters are mutually exclusive with each other.

   A network peering connection can belong to only one project. To
   define the same network peering connection for multiple projects,
   create custom resource definitions for each project.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Name of the project to which the network peering connection
   belongs. You must specify an existing
   :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`. This parameter applies only to
   network peering connections that belong to projects managed by the
   same instance |ak8so|.

   For deployments that belong to projects managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|

   use ``spec.externalProjectRef.id``. These parameters are mutually
   exclusive with each other.

   A network peering connection can belong only to one project. To
   define the same network peering connection for multiple projects,
   create custom resource definitions for each project.

.. setting:: spec.projectRef.namespace

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Namespace in which the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`
   specified in ``spec.projectRef.name`` exists.

   Do not set this parameter for deployments that belong to projects
   managed by either:

   - a different instance of |ak8so|
   - tooling other than |ak8so|

.. setting:: spec.id

   *Type*: string

   scenarios in which |ak8so| assumes management of a pre-existing
   network peering connection.

.. setting:: spec.provider

   Cloud provider with which to establish a |vpc| peering
   connection. Must be one of the following:

   - ``AWS``
   - ``Azure``
   - ``GCP``

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   {+aws+} region to which to establish a |vpc| peering
   connection. Required for and limited to {+aws+} connections.
