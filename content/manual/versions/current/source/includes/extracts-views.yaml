ref: views-collation-behavior
content: |

   - You can specify a default :ref:`collation <collation>`
     for a view at creation time. If no collation is specified, the
     view's default collation is the "simple" binary comparison
     collator. That is, the view does not inherit the collection's
     default collation.

   - String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation.
     An operation that attempts to change or override a view's default
     collation will fail with an error.

   - If creating a view from another view, you cannot specify a
     collation that differs from the source view's collation.

ref: views-collation-agg
content: |

   If performing an aggregation that involves multiple views, such as
   with :pipeline:`$lookup` or :pipeline:`$graphLookup`, the views must
   have the same :ref:`collation <collation>`.
---
ref: views-public-definition
content: |
   The view definition is public; i.e. :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()`
   and ``explain`` operations on the view will include the pipeline that
   defines the view. As such, avoid referring directly to sensitive fields
   and values in view definitions.
---
ref: views-restriction-output-to-disk
content: |

   A view definition ``pipeline`` cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` or
   the :pipeline:`$merge` stage. This restriction also applies to
   embedded pipelines, such as pipelines used in :pipeline:`$lookup` or
   :pipeline:`$facet` stages.
---
ref: views-access-control
content: |

  If the deployment enforces :ref:`authentication <authentication>`:
  
  - To create a view, you must have the :authaction:`createCollection`
    privilege on the database that the view is created. Additionally, if
    you have the :authaction:`find` privilege on the namespace of the
    view you want to create, you must also have the ``find`` privilege on the
    following resources:

    - The source collection or view from which the new view is created.
    - Any collections or views referenced in the :ref:`view pipeline
      <views-pipelines>`.

  - To query a view, you must have the ``find`` privilege on the view
    namespace. You don't need the ``find`` privilege on the source
    collection or any namespaces referenced in the view pipeline.

  A user with the built-in :authrole:`readWrite` role on the database
  has the required privileges to run the listed operations. To grant the
  required permissions, either:
  
  - :ref:`Create a user <create-users>` with the required role.
  - :ref:`Grant the role to an existing user
    <modify-existing-user-access>`.
