  Specifies the "database address" of the database to connect to. For
  example:

  The above command will connect the {{program}} shell to the
  :term:`admin database` on the local machine. You may specify a remote
  database instance, with the resolvable hostname or IP address. Separate
  the database name from the hostname using a ``/`` character. See the
  following examples:

     mongo mongodb1.example.net
     mongo mongodb1/admin

     :option:`--username` and :option:`--password` as the last options, as
     in the following:
