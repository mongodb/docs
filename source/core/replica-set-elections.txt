Replica Set Elections

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use elections to determine which
set member will become :term:`primary`. Replica sets can trigger an 
election in response to a variety of events, such as:

- Adding a new node to the replica set,
- :method:`initiating a replica set <rs.initiate()>`,
- performing replica set maintenance using methods such as :method:`rs.stepDown()` or :method:`rs.reconfig()`, and
- the :term:`secondary` members losing connectivity to the primary for more than the configured :rsconf:`timeout <settings.electionTimeoutMillis>` (10 seconds by default).

In the following diagram, the primary node was unavailable for longer
than the :rsconf:`configured timeout <settings.electionTimeoutMillis>`
and triggers the :ref:`automatic failover <replication-auto-failover>`
process. One of the remaining secondaries calls for an election to
select a new primary and automatically resume normal operations.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-trigger-election.rst

The replica set cannot process write operations until the
election completes successfully. The replica set can continue to serve 
read queries if such queries are configured to 
:ref:`run on secondaries <replica-set-read-preference>`.

Factors and Conditions that Affect Elections
--------------------------------------------

Replication Election Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

   MongoDB 4.0 removes the deprecated replication protocol version 0.

Replication :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>` reduces
replica set failover time and accelerate the detection of multiple
simultaneous primaries.

With protocolVersion 1, you can use
:rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` to prioritize between faster
failovers and preservation of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` writes.

For more information on ``pv1``, see
:doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`.

.. _replica-set-heartbeats:

Heartbeats
~~~~~~~~~~

Replica set members send heartbeats (pings) to each other every two
seconds. If a heartbeat does not return within 10 seconds, the other
members mark the delinquent member as inaccessible.

Member Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a replica set has a stable primary, the election algorithm will
make a "best-effort" attempt to have the secondary with the highest
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election.
Member priority affects both the timing and the
outcome of elections; secondaries with higher priority call elections
relatively sooner than secondaries with lower
priority, and are also more likely to win. However, a lower priority
instance can be elected as primary for brief periods, even if a higher
priority secondary is available. Replica set members continue
to call elections until the highest priority member available becomes
primary.

Members with a priority value of ``0`` cannot become primary and do
not seek election. For details, see
:doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

.. _rs-election-mirrored-reads:

Mirrored Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB provides :ref:`mirrored reads
<mirrored-reads>` to pre-warm electable secondary members' cache with
the most recently accessed data. With mirrored reads, the primary can
mirror a subset of :ref:`operations
<mirrored-reads-supported-operations>` that it receives and send them
to a subset of electable secondaries. Pre-warming the cache of a
secondary can help restore performance more quickly after an election.

For details, see :ref:`mirrored-reads`.

Loss of a Data Center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a distributed replica set, the loss of a data center may affect
the ability of the remaining members in other data center or data
centers to elect a primary.

If possible, distribute the replica set members across data centers to
maximize the likelihood that even with a loss of a data center, one of
the remaining replica set members can become the new primary.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/replica-set-architecture-geographically-distributed`

Network Partition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :term:`network partition` may segregate a primary into a partition
with a minority of nodes. When the primary detects that it can only see
a minority of nodes in the replica set, the primary steps down as
primary and becomes a secondary. Independently, a member in the
partition that can communicate with a :data:`majority
<replSetGetStatus.majorityVoteCount>` of the nodes (including itself)
holds an election to become the new primary.

.. index:: replica set members; non-voting


Voting Members
--------------

The replica set member configuration setting :rsconf:`members[n].votes`
and member :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members[n].state` determine whether a
member votes in an election.


- All replica set members that have their :rsconf:`members[n].votes`
  setting equal to 1 vote in elections. To exclude a member from voting
  in an :term:`election`, change the value of the member's
  :rsconf:`members[n].votes` configuration to ``0``.

  - .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-non-voting-priority-restriction.rst

  - .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-nonzero-priority-vote-restriction.rst
     
- Only voting members in the following states are eligible to vote:

  - :replstate:`PRIMARY`

  - :replstate:`SECONDARY`

  - :replstate:`STARTUP2`

  - :replstate:`RECOVERING`

  - :replstate:`ARBITER`

  - :replstate:`ROLLBACK`

.. seealso::

   - :data:`replSetGetStatus.votingMembersCount`

   - :data:`replSetGetStatus.writableVotingMembersCount`

.. _replica-set-non-voting-members:

Non-Voting Members
------------------

Although non-voting members do not vote in elections, these members
hold copies of the replica set's data and can accept read operations
from client applications.

Because a replica set can have up to :limit:`50 members 
<Number of Members of a Replica Set>`, but only :limit:`7 voting
members <Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set>`, non-voting
members allow a replica set to have more than seven members.

.. include:: /includes/fact-rs-non-voting-priority-restriction.rst

For instance, the following nine-member replica set has seven voting
members and two non-voting members.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-only-seven-voting-members.rst

A non-voting member has both :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` and
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` equal to ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : <num>,
      "host" : <hostname:port>,
      "arbiterOnly" : false,
      "buildIndexes" : true,
      "hidden" : false,
      "priority" : 0,
      "tags" : {
      
      },
      "slaveDelay" : NumberLong(0),
      "votes" : 0
   }

.. important:: Do **not** alter the number of votes to control which
   members will become primary. Instead, modify the
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` option. *Only*
   alter the number of votes in exceptional cases. For example, to
   permit more than seven members.

To configure a non-voting member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-non-voting-replica-set-member`.
