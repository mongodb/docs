Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB by using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification that describes how to split files
into chunks when storing them and reassemble them when retrieving them. The {+driver-short+}'s
implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of
the file storage. 

Use GridFS if the size of your files exceeds the BSON document
size limit of 16MB. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

The following sections describe GridFS operations and how to
perform them.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections, named using the convention
defined in the GridFS specification:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the ``fs.chunks`` and ``fs.files``
collections, unless you specify a different name in the ``GridFSBucket()`` constructor. The
driver also creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related
metadata. The driver creates the GridFS bucket, if it doesn't exist, only when the first write
operation is performed. The driver creates indexes only if they don't exist and when the
bucket is empty. For more information about
GridFS indexes, see :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from
memory or from a stream. See the following diagram to see how GridFS splits
the files when uploaded to a bucket.

   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a GridFS bucket by calling the
``GridFSBucket()`` constructor and passing in a ``MongoDatabase`` instance.
You can use the ``GridFSBucket`` instance to
call read and write operations on the files in your bucket.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-create-bucket
   :end-before: end-create-bucket

To create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the default name
``fs``, pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the ``GridFSBucket()``
constructor, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-create-custom-bucket
   :end-before: end-create-custom-bucket

Upload Files
------------

The ``GridFSBucket.uploadFromObservable()`` method reads the contents of an
``Observable[ByteBuffer]`` and saves it to the ``GridFSBucket`` instance.

You can use the ``GridFSUploadOptions`` type to configure the chunk size or include
additional metadata.

The following example uploads the contents of an ``Observable[ByteBuffer]`` into
``GridFSBucket``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-upload-files
   :end-before: end-upload-files

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the
``files`` collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information
about the file it refers to, including:

- The ``_id`` of the file
- The name of the file
- The length/size of the file
- The upload date and time
- A ``metadata`` document in which you can store any other information

To learn more about fields you can retrieve from the ``files`` collection, see the
:manual:`GridFS Files Collection </core/gridfs/#the-files-collection>` documentation in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

To retrieve files from a GridFS bucket, call the ``find()`` method on the ``GridFSBucket``
instance. The following code example retrieves and prints file metadata from all files in
a GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-retrieve-file-info
   :end-before: end-retrieve-file-info

To learn more about querying MongoDB, see :ref:`<scala-retrieve>`.

Download Files
--------------

The ``downloadToObservable()`` method returns an ``Observable[ByteBuffer]``
that reads the contents from MongoDB.

To download a file by its file ``_id``, pass the ``_id`` to the method.
The following example downloads a file by its file ``_id``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-download-files-id
   :end-before: end-download-files-id

If you don't know the ``_id`` of the file but know the filename, then you
can pass the filename to the ``downloadToObservable()`` method. The following example
downloads a file named ``mongodb-tutorial``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-download-files-name
   :end-before: end-download-files-name

.. note::

   If there are multiple documents with the same ``filename`` value,
   GridFS will fetch the most recent file with the given name (as
   determined by the ``uploadDate`` field).

Rename Files
------------

Use the ``rename()`` method to update the name of a GridFS file in your
bucket. You must specify the file to rename by its ``_id`` field
rather than its file name.

The following example renames a file to ``mongodbTutorial``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-rename-files
   :end-before: end-rename-files

.. note::

   The ``rename()`` method supports updating the name of only one file at
   a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the
   file name from the bucket, extract the ``_id`` field from the files you
   want to rename, and pass each value in separate calls to the ``rename()``
   method.

Delete Files
------------

Use the ``delete()`` method to remove a file's collection document and associated
chunks from your bucket. You must specify the file by its ``_id`` field rather than its
file name.

The following example deletes a file by its ``_id``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-delete-files
   :end-before: end-delete-files

.. note::

   The ``delete()`` method supports deleting only one file at a time. To
   delete multiple files, retrieve the files from the bucket, extract
   the ``_id`` field from the files you want to delete, and pass each value
   in separate calls to the ``delete()`` method.
