Optional. A flag to indicate whether the command returns just the name
and type (``view``, ``collection``, or ``timeseries``) or returns both
the name and other information.

The default value is ``false``.

When ``nameOnly`` is ``true``, your ``filter`` expression can only
filter based on a collection's name and type. No other fields are
available.
