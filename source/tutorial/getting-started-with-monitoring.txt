Agent Installation
------------------

To monitor MongoDB systems with MMS you must install a lightweight
agent that can connect to all MongoDB instances to gather information.
See the :doc:`/tutorial/install-monitoring-agent` document for complete
information.

.. only:: hosted

   To begin using |monitoring|, :doc:`install MMS On-Prem
   </installation>`, then install the agent according to the
   :doc:`/tutorial/install-monitoring-agent` tutorial.

Use MMS Monitoring
------------------

The MMS web console is at the center of the |mms|.
Through it, you can access all of your monitored objects, set up alerts,
control users, adjust your settings, and, using |monitoring| dashboards,
create customized collections of charts for easier data analysis.

The best way to learn about |monitoring|'s capabilities is to browse
the interface with live data. If you haven't done so already,
please :doc:`install the Monitoring agent </monitoring/install>`
before proceeding.

Clicking on any host name in the hosts table of the "Hosts" tab
will give you access to detailed statistics about that host.
For detailed instructions on interacting with this data, please see
the :doc:`Host Statistics </monitoring/statistics>` documentation.

Next Steps
----------

The MMS web console contains a great deal of functionality beyond the
scope of this overview. Continue to explore the functionality
addressed above in your own system, with your own data.
