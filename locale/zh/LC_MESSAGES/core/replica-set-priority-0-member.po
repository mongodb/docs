"A *priority 0* member is a secondary that **cannot** become :term:`primary`."
" *Priority 0* members cannot *trigger* :term:`elections <election>`.  "
"Otherwise these members function as normal secondaries. A *priority 0* "
"member maintains a copy of the data set, accepts read operations, and votes "
"in elections. Configure a *priority 0* member to prevent :term:`secondaries "
"<secondary>` from becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-"
"data center deployments."

"A *priority 0* member can function as a standby. In some replica sets, it "

"In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in sets "
