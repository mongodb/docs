Hidden Replica Set Members
==========================

   :description: Understand the role and behavior of hidden replica set members, which maintain data copies without being visible to client applications.

A hidden member maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>`
data set but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members
are good for workloads with different usage patterns from the other
members in the :term:`replica set`. Hidden members must always be
:ref:`priority 0 members <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and
so **cannot become primary**. The :method:`db.hello()` method does not
display hidden members. Hidden members, however, **may vote** in
:ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`.


Behavior
--------

Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only read from a hidden member if you directly connect to the
node. If you connect to a cluster without directly connecting to the hidden 
node, you cannot run queries on the hidden node. As a result, these
members receive no traffic other than basic replication. Use hidden
members for dedicated tasks such as reporting and
backups.

In a sharded cluster, :binary:`~bin.mongos` do not interact with hidden
members.

Voting
~~~~~~

Hidden members *may* vote in replica set elections. If you stop a
voting hidden member, ensure that the set has an active majority or the
:term:`primary` will step down.

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hidden replica set members can acknowledge write operations issued
with :writeconcern:`w: \<number\> <\<number\>>`. For write operations
issued with :writeconcern:`w : "majority" <"majority">`, however,
hidden members must also be voting members (i.e. :rsconf:`members[n].votes`
greater than ``0``) to acknowledge the ``"majority"`` write operation.
Non-voting replica set members (i.e. :rsconf:`members[n].votes` 
is ``0``) cannot contribute to acknowledging write operations with 
``majority`` write concern.
