The following examples use MongoDB Atlas Terraform Provider version 2.x (``~> 2.2``).
If you're upgrading from provider version 1.x, see the 
`2.0.0 Upgrade Guide <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/guides/2.0.0-upgrade-guide>`__ 
for breaking changes and migration steps. The examples use the 
``mongodbatlas_advanced_cluster`` resource with v2.x syntax.
