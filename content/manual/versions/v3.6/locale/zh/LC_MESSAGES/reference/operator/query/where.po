"Use the :query:`$where` operator to pass either a string containing a "
"JavaScript expression or a full JavaScript function to the query system. "
"The :query:`$where` provides greater flexibility, but requires that the "
"database processes the JavaScript expression or function for *each* "
"document in the collection. Reference the document in the JavaScript "
"expression or function using either ``this`` or ``obj`` ."

"The :query:`$expr` operator allows the use of :ref:`aggregation "
"expressions <aggregation-framework>` within the query language. "
":query:`$expr` is faster than :query:`$where` because it does not execute"
" JavaScript and should be preferred where possible."
