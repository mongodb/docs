.. _onprem-own-logs:

Available {+onprem+} Logs
--------------------------

Each host that serves {+onprem+} stores its logs in the following path:

.. code-block:: bash

   /opt/mongodb/mms/logs/

For some logs, {+onprem+} uses configuration files. {+onprem+} rotates
these logs daily in the following manner:

1. Close the current log file.
#. Compress the closed log file using ``gzip``.
#. Start a new log file.

{+onprem+} retains each compressed log file for 30 days. After 30 days,
it deletes that compressed file.

You can :ref:`change the retention policy <change-onprem-log-retention>`
of the following logs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - Log File Name
     - Log Contents
     - Configuration File

   * - :file:`mms[#].log`, typically :file:`mms0.log`
     - {+onprem+} operations
     - :file:`logback.xml`

   * - :file:`daemon.log`
     - {+onprem+} backup operations
     - :file:`logback.xml`

   * - :file:`mms[#]-access.log`, typically :file:`mms0-access.log`
     - {+onprem+} access attempts
     - :file:`logback-access.xml`

You can manage the retention policy of the following logs
using your platform's tools:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: 30 70

   * - :file:`daemon-startup.log`
     - {+onprem+} backup process startup process messages

   * - :file:`mms-migration.log`
     - {+onprem+} migration process messages
   
   * - :file:`mms[#]-startup.log`, typically :file:`mms0-startup.log`
     - {+onprem+} startup process messages

{+onprem+} may generate additional log files in extenuating
circumstances. If you find files in the log directory that aren't
listed in these tables, contact `MongoDB Support <https://support.mongodb.com/welcome?tck=docs>`__
for assistance.


.. _change-onprem-log-retention:

Change {+onprem+} Log Retention
--------------------------------

If |onprem| logs have configuration files, you can change their
log retention using these files. You cannot change log retention of
these log files in the console.

.. important::

   If you upgrade {+onprem+}, it overwrites its configuration files. To
   set log retention after you upgrade, repeat the steps in this
   procedure.

.. _change-onprem-log-rotation:

Change {+onprem+} Log Rotation Policy
--------------------------------------

By default, {+onprem+} rotates and compresses its logs once per day. If
you have large log files, you can also rotate them by size.
 
To change your rotation policy to rotate logs based on both size and
time:

.. include:: /includes/steps/onprem-logs-rotation.rst
