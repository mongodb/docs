This document describes the URI format for defining connections between
applications using MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>` and MongoDB
instances.

Connection String Formats
-------------------------

You can specify the MongoDB connection string using either:

- the :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format` or 

- the :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.

Standard Connection String Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection
URI used to connect to a MongoDB deployment: standalone, replica set,
or a sharded cluster.

The standard URI connection scheme has the form:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[database][?options]]

Examples
````````

.. container::

   .. tabs::
   
      tabs:
   
         - id: standalone
           name: Standalone
           content: |

              - For a standalone:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017/admin

              - For a standalone that :doc:`enforces access control
                </tutorial/enable-authentication>`:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017/admin

                .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

         - id: repl
           name: Replica Set
           content: |

              .. note::

                 .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

                 For a replica set, include the :urioption:`replicaSet`
                 option.

              - For a replica set:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/admin?replicaSet=myRepl
               
              - For a replica set that :doc:`enforces access control
                </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, include
                user credentials:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/admin?replicaSet=myRepl

         - id: sharded
           name: Sharded Cluster
           content: |

              .. note::

                 For a connection string to a sharded cluster, specify
                 :binary:`~bin.mongos` hosts in the connection string.

              - For a sharded cluster:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://mongos0.example.com:27017,mongos1.example.com:27017,mongos2.example.com:27017/admin

                control </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, include
                user credentials:

                .. code-block:: sh

                   mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongos0.example.com:27017,mongos1.example.com:27017,mongos2.example.com:27017/admin

                .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

   For more examples, see :ref:`connections-connection-examples`.

Components
``````````

.. container::

   The standard URI connection string includes the following components:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80

      * - ``mongodb://``

        - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the
          standard connection format.

      * - ``username:password@``

        - Optional.  Authentication credentials. If specified, the client
          will attempt to log in to the specific database using these
          credentials after connecting.

          .. include:: /includes/fact-pct-encode-uri.rst

          See also :urioption:`authSource`.


      * - ``host[:port]``

        - The host (and optional port number) where the
          :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance (or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
          instance for a sharded cluster) is running. You can specify a
          hostname, IP address, or UNIX domain socket. Specify as many
          hosts as appropriate for your deployment topology:

          - For a standalone, specify the hostname of the standalone
            :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

          - .. include:: /includes/fact-uri-rs-hostnames.rst

          - For a sharded cluster, specify the hostname(s) of the
            :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance(s).

          If the port number is not specified, the default port ``27017``
          is used.


      * - ``/database``

        - Optional. The name of the database to authenticate if the
          connection string includes authentication credentials in the
          form of ``username:password@``. If ``/database`` is not
          specified and the connection string includes credentials, the
          driver will authenticate to the ``admin`` database. See also
          :urioption:`authSource`.

      * - ``?options``

        - Optional. A query string that specifies connection specific
          options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
          :ref:`connections-connection-options` for a full description of
          these options.

          If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must
          specify a slash (``/``) between the last ``host`` and the
          question mark (``?``) that begins the string of options.


.. index:: connections; dns-seedlist
.. _connections-dns-seedlist:
      
      
DNS Seedlist Connection Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.6

In addition to the standard connection format, MongoDB supports a DNS-constructed
seedlist. Using DNS to construct the available servers list allows more flexibility
of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring
clients.

In order to leverage the DNS seed list, use a connection string prefix of
``mongodb+srv`` rather than the standard ``mongodb``. The ``+srv``
indicates to the client that the hostname that follows corresponds to a
DNS SRV record. The driver or :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell will then
query the DNS for the record to determine which hosts are running the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

For example, to connect to a DNS-listed hostname:

.. code-block:: none
 
    mongodb+srv://server.example.com/
 
A typical DNS configuration for the connection string above might look something
like this:

.. code-block:: none

   Record                            TTL   Class    Priority Weight Port  Target
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27317 mongodb1.example.com.
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27017 mongodb2.example.com.

When a client connects to a member of the :term:`seed list`, the client 
retrieves a list of replica set members it can connect to. Clients 
often use DNS aliases in their seed lists which means the host may
return a server list that differs from the original seed list. If this
happens, clients will use the hostnames provided by the replica set 
rather than the hostnames listed in the seed list to ensure that 
replica set members can be reached via the hostnames in the resulting
replica set config. 

Only two options are available for configuration via a TXT record -- 
``replicaSet`` and ``authSource``, and only one TXT record
is allowed per server. If multiple TXT records appear in the DNS and/or if the TXT record contains
an option other than ``replicaSet`` or ``authSource``, an error will be thrown by the
driver.

An example of a properly configured TXT record:

.. code-block:: none

   Record              TTL   Class    Text
   server.example.com. 86400 IN TXT   "replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB"

In this case, taking into account both
the DNS SRV records and the options retrieved from the TXT records, the parsed string will look like:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB

Options set in a TXT record can be overridden by passing in a query string with the URI. In the example below,
the query string has provided an override for the ``authSource`` option configured in the TXT record of the DNS
entry above.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://server.example.com/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB
       
The rest of the option string will remain, and we can expect that the resulting URI 
would look like this (after parse).

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&replicaSet=mySet&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB
       
.. note::
   The ``mongodb+srv`` option will fail if there is no available DNS with records that correspond to the
   hostname identified in the connection string. In addition, use of the ``+srv`` connection string modifier
   sets the ``ssl`` option to ``true`` automatically for the connection. This can be overridden by explicitly setting
   the ``ssl`` option to ``false`` with ``ssl=false`` in the query string.


.. index:: connections; options
.. _connections-connection-options:

Connection String Options
-------------------------

This section lists all connection options used in the
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.

Connection options are pairs in the following form: ``name=value``. The
``value`` is always case sensitive. Separate options with the ampersand
(i.e. ``&``) character. In the following example, a connection uses the
``replicaSet`` and ``connectTimeoutMS`` options:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db1.example.net:27017,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

.. admonition:: Semi-colon separator for connection string arguments

   To provide backwards compatibility, drivers currently accept
   semi-colons (i.e. ``;``) as option separators.

.. _replica-set-option:

Replica Set Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following connection string to a replica set named ``myRepl`` with
members running on the specified hosts:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://db0.example.com:27017,db1.example.com:27017,db2.example.com:27017/admin?replicaSet=myRepl

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: replicaSet

     - Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a member of a replica set.

       When connecting to a replica set, provide a seed list of the
       replica set member(s) to the ``host[:port]`` component of the
       uri. For specific details, refer to your :ecosystem:`driver
       </drivers>` documentation.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following connection string to a replica set includes 
:urioption:`ssl=true <ssl>` option:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&ssl=true

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: ssl

     - A boolean to enable or disables TLS/SSL for the connection:
     
       - ``true``: Initiate the connection with TLS/SSL. Default for
         :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.
         
       - ``false``: Initiate the connection without TLS/SSL. Default
         for :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.

   * - .. urioption:: connectTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing
       out. The default is never to timeout, though different drivers
       might vary. See the :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>`
       documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: socketTimeoutMS

     - The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a
       socket before the attempt times out. The default is never to
       timeout, though different drivers might vary. See the
       :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>` documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: compressors

     - Comma-delimited string of compressors to enable
       network compression for communication between this
       client and a :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
       instance.

       You can specify the following compressors:	

       - :term:`snappy`

       - :term:`zlib` (Available in MongoDB 3.6 or greater)

       If you specify multiple compressors, then the order in which you list
       the compressors matter as well as the communication initiator. For
       example, if the client specifies the following network
       compressors ``"zlib,snappy"`` and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` specifies
       ``"snappy,zlib"``, messages between the client and the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses ``zlib``.

       .. important::

          Messages are compressed when both parties enable network
          compression. Otherwise, messages between the parties are
          uncompressed.

          If the parties do not share at least one common compressor,
          messages between the parties are uncompressed.

       Starting in MongoDB 3.6.10, the
       :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports the uri connection string
       option :urioption:`compressors`.

   * - .. urioption:: zlibCompressionLevel

     - An integer that specifies the compression level if using
       :term:`zlib` for :urioption:`network compression <compressors>`.

       You can specify an integer value ranging from ``-1`` to ``9``:

       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 25 75

          * - Value
            - Notes

          * - ``-1``

            - Default compression level, usually level ``6`` compression.

          * - ``0``
            - No compression

          * - ``1`` - ``9``

            - Increasing level of compression but at the cost of speed, with:

              - ``1`` providing the best speed but least compression, and

              - ``9`` providing the best compression but at the slowest speed.

       Not supported by the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

.. _connection-pool-options:

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most drivers implement some kind of connection pool handling. 
Some drivers do not support connection
pools. See your :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>` documentation
for more information on the connection pooling implementation. These
options allow applications to configure the connection pool when
connecting to the MongoDB deployment.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: maxPoolSize

     - The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``100``.

   * - .. urioption:: minPoolSize

     - The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The
       default value is ``0``.

       .. note::
          The :urioption:`minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
          drivers. For information on your driver, see the
          :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>` documentation.

   * - .. urioption:: maxIdleTimeMS

     - The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain
       idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueMultiple

     - A number that the driver multiples the :urioption:`maxPoolSize`
       value to, to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to
       wait for a connection to become available from the pool. For
       default values, see the :ecosystem:`/drivers`
       documentation.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

   * - .. urioption:: waitQueueTimeoutMS

     - The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for a
       connection to become available. For default values, see the
       :ecosystem:`/drivers` documentation.

       This option is not supported by all drivers.

.. _connections-write-concern:

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Write concern <write-concern>` describes the level of
acknowledgment requested from MongoDB.  For a
full explanation of write concern and write operations in general, see
:doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

You can specify the write concern both in the connection string and
as a parameter to methods like ``insert`` or ``update``. If the
write concern is specified in both places, the method parameter
overrides the connection-string setting.

For example, the following connection string to a replica set specifies
:writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern and a 5 second timeout using
the :urioption:`wtimeoutMS` write concern parameter:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&w=majority&wtimeoutMS=5000

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: w

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-w`. The ``w`` option
       requests acknowledgement that the write operation has propagated
       to a specified number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or to
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with specified tags.

       You can specify a :writeconcern:`number <\<number\>>`, the
       string :writeconcern:`majority <"majority">`, or a
       :writeconcern:`tag set <\<write concern name\>>`.

       For details, see :ref:`wc-w`.

   * - .. urioption:: wtimeoutMS

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.
       :urioption:`wtimeoutMS` specifies a time limit, in milliseconds,
       for the write concern.

       When ``wtimeoutMS`` is ``0``, write operations will never time
       out. For more information, see :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.

   * - .. urioption:: journal

     - Corresponds to the write concern :ref:`wc-j` option. The
       :urioption:`journal` option requests acknowledgement from
       MongoDB that the write operation has been written to the
       :doc:`journal </core/journaling>`. For details, see :ref:`wc-j`.

       If you set :urioption:`journal` to ``true``, and specify a
       :urioption:`w` value less than 1, :urioption:`journal` prevails.

       .. versionchanged:: 2.6
          If you set :urioption:`journal` to true, and the
          :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not have journaling enabled, as with
          :setting:`storage.journal.enabled`, then MongoDB will error.
          In previous versions, MongoDB would provide basic receipt
          acknowledgement (i.e. ``w:1``), ignore :urioption:`journal`,
          and include a ``jnote`` field in its return document.

For more information, see :doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

``readConcern`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

   For the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB 3.2 introduces the
   readConcern option for replica sets and replica set shards.

:doc:`/reference/read-concern` allows clients to choose a level of
isolation for their reads from replica sets.

The following connection string to a replica set specifies
:urioption:`readConcernLevel=majority <readConcernLevel>`:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&readConcernLevel=majority

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readConcernLevel

     - The level of isolation. Can accept one of the following values:
     
       - :readconcern:`local <"local">`
       - :readconcern:`majority <"majority">`
       - :readconcern:`linearizable <"linearizable">`
       - :readconcern:`available <"available">`

       This connection string option is not available for the
       :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. Specify the read concern as an
       :ref:`option to the specific operation
       <read-concern-operations>`.

.. _connections-read-preference:

For more information, see :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>` describe the
behavior of read operations with regards to :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`. These parameters allow you to specify read preferences
on a per-connection basis in the connection string.

For example:

- The following connection string to a replica set specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode and a
  :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value of 120 seconds:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://db0.example.com,db1.example.com,db2.example.com/?replicaSet=myRepl&readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120

- The following connection string to a sharded cluster specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode and a
  :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value of 120 seconds:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://mongos1.example.com,mongos2.example.com/?readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120

- The following connection string to a sharded cluster specifies
  :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode as well as three
  :urioption:`readPreferenceTags`:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://mongos1.example.com,mongos2.example.com/?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``. The
``readPreferenceTags`` are tried in order until a match is found. Once
found, that specification is used to find all eligible matching
members and any remaining ``readPreferenceTags``  are ignored.
For details, see :ref:`read-preference-tag-order-matching`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: readPreference

     - Specifies the :term:`replica set` read preference for this
       connection. 
       
       The read preference values are the following:

       - :readmode:`primary` (*Default*)
       - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`secondary`
       - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
       - :readmode:`nearest`

       This connection string option is not available for the
       :binary:`mongo` shell. See :method:`cursor.readPref()` and
       :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` instead.

   * - .. urioption:: maxStalenessSeconds
   
     - .. versionadded:: 3.4
     
       Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the client
       stops using it for read operations. For details, see:
       :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness`.

       By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
       secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation.
  
       The minimum :urioption:`maxStalenessSeconds` value is 90
       seconds. Specifying a value between 0 and 90 seconds will produce
       an error. MongoDB drivers treat a ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value
       of ``-1`` as "no max staleness", the same as if
       ``maxStalenessSeconds`` is omitted.
       
       .. important::
          To use ``maxStalenessSeconds``, all of the
          MongoDB instances in your deployment must be using MongoDB 3.4 or
          later. If any instances are on an earlier version of MongoDB, the
          driver or :binary:`~bin.mongos` will raise an error.

   * - .. urioption:: readPreferenceTags

     - Specifies the :ref:`tags document
       <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>` as a comma-separated
       list of colon-separated key-value pairs. For example,
       
       - To specify the tags document ``{ "dc": "ny", "rack": "r1" }``,
         use ``readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1`` in the connection
         string.
         
       - To specify an empty tags document ``{ }``, use
         ``readPreferenceTags=`` without setting the value.

       To specify a *list* of tag documents, use multiple
       ``readPreferenceTags``. For example,
       ``readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:r1&readPreferenceTags=``.

       Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``. The
       ``readPreferenceTags`` are tried in order until a match is
       found. For details, see
       :ref:`read-preference-tag-order-matching`.
       
       This connection string option is not available for the
       :binary:`mongo` shell. See :method:`cursor.readPref()` and
       :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` instead.

For more information, see :doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>`.

Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following connection string to a replica set specifies the
:urioption:`authSource` to the ``admin`` database. That is the user
credentials are authenticated to the ``admin`` database.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/test?replicaSet=myRepl&authSource=admin

If the username or password includes the at sign ``@``, colon ``:``,
slash ``/``, or the percent sign ``%`` characters, use `percent
encoding <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: authSource

     - Specify the database name associated with the user's
       credentials. :urioption:`authSource`
       defaults to the database specified in the connection string.

       For authentication mechanisms that delegate credential storage
       to other services, the :urioption:`authSource` value should be
       ``$external`` as with the ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) and ``GSSAPI``
       (Kerberos) authentication mechanisms.

       MongoDB will ignore :urioption:`authSource` values if the
       connection string specifies no username.

   * - .. urioption:: authMechanism

     - .. versionchanged:: 2.6
          Added support for the ``PLAIN`` and ``MONGODB-X509``
          authentication mechanisms.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.0
          Added support for the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication mechanism.

          Specify the authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to
          authenticate the connection. Possible values include:

       - :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>`
       - :ref:`MONGODB-CR <authentication-mongodb-cr>` (*Deprecated in MongoDB 3.6*)
       - :ref:`MONGODB-X509 <security-auth-x509>`
       - :ref:`GSSAPI <security-auth-kerberos>` (Kerberos)
       - :ref:`PLAIN <security-auth-ldap>` (LDAP SASL)

       Only MongoDB Enterprise :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
       instances provide ``GSSAPI`` (Kerberos) and ``PLAIN`` (LDAP)
       mechanisms. To use ``MONGODB-X509``, you must have TLS/SSL
       Enabled.

       See :doc:`/core/authentication` for more information about the
       authentication system in MongoDB. Also consider
       :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` for more
       information on x509 authentication.

   * - .. urioption:: authMechanismProperties

     - Specify properties for the specified :urioption:`authMechanism`
       as a comma-separated list of colon-separated key-value pairs. 
       
       Possible values are:

       ``SERVICE_NAME:<string>``
         Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized
         MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set
         on MongoDB instances to which you are connecting. 

         ``SERVICE_NAME`` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all clients and 
         MongoDB instances. If you change the
         :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
         must set ``SERVICE_NAME`` to match that setting.

       ``CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME:true|false``
         Canonicalize the hostname of the client host machine when 
         connecting to the Kerberos server. This may be required when
         hosts report different hostnames than what is in the Kerberos
         database. Defaults to ``false``.

       ``SERVICE_REALM:<string>``
         Set the Kerberos realm for the MongoDB service. This may be
         necessary to support cross-realm authentication where the user
         exists in one realm and the service in another.

         .. note::

            The :urioption:`authMechanismProperties` option is only supported 
            when :urioption:`authMechanism` is 
            :ref:`GSSAPI <security-auth-kerberos>`.

   * - .. urioption:: gssapiServiceName

     - Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized
       MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set on
       MongoDB instances to which you are connecting.

       :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all
       clients and MongoDB instances. If you change
       :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
       must set :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` to match that setting.

       :urioption:`gssapiServiceName` is a deprecated aliases for
       :urioption:`authMechanismProperties=SERVICE_NAME:mongodb 
       <authMechanismProperties>`. For more information on which 
       options your driver supports and their relative priority to each 
       other, reference the documentation for your preferred driver 
       version.

.. _selection-discovery-options:

Server Selection and Discovery Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following options to configure how MongoDB drivers
and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances select a server to which to direct read
or write operations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Connection Option
     - Description
   
   * - .. urioption:: localThresholdMS

     - The size (in milliseconds) of the latency window for selecting
       among multiple suitable MongoDB instances. *Default*: 15
       milliseconds.
       
       All drivers use :urioption:`localThresholdMS`. Use the
       ``localThreshold`` alias when specifying the latency window size
       to :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTimeoutMS

     - Specifies how long (in milliseconds) to block for server
       selection before throwing an exception. *Default*: 30,000
       milliseconds.

   * - .. urioption:: serverSelectionTryOnce

     - **Single-threaded drivers only**. When ``true``, instructs the
       driver to scan the MongoDB deployment exactly once after server
       selection fails and then either select a server or raise an
       error. When ``false``, the driver blocks and searches for a
       server up to the :urioption:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS` value.
       *Default*: ``true``.
       
       Multi-threaded drivers and :binary:`~bin.mongos` do not support
       :urioption:`serverSelectionTryOnce`.

   * - .. urioption:: heartbeatFrequencyMS

     - :urioption:`heartbeatFrequencyMS` controls when the driver
       checks the state of the MongoDB deployment. Specify the interval
       (in milliseconds) between checks, counted from the end of the
       previous check until the beginning of the next one.
       
       *Default*:
       
       - Single-threaded drivers: 60 seconds.
       - Multi-threaded drivers: 10 seconds.
       
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` does not support changing the frequency of 
       the heartbeat checks.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: retryWrites

     - Enable :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>`.

       Possible values are:

       - ``true``

       - ``false``. The default value for the 3.6 drivers is ``false``.

       .. versionadded:: 3.6

   * - .. urioption:: uuidRepresentation

     - Possible values are:

       ``standard``
         The standard binary representation.

       ``csharpLegacy``
         The default representation for the C# driver.

       ``javaLegacy``
         The default representation for the Java driver.

       ``pythonLegacy``
         The default representation for the Python driver.

       For the default, see the :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`
       documentation for your driver.

       .. note::
          Not all drivers support the :urioption:`uuidRepresentation`
          option. For information on your driver, see the :ecosystem:`drivers
          </drivers>` documentation.
