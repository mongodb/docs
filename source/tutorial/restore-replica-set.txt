When you restore a replica set from backup, |mms| provides you with a
restore file for the selected restore point. For an overview of the
restore process, please see :doc:`/core/restore-overview`.

Considerations
--------------

``BinData``
+++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/considerations-restore-bindata-change.rst

``restoreInfo.txt``
+++++++++++++++++++

The backup restore file includes a metadata file, ``restoreInfo.txt``.
This file captures the options the database used when the snapshot was
taken. The database must be run with the listed options after it has
been restored.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/encrypted-backup-display-kmip-info.rst

Oplog Size
++++++++++

To seed each replica set member, you will use the
:file:`seedSecondary.sh` or :file:`seedSecondary.bat` script included
in the backup restore file. When you run the script, you provide
the replica set's :term:`oplog` size in gigabytes.

.. seealso::
   If you do not have the size, see the **Check the Size of the Oplog** section of the 
   :manual:`Troubleshoot Replica Sets </tutorial/troubleshoot-replica-sets>` 
   .

Client Requests During Restoration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/considerations-restore-in-isolation.rst

Secure Copy (``SCP``) Delivery
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/note-scp-key-pair-requirement.rst

.. include:: /includes/note-windows-scp-issue.rst

``SCP`` is performed in parallel and, by default, Secure Shell Daemon
(``sshd``) installations use a small number of concurrent connections.
Changing this setting in ``sshd_config`` allows ``SCP`` to support
sufficient connections to complete the restore.

Automatic Restore
-----------------

To have |mms| restore the snapshots, perform the
:ref:`select the snapshot <select-snapshot-replica-set>` procedure. Choose 
:guilabel:`Choose Cluster to Restore to` at Step 2 of the restore wizard.

Manual Restore
--------------

To restore the backup manually, perform the following procedures:

1. :ref:`Select and Prepare the Snapshot<select-snapshot-replica-set>`.

#. :ref:`Retrieve the Snapshot using HTTPS 
   <retrieve-snapshot-replica-set>` or 
   :ref:`Send the Snapshot using SCP 
   <send-snapshot-replica-set-by-scp>`.

#. :ref:`Prepare and Distribute Snapshot <prep-and-distro-snapshot-replica-set>`

#. :ref:`Unmanage the Replica Set<unmanage-replset>`.

#. :ref:`Restore the Replica Set Manually<restore-replset-manually>`.

#. :ref:`Reimport the Replica Set<reimport-replset>`.
