A collection is a grouping of MongoDB
:ref:`documents <compass-documents>`. Documents within a collection can
have different fields. A collection is the equivalent of a
table in a relational database system. A collection exists within a
single :ref:`database <compass-database-tab>`.

Collections Screen

Collection Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Collections` screen displays the following
information for each collection in the selected database:

- Collection name
- Number of :ref:`documents <compass-documents>` in the collection
 
  .. note::

    |compass-short| bases the document count that appears on the 
    :guilabel:`Collections` screen on cached metadata using 
    :manual:`collStats </reference/command/collStats/>`. This count 
    might differ from the actual document count in the collection. For 
    example, an :manual:`unexpected shutdown 
    </reference/command/collStats/#behavior>` can throw off the count. 
    Use the :manual:`db.collection.countDocuments() 
    </reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/>` method for the 
    most accurate document count.

- Average size of documents in the collection
- Total size of all documents in the collection
- Number of :ref:`indexes <compass-indexes>` on the collection
- Total size of all indexes on the collection
- :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/>` properties for the
  collection. Hover over a :guilabel:`Collation` banner to view
  the properties for that collection.
