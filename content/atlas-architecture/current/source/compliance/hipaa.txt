The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a
U.S. law that sets national standards for protecting the privacy and
security of protected health information (PHI). It includes rules that
govern how Covered Entities and their Business Associates use, disclose,
protect, and provide access to {+PHI+} across electronic, paper, and
oral formats.

Under HIPAA: 

- MongoDB is a `Business Associate
  <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html>`__,
  meaning an entity that performs certain functions or activities
  involving the use or disclosure of {+PHI+} on behalf of, or provides
  services to, a Covered Entity.
- MongoDB's customers are usually `Covered Entities
  <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html>`__,
  such as healthcare providers, health plans, or healthcare
  clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain, or transmit {+PHI+},
  but MongoDB's customers can also be Business Associates.
- `Protected Health Information (PHI)
  <https://www.hhs.gov/answers/hipaa/what-is-phi/index.html>`__ is any
  individually identifiable health information held by a Covered Entity
  or Business Associate, including, for example, names, addresses,
  Social Security numbers, medical records, test results, and insurance
  information.

HIPAA establishes the following core rules for compliance:

- `Privacy Rule
  <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html>`__:
  governs how protected health information (PHI) can be used and
  disclosed, and gives individuals rights over their health information
- `Security Rule
  <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html>`__:
  governs how Covered Entities and their Business Associates must
  protect individuals' electronic personal health information (ePHI)
- `Breach Notification Rule
  <https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html>`__:
  governs how Covered Entities and their Business Associates provide
  notification following a breach of unsecured {+PHI+}

We understand that HIPAA compliance is a shared responsibility between
MongoDB, you, and your end customers. The following sections describe
how MongoDB {+service+} features can support your compliance with these
core HIPAA rules.

Privacy Rule
------------

MongoDB {+service+} provides features that support compliance for the
Privacy Rule:

Individual Right of Access and Record Rectification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Privacy Rule gives individuals rights over their health information,
including the right to examine and obtain a copy of their health records
and to request corrections where appropriate.

The following MongoDB {+service+} features support compliance in this area:

- The :atlas:`{+atlas-ui+} </atlas-ui/documents/>` and MongoDB
  :driver:`Drivers </>` allow authorized users to securely connect to
  your MongoDB {+service+} deployment and view, create, update, or
  delete documents containing an individual's {+PHI+} in accordance with
  your policies.
- {+service+}'s robust :atlas:`query capabilities
  </atlas-search/return-scope/>` enable authorized users to locate and
  retrieve an individual's {+PHI+} using rich filters and aggregation
  capabilities.

Data Retention and Secure Disposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Privacy Rule sets standards for how Covered Entities should protect
{+PHI+} throughout its lifecycle, including when {+PHI+} is no longer
needed and must be securely disposed of.

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Backups <arch-center-backups>`: Create
  backups of your data for recovery purposes during its retention
  period, enable compliance policies to prevent backups from being
  modified or deleted, and securely delete backups when they are no
  longer needed.

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Data Encryption <arch-center-data-encryption>`: 
  Use encryption features to protect {+PHI+} at rest, in transit, and in
  use throughout its lifecycle, including when it is being deleted.

Minimum Necessary Standard (Data Minimization)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Privacy Rule's minimum necessary standard is the principle that
Covered Entities must take reasonable steps to use, disclose, and
request only the minimum amount of {+PHI+} needed to accomplish the
intended purpose of the use, disclosure, or request. 

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Auditing and Logging <arch-center-auditing-logging>`:
  Monitor, record, and review database events such as user authentication
  attempts and permission adjustments that impact access to {+PHI+}.

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Data Encryption <arch-center-data-encryption>`:
  Apply encryption in use techniques like Client-Side Field Level
  Encryption (CSFLE) and Queryable Encryption to limit exposure of
  sensitive {+PHI+} data to only authorized application components and
  users.

.. _hipaa-compliance-security-rule: 

Security Rule
-------------

MongoDB {+service+} provides features that support compliance for the
Security Rule:

Encryption and Transmission Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Security Rule sets standards for how Covered Entities must ensure
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of {+ephi+}, including
by implementing technical security measures guarding against
unauthorized access to {+ephi+} that is being transmitted over an
electronic network.

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} article describes
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area: 

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Data Encryption <arch-center-data-encryption>`:
  Ensure data encryption in transit (TLS), at rest (AES-256, BYOK,
  CMK, KMS, or TDE), and in use (CSFLE, random encryption, or
  queryable encryption).

- :ref:`Guidance for {+service+} Network Security <arch-center-network-security>`:
  Safeguard network access to {+service+} clusters and protect
  {+ephi+} during transmission with encryption in transit, IP access
  lists, firewall configurations, private endpoints, and network
  isolation.

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Security Rule requires that only authorized personnel have access to
{+ephi+}.

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`Guidance for Atlas Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>`:
  Implement access control and user authentication to protect {+ephi+}
  through secure identity management, including support for Federated
  Authentication with |idps|, |aws| |iam| role authentication,
  multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more. 

- :ref:`Guidance for Atlas Authorization <arch-center-authorization-recs>`:
  Implement workforce security, information access management, and
  assigned security responsibility to ensure that only authorized
  personnel can access {+ephi+} based on their specific job functions
  and responsibilities.

.. _hipaa-compliance-breach-notification-rule: 

Breach Notification Rule
------------------------

MongoDB {+service+} provides features that support compliance for the
Breach Notification Rule:

Auditing and Information System Activity Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Breach Notification Rule asks Covered Entities and Business
Associates to implement mechanisms that record and examine activity in
information systems containing or using {+ephi+}.

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`: Monitor, record, and review
  database events such as user authentication attempts and permission
  adjustments.

- :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`: Track cluster health,
  performance, and operational metrics, and configure alerts that can
  surface anomalous activity relevant to {+ephi+}.

You can also leverage :ref:`{+atlas-sp+} <atlas-sp-overview>` to build
custom data processing pipelines on top of real-time data streams
including Kafka topics, Kinesis, and {+service+} :manual:`Change Streams
</changeStreams>`, a native MongoDB feature that exposes an ordered
stream of change events (insert, update, delete, etc.) from your MongoDB
collections, databases, or clusters. You can integrate {+atlas-sp+} with
third-party monitoring and logging tools to create a comprehensive view
of system activity for your applications that process {+ephi+}.

Breach Notification and Incident Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Breach Notification Rule sets standards for how Covered Entities and
Business Associates should provide notification following a breach of
unsecured {+PHI+}.

- :atlas:`Third-Party Integrations
  </tutorial/third-party-service-integrations/>` with :abbr:`SIEM
  (Security Information and Event Management)` tools like PagerDuty,
  Microsoft Teams, and Prometheus, support alert routing, on-call
  notification, and coordinated incident response workflows.

Contingency Planning: High Availability and Disaster Recovery
