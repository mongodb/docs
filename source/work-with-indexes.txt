Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **indexes** with the {+driver-short+}.
Indexes can improve the efficiency of queries and add additional functionality
to querying and storing documents.

Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find the
documents that match each query. These collection scans are
slow and can negatively affect the performance of your application. However, if an
appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the
documents it must inspect.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in
your application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each
index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active, so we recommend
that you track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition,
when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also updates any related
index.

Because MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields
whose names are not known in advance or are arbitrary. MongoDB 4.2 introduced
:manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>` to help support these
queries. Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based index
planning.

For more information about designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#indexes>` guide
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see
:ref:`<cpp-get-started>`.

Create an Index
---------------

MongoDB supports several different index types to support querying your data.
The following sections describe the most common index types and provide sample
code for creating each index type.

.. _cpp-single-field-index:

Single-Field Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Single-field indexes </core/index-single/>` are indexes with a
reference to a single field within a collection's
documents. They improve single-field query and sort performance, and support
:manual:`TTL (time to live) indexes </core/index-ttl>`, which
automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time
or at a specific clock time. You can specify the sort order of the index entries
by specifying ``1`` for ascending or ``-1`` for descending.

.. note::

   The ``_id_`` index is an example of a single-field index. This index is
   automatically created on the ``_id`` field when a new collection is created.

The following example creates a single-field index in ascending order on the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :start-after: start-index-single
   :end-before: end-index-single
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

To learn more about single-field indexes, see :manual:`Single Field Indexes
</core/index-single>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _cpp-indexes-remove:

Remove an Index
---------------

You can remove any unused index except the default unique index on the
``_id`` field.

The following sections show how to remove a single index and how to remove all
indexes in a collection.

Remove a Single Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass an instance of an index or the index name to the ``drop_one()`` method to
remove an index from a collection.

The following example removes an index with the name ``"title_1"`` from the ``movies``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-index
   :end-before: end-remove-index

.. note::

   You cannot remove a single field from a compound text index. You must
   drop the entire index and create a new one to update the indexed
   fields.

Remove All Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.2, you can drop all indexes by calling the
``drop_all()`` method on the index view in your collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-all-indexes
   :end-before: end-remove-all-indexes

For earlier versions of MongoDB, pass ``"*"`` as a parameter to your call to
``drop_one()`` on the index view in your collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-all-wildcard
   :end-before: end-remove-all-wildcard
