Backups depend upon which
:manual:`version of MongoDB your database is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the FCV can be ``4.0`` or
``4.2``.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      Once backup has started, |mms| backs up the data as a ongoing and
      continuous process. This process continues creating snapshots as
      long as the head database remains synchronized with the database.

Backup Definition and Operational States
----------------------------------------

Each backup is defined as a :term:`job <backup job>`. Each job defines
how much and how often data is backed up. Backup jobs are defined on a
per-project basis.

Operational States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the states of a backup job:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 60 20 20
         :header-rows: 1

         * - State
           - Retain Old Snapshots
           - Create New Snapshots

         * - ``Active``
           - Yes
           - Yes

         * - ``Stopped``
           - Yes
           - No

         * - ``Inactive``
           - No
           - No

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 20 27 27 26
         :header-rows: 1

         * - State
           - Retain Old Snapshots
           - Create New Snapshots
           - Apply Oplogs

         * - ``Active``
           - Yes
           - Yes
           - Yes

         * - ``Stopped``
           - Yes
           - No
           - No

         * - ``Inactive``
           - No
           - No
           - No

Change Operational States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once backup jobs are active for a :opsmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#term-project>`, they run without
further intervention until they are stopped or terminated. The operator
can change the state of a backup in the following ways:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-change-op-state.rst

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      .. include:: /includes/backup/legacy-process-change-op-state.rst

.. _backup-initial-sync:

Backup Process Flows
--------------------

Once created, a backup job goes through the following process flow:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:


   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-initial-backup.rst

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      **Initial Backup**

      .. include:: /includes/backup/legacy-process-initial-backup.rst

      **Subsequent Backups**
