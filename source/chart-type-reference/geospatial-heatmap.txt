Overview
--------

Geospatial heatmap charts are useful for displaying how
geographical areas of a map compare to one another based on a given
criterion.

.. note::

   Heatmap charts can use a maximum of 10,000 documents. If you
   create a heatmap with a collection of more than 10,000
   documents, turn on :ref:`Sample Mode <charts-sample-mode>` or use a
   :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>`. Otherwise, your chart may
   use incomplete or misleading data.

To create a geospatial heatmap chart:

1. On the chart editing screen, select :guilabel:`Geospatial` from
   the :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown menu.

#. Select :guilabel:`Heatmap` from the three available geospatial
   chart types.

Encoding Channels
-----------------

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~

A :guilabel:`geopoint` encoding channel which defines the map
area of the chart. See the :ref:`Geopoint <geopoint-channel>` reference
page for more information about what types of data you can use in this
channel.

Intensity
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/intensity-definition.rst

.. include:: /includes/radius-description.rst

.. note::

   Intensity shading is local to the map's current view. The most
   intense color is displayed for the most extreme aggregated values
   currently visible on the map, even if there are points outside the
   current view that are more extreme.

Legend
~~~~~~

Unlike other types of charts, the legend and the chart colors on
geospatial heatmaps change when the view changes. The color range is
based on the data in the current view, and may change when you pan or
zoom the map.

Example
-------

The following chart is based on AirBnB data for the New York City area. 
It shows rental rate hot spots in a geospatial heatmap.

   :alt: Geospatial heatmap example

The :guilabel:`Coordinates` channel uses the ``location`` database
field, which contains arrays of latitude-longitude pairs. The
:guilabel:`Intensity` field uses the ``monthly_price`` database field,
which contains monthly rental rates for each property in the database.

Limitation
----------

The maximum query response size for a geospatial heatmap is 50000 documents.
