You can view, filter, and modify :ref:`embedded charts 
<embedding-charts>` and :ref:`embedded dashboards 
<embedding-dashboards>` in the :guilabel:`Items` view. The 
:guilabel:`Items` view includes a list of all the embedded items that 
you created or that someone shared with you. Each embedded item appears 
along with its :guilabel:`Emdedding ID` and details about whether the 
item has authetication enabled at the dashboard or charts level. 
Options to filter the list appear at the top of the view. You can click 
the name of a dashboard to go to the associated dashboard page.
