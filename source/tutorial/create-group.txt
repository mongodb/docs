Overview
--------

A group provides access to a distinct deployment of MongoDB clusters, replica
sets and standalone processes. Users must be members of a group to access the
group's deployment. When you register as a new |mms| user, you must choose
whether to join an existing group or create a new one.

Each group must have a globally unique name within the |mms| platform. Once
you name a group, the group's name cannot be changed. The user who creates a
group automatically has the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the group and
can manage user access.

You can create multiple groups. Each group has a unique agent API key that is shared
by the Monitoring, Backup and Automation Agents.
Within each group, the Monitoring Agent must be able to connect to all
hosts it monitors. If you have segregated environments separated by firewalls,
you must create separate |mms| groups for each environment.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and cannot
monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a new group.
Having a second group makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second group and agent to monitor a different set of
MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate the hosts
within the |mms| console. A user can only view data from the hosts monitored in
a single group at once.

After adding a second group, the |mms| interface will have a drop-down list that
will allow you to change groups. Selecting a new group will refresh the
current page with the data available from the servers in this group.

Procedures
----------

.. _create-group:

Create a Group
++++++++++++++

Choose a globally unique name for your group; this name must be unique within
the |mms| platform. For security and auditing reasons, you cannot use a name
used earlier, and once you name a group, the group's name cannot be changed.

|mms| automatically adds you as the first user to the group and assigns
the group a set of default :doc:`alert configurations
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-group.rst

.. _remove-group:

Remove a Group
++++++++++++++

.. only:: onprem

   Please contact your |mms| administrator to remove a company or group
   from your |mms| account.

.. only:: cloud

   Removing a group deletes all the group's artifacts, including all user
   and monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the group in selection
   lists. If you recreate the group, it is as if the group had not
   existed.

   You can remove a group if:

   - You have the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the group.

   - The group has no outstanding invoices.

   - The group has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to removing
     the group, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.

Group Settings
++++++++++++++

The following settings in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab's
:guilabel:`Group Settings` page apply to all users in the group:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Group Time Zone`

     - Sets your group's time zone.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates the collection of log data for all
       hosts. This overwrites the statuses set on the individual hosts.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Profiling Information for All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates |mms| collection of data from the MongoDB
       :manual:`database profilers </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
       running on your :program:`mongod` instances. A :program:`mongod`
       instance must have its profiler enabled in order for |mms| to
       collect data from it.

       When you change this setting, |mms| applies the change globally to
       all :program:`mongod` processes in the group. For example, if you
       disable this setting, |mms| disables the collection of profiling
       data for all the group's processes. This setting does not affect
       whether the profiler is enabled on a given :program:`mongod`
       process, only whether |mms| collects profiling data.

       To enable the collection of profiling data on a process-by-process
       basis, see :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

       When profiling is enabled, |mms| collects data from MongoDBâ€™s
       profiler to provide statistics about performance and database
       operations. Ensure exposing profile data to |mms| is
       consistent with your information security practices. Also be aware
       the profiler can consume resources which may adversely affect
       MongoDB performance. For more information, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics. For more information, see :ref:`db-stats-warning`.

   * - :guilabel:`Enable Public API`

     - Allows you to :doc:`use the Public API
       </tutorial/enable-public-api>` with the group.

   * - :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates`

     - Allows you to reset and remove all detected duplicate hosts. This
       is useful if your server environment has drastically changed and
       you believe a host is incorrectly marked as a duplicate.

   * - :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames`

     - Allows you to specify resolvable hostnames or IP address for your
       deployment's servers. |mms| keeps a list of the multiple way to
       which each server is referred (hostname, FQDN, IP address) and uses
       heuristics to determine the best choice. Use this setting to
       guarantee |mms| uses a resolvable method. The method you choose
       will also be the method used to display the servers in |mms|.

       To specify a preferred hostname, click :guilabel:`Add`. To specify
       a hostname pattern, use the :guilabel:`Ends With` or
       :guilabel:`Regex` buttons.

   * - :guilabel:`Suppress Mongos Automatic Discovery`

     - Suppresses automatic discovery of all :program:`mongos` processes
       in your deployment's sharded clusters.

   * - :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores`

     - If you use |mms| :doc:`Backup </tutorial/nav/backup-use>`, this
       setting allows you to generate a public key for SCP backup
       restoration. If you restore a snapshot through SCP, |mms| uses the
       key to transmit the snapshot. For more information on restores, see
       :ref:`how to validate an SCP restore <backup-faq-scp-validation>`
       and other SCP FAQs.

   * - :guilabel:`PagerDuty Service Key`

     - Sets a default service key for alert notifications sent to a `PagerDuty
       <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
       account. |mms| enters the key by default when you add a PagerDuty
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Flowdock Settings`

     - Sets default values for alert notifications sent to Flowdock. |mms|
       enters the values by default when you add a Flowdock notification
       to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. Set the following:

       - :guilabel:`Org Name`: The Flowdock organization name in
         lower-case letters. This is the name that appears after
         ``www.flowdock.com/app/`` in the URL string.

       - :guilabel:`Flow Name`: The flow name in lower-case letters. The
         flow name appears after the org name in the URL string:
         ``www.flowdock.com/app/<org-name>/<flow-name>``.

         The flow name also appears in the "flow email address" setting in
         Flowdock. For example: ``<flow-name>@example.flowdock.com``.

       - :guilabel:`API Token`: Your Flowdock "personal API token" found
         on the `<https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens>`_ page of your
         Flowdock account.

   * - :guilabel:`HipChat Settings`

     - Sets a default room and API token for alert notifications sent to a
       HipChat account. |mms| enters the values by default when you add a
       HipChat notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Slack Settings`

     - Sets a default channel and token for alert notifications sent
       to a Slack account. You can use either an API token or a Bot token. To
       create an API token, see the `<https://api.slack.com/web>`_ page in
       your Slack account. For information on Bot users in Slack, see
       `<https://api.slack.com/bot-users>`_.

       |mms| will enter these values by default when you add a Slack
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook Settings`

     - Adds a :guilabel:`Webhook URL` endpoint to which |mms| can send
       alert notifications for programmatic processing. |mms| sends an
       alert notification as an HTTP POST request in which the request body
       contains a JSON document that uses the same format as the Public
       API's :doc:`Alerts resource </reference/api/alerts>`.

       |mms| adds a request header called ``X-MMS-Event`` to distinguish
       between various alert states. The possible values for this header
       are:

       - ``alert.open``: The alert was just opened.

       - ``alert.close``: The alert was resolved.

       - ``alert.update``: A previously opened alert is still open.

       - ``alert.cancel``: The alert became invalid and was canceled.

       - ``alert.inform``: Represents an informational alert, which is a
         point-in-time event, such as "Primary Elected."

       If you specify a key in the :guilabel:`Webhook Secret` field, |mms| adds the
       ``X-MMS-Signature`` request header, which contains the hex-encoded
       HMAC signature of the request body. The signature is created using
       the provided secret.

       To send alert notifications to a Webhook, select the Webhook
       notification option when creating or editing an :doc:`alert
       configuration </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

.. _admin-only-group-settings:

Admin Only Group Settings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following group settings in the :guilabel:`Admin Only` section of the
:guilabel:`Settings` tab could, in certain situations, affect more
than the group. For example, setting logging to a high verbosity would
cause system logs to roll over faster. Only users with the
:ref:`global-owner-role` role can edit these settings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Mongos Deactivation Threshold`

     - Change the amount of time before |mms| stops monitoring an
       unreachable :program:`mongos`. By default, the Monitoring Agent
       stops monitoring an unreachable :program:`mongos` after 24 hours.
       Set this to the amount of time in hours to wait before
       deactivation.

   * - :guilabel:`Monitoring Agent Log Level`

     - Change the verbosity of the Monitoring Agent log.

   * - :guilabel:`Automation Agent Log Level`

     - Change the verbosity of the Automation Agent log.
