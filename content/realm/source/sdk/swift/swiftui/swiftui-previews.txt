Overview
--------

SwiftUI Previews are a useful tool during development. You can work with Realm 
data in SwiftUI Previews in a few ways:

- Initialize individual objects to use in detail views
- Conditionally use an array of objects in place of ``@ObservedResults``
- Create a realm that contains data for the previews

SwiftUI Preview debugging can be opaque, so we also have a few tips to debug
issue with persisting Realms within SwiftUI Previews.

.. _swift-use-objects-in-a-detail-view:

Initialize an Object for a Detail View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simplest case, you can use SwiftUI Previews with one or more objects 
that use Realm properties you can set directly at initialization. 
You might want to do this when previewing a Detail view. Consider DoggoDB's
``DogDetailView``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/PassObjectsToView.snippet.dog-detail-view.swift
   :language: swift

Create an extension for your model object. Where you put this extension depends 
on convention in your codebase. You may put it directly in the model file,
have a dedicated directory for sample data, or use some other convention in 
your codebase.

In this extension, initialize one or more Realm objects with ``static let``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Model.snippet.preview-extend-model-class-with-objects.swift
   :language: swift

In this example, we :ref:`initialize objects with a value 
<ios-initialize-an-object-with-a-value>`. You can only initialize objects with
a value when your model contains properties that you can directly initialize.
If your model object contains properties that are only mutable within a 
write transaction, such as a :ref:`List property <ios-list-collections>`,
you must instead :ref:`create a realm to use with your SwiftUI Previews 
<swift-create-a-realm-with-data>`.

After you have initialized an object as an extension of your model class, 
you can use it in your SwiftUI Preview. You can pass the object directly
to the View in the Preview:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Previews.snippet.preview-detail-view.swift
   :language: swift

.. _conditionally-use-observedresults-in-a-list-view:

Conditionally Use ObservedResults in a List View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use :swift-sdk:`@ObservedResults <Structs/ObservedResults.html>`
in a List view, this implicitly opens a realm and queries it. For this to 
work in a Preview, you need :ref:`a realm populated with data 
<swift-create-a-realm-with-data>`. As an alternative, you can conditionally 
use a static array in Previews and only use the ``@ObservedResults`` variable 
when running the app.

You could do this in multiple ways, but for the sake of making our
code easier to read and understand, we'll create an ``EnvironmentValue`` 
that can detect whether the app is running in a Preview:

.. code-block:: swift

   import Foundation
   import SwiftUI

   public extension EnvironmentValues {
      var isPreview: Bool {
         #if DEBUG
         return ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["XCODE_RUNNING_FOR_PREVIEWS"] == "1"
         #else
         return false
         #endif
      }
   }

Then, we can use this as an environment value in our view, and conditionally
change which variable we use based on whether or not we are in a Preview.

This example builds on the :ref:`Dog extension we defined above 
<swift-use-objects-in-a-detail-view>`. We'll create an ``dogArray`` as 
a ``static let`` in our Dog extension, and include the item objects we
already created:

.. code-block:: swift

   static let dogArray = [dog1, dog2, dog3]

Then, when we iterate through our List, use the static ``dogArray`` if
running in a Preview, or use the ``@ObservedResults`` query if not in a Preview.

.. code-block:: swift

   struct DogsView: View {
      @Environment(\.isPreview) var isPreview
      @ObservedResults(Dog.self) var dogs
      var previewDogs = Dog.dogArray

      var body: some View {
         NavigationView {
            VStack {
               List {
                  if isPreview {
                     ForEach(previewDogs) { dog in
                        DogRow(dog: dog)
                     }
                  } else {
                     ForEach(dogs) { dog in
                        DogRow(dog: dog)
                     }.onDelete(perform: $dogs.remove)
                  }
               }
               ... More View code

This has the benefit of being lightweight and not persisting any data, but 
the downside of making the View code more verbose. If you prefer cleaner 
View code, you can create a realm with data that you use in the Previews.

.. _swift-create-a-realm-with-data:

Create a Realm with Data for Previews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, your only option to see realm data in a SwiftUI Preview
is to create a realm that contains the data. You might do this when populating 
a property that can only be populated during a write transaction, rather 
than initialized directly with a value, such as a :ref:`List 
<ios-list-collections>` or :ref:`MutableSet <ios-mutableset-data-type>`. 
You might also want to do this if your view relies on more complex object 
hierarchies being passed in from other views.

However, using a realm directly does inject state into your SwiftUI Previews, 
which can come with drawbacks. Whether you're using Realm or Core Data, 
stateful SwiftUI Previews can cause issues like:

- Seeing unexpected or duplicated data due to re-running the realm file 
  creation steps repeatedly
- Needing to perform a migration within the SwiftUI Preview when you make model changes
- Potential issues related to changing state within views
- Unexplained crashes or performance issues related to issues that are not
  surfaced in a visible way in SwiftUI Previews

You can avoid or fix some of these issues with these tips:

- :ref:`Use an in-memory realm, when possible (demonstrated in the example above) <swiftui-preview-use-in-memory-realm>`
- :ref:`Manually delete all preview data from the command line to reset state <swiftui-preview-delete-realm-from-preview>`
- :ref:`Check out diagnostic logs to try to troubleshoot SwiftUI Preview issues <swiftui-preview-diagnose-crashes>`

You can create a static variable for your realm in your model extension.
This is where you do the work to populate your realm. In our case, we 
create a ``Person`` and append some ``Dog`` objects to the ``dogs``
List property. This example builds on the example above where we :ref:`initialized
a few Dog objects in an Dog extension <swift-use-objects-in-a-detail-view>`.


We'll create a ``Person`` extension, and create a single ``Person`` object
in that extension. Then, we'll create a ``previewRealm`` by adding the 
``Person`` we just created, and appending the example ``Dog`` objects from 
the ``Dog`` extension.

To avoid adding these objects more than once, we add a check to see if the 
Person already exists by querying for Person objects and checking that 
the count is 1. If the realm contains a Person, we can use it in our 
SwiftUI Preview. If not, we add the data.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Model.snippet.extend-model-class-with-realm.swift
   :language: swift

To use it in the SwiftUI Preview, our ProfileView code expects a Profile.
This is a :ref:`projection of the Person object <swiftui-projection>`. In our 
Preview, we can get the realm, query it for the Profile, and pass it to the 
view:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Previews.snippet.preview-with-realm.swift
   :language: swift

If you don't have a View that is expecting a realm object to be passed in,
but instead uses ``@ObservedResults`` to query a realm or otherwise work
with an existing realm, you can :ref:`inject the realm into the view as an 
environment value <inject-realm-as-environment-value>`:

.. code-block:: swift

   struct SomeListView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
      static var previews: some View {
         SomeListView()
            .environment(\.realm, Person.previewRealm)
      }
   }

.. _swiftui-preview-use-in-memory-realm:

Use an In-Memory Realm
``````````````````````

When possible, use an :ref:`in-memory realm <ios-open-an-in-memory-realm>` 
to get around some of the state-related issues that can come from using 
a database within a SwiftUI Preview.

Use the :swift-sdk:`inMemoryIdentifier 
<Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV18inMemoryIdentifierSSSgvp>` 
configuration property when you initialize the realm.

.. code-block:: swift

   static var previewRealm: Realm {
      var realm: Realm
      let identifier = "previewRealm"
      let config = Realm.Configuration(inMemoryIdentifier: identifier)
      do {
         realm = try Realm(configuration: config)
         // ... Add data to realm

.. note::

   Do not use the the :swift-sdk:`deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded 
   <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV06deleteA17IfMigrationNeededSbvp>`
   configuration property when you initialize a realm for SwiftUI Previews.
   Due to the way Apple has implemented SwiftUI Previews, using this property
   to bypass migration issues causes SwiftUI Previews to crash.

.. _swiftui-preview-delete-realm-from-preview:

Delete SwiftUI Previews
```````````````````````

If you run into other SwiftUI Preview issues related to state, 
such as a failure to load a realm in a Preview due to migration being 
required, there are a few things you can do to remove cached Preview data.

The Apple-recommended fix is to close Xcode and use the command line to 
delete all your existing SwiftUI Preview data. 

1. Close Xcode.
2. From your command line, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      xcrun simctl --set previews delete all

It's possible that data may persist after running this command. This is 
likely due to Xcode retaining a reference due to something in the Preview
and being unable to delete it. You can also try these steps to resolve issues:

- Build for a different simulator 
- Restart the computer and re-run ``xcrun simctl --set previews delete all``
- Delete stored Preview data directly. This data is stored in 
  ``~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/Previews``.

.. _swiftui-preview-diagnose-crashes:

Get Detailed Information about SwiftUI Preview Crashes
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you have an unexplained SwiftUI Preview crash when using realm, first try
running the application on the simulator. The error messaging and logs available
for the simulator make it easier to find and diagnose issues. If you can
debug the issue in the simulator, this is the easiest route.

If you cannot replicate a SwiftUI Preview crash in the simulator, you can 
view crash logs for the SwiftUI Preview app. These logs are available in 
``~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/``. These logs sometimes appear after 
a delay, so wait a few minutes after a crash if you don't see the relevant 
log immediately.

.. _swift-use-a-synced-realm-in-previews:

Use a Synced Realm in Previews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app uses Atlas Device Sync, you may wonder how to use a synced realm
in your SwiftUI Previews. A better practice is to use static objects or a 
local realm that you populate with data for your SwiftUI Previews.

In our example app, we can preview a view *associated* with Device Sync - 
the LoginView - without needing to use a realm at all:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Previews.snippet.preview-view-associated-with-sync.swift
   :language: swift

Since we're only viewing the static UI, we don't need to worry about the 
SyncContentView that contains the logic of whether to show the LoginView 
or go to the OpenSyncedRealmView. We can also skip previewing the 
OpenSyncedRealmView, because that just handles logic associated with opening
a synced realm and populating it for the DogsView. So the next view we
want to see in a Preview is the DogsView.

Fortunately, with Realm, the code to work with the realm doesn't care whether
the realm uses Device Sync or not - you work with the realm in the same way.
So we can use the same local realm that we :ref:`created in the example above 
<swift-create-a-realm-with-data>` in the SwiftUI Preview.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Previews.snippet.preview-dogs-view.swift
   :language: swift
