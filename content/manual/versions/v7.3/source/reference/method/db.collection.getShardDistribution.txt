.. method:: db.collection.getShardDistribution()


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst


   Prints the data distribution statistics for a :term:`sharded
   <sharding>` collection. 

Syntax
------

The :method:`~db.collection.getShardDistribution()` method has the following 
form: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.getShardDistribution()

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/sharding`

.. TODO - Improve the output sections.

Output
------

Sample Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a sample output for the distribution of a sharded
collection:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Shard shard01 at shard01/localhost:27018
   {
     data: '38.14MB',
     docs: 1000003,
     chunks: 2,
     'estimated data per chunk': '19.07B',
     'estimated docs per chunk': 500001
   }
   ---
   Shard shard02 at shard02/localhost:27019
   {
     data: '38.14B',
     docs: 999999,
     chunks: 3,
     'estimated data per chunk': '12.71B',
     'estimated docs per chunk': 333333
   }
   ---
   Totals
   {
     data: '76.29B',
     docs: 2000002,
     chunks: 5,
     'Shard shard01': [ '50 % data', '50 % docs in cluster', '40B avg obj size on shard' ],
     'Shard shard02': [ '49.99 % data', '49.99 % docs in cluster', '40B avg obj size on shard' ]
   }

Output Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Shard shard01 at <host-a>   {
     data: <size-a>,
     docs: <count-a>,
     chunks: <number of chunks-a>,
     'estimated data per chunk': <size-a>/<number of chunks-a>,
     'estimated docs per chunk': <count-a>/<number of chunks-a>
   }
   ---
   Shard shard02 at <host-b>
   {
     data: <size-b>,
     docs: <count-b>,
     chunks: <number of chunks-b>,
     'estimated data per chunk': <size-b>/<number of chunks-b>,
     'estimated docs per chunk': <count-b>/<number of chunks-b>
   }
   ---
   Totals
   {
     data: <stats.size>,
     docs: <stats.count>,
     chunks: <calc total chunks>,
     Shard shard01: [ <estDataPercent-a> % data, <estDocPercent-a> % docs in cluster, stats.shards[ <shard-a> ].avgObjSize avg obj size on shard ],
     Shard shard02: [ <estDataPercent-b> % data, <estDocPercent-b> % docs in cluster, stats.shards[ <shard-b> ].avgObjSize avg obj size on shard ]
   }

The output information displays:

- ``<shard-x>`` is a string that holds the shard name.

- ``<host-x>`` is a string that holds the host name(s).

- ``<size-x>`` is a number that includes the size of the data,
  including the unit of measure (e.g. ``b``, ``Mb``).

- ``<count-x>`` is a number that reports the number of
  documents in the shard.

- ``<number of chunks-x>`` is a number that reports the
  number of chunks in the shard.

- ``<size-x>/<number of chunks-x>`` is a calculated value
  that reflects the estimated data size per chunk for the shard,
  including the unit of measure (e.g. ``b``, ``Mb``).

- ``<count-x>/<number of chunks-x>`` is a calculated value
  that reflects the estimated number of documents per chunk for the
  shard.

- ``<stats.size>`` is a value that reports the total size of
  the data in the sharded collection, including the unit of measure.

- ``<stats.count>`` is a value that reports the total number
  of documents in the sharded collection.

- ``<calc total chunks>`` is a calculated number that reports the
  number of chunks from all shards, for example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     <calc total chunks> = <number of chunks-a> + <number of chunks-b>

- ``<estDataPercent-x>`` is a calculated value that
  reflects, for each shard, the data size as the percentage of the
  collection's total data size, for example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     <estDataPercent-x> = <size-x>/<stats.size>

- ``<estDocPercent-x>`` is a calculated value that
  reflects, for each shard, the number of documents as the
  percentage of the total number of documents for the collection,
  for example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     <estDocPercent-x> = <count-x>/<stats.count>

- ``stats.shards[ <shard-x> ].avgObjSize`` is a number that
  reflects the average object size, including the unit of measure,
  for the shard.
