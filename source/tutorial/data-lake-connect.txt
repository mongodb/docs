This part of the tutorial will walk you through connecting to your
{+data-lake-short+} using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this part of the tutorial, you will need to have completed:

- **Part 1:** :doc:`Upload sample data to your S3 bucket </tutorial/data-lake-sample-data>`
- **Part 2:** :doc:`/tutorial/data-lake-deploy`

Whitelist Your Connection IP Address
------------------------------------

.. note::

   If your IP is already whitelisted and you created a MongoDB
   user, you can skip to :ref:`data-lake-connect`.

*Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

An :abbr:`IP address (Internet Protocal address)` is a unique numeric
identifier for a device connecting to a network. Within |service|, you
can create a list of trusted IP addresses that can connect to your
{+data-lake-short+} and access your data. |service| only allows connections
to a {+data-lake-short+} from addresses listed in the IP whitelist.

Create a MongoDB User for Your {+data-lake-short+}
--------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   If your IP is already whitelisted and you created a MongoDB
   user, you can skip to :ref:`data-lake-connect`.

*Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

You must create a MongoDB user to access your deployment. For security
purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB users
to access {+data-lake-short+}s.

To add a MongoDB user to your cluster:

   For information on configuring additional MongoDB users on your
   cluster, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users/`.

Connect to Your {+data-lake-short+} Using the ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------------------------------------------

Connecting to your {+data-lake-short+} depends on whether
you have the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell installed:

   tabs:

     - id: installed
       name: "Installed"
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/data-lake-shell-installed.rst

     - id: not-installed
       name: "Not Installed"
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/data-lake-shell-not-installed.rst
