   * - Metric
  
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Asserts`
  
     - Displays the following information:

       - :guilabel:`regular` displays the average rate of 
         regular asserts raised per second over the selected sample 
         period. 
        
       - :guilabel:`warning` displays the average rate of 
         warnings per second over the selected sample period.
        
       - :guilabel:`msg` displays the average rate of message 
         asserts per second over the selected sample period. These 
         internal server errors have a well-defined text string. 
         |service| logs stack traces for these.
       
       - :guilabel:`user` displays the average rate of user 
         asserts per second over the selected sample period. This 
         metric includes asserts that a user generates, such as out of 
         disk space or duplicate key errors.
     
       Monitor asserts to track how many errors occur while trying to 
       read or write data. Check the server logs to identify the source 
       of any errors.
   
   * - :guilabel:`Avg Object Size`
     
     - Displays the average object size across all collections in the 
       database.

       Monitor object size to track the size of your objects and better 
       understand your database space.

   * - :guilabel:`Background Flush Avg`
    
     - Displays the average time of background flushes in seconds. 	
       |mongod| writes to and flushes (fsyncs) journal 
       files immediately. By default, all other data files are flushed 
       every 60 seconds in the background.
       
       Monitor the background flush average to determine whether this 
       statistic is a significant percentage of 60 seconds. If so, this 
       statistic could indicate that the server is bottlenecked on 
       these writes. You might have a large number of random writes 
       occurring. The operating system might flush data faster than 
       every 60 seconds. In that case, this statistic will be a very 
       small value even if the writing is a bottleneck.

   * - :guilabel:`Catalog`

     - Displays the following information:
     
       - :guilabel:`total databases` displays the total number of 
         non-system databases.
       
       - :guilabel:`total collections` displays the total number of 
         collections across all non-system databases.

       - :guilabel:`total views` displays the total number of views 
         across all non-system databases.

       - :guilabel:`total indexes` displays the total number of indexes 
         across all non-system collections.
      
       Monitor catalog counts to prevent an excessive number of 
       databases, collections, views, or indexes from causing startup 
       failures.

   * - :guilabel:`Collections`

     - Displays the number of collections in the database.
     
       Monitor collections to determine restart times, continuous 
       backup performance, and stability.

   * - :guilabel:`Connections`

     - Displays the total number of active connections to the 
       deployment.

       Monitor connections to determine whether the current connection 
       limits are sufficient.
  
   * - :guilabel:`Cursors`

     - Displays the following information:
     
       - :guilabel:`totalOpen` displays the number of cursors that the 
         server is maintaining for clients. Since MongoDB exhausts 
         unused cursors, this value is usually small or zero. However, 
         if there is a queue, stale tailable cursors, or a large number 
         of operations, this value might rise.
        
       - :guilabel:`timedOut` displays the average rate of cursors 
         that have timed out per second over the selected sample period.
  
       Monitor cursors to close unnecessary cursors and reduce the 
       timeout configuration in the application.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Size`

     - Displays the actual size of the data files in the database.
   
       Monitor data size to ensure that database is not using too much 
       memory or CPU.

       - :guilabel:`dataSize` displays the amount 
         of storage space in bytes that your stored data uses.

       - :guilabel:`indexSize` displays the sum total 
         size in bytes of the index data across all databases.
  
       Monitor storage space to determine whether to manually increase 
       the disk size.

       Monitor free disk space to determine whether to use disk 
       auto-scaling or manually increase the disk size.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk Space Percent Free`

     - Displays the total amount of free space remaining on disk as a 
       percentage of the total disk space.

         act as swap space.

       - :guilabel:`mapped` displays the number of MMAPv1 memory maps 
         of all the data files. This number is likely similar to your 
         total database(s) size. WiredTiger does not use memory mapped 
         files, so this should be 0.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-memory.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Network`

     - Displays the following information:
     
       - :guilabel:`bytesIn` displays the average rate of physical

       other than memory mapping files use excessive memory. For 
       example, this could indicate too many connections to the 
       database. Each connection has a thread stack and the memory for 
       those stacks can add up to a considerable amount. Keep this

         and waiting for any lock. 

       - :guilabel:`readers` displays the number of operations queued 
         and waiting for a read lock.

       - :guilabel:`writers` displays the number of operation queued 
         and waiting for a write lock.

       Monitor queues to identify potential issues and bottlenecks.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Targeting`

     - Displays the efficiency of read operations run on MongoDB:

     - Displays :guilabel:`spill to disk during sort`, 
       the total number of writes to disk caused by 
       :pipeline:`$sort` stages.

       A high :guilabel:`spill to disk during sort` 
       number might be due to resource-intensive queries 
       that are performing a :term:`collection scan` and are using a 
       ``$sort`` stage. These resource-intensive queries result in temporary 
       file creation that exceed available memory and utilize disk 
       pace for sorting. :ref:`Identify offending queries
       <analyze-slow-queries>` by looking for 
       collection scans with a ``$sort`` stage around the same 
       time the database experiences an increase in disk usage.

         physical bytes that the network interface transmits per second.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-reset-system-network-bytes-out.rst

       - :guilabel:`max network bytes in` displays the maximum network 
         bytes in values over the time period that the metric 
         granularity specifies.

       - :guilabel:`max network bytes out` displays the maximum network 
         bytes out values over the time period that the metric 
         granularity specifies. 
   
       Monitor network metrics to track network performance.
