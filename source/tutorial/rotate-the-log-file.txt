===================
Rotate the Log File
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Log rotation archives the current log file and starts a new log. Log
rotation archives the current log and appends the file name with a
timestamp. The timestamp is expressed in UTC (GMT) and formatted as ISO,
using dashes instead of colons. MongoDB continues logging in a *new*
file that uses the original name of the archived file. Log rotation
occurs when the :program:`mongod` ends or explicitly by command. For
more information on logging, see :ref:`monitoring-standard-loggging`.

As an example, the following steps will create and rotate a log file:

1. Start a :program:`mongod` with verbose logging, with appending
   enabled, and with the following log file:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log --logappend

#. In a separate terminal, list the matching files:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*

   For results, you get:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      server1.log

#. Rotate the log file using *one* of the following methods.

   - From the :program:`mongo` shell, issue the :dbcommand:`logRotate`
     command from the ``admin`` database:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        use admin
        db.runCommand( { logRotate : 1 } )

   - From the UNIX shell, rotate logs for a single process by issuing
     the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        kill -SIGUSR1 <mongod process id>

   - From the UNIX shell, rotate logs for all :program:`mongod`
     processes on a machine by issuing the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        killall -SIGUSR1 mongod

   - On Windows, use the :program:`mongo` shell from the Windows command
     line by using a JavaScript command file to issue the
     :dbcommand:`logRotate` command.

#. List the matching files again:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*

   For results you get something similar to the following. The
   timestamps will be different.

   .. code-block:: none

      server1.log  server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00

   The example results indicate a log rotation performed at exactly
   ``11:30 pm`` on ``November 24th, 2011 UTC``, which is the local time
   offset by the local time zone. The original log file is the one with
   the timestamp. The new log is ``server1.log`` file.

   If another logRotate command were given an hour later, then an additional
   file would appear when listing matching files, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: none

      server1.log  server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00  server1.log.2011-11-25T00-30-00

   The ``server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00`` file is unchanged from
   before, while ``server1.log.2011-11-25T00-30-00`` is the previous
   ``server1.log`` file, renamed. The ``server1.log`` is the new empty
   file that will receive new log output.
