Overview
--------

Atlas App Services allows you to upgrade your shared tier cluster (**M0**, **M2**, and
**M5**) to a dedicated cluster. Upgrade your cluster before releasing an Atlas Device Sync
application by completing the following steps.

.. note::

   Using a shared tier cluster on a production application is not recommended.
   To avoid data loss, upgrade to a dedicated tier cluster before releasing your
   application.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Shut Down All Running Emulators

      Before upgrading your cluster, end any client application's Sync Connection.
      To do this, shut down all emulators, simulators, and terminals that are running
      your realm application.


   .. step:: Terminate Atlas Device Sync

      To terminate Atlas Device Sync, follow the instructions for :ref:`Terminating Atlas Device Sync
      <terminating-realm-sync>`.


   .. step:: Upgrade Your Cluster

      Click the :guilabel:`Upgrade` green button under the :guilabel:`Enhance Your
      Experience` heading of the :guilabel:`Data Services` tab.
