Overview
--------

{+framework-core+} allows you to work with data in your application without
explicitly running database commands. To query your data, use the
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax. LINQ allows you to write strongly typed
queries using C#-specific keywords and operators. When you run the application,
the {+provider-short+} automatically translates the LINQ queries and runs them on the
database using the MongoDB Query API.

In this guide you can see examples of common query operations on
an application configured to use the {+provider-short+}.

.. tip::

   To learn how to configure an application to use the {+provider-short+}, see
   :ref:`entity-framework-configure`.

Find Entities
-------------

Find a single entity by using the ``FirstOrDefault()`` method, or find
multiple entities by using the ``Where()`` method.


.. _entity-framework-find-one:

Find a Single Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FirstOrDefault()`` method returns the first entity it finds in your collection that
matches the search criteria, and returns ``null`` if no matching entities
are found.

The following code uses the ``FirstOrDefault()`` method to find a planet with
the ``name`` field of "Mercury" from a ``DBSet`` called ``Planets`` and prints
the planet name to the console:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-find-one
   :end-before: // end-find-one
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. _entity-framework-find-multiple:

Find Multiple Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``Where()`` method to retrieve multiple entities from your
collections. ``Where()`` returns all entities that match the search
criteria.

The following code uses the ``Where()`` method to find all planets that have the
``hasRings`` field set to ``true`` and prints the planet names to the console.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-find-many
   :end-before: // end-find-many
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. _entity-framework-sort:

Sort Entities
-------------

Use the ``OrderBy()`` method to specify an order in which to return entities
from a query. ``OrderBy()`` sorts the elements in ascending order based on a
specified sort criteria.

The following code uses the ``OrderBy()`` method to find all planets and sort
them by the value of the ``orderFromSun`` field in ascending order. It then
prints the results to the console.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: csharp

      var planetList = db.Planets.OrderBy(p => p.orderFromSun);
    
      foreach (var p in planetList)
      {
         Console.WriteLine(p.name);
      }

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      Mercury
      Venus
      Earth
      Mars
      Jupiter
      Saturn
      Uranus
      Neptune

.. tip:: Sort in Descending Order

   You can sort the results of a query in descending order by using the
   ``OrderByDescending()`` method.

You can perform a secondary sort on your query by using the ``ThenBy()`` method. The
``ThenBy()`` method sorts the results of the ``OrderBy()`` method in ascending
order based on a specified sort criteria. The ``ThenBy()`` method should be
chained to the ``OrderBy()`` method.

.. tip:: Secondary Sort in Descending Order

   You can perform a secondary sort in descending order by using the
   ``ThenByDescending()`` method.

The following code uses the ``OrderBy()`` and ``ThenBy()`` methods to find all
planets and sort them by the ``hasRings()`` field, with a secondary sort
on the ``name`` field.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: csharp

      var planetList = db.Planets.OrderBy(o => o.hasRings).ThenBy(o => o.name);
    
      foreach (var p in planetList)
      {
         Console.WriteLine("Has rings: " + p.hasRings + ", Name: " + p.name);
      }

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      Has rings: False, Name: Earth
      Has rings: False, Name: Mars
      Has rings: False, Name: Mercury
      Has rings: False, Name: Venus
      Has rings: True, Name: Jupiter
      Has rings: True, Name: Neptune
      Has rings: True, Name: Saturn
      Has rings: True, Name: Uranus

.. tip::

   When sorting on fields with a boolean value, entities with a field value of
   ``false`` show before those with a value of ``true``.
