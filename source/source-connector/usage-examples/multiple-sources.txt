   :description: Configure a MongoDB Kafka source connector to listen for change events on multiple collections and publish them to a Kafka topic using aggregation pipelines.

This usage example demonstrates how to configure a {+source-connector+}
to listen for change events on multiple MongoDB collections, and
publish them to a Kafka topic.

If you need your connector to listen for change events on a more particular
set of databases and collections, you can use a **pipeline**. A pipeline is a
MongoDB aggregation pipeline composed of instructions to the database to
filter or transform data. See the next section for examples of how to
configure your connector ``pipeline`` setting to match multiple database and
collection names using a regular expression.

.. note::

   The ``database`` and ``collection`` configuration settings also affect
   which databases and collections on which the connector listens for change
   events. To learn more about these settings, see the
   :ref:`<source-configuration-mongodb-connection>` guide.

Examples
--------

The following examples show you how to use an aggregation pipeline to select
specific database or collection names on which to listen for change events.

Include Change Events from Multiple Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define an aggregation pipeline to select only change events on
multiple databases by specifying the following in the ``pipeline``
setting:

- A ``$match`` aggregation operator
- The ``ns.db``, field which identifies the database part of the namespace
- The ``$regex`` operator and a regular expression that matches the database
  names

The following sample configuration shows how you can set your source connector
to listen for change events on the ``sandbox`` and ``firewall`` databases:

.. code-block:: ini

   pipeline=[{"$match": {"ns.db": {"$regex": "/^(sandbox|firewall)$/"}}}]

Exclude Change Events from Multiple Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define an aggregation pipeline to ignore change events on
multiple collections by specifying the following in the ``pipeline``
setting:

- A ``$match`` aggregation operator
- The ``ns.coll`` field, which identifies the collection part of the namespace
- The ``$regex`` operator and a regular expression that matches the
  collection names
- The ``$not`` operator which instructs the enclosing ``$regex`` operator to
  match everything the regular expression does not match

The following sample configuration shows how you can set your source connector
to filter out change events that originate from all collections named
"hyperspace" in any database:

.. code-block:: ini

   pipeline=[{"$match": {"ns.coll": {"$regex": {"$not": "/^hyperspace$/"}}}}]
