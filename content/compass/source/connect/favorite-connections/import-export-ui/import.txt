You can import saved connections in |compass|. This lets you use saved 
connections from other workspaces or connections used by other team members.

Prerequisite
------------

Before you import saved connections, you must :ref:`export the
connections <compass-export-connections-ui>`.

Procedure
---------

To import saved connections from a JSON file into |compass-short|:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: On the Connect screen, hover over :guilabel:`Saved Connections` 
      in the left-side navigation and click the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` 
      button.

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Import saved connections`.

   .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Source File`, click :guilabel:`Select a file`. 
        
   .. step:: Select the exported JSON file you want to import.

   .. step:: If your file is encrypted with a password, enter the passphrase 
      under :guilabel:`Decryption Password`.
    
   .. step:: Select the connection names you want to import. 
    
      If the connection name already exists under your saved connections, 
      |compass-short| overwrites the existing connection with the imported 
      connection.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Import`.
        
Results
-------

After the connections are imported, they appear on the left-side 
navigation of the Connect screen under :guilabel:`Saved Connections`.
