The |service| |api| follows the principles of the |rest| architectural
style to expose a number of internal resources which enable
programmatic access to |service|'s features.

As with changes made through the |service| web interface, changes made
through the |api| are subject to |service| :doc:`billing </billing>`.
If you incur charges, you must have a valid credit card on file with
|service| or risk having your account locked.

The |api| has the following features:

|json| entities
  All entities are expressed in |json|.

Key-based access
  Each |service| user or application needing to connect to |service|
  must :doc:`generate an API key <configure-api-access>` before
  accessing the |service| |api|.

Digest authentication
  To ensure that your |api| key is never sent over the
  network, |api| requests are authenticated using
  `HTTP Digest Authentication`_.

Browsable interface
  Using a consistent linking mechanism, you can browse the entire |api|
  by starting at the root resource and following links to related
  resources.

|https|-Only
  You can only access the |api| via |https|, ensuring all
  data sent over the network is fully encrypted using |tls|.

User Access Control
  Each |service| user's |api| capabilities match the permissions
  granted by their |service| :ref:`user-roles`.

  .. example::

     A user with the :authrole:`Project Read Only` in a |service|
     project cannot modify any resource within that project whether
     through the |service| UI or the |api|.

|api| Network Access List
  The |service| secures access to its |api| through an
  :ref:`access list <enable-api-access-list>`. This list restricts
  access to the |api| to specific IP or |cidr| addresses. Each
  :doc:`Programmatic API Key </reference/api/apiKeys>` has its own
  |api| access list. Each |api| Key must make any |api| requests from
  an IP address on the |api| access list.

  .. seealso:: :doc:`Configure Atlas API Access </configure-api-access>`

|http| Methods
--------------

All resources support a subset of these common |http| Methods:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Method
     - Purpose

   * - ``GET``
     - Retrieve the |json| representation of a resource.

   * - ``POST``
     - Create a new resource using the provided |json| representation.

   * - ``PUT``
     - Replace a resource with the provided |json| representation.

   * - ``PATCH``
     - Update the specified fields in a resource using the provided
       |json| representation.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - Remove a resource.

   * - ``HEAD``
     - Returns the response header without the |json| representation of
       the resource.

|json|
------

All entities are represented in |json|. The following rules and
conventions apply:

- **Content Type Request Header**

  When sending |json| to the server via ``POST`` or ``PUT``, make sure
  to specify the correct content type request header: ``Content-Type:
  application/json``

- **Invalid Fields**

  Invalid fields are *rejected* rather than *ignored*. If, for example,
  you attempt to create a new entity and misspell one of the fields, or
  if you attempt to update an existing entity and include a field that
  cannot be modified, the server responds with a 400 status code and an
  error message stating which field was invalid.

- **ISO-8601-Formatted Dates**

  All dates are returned as `ISO-8601`_-formatted strings designated in
  UTC. When sending dates to the server (i.e., as query parameters or
  fields in ``POST`` or ``PATCH`` request entities), use
  ISO-8601-formatted dates. If you do not specify a time zone, UTC is
  assumed. However, it is highly recommended that you include a time
  zone designator to avoid any ambiguity.

- **BSON Timestamps**

  In some cases, a timestamp is returned as a `BSON timestamp`_, most
  notably in the backup resources. These are represented in |json|
  documents as an object with two fields: ``date``, which is an
  ISO-8601-formatted date string in UTC with granularity to the second,
  and ``increment`` a 32-bit integer.

- **Field Names for Fields with Numbers**

  Fields that contain numeric values in a particular unit will be named
  so as to disambiguate the unit being used.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, a host's uptime is returned in milliseconds, so the name of
     the host entity field is ``uptimeMsec``.

- **Empty Fields**

  Fields that do not have a current value are returned with an
  appropriate default value.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, |service| will not have any statistics for a newly
     discovered host, so any statistics-related fields will have a value of
     zero.

  Fields that do not have a sensible default value are omitted from the
  entity.

  .. FUTURE: add an example to above para similar to the one in the
     Cloud/Ops docs:
     For example, a host that is not using authentication will omit the
     ``username`` field from the returned entity.

- **Field Order**

  The fields in the |json| documents returned by the server are in no
  particular order, and the order may change. Do not depend on the
  order of the fields.

.. _api-linking:

Linking
-------

Each resource includes one or more links to sub-resources and/or
related resources. Links are placed in the ``links`` field of an
entity, which is an array of link relation objects. Each link relation
has two fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``rel``
     - Name (or type) of the relation. Many of these are considered
       Extension Relation Types and are prefixed by
       ``http://mms.mongodb.com``.

   * - ``href``
     - The target |url|.

All entities include at least one link relation called ``self``, which
is simply its own |url|. When an entity is part of a list, then it only
includes the ``self`` link relation.

.. FUTURE: Add an example similar to the example in the Cloud/Ops docs.

For more information, refer to the `Web Linking Specification
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288>`_. Note that although the
specification describes a format for including links in the |http|
response headers, doing so is not a requirement. To make the |api|
easily browsable, it includes the links in the response body rather
than in the response headers.

.. _api-lists:

Lists
-----

Some resources return a list of entities. When a list of entities is
expected in a response, the results are returned in batches bounded by
the following query parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``pageNum``
     - Page number (1-based). Defaults to ``1`` if not specified.

   * - ``itemsPerPage``
     - Number of items to return per page, up to a maximum of 500.
       Defaults to ``100`` if not specified.

   * - ``includeCount``
     - Specifies whether the response returns the ``totalCount`` field.
       Defaults to ``true`` if not specified. 

The response entity contains three fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``totalCount``
     - The total number of items in the entire result set.

   * - ``results``
     - The result set, which is an array of entity documents.

   * - ``links``
     - Contains one to three link relations: ``previous`` for the
       previous page of results (omitted for the first page); ``next``
       for the next page of results (omitted for the last page); and
       ``self`` for the current page (always present).

If you make a request for a list of entities and there are no results,
then the |api| responds with a 200 status code and the ``results``
array is empty. It does *not* respond with a 404 in this case, since
the list of entities may not be empty at some point in the future.
However, if you request a list of entities in a context that does not
exist (e.g., the list of hosts for a non-existent project), then this
*does* result in a 404 response status.

.. FUTURE: Add an example similar to the example in the Cloud/Ops docs.

.. _api-envelope:

Envelopes
---------

Some clients might not be able to access the |http| response headers
and/or status code. In that case, you can request that the response
include an "envelope," which is simply an extra layer of information in
the |json| document and contains any relevant details that would
normally be in the response headers. By default, the |api| does *not*
include the response in an envelope. To request one, simply add the
query parameter ``envelope=true``.

For responses that contain a single entity, the envelope contains two
fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``status``
     - The |http| status code.

   * - ``content``
     - The requested entity.

For responses that contain a list of entities, there is already an
envelope that wraps the results, so specifying ``envelope=true`` only
adds the ``status`` field to the existing envelope.

Pretty Printing
---------------

By default, extraneous whitespace is stripped from the |json| returned
by the server. To ask for pretty-printed |json|, simply append the
``pretty=true`` query parameter to any request:

.. code-block:: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   curl --user '{USERNAME}:{APIKEY}' --digest \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --include \
     --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v1.0?pretty=true"

Response Codes
--------------

Responses use the standard |http| response codes, including:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 20 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Code
     - Meaning
     - Notes

   * - 200
     - OK
     - The request was successful. This is typically the response to a
       successful ``GET`` request.

   * - 201
     - Created
     - A new resource was created. This is typically the response to a
       successful ``POST`` request.

   * - 202
     - Accepted
     - A request for an asynchronous operation was accepted.

   * - 400
     - Bad Request
     - Something was wrong with the client request.

   * - 401
     - Unauthorized
     - Authentication is required but was not present in the request.
       Typically this means that the digest authentication information
       was omitted from the request, the provided credentials are
       incorrect, or the user associated with the given |api| key is
       not allowed to access the requested resource.

   * - 403
     - Forbidden
     - Access to the specified resource is not permitted.

   * - 404
     - Not Found
     - The requested resource does not exist.

   * - 405
     - Method Not Allowed
     - The |http| method is not supported for the specified resource.
       Keep in mind that each resource may only support a subset of |http| methods.

       .. example::
          You cannot ``DELETE`` the root resource.

   * - 409
     - Conflict
     - This is typically the response to a request to create or modify
       a property of an entity that is unique when an existing entity
       already exists with the same value for that property.

   * - 5xx
     - Various server errors
     - Something unexpected went wrong. Try again later and consider
       notifying |service| Support.

Errors
------

When a request results in an error, the response body contains a
document with additional details about what went wrong. The document
contains three fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``error``
     - The error code, which is simply the |http| status code.

   * - ``reason``
     - A short description of the error, which is simply the |http|
       status phrase.

   * - ``detail``
     - A more detailed description of the error.

.. FUTURE: Add an example similar to the example in the Cloud/Ops docs.

.. _group-id:
.. _project-id:

Project ID
----------

Your Project ID is a string value that uniquely identifies a
|service| project.

|service| projects were previously identified as "groups". Some
|service| endpoints reference ``group`` or ``{GROUP-ID}`` as part of
the request path, query, or body parameters. For any endpoint that
requires your ``{GROUP-ID}``, specify your Project ID instead.

To retrieve your project ID:

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-project-id.rst

.. _api-authentication:

Authentication
--------------

As previously mentioned, the |service| |api| uses |http| Digest
Authentication. The details of digest authentication are beyond the
scope of this document. Digest authentication requires a username and a
password. The |service| hashes these values using a unique value called
a **nonce**. The |api| public key serves as the username. Its
corresponding |api| private key serves as the password.

Keep the following points in mind:

- The |service|-generated nonce is used by the client to hash the
  username and password before sending them back to the |service| to
  authenticate a request. The nonce is only valid for a short amount of
  time as per the digest authentication specification. This is to
  prevent replay attacks, so you can't cache a nonce and use it
  forever.

- Using digest authentication with |https| adds an extra layer of
  security. The |api| request never sends the password  to the
  |service|.

- Some resource require additional security. These resources deny
  access to any request not made from an IP address on an |api| access
  list. Each organization may have one or more |api| keys, each with
  their own |api| access list. An |api| key can access an |api|
  resource only from an IP address on its |api| access list.

- |service| roles limit which operations an |api| key can perform. The
  |api| resources enforce the same privileges. The resources and
  methods that an |api| key use the same roles as |a-service| user.

- |service| binds many resources to a project. Many |api| resource
  |url|\s follow the format of ``/api/atlas/v1.0/groups/<GROUP-ID>/``.
  For these resources, the |api| key must be a member of the
  organization that hosts the project. Otherwise, the |service|
  responds with a :httpstat:`401` error.

.. _api-rate-limiting:

Rate Limiting
-------------

Certain resources limit how many requests they can process per minute.

For these resources, |service| allows up to 100 requests per minute
*per project*. |api| keys belong to an organization, but can be granted
access multiple projects.

.. example::

   Consider two users: A and B. User A belongs to project X, and user B
   belongs to projects X and Y.

   - At 1:00:00pm, User A makes 50 requests to a rate limited resource
     in project X, all of which are complete by 1:00:20pm.

   - At 1:00:30pm, User B attempts to make 60 requests to a rate
     limited resource in project X.

     Since User A has already used up 50 requests within the 1:00pm
     minute for project X, the last 10 requests User B attempts to make
     are rejected.

     However, User B can make requests to a rate limited resource in
     project Y, since each project maintains a separate request
     counter.

   - At 1:01:00pm, requests to project X may proceed, because the
     request counter used for rate limiting resets each minute.

If you exceed the rate limit, the |api| returns a :httpstat:`429` (Too
Many Requests) |http| status code.
