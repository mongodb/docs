title: "Update your ``MongoDBMulti`` custom resource to enable X509 authentication."
level: 4
content: |

   :ref:`Update your MongoDB multi-cluster resource <k8s-edit-database-resource>`
   with :ref:`security settings <security-settings>` from the |k8s-op-short|
   MongoDB resource specification. Add the ``internalCluster`` setting,
   under ``spec.authentication``, and set it to ``"X509"``. The resulting
   configuration should look as follows:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
      kind: MongoDBMulti
      metadata:
       name: multi-replica-set
      spec:
       version: 4.4.0-ent
       type: ReplicaSet
       persistent: false
       duplicateServiceObjects: true
       credentials: my-credentials
       opsManager:
         configMapRef:
           name: my-project
       security:
         tls:
           ca: custom-ca
         certsSecretPrefix: <prefix>
       authentication:
         enabled: true
         modes: ["X509"]
         agents: 
           mode: "X509"
         internalCluster: "X509"
       clusterSpecList:
         clusterSpecs:
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}
           members: 3
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}
           members: 2
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_3_FULL_NAME}
           members: 3

   The |k8s-op-short| copies the ConfigMap with the |certauth| created in
   the central cluster to each member cluster, generates a concatenated
   |pem| secret, and distributes it to the member clusters.
