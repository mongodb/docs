.. important:: Flutter SDK v2.0.0 Breaking Change to Generated Files

    Flutter SDK version 2.0.0 introduces an update to the 
    builder, which impacts how files generate. In v2.0.0 and later, all 
    generated files use the ``.realm.dart`` naming convention instead of ``.g.dart``. 

    This is a breaking change for existing apps. For information on how to upgrade an existing app from an earlier SDK version to v2.0.0 or later, 
    refer to :ref:`flutter-upgrade-v2`.
