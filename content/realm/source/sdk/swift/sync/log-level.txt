You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

.. versionchanged:: 10.39.0: Deprecated in favor of Realm Logger

.. warning::

   This page shows how to set a Sync client log level in Realm Swift SDK
   versions 10.38.3 and earlier. Realm Swift SDK v10.39.0 supersedes this 
   logging implementation with a Realm logger you can set and configure. 
   For information on how to set a Realm logger in a later 
   version, refer to :ref:`swift-logging`.

Set the Sync Log Level
----------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can set the Device Sync client log level on the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncManager
      <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` instance on your
      :swift-sdk:`App <Extensions/App.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-log-level-deprecated.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can set the Device Sync client log level on the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncManager <Classes/RLMSyncManager.html>` instance
      on your :objc-sdk:`RLMApp <Classes/RLMApp.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-log-level.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip::

   See :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncLogLevel <Enums/RLMSyncLogLevel.html>` for a
   description of each available log level. Note that more logging can
   negatively affect performance.

Set a Custom Logger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pipe Device Sync logs to a custom logger by setting the ``logger`` 
property on the ``SyncManager``. You must set this property before you 
open any synced realms.

If you do not specify this property, the Realm Swift SDK outputs log strings
to Apple System Logger.
