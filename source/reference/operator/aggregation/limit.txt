Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $limit

   Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the
   :term:`pipeline`.

   The :pipeline:`$limit` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $limit: <positive integer> }

   :pipeline:`$limit` takes a positive integer that specifies the
   maximum number of documents to pass along.

Behavior
--------

Using $limit with Sorted Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using the :pipeline:`$limit` stage with any of:

- the :pipeline:`$sort` aggregation stage,
- the :method:`~cursor.sort()` method, or
- the ``sort`` field to the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command or the
  :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` shell method.

be sure that you are performing a *stable sort* before passing results
to the :pipeline:`$limit` stage. A stable sort ensures that the sort
order of returned documents remains the same across multiple executions
of the same sort; especially important when used with the
:pipeline:`$limit` stage.

See the following for more information on each:

- :ref:`Stable sorting with $sort (aggregation)
  <sort-aggregation-stable-sorting>`
- :ref:`Stable sorting with the sort() method
  <sort-cursor-stable-sorting>`
- :ref:`Stable sorting with the findAndModify command
  <findandmodify-command-stable-sorting>`
- :ref:`Stable sorting with the findAndModify() method
  <findandmodify-method-stable-sorting>`

Example
-------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.article.aggregate([
      { $limit : 5 }
   ]);

This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it
by the pipeline. :pipeline:`$limit` has no effect on the content
of the documents it passes.
