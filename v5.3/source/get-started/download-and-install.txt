   .. step:: Install Dependencies
    
      Ensure you have `JDK version 8 or later
      <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__ installed
      in your development environment.

      This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using 
      Maven or Gradle in an integrated development environment (IDE). We
      recommend that you use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE. An IDE
      makes it more convenient to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run
      your project.

      If you are not using an IDE, see
      `Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
      or
      `Creating New Gradle Builds
      <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
      for more information about how to set up your project. See `The MongoDB
      Reactive Streams Driver
      <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-driver-reactivestreams>`__
      to download the driver
      and dependencies directly from Maven.

   .. step:: Install the Project Reactor Library

      This guide uses methods from the Reactor library, a library based on the
      Reactive Streams specification. 
      
      Open a new Maven or Gradle project in your IDE. If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the 
      following snippet to your ``pom.xml``:

      .. code-block:: xml

        <dependencyManagement> 
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                    <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
                    <version>2023.0.7</version>
                    <type>pom</type>
                    <scope>import</scope>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </dependencyManagement>

      Then, add the following to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

          <dependencies>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                  <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId> 
              </dependency>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                  <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId> 
                  <scope>test</scope>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
      
      To install Reactor using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, see `Getting Reactor
      <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#getting>`__ in the
      Project Reactor documentation.

      After you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.

   .. step:: Install the {+driver-short+}

      In your project, if you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the following to
      your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                <artifactId>mongodb-driver-reactivestreams</artifactId>
                <version>{+full-version+}</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

      If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
      ``build.gradle`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: groovy
        
          dependencies {
            implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-reactivestreams:{+full-version+}'
          }
      
      After you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.
      
After you complete these steps, you have a new project 
and the driver dependencies installed.
