You can restore a backup snapshot for a |mms| deployment to an
|service| deployment and let |service| handle the complexities of deploying,
managing, and healing deployments on the AWS, Azure, and Google cloud
platforms. See `<https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/tutorial/restore-deployment-to-atlas>`_
for more information and instructions.

.. note::

   Your |service| cluster must use M10 or larger instance nodes. Shared Cluster
   Tier deployments do not support restoring snapshots from |mms| clusters.

   You cannot restore a |mms| backup snapshot to an |service| deployment
   with :doc:`Encryption at Rest </security-aws-kms>` enabled.
