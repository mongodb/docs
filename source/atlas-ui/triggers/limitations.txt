There are several guidelines to keep in mind when architecting how your tools
and clients interact with MongoDB through Triggers. Keep this guidance in mind
when deciding how to structure queries, selecting which CRUD and aggregation
operations to use, and determining how to handle concurrent workloads.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

Triggers support all :manual:`aggregation pipeline stages
</reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in :ref:`system functions
<atlas-system-functions>` except for ``$currentOp`` and ``$indexStats``.

For security reasons, only a subset of aggregation pipeline stages are
supported in :ref:`user functions <atlas-user-functions>`.

For a list of pipeline stages that are available and their allowed function
context, see :ref:`Aggregation <mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-aggregation>`.

Batch Loading
-------------

When data is bulk/batch loaded into MongoDB |service|, you may see a delay in
data appearing on devices while |service| processes changes.

.. _atlas-time-series-limitation:

Time Series Collections
-----------------------

You *cannot* define :ref:`Database Triggers <atlas-database-trigger>` on a :manual:`time series collections
</core/timeseries-collections/>`. This is because time series collections do not
yet support :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`.

{+Serverless-Instances+}
--------------------

You *cannot* define :ref:`Database Triggers <atlas-database-trigger>` on a :manual:`{+Serverless-instance+}
<serverless-caveats>`. This is because {+Serverless-instances+} do not support :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`.

Federated Database Instances
----------------------------

You *cannot* define :ref:`Database Triggers <atlas-database-trigger>` on a :manual:`{+fdi+}
<data-federation-caveats>`. This is because {+fdi+}s do not
support :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`.

.. _atlas-service-limitations-change-streams:

Change Streams
--------------

|service| limits the total number of change streams open against a given
cluster based on the cluster's size. The following table lists
the limitations for each cluster size:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Cluster Size
     - Maximum Number of Change Streams

   * - Free Tier (``M0``)
     - 5

   * - {+Flex-Clusters+}
     - 10

   * - Shared Clusters (``M2``/``M5``)
     - 10

   * - Small, Dedicated Clusters (``M10``/``M20``)
     - 100

   * - Standard Clusters (``M30``/``M40``)
     - 1000

   * - Standard Clusters (``M50`` - ``M90``)
     - 1000

   * - High-Power Clusters (``M100+``)
     - 1000

.. note::

   |service| opens a single change stream on each collection that is
   associated with a :ref:`Database Trigger <atlas-database-trigger>`.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-database-commmands:
.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-database-commands:

Database Commands
-----------------

You can call a limited subset of database commands when connected to a
MongoDB cluster over the :manual:`wire protocol </reference/mongodb-wire-protocol>`. For a list of
supported commands, see :ref:`Database Commands
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-database-commands>`.

.. note::

   App Services does *not* support any database commands in |service| :ref:`Functions <atlas-system-functions>`.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-version-requirements:

MongoDB Version Requirements
----------------------------

You can access most of the CRUD and Aggregation functionality of MongoDB
version 3.6. However, Triggers do not support all operations and features
available in standard tools and clients. For a list of specific MongoDB
operations that are available when you connect to MongoDB through Triggers, see
:ref:`the CRUD & Aggregation API reference
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-query-options:

Query Options
-------------

Triggers support all query options in :ref:`system functions
<atlas-system-functions>`. For a list of specific options that are available when you
connect to MongoDB through Triggers, see :ref:`Query Options
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-query-options>`.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-query-results:

Query Results
-------------

MongoDB queries executed through Triggers can return a maximum of 50,000
documents. If you need to return more documents, consider paginating
your query.

.. _atlas-mongodb-service-limitations-request-traffic:

Request Traffic
---------------

|service| limits request traffic to the following defaults:

- 10,000 concurrent requests. Any requests made beyond
  the concurrent request limit receive an HTTP response status
  code of `429 - Too Many Requests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429>`_.

|service| can handle requests many times the above limits. However, these limits are
put in place to ensure applications scale responsibly and to prevent DOS attacks
and unintended billing charges.

You can request a higher limit by `filing a support ticket <https://support.mongodb.com/welcome>`__.

.. _atlas-connection_pooling:

Connection Pooling
------------------

|service| uses connection pooling to reduce the overhead of frequently
opening and closing connections between requests and Trigger executions.
Connections are opened as needed. Connection pooling is dependent on
several factors:

- Cluster Tier. The higher the cluster tier, the more connections available in
  the pool.
- Deployment Mode. Global deployments use multiple servers in each region, and
  therefore have an overall larger connection pool.
- Services. Each service has an independent connection pool, so the number of
  services in your app does not impact the number of connections available.
