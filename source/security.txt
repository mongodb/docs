Preconfigured Security Features
-------------------------------

|tls|
~~~~~

|cloudgov| and databases hosted in |cloudgov-short| use 
|tls| 1.2 to encrypt connections. This cannot be disabled.

Required Security Features
--------------------------

You *must* configure the following secruity features:

- :ref:`IP access list <allow-ip>`, and

- :ref:`Database user authentication <database-access>`.

Optional Security Features
--------------------------

A subset of commercial |service| 
:atlas:`optional security features </setup-cluster-security/#optional-security-features>` 
are available in |cloudgov-short| with some limitations.

Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must use KMS keys in |aws-fr-high| regions to encrypt data in 
  |aws-fr-high| region-only projects. You must use KMS keys in 
  |aws-fr-moderate| regions to encrypt data in |aws-fr-moderate| 
  region-only projects.

- |aws| is the only supported cloud provider for |cloudgov-short|.

See the |service| documentation to configure 
:atlas:`Customer Key Management with AWS KMS </security-aws-kms/>`.

|vpc| Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only peer |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only peer |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.

- |aws| is the only supported cloud provider for |cloudgov-short|.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Set up a Network Peering Connection </security-vpc-peering/>`

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only link |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only link |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.

- |aws| is the only supported cloud provider for |cloudgov-short|.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Set up a Private Endpoint </security-private-endpoint/>`.
