   :description: Learn how to use the C Driver to run a database command.
   :keywords: command, server, usage, code example

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a database command with the
{+driver-short+}. You can use database commands to perform a variety of
administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics,
initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Functions to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper functions for many database commands. We recommend
   using driver functions instead of executing database commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>` instead
   of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()`` method inside the
   shell is the preferred method to issue database commands, as it provides a
   consistent interface between the shell and drivers.

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, you must specify the command and any relevant
parameters in a BSON document, then pass this BSON document to a command
execution function. The {+driver-short+} provides the following functions to run
database commands:

- ``mongoc_client_command_simple()``, which runs a specified command on the
  server and stores the first document from the result in the ``reply`` BSON
  document. This function provides a simplified way to send a command directly
  to the server.
- ``mongoc_client_command_with_opts()``, which runs a specified command on the
  server and interprets ``opts`` according to the MongoDB server version. This
  function offers flexibilty by allowing additional options.

The following code shows how you can use the ``mongoc_client_command_simple()``
function to run the ``hello`` command, which returns information about the current
member's role in the replica set, on a database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/run-command.c
    :language: c
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-execute-command
    :end-before: end-execute-command

For a full list of database commands and corresponding parameters, see the
:ref:`Additional Information <c-addl-info-runcommand>` section.

Command Options
---------------

You can specify optional command behavior for the
``mongoc_client_command_with_opts()`` function. This function accepts a BSON
document for the ``opts`` parameter.

You can pass a BSON document that specifies the following options:

- ``readConcern``
- ``writeConcern``
- ``sessionId``
- ``collation``
- ``serverId``

To learn more about a command and the options that it accepts, locate the
command and follow the link in the :manual:`Database Commands
</reference/command/>` section of the Server manual.

The following code shows how to specify a ``grantRolesToUsers`` command with a
``majority`` write concern:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/run-command.c
    :language: c
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-execute-command-with-options
    :end-before: end-execute-command-with-options

.. note:: Read Preference

   The ``mongoc_client_command_simple()`` and
   ``mongoc_client_command_with_opts()`` functions ignore the read preference
   setting you might have set on your client. By default, these functions use
   the ``primary`` read preference.

   To specify a read preference other than the primary read preference, you must
   explicity pass it as an argument. The following code demonstrates how to
   specify a read preference and use it with the
   ``mongoc_client_command_simple()`` function:

   .. code-block:: c

      read_prefs = mongoc_read_prefs_new(MONGOC_READ_SECONDARY);

      command = BCON_NEW("hello", BCON_INT32(1));

      retval = mongoc_client_command_simple(client, "admin", command,
      read_prefs, &reply, &error);
  
   For more information on read preference options, see :manual:`Read Preference
   </core/read-preference/>` in the Server manual.

Response
--------

Each function returns either a BSON document or a cursor containing the response
from the database after the command runs. Each database command performs a
different function, so the response content can vary across commands. However,
every response contains documents with the following fields:

- ``<command result>``: Provides fields specific to the database command. For
  example, ``count`` returns the ``n`` field and ``explain`` returns the
  ``queryPlanner`` field.
- ``ok``: Indicates whether the command succeeded (``1``) or failed (``0``).

Example
-------

The following code shows how you can use the
``mongoc_client_write_command_with_opts()`` function to run the
``cloneCollectionAsCapped`` command with the ``writeConcern`` option. It then
uses the ``mongoc_client_read_command_with_opts()`` function to run the
``distinct`` command with the ``collation`` and ``readConcern`` options.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/run-command.c
    :language: c
    :dedent:
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 17-20, 30, 46, 53-56
    :start-after: start-run-command-example
    :end-before: end-run-command-example

Output
~~~~~~

The ``cloneCollectionAsCapped`` command clones a collection as a capped
collection. Then, the ``distinct`` command gets the distinct values of a field
with a given filter and collation. The example outputs the following result:

.. code-block:: c

    cloneCollectionAsCapped: { "ok": 1, ... } distinct: { "values": ["value1",
    "value2", "value3"], "ok": 1, ... }
