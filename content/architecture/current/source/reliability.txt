Reliability in the {+service+} Well-Architected Framework
=========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Reliability pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes features that
minimize downtime and prevent data loss, including support for high
availability and fault tolerance.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about reliability
in {+service+}:

      Create {+cluster+} configurations that meet your availability
      needs and expedite recovery from disasters.
