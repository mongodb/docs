Deployment Regions for Backup Regionalization (API)
===================================================

Overview
--------

|onprem| supports backup regionalization, which allows each cluster or
shard to read from and write to snapshot stores in single or multiple
regions of your choice. The ``backupDeployments`` resource lets you view
and update deployment regions. 

To update or create a deployment region, you must issue the request 
from an IP address on your user account's :ref:`access list
<access-list-for-api-operations>`. The ``backupDeployments`` resource
accepts all requests only from IP addresses in the access list.
