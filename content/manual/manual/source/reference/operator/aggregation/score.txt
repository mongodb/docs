Definition

.. pipeline:: $score

   ``$score`` computes and returns a new score as metadata. It also
   optionally normalizes the input scores, by default to a range between
   zero and one. 

Syntax 
------

The stage has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
     $score: { 
       score: <expression>,
       scoreDetails: <boolean>,
       normalization: "none|sigmoid|minMaxScaler",
       weight: <expression>
     } 
   }

Fields 
------

``$score`` takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``score``
     - Expression
     - Computes a new value from the input scores and stores the value
       in the :expression:`$meta` keyword ``score``.
       Returns an error for non-numeric inputs.

   * - ``scoreDetails``
     - Boolean
     - Default is ``false``. Specifies if ``$score`` computes and populates the
       ``$scoreDetails`` metadata field for each output document. See
       :ref:`score-scoreDetails` for more information on this field.

   * - ``normalization``
     - String
     - Optional. Normalizes the score to the range of ``0`` to ``1``.
       Value can be:

       - ``none`` - Doesn't normalize. 
       - ``sigmoid`` - Applies the following :expression:`$sigmoid`
         expression: 

         .. code-block:: shell 
            :copyable: false 

            1 / (1 + e^-x)

         Here, ``x`` is the score to normalize.

         If omitted, defaults to ``none``.

       - ``minMaxScaler`` - to apply the :group:`$minMaxScaler` window
         function:

         .. code-block:: shell 
            :copyable: false 

             (s - min_s) / (max_s - min_s)

         Where: 

         - ``s`` is the score.
         - ``min_s`` is the minimum score. 
         - ``max_s`` is the maximum score.

   * - ``weight``
     - Double 
     - Optional. Number to multiply the ``score`` expression by after
       normalization.  

Behavior 
--------

The output documents from a :pipeline:`$score` are the same as the input
documents, but includes additional computed score as metadata. 

If you specify multiple :pipeline:`$score` stages in the pipeline, the
last :pipeline:`$score` stage in the pipeline overrides the score
metadata from previous :pipeline:`$score` stages.

.. _score-scoreDetails:

scoreDetails
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you set ``scoreDetails`` to ``true``, ``$score`` creates a
``scoreDetails`` metadata field for each document. The ``scoreDetails`` field
contains information about the final ranking. 

.. note::

   When you set ``scoreDetails`` to ``true``, ``$score`` sets the
   ``scoreDetails`` metadata field for each document but does not automatically
   output the ``scoreDetails`` metafield.

   To view the ``scoreDetails`` metadata field, you must either:

   - use a :pipeline:`$project` stage after ``$score`` to project the
     ``scoreDetails`` field

   - use a :pipeline:`$addFields` stage after ``$score`` to add the
     ``scoreDetails`` field to your pipeline output

The ``scoreDetails`` field contains the following subfields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
 
   * - Field
 
     - Description

   * - ``value``
  
     - The calculated score. 

   * - ``description``
 
     - A description in string format that explains how the ``$score`` operationMetrics
       calculates the final score. 

   * - ``rawScore``
  
     - The unweighted raw (not normalized) score. 
  
   * - ``normalization``
  
     -  One of the following normalization values: "none", "sigmoid", "minMaxScaler".

   * - ``weight``
 
     - The weight of the input pipeline, which must be in range [0,1].

   * - ``expression``

     - The value of ``$score.score`` in string format. 

   * - ``details``
 
     - An empty array, as ``$score`` cannot take any input pipelines. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-scoreDetails-output-format.rst

For example, the following code blocks shows the ``scoreDetails`` field for a
``$score`` operation with an ``$add`` expression:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   {
    _id: ObjectId('55f5a192d4bede9ac365b257'),
    scoreDetails: {
      value: 0.5,
      description: 'the score calculated from multiplying a weight in the range [0,1] with either a normalized or nonnormalized value:',
      rawScore: 145,
      normalization: 'sigmoid',
      weight: 0.5,
      expression: '{ string: { $add: [ 'field', 'myField' ] } }',
      details: []
    }
  },
