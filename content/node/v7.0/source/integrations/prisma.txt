Overview
--------

Prisma is an open source Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Node.js. It supports both {+language+}
and TypeScript, but it is primarily used with TypeScript to help you write readable and type-safe
code.

.. warning:: MongoDB Support for Prisma ORM v7

   The {+driver-long+} does not yet support Prisma ORM version 7. Use the latest
   available version 6.x release of Prisma ORM when working with MongoDB.

Schemas
~~~~~~~

Schemas help developers avoid data inconsistency issues over time by defining the structure of
your collection's documents. While you can define a schema at the database level within MongoDB,
Prisma lets you define a schema at the application level. Because the Prisma Client is aware
of the schema, developers using the Prisma Client have access to auto-completing queries.

Data Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, data that is accessed together should be stored together in a MongoDB collection.
Prisma supports using embedded documents to keep data together. In use
cases where you must store related data in separate MongoDB collections,
you must include one document's ``_id`` field in another document. Prisma streamlines this
process and assists you in organizing this related data, while also maintaining referential integrity
of the data.

When you use references to model relations between collections, you can add the ``@relation``
attribute to your Prisma schema to enable Prisma Client to access those relations, emulate
referential actions, and help maintain referential integrity.

To learn more about efficient data modeling in MongoDB, see :manual:`Reduce $lookup Operations </data-modeling/design-antipatterns/reduce-lookup-operations>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Schema Introspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB has a flexible schema by default. When you introspect an existing
MongoDB database by using the ``prisma db pull`` command, Prisma samples up to
1000 random documents from each collection to infer the schema structure.

If your collection contains fields with inconsistent data types across
documents, Prisma maps those fields to the ``Json`` type and outputs a warning.
This enables you to read all existing data, but it reduces type safety
benefits. To resolve this, you can manually update the data to use consistent
types, and then run ``prisma db pull`` again to regenerate the schema with
proper type definitions. For more information, see
:ref:`<node-prisma-troubleshooting>`.

Tutorial
--------

This tutorial shows how to perform the following actions:

- Download an example Prisma application
- Configure your Prisma schema
- Create and populate a MongoDB database with sample data
- Make the example application compatible with MongoDB
- Run the application

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Verify the prerequisites

      Before you begin this tutorial, ensure you have the following components prepared:

      - A MongoDB Atlas account with a configured cluster. To view
        instructions, see the `MongoDB Get Started <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/get-started/?language=nodejs>`__
        guide.
      - `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download>`__ {+min-node-version+} or later.

   .. step:: Download the example application

      Clone or download the :github:`example application </prisma/prisma-examples/tree/accelerate-nextjs-starter/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes>` from the
      :github:`Prisma examples repository </prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest>`.

      This example is a simple blog content management platform that uses a SQLite database.
      The following steps modify the application to use MongoDB instead of SQLite.
   
   .. step:: Configure your Prisma schema

      Navigate to the ``prisma/schema.prisma`` file in the example application
      directory. In the ``datasource db`` object of this file, set the ``provider`` field to ``"mongodb"`` and
      the ``url`` field to your Atlas connection URI.

      In the ``User`` model in the same file, change the ``id`` field type from ``Int`` to
      ``String`` and set the default value to ``auto()``. The ``id`` property must map
      to the MongoDB ``_id`` field. You must also instruct Prisma to set the data type for this
      property to ``ObjectId``.

      In the ``Post`` model, perform the same changes to the ``id`` field as you did in the ``User``
      model. You must also change the ``authorId`` field type from ``Int`` to ``String`` and set the
      data type to ``ObjectId``.

      Your ``schema.prisma`` file should resemble the following:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/integrations/example-schema.prisma
         :language: typescript

      This schema defines separate ``User`` and ``Post`` collections in your MongoDB
      database, where each ``Post`` contains a reference to a ``User``.

      Once you have made these changes, navigate to the project directory in your
      terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies and
      generate the schema:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm install
         npx prisma generate
      
      .. note::

         If you make any further changes to the schema, you must re-run the
         ``npx prisma generate`` command for the changes to take effect.

   .. step:: Create and populate the MongoDB database

      To populate the database with sample data, run the ``prisma/seed.ts`` file in the example
      project by running the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npx prisma db seed
      
      This creates the ``User`` and ``Post`` collections as defined by the ``schema.prisma``
      file and populates them with sample data.
   
   .. step:: Make the example application compatible with MongoDB

      Navigate to the ``src`` directory of the example project. In the ``pages/api/post/[id].ts``
      and ``pages/api/publish/[id].ts`` files, replace all instances of ``Number(postId)`` with
      ``postId``. This is necessary because the ``id`` fields in the schema are now of type
      ``String`` instead of ``Int``.
   
   .. step:: Run the application

      To start the application, run the following command from the project directory:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm run dev
      
      Navigate to ``http://localhost:3000`` in your web browser to view and run
      the application. You can use the application to create, draft, publish, and delete blog posts.
      You can reference the API route definitions in the ``pages/api`` folder of the example project.

.. _node-prisma-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting Type Conflicts
------------------------------

If your MongoDB collections contain fields that use inconsistent data types across documents,
Prisma Client might throw errors when querying data that doesn't match the expected type
from your schema. 

You can perform the following actions to address this:

1. Review the warnings and comments in your Prisma schema after running ``prisma db pull``
   to identify fields that use conflicting types.
2. Update your data to use consistent types across all documents in the collection.
3. Run ``prisma db pull`` again to regenerate your schema that includes the corrected types.

Alternatively, you can leave the field as type ``Json`` if you need to maintain
flexibility. However, this reduces the type safety benefits that Prisma provides.
