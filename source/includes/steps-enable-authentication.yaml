title: Start the MongoDB instance with authentication enabled.
stepnum: 1
ref: start
pre: |
  Start the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance with the
  :setting:`~security.authentication` or :setting:`~security.keyFile`
  setting. Use :setting:`~security.authentication` on a standalone
  instance. Use :setting:`~security.keyFile` on an instance in a
  :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`.
action:
  - pre: |
      For example, to start a :program:`mongod` with authentication
      enabled and a key file stored in ``/private/var``, first set the
      following option in the :program:`mongod`'s configuration file:
    language: yaml
    code: |
      security:
        keyFile: /private/var/key.pem
  - pre: |
      Then start the :program:`mongod` and specify the config file. For example:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod --config /etc/mongodb/mongodb.conf
post: |
  After you enable authentication, only the user administrator can
  connect to the MongoDB instance. The user administrator must log in
  and grant further access to the instance by creating additional
  users.

stepnum: 2
ref: connect-via-localhost
action:
  pre: |
    Connect to the MongoDB instance from a client running on the same
    system. This access is made possible by the :ref:`localhost exception
    <localhost-exception>`.
