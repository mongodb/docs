Freezing creates an immutable snapshot of data in a realm at the time of freezing.
Frozen objects are not live and do not automatically update.
You cannot write to frozen data.
Once data is frozen, it cannot be unfrozen.

You can freeze the following object types:

- :ref:`Realm <flutter-freeze-realm>`
- :ref:`RealmResults <flutter-freeze-realmresults>`
- :ref:`RealmObject <flutter-freeze-realmobject>`
- :ref:`RealmList <flutter-freeze-realmlist>`

.. _flutter-freeze-realm:

Freeze a Realm
--------------

Create a frozen snapshot of an entire realm with :flutter-sdk:`Realm.freeze()
<realm/Realm/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen realm,
you must close it to prevent memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/freeze_test.snippet.freeze-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-freeze-realmresults:

Freeze RealmResults
-------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of ``RealmResults`` with :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults.freeze()
<realm/RealmResults/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/freeze_test.snippet.freeze-realm-results.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-freeze-realmobject:

Freeze a RealmObject
--------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of a ``RealmObject`` with :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject.freeze()
<realm/RealmObjectBase/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/freeze_test.snippet.freeze-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-freeze-realmlist:

Freeze a RealmList in a RealmObject
-----------------------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of ``RealmList`` in a ``RealmObject``
with :flutter-sdk:`RealmList.freeze() <realm/RealmList/freeze.html>`.
Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/freeze_test.snippet.freeze-list-in-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-isfrozen:

Check if Data Is Frozen
-----------------------

Check if any of the freezable data types are frozen with the ``isFrozen`` property.
``isFrozen`` returns ``true`` if an object is frozen and ``false`` if it is a live object.
