========================
Database Profiler Output
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The database profiler captures data information about read and write
operations, cursor operations, and database commands. To configure the
database profile and set the thresholds for capturing profile data,
see the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler` section.

The database profiler writes data in the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection,
which is a :term:`capped collection`. To view the profiler's output,
use normal MongoDB queries on the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection.

.. note::

   Because the database profiler writes data to the
   :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection in a
   database, the profiler will profile some write activity, even for
   databases that are otherwise read-only.

Example ``system.profile`` Document
-----------------------------------

The documents in the :data:`system.profile
<<database>.system.profile>` collection have the following form. This
example document reflects an update operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "ts" : ISODate("2012-12-10T19:31:28.977Z"),
       "op" : "update",
       "ns" : "social.users",
       "query" : {
           "name" : "jane"
       },
       "updateobj" : {
           "$set" : {
               "likes" : [
                   "basketball",
                   "trekking"
               ]
           }
       },
       "nscanned" : 8,
       "moved" : true,
       "nmoved" : 1,
       "nupdated" : 1,
       "keyUpdates" : 0,
       "numYield" : 0,
       "lockStats" : {
           "timeLockedMicros" : {
               "r" : NumberLong(0),
               "w" : NumberLong(258)
           },
           "timeAcquiringMicros" : {
               "r" : NumberLong(0),
               "w" : NumberLong(7)
           }
       },
       "millis" : 0,
       "client" : "127.0.0.1",
       "user" : ""
   }

Output Reference
----------------

For any single operation, the documents created by the database
profiler will include a subset of the following fields. The precise
selection of fields in these documents depends on the type of
operation.

.. stats:: ts

   The timestamp of the operation.

.. stats:: op

   The type of operation. The possible values are:

   - ``insert``
   - ``query``
   - ``update``
   - ``remove``
   - ``getmore``
   - ``command``

.. stats:: ns

   The :term:`namespace` the operation targets. Namespaces in MongoDB
   take the form of the :term:`database`, followed by a dot (``.``),
   followed by the name of
   the :term:`collection`.

.. stats:: query

   The query document used. See :ref:`documents-query-selectors` for
   more information on these documents, and
   :doc:`/reference/meta-query-operators` for more information.

.. stats:: command

   The command operation.

.. stats:: updateobj

   The :ref:`update document <documents-update-actions>` passed in
   during an :doc:`update </applications/update>` operation.

.. stats:: cursorid

   The ID of the cursor accessed by a ``getmore`` operation.

.. stats:: ntoreturn

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2

   The number of documents the operation specified to return. For
   example, the :dbcommand:`profile` command would return one document
   (a results document) so the :status:`ntoreturn` value would be ``1``. The
   :method:`limit(5) <cursor.limit()>` command would return five
   documents so the ``ntoreturn`` value would be ``5``.

   If the :status:`ntoreturn` value is ``0``, the command did not specify a
   number of documents to return, as would be the case with a simple
   :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` command with no limit
   specified.

   In version 2.0, this information was provided for ``query`` and
   ``command`` operations. In 2.2, this information is also provided for
   ``getmore`` operations.

.. stats:: ntoskip

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of documents the :method:`skip() <cursor.skip()>` method
   specified to skip.

.. stats:: nscanned

   The number of documents that MongoDB scans in the :doc:`index </indexes>` in order to
   carry out the operation.

   In general, if :stats:`nscanned` is much higher than :stats:`nreturned`, the
   database is scanning many objects to find the target objects.
   Consider creating an index to improve this.

.. stats:: moved

   If :stats:`moved` has a value of ``true`` indicates that the update operation moved one or
   more documents to a new location on disk. These operations take
   more time than
   in-place updates, and typically occur when documents grow as a
   result of document growth.

   .. todo put a link to document growth in schema design/data
      modeling docs.

.. stats:: nmoved

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of documents moved on disk by the operation.

.. stats:: nupdated

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of documents updated by the operation.

.. stats:: keyUpdates

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of :doc:`index </indexes>` keys the update changed in
   the operation. Changing an index key
   carries a small performance cost because the database must remove the old
   key and inserts a new key into the B-tree index.

.. stats:: numYield

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The number of times the operation yielded to allow other operations
   to complete. Typically, operations yield when they need access to
   data that MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete while MongoDB
   reads in data for the yielding operation. For more information,
   see :ref:`the FAQ on when operations yield <faq-concurrency-yielding>`.

.. stats:: lockStats

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The time in microseconds the operation spent acquiring and holding
   locks. This field reports data for the following lock types:

   - ``R`` - global read lock
   - ``W`` - global write lock
   - ``r`` - database-specific read lock
   - ``w`` - database-specific write lock

   .. stats:: lockStats.timeLockedMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation held a specific lock. For
      operations that require more than one lock, like those 
      that lock the ``local`` database to update the :term:`oplog`, then
      this value may be longer than the total length of the
      operation (i.e. :stats:`millis`.) 

   .. stats:: lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation spent waiting to acquire a
      specific lock.

.. stats:: nreturned

   The number of documents returned by the operation.

.. stats:: responseLength

   The length in bytes of the operation's result document. A large
   :stats:`responseLength` can affect performance. To limit the size of a the
   result document for a query operation, you can use any of the
   following:

   - :ref:`Projections <read-operations-projection>`
   - :method:`The limit() method <cursor.limit()>`
   - :method:`The batchSize() method <cursor.batchSize()>`

.. stats:: millis

   The time in milliseconds for the server to perform the operation.
   This time does not include network time nor time to acquire the lock.

.. stats:: client

   The IP address or hostname of the client connection where the
   operation originates.

   For some operations, such as :method:`db.eval()`, the client is
   ``0.0.0.0:0`` instead of an actual client.

.. stats:: user

   The authenticated user who ran the operation.

.. todo Test what values appear for authenticated users and add that info.
   When we do, we can add back this: "If the operation was not run by an
   authenticated user, this field's value is an empty string."

.. todo Consider adding documentation to our manual on the
   "internal user" used by replication

.. todo add versionchanged stats for version 2.0 in all the fields.
