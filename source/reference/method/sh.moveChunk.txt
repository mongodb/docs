sh.moveChunk()

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.moveChunk(namespace, query, destination)

   Moves the :term:`chunk` that contains the document specified by the
   ``query`` to the ``destination`` shard. :method:`sh.moveChunk()`
   provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` database
   command and takes the following arguments:

   .. include:: /reference/method/sh.moveChunk-param.rst

   .. important:: In most circumstances, allow the :term:`balancer` to
      automatically migrate :term:`chunks <chunk>`, and avoid calling
      :method:`sh.moveChunk()` directly.

.. seealso:: :dbcommand:`moveChunk`, :method:`sh.splitAt()`,
   :method:`sh.splitFind()`, :doc:`/sharding`, and :ref:`chunk
   migration <sharding-chunk-migration>`.

Example
-------

Given the ``people`` collection in the ``records`` database, the
following operation finds the chunk that contains the documents with the
``zipcode`` field set to ``53187`` and then moves that chunk to the
shard named ``shard0019``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.moveChunk("records.people", { zipcode: 53187 }, "shard0019")
