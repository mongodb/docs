A heatmap represents data in a tabular format as a range of color. A
darker, or more intense, color represents a larger aggregated value
for a particular data point.

Heatmap Encoding Channels
-------------------------

Heatmaps provide the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - X Axis
     - A :guilabel:`category` encoding channel that creates a category
       along the X axis for each unique value in this field.

   * - Y Axis
     - A :guilabel:`category` encoding channel that creates a category
       along the Y axis for each unique value in this field.

   * - Intensity
     - .. include:: /includes/intensity-definition.rst

.. note::

   Heatmaps support :ref:`sorting <charts-sort-data>` and
   :ref:`limiting <charts-limit-data>` for the
   :guilabel:`X Axis` encoding channel, but not the
   :guilabel:`Y Axis` channel.

Use Cases
---------

Heatmaps reveal patterns or trends within your data. Use heatmaps
when the exact data values are not as important as depicting
higher-level trends and relationships between your data points. They
can also highlight any significant outliers, or points which strongly
go against the general direction of your data. A heatmap is a good
choice to display:

- A comparison of average room rental prices based on location and
  property type.

- Geographic data, such as election results across different districts
  or population density.

- The number of customer orders across various store locations by month
  of the year.

.. tip::

   Heatmaps work especially well with :ref:`binned <charts-bin-data>`
   data. With naturally ordered datasets, heatmaps highlight areas of
   concentration within the data.

Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for a heatmap is 20000 documents. 


Example
-------

The following chart visualizes data pertaining to movies. Each
document in the collection represents a movie and contains general
information about the film as well as ratings from critics. This
heatmap shows the mean (average) `Metacritic
<http://www.metacritic.com/>`_ rating for different movie genres
(Y Axis) over time (X Axis):

.. figure:: /images/charts/heatmap-example.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Heatmap example

We :ref:`bin <charts-bin-data>` the years along the X Axis into
decades and aggregate to find the :guilabel:`mean` ``metacritic`` score
of films from each genre released in each decade.

The :guilabel:`intensity` field of ``metacritic`` shades each grid
element based on the mean ``metacritic`` field of all of the
intersecting documents based on the :guilabel:`X` and
:guilabel:`Y axes` fields. Based on the chart, we see that
from ``1930-1940`` there are a few genres with very high
average Metacritic scores, and over time a more even distribution of
film ratings begins to occur.

.. note::

   If the space is white, there are no movies from that decade of that
   particular genre in the dataset.
