Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------

Missed |sms| Authentication Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Use Authenticator Apps When Possible
   :class: warning

   Authenticator applications are the preferred method to |sms| for
   two-factor authentication. |sms| is an older protocol with many
   known security vulnerabilities. The U.S.
   :abbr:`NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)`
   advised abandoning |sms| for |2fa| in section `5.1.3.2`_ of its
   `Digital Identity Guidelines`_.

If are using |sms|, but do not receive the authentication tokens via
|sms|:

1. Refer to the :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`
   page for more details about using two-factor authentication. This
   page includes any limitations which may affect |sms| delivery times.

2. Enter the |sms| phone number with country code first followed by the
   area code and the phone number.

   If you are outside of the United States or Canada, include ``011``
   and the `country code <https://countrycode.org/>`__  because |mms|
   uses the U.S.-based `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send text
   messages. As an alternative to your non-U.S. telephone number, use
   a `Google Voice <https://voice.google.com>`__ telephone number.

   .. example::

      For New Zealand enter ``01164`` before the phone number. 

   .. cond:: cloud

      If you do not receive the authentication token in a reasonable
      amount of time
      `contact Support <https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/support>`_
      to rule out |sms| message delivery delays.

   .. cond:: onprem

      If you do not receive the authentication token in a reasonable
      amount of time, contact your |mms| system administrator.

   .. seealso::

      To learn more about limits of |sms| for |2fa|, see 
      :ref:`SMS delivery considerations <sms-delivery-considerations>`.

Delete or Reset Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cond:: cloud

   To delete or reset two-factor authentication, go to
   `<https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/mfa/reset>`_.
   The reset button deletes your existing two-factor authentication
   settings and provides the option to create new ones.

.. cond:: onprem

   Contact your system administrator to remove or reset two-factor
   authentication on your account.

   For administrative information on two-factor authentication, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-two-factor-authentication`.

   LDAP
   ----

   Forgot to Change ``MONGODB-CR`` Error
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If your MongoDB deployment uses LDAP for authentication, and you
   find the following error message:

   .. warning::

      You forgot to change ``MONGODB-CR`` to ``LDAP (PLAIN)`` since
      they both take username/password.

   Then make sure that you specified the ``LDAP (PLAIN)`` as is the
   authentication mechanism for both the
   :doc:`{+magent+} </tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap>`
   and the
   :doc:`{+bagent+} </tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap>`.

   Restore Lost Access to Organizations and Projects
   -------------------------------------------------

   If you created your |mms| account using a Gmail or Google Apps 
   account, the following can cause you to lose access to your 
   organizations and projects:

   - The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the 
     email address associated to your account. This is most often the case
     with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
   - Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

   To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

   - Ask a user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to invite you 
     to the organization to which you lost access, or
   - :website:`Contact MongoDB Support </contact>`.
