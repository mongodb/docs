.. [#data-bearing]

   For replica sets, the data-bearing servers are the servers hosting the
   replica set nodes. For sharded clusters, the data-bearing servers are the
   servers hosting the shards. For sharded clusters, |service| also deploys
   servers for the :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`; these are
   charged at a rate separate from the instance costs.
