As of September 2024, the following App Services are deprecated:

- Atlas Data API and HTTPS Endpoints
- Atlas Device SDKs

These services will reach end-of-life and be removed on **September 30, 2025**.

Previously Deprecated Services
------------------------------

As of March 12, 2024, GraphQL and Static Hosting are deprecated for Atlas App
Services. GraphQL and Static Hosting services will be discontinued on
**September 30, 2025**.

To learn more about these deprecations, refer to the :ref:`Migrate Static
Hosting and GraphQL From App Services page <migrate-hosting-graphql>`.

Triggers Are Not Deprecated
----------------------------

Triggers are not deprecated. This service will continue to be available. App
Services Functions will also continue to be available to use with Triggers.

Atlas Data API and HTTPS Endpoints Are Deprecated
-------------------------------------------------

To learn more about the Atlas Data API and HTTPS Endpoints deprecation and what
alternatives exist, refer to the :ref:`Atlas Data API and HTTPS Endpoints
deprecation page <data-api-deprecation>`.

Device Sync is Deprecated
-------------------------

To learn more about the Device Sync deprecation and what alternatives exist,
refer to the :ref:`Device Sync deprecation page <device-sync-deprecation>`.

Atlas Devices SDKs Are Deprecated
---------------------------------

To learn more about the Atlas Device SDKs deprecation, refer to the :ref:`Atlas
Device SDKs deprecation page <device-sdks-deprecation>`.

Additional Impacted App Services Capabilities
---------------------------------------------

Some App Services are affected by the deprecation of the Device SDKs. These
services will no longer function as expected when the SDKs reach end-of-life and
are not supported.

Authentication and User Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Device SDKs are the primary entry point for :ref:`App Services
Authentication and User Management <users-and-authentication>`, an
authentication service for your applications. As part of the SDK deprecation,
this feature will no longer be available when the SDKs reach end-of-life and are
removed. You must move to an alternative authentication service before that time
to avoid disruption in your application.

The feature supports multiple :ref:`authentication providers 
<authentication-providers>`, and your migration to alternative solutions depends
on your provider. To identify the best alternative for your use case, please
contact your Account team.

Given App Services Authentication is no longer available, Authentication
Triggers will no longer be executed when user events (for example: login or
create) occur. This authentication logic will need to be implemented along with 
the chosen alternative solution.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Functions will continue to be available within the context of Triggers. Use
cases where a function was being directly accessed through a Device SDK are
impacted and must migrate to a different solution. 

Wire Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services Wire Protocol is also deprecated alongside the Device SDKs.

Data Access Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Access Permissions (Rules and Roles) are also deprecated alongside Device
Sync.

App Services Admin API and CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The App Services Admin API and CLI are not deprecated. However, they have
endpoints and commands that rely on deprecated services. These endpoints and
commands are deprecated.
