Workload Identity Federation uses OAuth 2.0 to enable your applications to 
access MongoDB using external programmatic identities such as Azure Service 
Principals, Azure Managed Identities, and Google Service Accounts. 

.. important:: 

   .. include:: includes/fact-OIDC-linux-only.rst

Use Cases
---------

With Workload Identity Federation, you can:

- Manage your application's access to MongoDB deployments through your 
  existing cloud provider or identity provider (IdP).
- Enforce security policies such as role-based access control, credential 
  rotation, and workload-specific permissions.
- Grant access to specific applications, containers, or virtual machines 
  without managing individual service accounts.

Behavior
--------

- To use Workload Identity Federation, you must use MongoDB 
  Enterprise and have MongoDB 7.0.11 or later.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-confirm-enterprise-binaries.rst

- Workload Identity Federation allows your applications to access MongoDB 
  clusters with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. The access tokens can be issued by 
  any external identity provider, including Azure Entra ID and Google Cloud 
  Platform. 
  
- MongoDB stores user identifiers and privileges, but not secrets.

Get Started
-----------

To configure and use Workload Identity Federation, perform the 
following tasks:

1. :ref:`workload-external-provider`

   Register your OAuth 2.0 application with an IdP that supports the OAuth 2.0 
   standard, such as Azure Service Principals, Azure Managed Identities and 
   Google Service Accounts.

#. :ref:`configure-mongodb-workload`

   Configure your MongoDB server to use Workload Identity Federation with 
   OAuth 2.0.

#. :ref:`database-user-workload`

   Specify privileges for workload identity principals by adding roles to 
   MongoDB (for OAuth, external authorization, or both) or adding database users 
   to MongoDB (for database-managed authorization).

Details 
-------

MongoDB Drivers support two types of authentication flow for Workload 
Identity Federation: Built-in Authentication and Callback Authentication.

Built-in Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use built-in authentication if you deploy your application on a 
supported infrastructure with a supported principal type. Your application 
can access MongoDB clusters without supplying a password or manually 
requesting a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) from your cloud provider's metadata 
service. Instead, your chosen MongoDB driver uses your existing principal 
identifier to request a JWT access token under the hood, which is then 
passed to the Atlas cluster automatically when your application connects.

For more implementation details, see your chosen :driver:`Driver's 
documentation </>`.

Callback Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use callback authentication with any service supporting OAuth 2.0 
access tokens. Workload Identity Federation calls a callback method, in 
which you can request the required JWT from your authorization server or 
cloud provider that you must pass when your application connects to MongoDB 
with Workload Identity Federation.

details.
