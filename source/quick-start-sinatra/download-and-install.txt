Prerequisites
-------------

To create the Quick Start application by using Sinatra, you need the
following software installed in your development environment:

- `{+language+} language. <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/>`__
- :rubygems:`RubyGems package manager. <pages/download>`
- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

Download and Install the {+odm+} and Framework Gems
---------------------------------------------------

In {+language+}, packages are called **gems**.

Complete the following steps to install and add the {+odm+} and Sinatra
gems to your web application.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install {+odm+}

      Ensure that the version of {+odm+} you install is compatible with the
      version of {+language+} installed on your operating system. To
      learn which versions are compatible, see the
      :ref:`mongoid-compatibility` page.

      Run the following command to install the {+odm+} gem:

      .. code-block:: bash

         gem install mongoid

      When the installation completes, the command outputs the following
      message:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         Successfully installed mongoid-{+full-version+}
         Parsing documentation for mongoid-{+full-version+}
         Installing ri documentation for mongoid-{+full-version+}
         Done installing documentation for mongoid after 1 seconds
         1 gem installed

   .. step:: Create a Quick Start application directory

      Run the following commands to generate a new directory
      called ``{+quickstart-sinatra-app-name+}`` and enter it:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir {+quickstart-sinatra-app-name+}
         cd {+quickstart-sinatra-app-name+}

   .. step:: Create a ``Gemfile`` and add gems

      All {+language+} applications must have a ``Gemfile`` that lists
      the required gems. Run the following command to create a
      ``Gemfile`` in your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         touch Gemfile

      Paste the following content into the ``Gemfile`` to add the
      required gems:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         source 'https://rubygems.org'
         
         gem 'sinatra'
         gem 'mongoid'
         gem 'rackup'

      The ``rackup`` gem provides a web server interface for your
      application.

   .. step:: Install gems

      Run the following command to install the specified gems into your
      application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         gem install bundler
         bundle install

      When the command runs successfully, the output in your
      shell contains a ``Bundle complete!`` message and describes the
      number of new gems installed.

      After completing these steps, you have a new Sinatra web application with
      {+odm+} installed.
