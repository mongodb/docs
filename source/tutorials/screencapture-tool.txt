Introduction
------------

We have developed a tool which automatically captures and updates
screenshots in our documentation repositories. The goal of this tool is
to make it easier to incorporate screenshots into our documentation and
ultimately benefit our readers by providing more visual aids to remove
ambiguity when referring to UI elements and provide additional clarity
when listing out steps for lengthy procedures.

Screencapture scripts for web-based tools such as Atlas and Charts are
written using `NightmareJS <https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare>`_
and scripts for Compass are written using
`MochaJS <https://mochajs.org/>`_.

Writing Screencapture Scripts
-----------------------------

Refer to either

- :doc:`Writing NightmareJS Scripts </tutorials/screencapture-tool-nightmare>`
  for web-based tools (i.e. Atlas and Charts) or

- :doc:`Writing MochaJS Scripts for Compass </tutorials/screencapture-tool-mocha>`

for details and examples for writing each type of screencapture script.

Editing the Makefile to Include Screencapture Scripts
-----------------------------------------------------

Once you have completed writing a screencapture script and saved it to
the repository's ``screenshot-scripts`` directory, add it to the
list of scripts in the ``screenshots`` section of the ``Makefile``.
This allows the ``make screenshots`` command to run the script.

By default, the ``make screenshots`` command runs all screenshot scripts
listed in the Makefile. To only have the command run specific
screenshot scripts, comment out the scripts which should not be run.

.. important::

   When copying the code from the following example, you must replace
   the **space** indentation with **tab** indentation in order for the
   Makefile to be parsed correctly.

.. example::

   The following ``screenshots`` command of the Charts documentation
   Makefile only runs the ``data-sources.js`` script:

   .. code-block:: make

      screenshots:
      	giza generate assets
      	@echo "Running screenshot tool"
      	-rm -r screenshots-temp/*
      	mkdir -p screenshots-temp/charts/
      	cd build/docs-tools/tools/screenshot-tool && npm install
      	# node build/docs-tools/tools/screenshot-tool/screenshots.js `pwd`/screenshot-scripts/dashboard-landing.js
      	node build/docs-tools/tools/screenshot-tool/screenshots.js `pwd`/screenshot-scripts/data-sources.js

.. important::

   Some scripts require login information to be provided in a
   ``.properties.ini`` file. In these cases, the location of the
   ``properties.ini`` file must be passed as a third command line
   parameter. For example, the following command runs the
   ``create-cluster.js`` script, passing in the ``.properties.ini``
   file containing login information:

   .. code-block:: sh

      node build/docs-tools/tools/screenshot-tool/screenshots.js `pwd`/screenshot-scripts/create-cluster.js `pwd`/screenshot-scripts/.properties.ini

   For details on how to format the ``.properties.ini`` file, see the
   :ref:`Login Information <nightmare_login_information>` section.

Running the Screencapture Tool
------------------------------

After writing a screenshot script and saving it in the
``screenshot-scripts`` directory, from the **root directory** of the
repository run the following command to run the screenshot tool:

.. code-block:: sh

   make screenshots

If everything is configured correctly, this command should open an
automation browser which will execture your script.

.. note::

   The tool's browser does not have to be visible on your machine to
   run. The script still runs effectively when minimized. For details
   on showing or hiding the browser instance, refer to the
   meta-documentation page for writing your specific script type.

Troubleshooting and Best Practices
----------------------------------

- If Atlas is unable to login with the credentials provided in your
  ``.properties.ini`` file in the ``Makefile`` command, ensure that the
  file exists in the ``screenshot-scripts`` directory of your
  repository. Also ensure that the credentials match the Atlas
  environment you are connecting to.

- In the event you run a screencapture script, update the original image,
  and re-run the script and the script still shows a high mismatch
  percentage, check the following:

  - The original image was actually replaced, and the image in
    ``source/images`` was updated as expected.

  - If there are any timestamps in the image which may be updating
    each time the screenshot is taken.

  - If there are any *transitions* in the UI which might cause the
    content to be captured at slightly different locations on the page.
    If this is the case, consider adding a slightly longer ``wait()``
    time before capturing the page.

  - The image analysis file placed in the ``screenshots-temp`` folder.

- When the captured image has large dimensions, consider using the
  `figwidth <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure>`_
  option in the reStructuredText to cleanly scale down the image to fit
  in the document pane.

  - To have an image fill the entire width of the HTML content pane, set
    ``figwidth`` to ``750px``.

  - To have an image fill an admonition block, such as an example, set
    ``figwidth`` to ``720px``.

  .. example::

     The following example sets the width of ``picture.png`` to fill
     the entire HTML content pane:

     .. code-block:: rst

        .. figure:: picture.png
           :figwidth: 750px

- Inpsecting an element in a browser will provide an option to copy
  the CSS selector, which is useful when specifying a
  selector in the screenshot script.

.. cssclass:: hidden
