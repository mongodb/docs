pre: |

  Connect to the :term:`primary` to create a user with
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role. The
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role grants access to user creation
  on any database in the deployment.

  The following example creates the user ``fred`` with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin`` database.

     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system

  At the completion of this procedure, any client that administers users in

title: Create the cluster administrator.

ref: add-user-clusteradmin
pre: |

  Connect to the :term:`primary` to create a user with
  :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role. The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role
  grants access to replication operations, such as configuring the
  replica set.

  The following example creates the user ``ravi`` with the
  :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role on the ``admin`` database.
  
  .. important::
     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
     and to prevent or delay malicious access.

  At the completion of this procedure, any client that administrates or

title: Create users for client applications.
level: 4
ref: add-replica-set-users
pre: |

  Create users to allow client application to connect and interact with the
  replica set. At the completion of this tutorial, clients must authenticate as 
  a configured user to connect to the replica set.
  
  See :ref:`database-user-roles` for basic built-in roles to use
  in creating read-only and read-write users.
  
  The following creates a user with read and write permissions
  on the ``foo`` database.
  
  .. important::
     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
     and to prevent or delay malicious access.
  
action:
  - pre: |
  
      Create a user with the 
      :authrole:`readWrite` role in the ``foo`` database.

      .. tip::

         .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.getSiblingDB("foo").createUser(
        {
          "user" : "joe",
          "pwd" :  passwordPrompt(),     // or cleartext password
          roles: [ { "role" : "readWrite", "db" : "foo" } ] 
        }
      )
      
post: |

  Clients authenticating as this user can perform read and write operations
  against the ``foo`` database. See :ref:`authentication-auth-as-user` for
  more on creating an authenticated connection to the replica set.
  
  See the :ref:`Add Users <add-new-user>` tutorial for more information on
  adding users. Consider :ref:`security best practices
  <security-checklist-role-based-access-control>` when adding new users.

stepnum: 4
title: Update Client Applications
level: 4
ref: update-client-apps
pre: |
  
  At this point in the procedure, the replica set does not enforce
  authentication. However, client applications can still specify auth
  credentials and connect to the replica set.
  
  Update client applications to authenticate to the replica set using a
  configured user. Authenticated connections require a username, password, and
  the authentication database. See :ref:`authentication-auth-as-user`.

action:
  - pre: |
      
      For example, the following connects to a replica set named ``mongoRepl``
      and authenticates as the user ``joe``.
      
    language: shell
    code: |
      mongo  -u joe -password  -authenticationDatabase foo --host mongoRepl/mongo1.example.net:27017, mongo2.example.net:27017, mongo3.example.net:27017
    post: |
       If you do not specify the password to the :option:`-p <mongo -p>`
       command-line option, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell prompts for the
       password.
  - pre: |
  
      If your application uses a MongoDB driver, see the associated
      :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>` documentation for instructions on
      creating an authenticated connection.
  
post: |
  
  At the completion of this tutorial, the replica set rejects non-authenticated
  client connections. Performing this step now ensures clients can connect
  to the replica set before and after the transition.

  - The :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting. Starting the
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` with :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` set to
    ``true`` places the instance in a transition state where it can
    accept and create both authenticated and non-authenticated
    connections.
