To change the size of a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`, use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command's
``cappedSize`` option. ``cappedSize`` is specified in bytes, and must be
greater than ``0`` and less than or equal to ``1024^5`` (1 {+pb+}).

If ``cappedSize`` is less than the current size of the collection,
MongoDB removes the excess documents on the next insert operation.
