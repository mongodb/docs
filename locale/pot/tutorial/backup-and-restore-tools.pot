msgid "This tutorial describes the process for creating backups and restoring data using the utilities provided with MongoDB. The :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utilities work with :doc:`BSON </reference/bson-types>` data dumps, and are useful for creating backups of small deployments. For resilient and non-disruptive backups, use a file system or block-level disk snapshot function, such as the methods described in the :doc:`/core/backups` document."

msgid "Because :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` operate by interacting with a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, they can impact the performance of your running database. Not only do the tools create traffic for a running database instance, they also force the database to read all data through memory. When MongoDB reads infrequently used data, it can evict more frequently accessed data, causing a deterioration in performance for the database's regular workload."
