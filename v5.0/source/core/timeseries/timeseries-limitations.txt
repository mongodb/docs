Unsupported Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features are not supported for 
:ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

* :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>`
* :doc:`Change streams </changeStreams>`
* :doc:`Client-side field level encryption </core/security-client-side-encryption>`
* :appservices:`Database Triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`
* :appservices:`GraphQL API </graphql>`
* :appservices:`Atlas Device Sync </sync>` (Atlas Device Sync is supported if
  the time series collections are asymmetrically synchronized. For
  details, see :appservices:`Enable Atlas Device Sync
  </sync/configure/enable-sync>`.)
* :dbcommand:`reIndex`
* :doc:`Schema validation rules </core/schema-validation>`

Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum size of a measurement document is 4 MB.

Aggregation $out and $merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't use aggregation pipeline stages :pipeline:`$out` and :pipeline:`$merge`
to output or merge into to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` from another collection.

.. _timeseries-limitation-distinct:

distinct Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/time-series/timeseries-distinct-command.rst

.. _timeseries-limitations-doc-size:

Document Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum size for documents within a time series collection is 4 MB.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes:

Updates and Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0.5, you can perform some delete and update
operations.

Delete commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The delete command may not limit the number of documents to be
  deleted. You must use a delete command with ``justOne: false`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The update command may only modify the ``metaField`` field value.
- The update must be performed with an update document that contains
  only :ref:`update operator <update-operators>` expressions.
- The update command may not limit the number of documents to be
  updated. You must use an update command with ``multi: true`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.updateMany()` method.
- The update command may not set :ref:`upsert: true <update-upsert>`.

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

To remove all documents from a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.drop()` method to drop the collection.

.. include:: /includes/time-series-ttl-deletes.rst

For details on TTL deletes, see :ref:`ttl-collections`.

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>` on the fields
specified as the ``timeField`` and the ``metaField``. If the field value
for the ``metaField`` field is a document, you can also create secondary
indexes on fields inside that document.

The ``metaField`` doesn't support the following index types:

- :doc:`2d </core/2d>`
- :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`
- :doc:`text </core/index-text>`

Secondary indexes don't support the following index properties:

- :doc:`TTL </core/index-ttl>`
- :doc:`Unique </core/index-unique>`
- :doc:`Partial </core/index-partial>`

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A time series collection can't be created as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection's type can only be set when creating the collection:

- An existing collection can't be converted into a :ref:`time series
  collection <manual-capped-collection>`.
- A :ref:`time series collection <manual-capped-collection>` can't be
  converted into a different collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when creating the collection. After creation these parameters
can't be modified.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Modification of ``granularity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the ``granularity`` is set it can only be increased by one level at
a time. From ``"seconds"`` to ``"minutes"`` or from ``"minutes"`` to
``"hours"``. Other changes are not allowed. If you need to change the
``granularity`` from ``"seconds"`` to ``"hours"``, first increase the
``granularity`` to ``"minutes"`` and then to ``"hours"``.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0.6, sharded time series collections are
supported. When using sharded time series collections, you cannot modify
the ``granularity`` of a sharded time series collection.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot shard time series
collections.

Sharding Administration Commands
````````````````````````````````

You cannot run sharding administration commands on sharded time series 
collections. 

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't write to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` in :doc:`transactions
</core/transactions>`.

.. note::

  Reads from time series collections are supported in transactions.

Snapshot Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read operations on time series collections with read concern
``"snapshot"`` guarantee snapshot isolation only in the absence of
concurrent drop or rename operations on collections in the read
operation. Re-creating a time series collection on the same namespace
with different granularity setting does not yield full snapshot
isolation.
