This section covers enabling |global-write| on an |service| cluster.

Considerations
--------------

- You can enable |global-write| in |service| when you deploy an ``M30``
  or greater sharded cluster.

- After you deploy the cluster, you cannot convert a |global-write-cluster|
  to a standard sharded cluster. Before
  creating a |global-write-cluster|, review
  :doc:`Global Clusters Overview </global-clusters>` and
  :doc:`Global Clusters Sharding Reference </global-cluster-sharding>`.
