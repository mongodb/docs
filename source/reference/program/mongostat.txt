Synopsis
--------

The :program:`mongostat` utility provides a quick overview of the
status of a currently running :program:`mongod`
or :program:`mongos`
instance. :program:`mongostat` is functionally similar to the
UNIX/Linux file system utility ``vmstat``, but provides data regarding
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances.

.. seealso::

   For more information about monitoring MongoDB, see
   :doc:`/administration/monitoring`.

   For more background on various other MongoDB status outputs see:

   - :doc:`/reference/command/serverStatus`
   - :doc:`/reference/command/replSetGetStatus`
   - :doc:`/reference/command/dbStats`
   - :doc:`/reference/command/collStats`

   For an additional utility that provides MongoDB metrics see
   :doc:`mongotop </reference/program/mongotop>`.

:program:`mongostat` connects to the :program:`mongod` instance running
on the local host interface on TCP port ``27017``; however,
:program:`mongostat` can connect to any accessible remote :program:`mongod`
instance.

.. _mongostat-fields:

Fields
------

:program:`mongostat` returns values that reflect the operations over a
1 second period. When :command:`mongostat <sleeptime>` has a value
greater than 1, :program:`mongostat` averages the statistics to reflect
average operations per second.

:program:`mongostat` outputs the following fields:

.. describe:: inserts

   The number of objects inserted into the database per second. If
   followed by an asterisk (e.g. ``*``), the datum refers to a
   replicated operation.

.. describe:: query

   The number of query operations per second.

.. describe:: update

   The number of update operations per second.

.. describe:: delete

   The number of delete operations per second.

.. describe:: getmore

   The number of get more (i.e. cursor batch) operations per second.

.. describe:: command

   The number of commands per second. On :term:`slave` and
   :term:`secondary` systems, :program:`mongostat` presents two values
   separated by a pipe character (e.g. ``|``), in the form of
   ``local|replicated`` commands.

.. describe:: flushes

   The number of :term:`fsync` operations per second.

.. describe:: mapped

   The total amount of data mapped in megabytes. This is the total
   data size at the time of the last :program:`mongostat` call.

.. describe:: size

   The amount of virtual memory in megabytes used by the process at
   the time of the last :program:`mongostat` call.

.. describe:: non-mapped

   The total amount of virtual memory excluding all mapped memory at
   the time of the last :program:`mongostat` call.

.. describe:: res

   The amount of resident memory in megabytes used by the process at
   the time of the last :program:`mongostat` call.

.. describe:: faults

   .. versionchanged:: 2.1

   The number of page faults per second.

   Before version 2.1 this value was only provided for MongoDB
   instances running on Linux hosts.

.. describe:: locked

   The percent of time in a global write lock.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      The ``locked db`` field replaces the ``locked %`` field to
      more appropriate data regarding the database specific locks in
      version 2.2.

.. describe:: locked db

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   The percent of time in the per-database context-specific
   lock. :program:`mongostat` will report the database that has spent
   the most time since the last :program:`mongostat` call with a write
   lock.

   This value represents the amount of time that the listed database
   spent in a locked state *combined* with the time that the
   :program:`mongod` spent in the global lock. Because of this, and
   the sampling method, you may see some values greater than 100%.

.. describe:: idx miss

   The percent of index access attempts that required a page fault
   to load a btree node. This is a sampled value.

.. describe:: qr

   The length of the queue of clients waiting to read data from the
   MongoDB instance.

.. describe:: qw

   The length of the queue of clients waiting to write data from the
   MongoDB instance.

.. describe:: ar

   The number of active clients performing read operations.

.. describe:: aw

   The number of active clients performing write operations.

.. describe:: netIn

   The amount of network traffic, in *bytes*, received by the MongoDB instance.

   This includes traffic from :program:`mongostat` itself.

.. describe:: netOut

   The amount of network traffic, in *bytes*, sent by the MongoDB instance.

   This includes traffic from :program:`mongostat` itself.

.. describe:: conn

   The total number of open connections.

.. describe:: set

   The name, if applicable, of the replica set.

.. describe:: repl

   The replication status of the member.

Usage
-----

In the first example, :program:`mongostat` will return data every
second for 20 seconds. :program:`mongostat` collects data from the
:program:`mongod` instance running on the localhost interface on
port 27017. All of the following invocations produce identical
behavior:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongostat --rowcount 20 1
   mongostat --rowcount 20
   mongostat -n 20 1
   mongostat -n 20

In the next example, :program:`mongostat` returns data every 5 minutes
(or 300 seconds) for as long as the program runs. :program:`mongostat`
collects data from the :program:`mongod` instance running on the
localhost interface on port ``27017``. Both of the following
invocations produce identical behavior.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongostat --rowcount 0 300
   mongostat -n 0 300
   mongostat 300

In the following example, :program:`mongostat` returns data every 5
minutes for an hour (12 times.) :program:`mongostat` collects data
from the :program:`mongod` instance running on the localhost interface
on port 27017. Both of the following invocations produce identical
behavior.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongostat --rowcount 12 300
   mongostat -n 12 300

In many cases, using the :option:`--discover <mongostat --discover>`
will help provide a more complete snapshot of the state of an entire
group of machines. If a :program:`mongos` process connected to a
:term:`sharded cluster` is running on port ``27017`` of the local
machine, you can use the following form to return statistics from all
members of the cluster:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongostat --discover
