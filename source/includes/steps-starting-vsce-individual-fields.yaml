  .. note::

     If you want to connect to your deployment using a connection
     string, click :guilabel:`Connect with a connection string`, then 
     paste your connection string into the Command Palette. 

     For more information, see the **Paste Connection String** tab in 
     :ref:`vsce-connect-task`.

  The :guilabel:`General` tab contains the following connection
  field options:

  .. list-table:: 
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Option
       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Hostname`
       - Hostname of the machine where the deployment is
         running.
         
         If you are running your deployment locally, this value is
         ``localhost``. If you are connecting to an |service| cluster,
         you can get your hostname from your cluster detail view in
         |service|.

         If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database
         Administrator for information.

     * - :guilabel:`Port`
       - Port on which the deployment is running. Not required if
         you are using an :guilabel:`SRV Record` to connect to
         your MongoDB deployment.

         By default, a standalone deployment operates on port ``27017``.
         If you are connecting to a replica set, your port may also be
         ``27018`` or ``27019``. For more information on the default
         ports MongoDB operates on, see :manual:`Default MongoDB Port
         </reference/default-mongodb-port/>`.

         If you are not sure of the port where your deployment operates,
         contact your Database Administrator for information.

     * - :guilabel:`SRV Record`
       - Indicates whether the provided :guilabel:`Hostname`
         is an :manual:`SRV Record
         </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`.
         If this toggle is enabled, you do not need to specify a port.

         .. note::

           You can only use SRV connection strings to connect to
           deployments running MongoDB 3.6 and later.

         SRV connection strings have a prefix of ``mongodb+srv:``. If
         you are using an SRV connection string, you do not need to
         include ``mongodb+srv`` in your :guilabel:`Hostname`.

         .. example::

             If the following is your SRV connection string for your
             MongoDB deployment:

             .. code-block:: shell
                 :copyable: false

                 mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@gettingstarted-7q2cs.mongodb.net/test

             Then, in |vsce|, you would specify your
             :guilabel:`Hostname` as:

             .. code-block:: shell
                 :copyable: false

                 gettingstarted-7q2cs.mongodb.net

     * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
       - Authentication to use if the deployment
         requires authentication. |service| clusters use
         :guilabel:`Username / Password` authentication.
         
         Select your authentication method from the tabs below for
         specific instructions:

         .. tabs::

           tabs:
             - id: username-pw
               name: Username / Password
               content: |
                 Select :guilabel:`Username / Password` if the
                 deployment uses either MongoDB-CR or
                 :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 </core/security-scram/>` as its
                 authentication mechanism.
                 
                 Provide the :guilabel:`Username`, :guilabel:`Password`,
                 and :manual:`Authentication Database
                 </core/security-users/#user-authentication-database>`
                 to authenticate the user.

                 .. note::

                    Starting in MongoDB version 4.0, MongoDB removes
                    support for the deprecated MongoDB
                    Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication
                    mechanism.

             - id: scram-sha-256
               name: SCRAM-SHA-256
               content: |
                 Select :guilabel:`SCRAM-SHA-256` if the deployment uses
                 :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>` as its
                 authentication mechanism (*New in MongoDB 4.0*). If
                 selected, you must provide the :guilabel:`Username`,
                 :guilabel:`Password`, and :manual:`Authentication
                 Database
                 </core/security-users/#user-authentication-database>`
                 to authenticate the user.

                 For more information on the ``SCRAM``
                 authentication mechanism, see :manual:`SCRAM
                 </core/security-scram/>`.

             - id: ldap
               name: LDAP
               content: |

                 Select :guilabel:`LDAP` if the deployment
                 uses :manual:`LDAP </core/security-ldap-external/>`
                 as its authentication mechanism. If selected, you
                 must provide the :guilabel:`Username` and
                 :guilabel:`Password` to authenticate
                 the user.

             - id: x509
               name: X.509
               content: |

                 Select :guilabel:`X.509` if the deployment uses
                 :manual:`X.509 </core/security-x.509/>` as its
                 authentication mechanism. If selected, you must
                 provide the  :guilabel:`Username` to authenticate
                 the user.

                 .. note::

                    If you are using 
                    :atlas:`Atlas-managed certificates </security-add-mongodb-users/#select-an-authentication-method>`
                    , your username must be prefaced by "CN="
                    per `RFC 2253 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253>__`. 
                    For example, the username "X509User" must be 
                    provided as "CN=X509User".

  If you are connecting to your deployment using TLS/SSL or an SSH
  tunnel, refer to the following tabs for specific instructions:
  
  .. tabs::
     
     .. tab:: Connect Using TLS/SSL
        :tabid: ssl

        This option directs |vsce| to connect to your
        MongoDB deployment via TLS/SSL. You can select one of the
        following SSL options:

        .. list-table::
           :header-rows: 1
           :widths: 10 40

           * - Option
             - Description
           
           * - :guilabel:`System CA/Atlas Deployment`
             - Connect to
               `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`_.

           * - :guilabel:`Server Validation`
             - |vsce| validates the identity of the deployment. If
               selected, you must provide:

               .. list-table::
                  :widths: 35 65

                  * - :guilabel:`Certificate Authority`

                    - One or more certificate files from trusted
                      Certificate Authorities to validate the
                      certificate provided by the deployment.

           * - :guilabel:`Server and Client Validation`
             - The deployment performs certificate validation from its
               clients and |vsce| validates the identity of the
               deployment. If selected, you must provide:

               .. list-table::
                  :widths: 35 65

                  * - :guilabel:`Certificate Authority File`

                    - One or more certificate files from trusted
                      Certificate Authorities to validate the
                      certificate provided by the deployment.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Certificate`

                    - A TLS/SSL certificate to present to
                      the deployment to verify the identity of
                      the connecting client. Typical file extensions
                      for the certificate are ``.crt`` or ``.pem``.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Private Key`

                    - A TLS/SSL key file to the deployment to
                      verify the identity of the connecting client.
                      Typical file extensions for the private key are
                      ``.key`` or ``.pem``.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Key Password`

                    - If the *Client Private Key* is protected with a
                      password/passphrase, you must provide the
                      password/passphrase.

           * - :guilabel:`Unvalidated (Insecure)`
             - Use TLS/SSL without any identity validation.

        .. tip::

           For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
           certificates generated and signed by a single certificate
           authority. You or your organization can generate and
           maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
           certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL vendor.
  
     .. tab:: Connect Using SSH
        :tabid: ssh

        This option directs |vsce| to connect to your
        MongoDB deployment via an SSH tunnel. The tunnel automatically
        starts when you connect to MongoDB and stops when you
        disconnect.

        In the :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel` dropdown, choose either a
        password or an identity file to provide authentication. Once
        you select your identification method, specify the following
        options:

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 10 40

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Hostname`

             - Enter the bastion (jumpbox) hostname. This is the
               unique identifier (Fully Qualified Domain Name, or
               FQDN) for the machine to be accessed.


           * - :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel Port`

             - Provide the port used for the SSH connection. This
               defaults to 22, the standard port for SSH.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Username`

             - The username of the profile to log into on the remote
               system. This will be the user for which you want to
               establish the SSH connection.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Identity File`

             - Select the file from which the identity (private key)
               for SSH public key authentication is read.

               Unix or OS X: If using OpenSSH, identity files are
               found in the :file:`~/.ssh` directory. By default,
               the private key files have one of the following file
               names:

               - ``id_dsa``
               - ``id_ecdsa``
               - ``id_ed25519``
               - ``id_rsa``

               On Windows, the location of the identify files
               depends on your choice of SSH client, such as PuTTY.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Passphrase`

             - If your private key is encrypted, provide the
               passphrase used to decrypt your private key (stored
               in the specified identity file). A passphrase
               provides an extra layer of security for an SSH
               connection.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Password`
             -  The password used to secure the SSH connection.
                This is required if you are not using an identity file.

        To use an SSH tunnel through a bastion host, the SSH
        configuration on the bastion host must allow TCP port
        forwarding; i.e., the ``AllowTcpForwarding`` directive in
        the :file:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file is set to ``yes``. If
        ``AllowTcpForwarding`` is not set to ``yes``, set to ``yes``
        and restart the SSH daemon (``sudo service sshd restart``).

        Instead of creating the SSH tunnel using |vsce|, you can also 
        create the tunnel manually from the command line:

        .. code-block:: sh

           ssh -L <local_port>:<mongodb_hostname>:<mongodb_port> \
              <user>@<bastion_hostname> -fN

        .. example::

           If you have a deployment running on
           ``hostname-a.com`` on port 27017, and the
           bastion host is ``hostname-b.com`` with user name
           ``ec2-user``, you can build the tunnel via

           .. code-block:: sh

              ssh -L 27000:hostname-a.com:27017 ec2-user@hostname-b.com -fN

           Using this SSH tunnel, you can now connect |vsce| (or
           the :binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell) to
           ``localhost:27000`` to connect to the deployment running on
           ``hostname-a.com``.

        .. note::

           You cannot connect to a :term:`replica set` via an SSH
           tunnel. |vsce| cannot establish a connection
           to multiple servers across the same SSH tunnel.
