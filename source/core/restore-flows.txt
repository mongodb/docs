Restore Flows

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
------------

When you request a restore, the Backup Daemon prepares the snapshot you
will receive. If you choose to restore manually, you either download the
files from the |http-service| or
the Backup Daemon securely copies the files to the destination server.

The following sections describe the flows for manual restores of scheduled
snapshots and custom snapshots according to delivery option.

HTTP Restore
------------

Snapshot
~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/http-pull-snapshot-restore.rst

With the HTTP PULL snapshot restore, the Backup Daemon simply creates
a link to the appropriate snapshot in the Backup Blockstore Database.
When the user clicks the download link, they download the snapshot from
the |http-service|, which streams the file out of the
Backup Blockstore.

This restore method has the advantage of taking up **no** space on the
server hosting the Backup Daemon: the file passes directly from the
Backup Blockstore to the destination server.

Point-In-Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/http-pull-point-in-time-restore.rst

The HTTP PULL point-in-time restore follows the same pattern as the HTTP
PULL snapshot restore, with added steps for applying the oplog. When the
user requests the restore, the Backup Daemon retrieves the snapshot that
immediately precedes the point in time and writes that snapshot to
disk. The Backup Daemon then retrieves oplog entries from the Oplog
Store Database and applies them, creating a custom snapshot from that point
in time. The Daemon then writes the snapshot back to the Backup
Blockstore. Finally, when the user clicks the download link, the user
downloads the snapshot from the |http-service|, which streams the file
out of the Backup Blockstore.

This restore method requires that you have adequate space on the server
hosting the Backup Daemon for the snapshot files and oplog.

Archive SCP Restore
-------------------

Snapshot
~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/scp-snapshot-archive.rst

For a snapshot restore, with SCP archive delivery, the Backup Daemon
simply retrieves the snapshot from the Backup Blockstore and writes it
to its disk. The Backup Daemon then combines and compresses the snapshot into a
``.tar.gz`` archive and securely copies the archive to the destination
server.

This restore method requires that you have adequate space on the server
hosting the Backup Daemon for the snapshot files and archive.

Point-In-Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/scp-point-in-time-archive.rst

The point-in-time restore with SCP archive delivery follows the same
pattern as the snapshot restore, but with added steps for applying the
oplog. 

When the user requests the restore, the Backup Daemon retrieves
the snapshot that immediately precedes the point in time and writes
that snapshot to disk. The Backup Daemon then retrieves oplog entries
from the Oplog Store Database and applies them, creating a custom snapshot
for that point in time. The Backup Daemon then combines and compresses
the snapshot into a ``tar.gz`` archive and securely copies the archive
to the destination server.

This restore method requires that you have adequate space on the server
hosting the Backup Daemon for the snapshot files, oplog, and archive.

.. _scp-individual-files:

Individual Files SCP Restore
----------------------------

Snapshot
~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/scp-snapshot-individual-files.rst

For a snapshot restore, with SCP individual files delivery, the Backup
Daemon simply retrieves the snapshot from the Backup Blockstore and
securely copies the data files to the target directory on the destination server.

This restore method also has the advantage of taking up no space on the
server hosting the Backup Daemon: the file passes directly from the
Backup Blockstore to the destination server. The destination server
requires only sufficient space for the uncompressed data files. The data
*is* compressed during transmission.

Point-In-Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /images/scp-point-in-time-individual-files.rst

The point-in-time restore with SCP individual files delivery follows the same
pattern as the snapshot restore, but with added steps for applying the
oplog. 

When the user requests the restore, the Backup Daemon retrieves the
snapshot that immediately precedes the point in time and writes that
snapshot to disk. The Backup Daemon then retrieves oplog entries from
the Oplog Store Database and applies them, creating a custom snapshot for
that point in time. The Backup Daemon then securely copies the data
files to the target directory on the destination server

This restore method also requires that you have adequate space on the
server hosting the Backup Daemon for the snapshot files and oplog. The
destination server requires only sufficient space for the uncompressed
data files. The data *is* compressed during transmission.
