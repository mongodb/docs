System Requirements
-------------------

MongoDB Community Edition requires Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or 
later or Microsoft Windows 7 or later on an x86 64-bit architecture. 
The Windows installer (``.msi``) file includes all other
software dependencies and automatically upgrades any previous version 
of MongoDB that was installed using an ``.msi`` file.

To find which version, service pack, and build of Windows is  
running on your host and the processor type of that host, enter the 
following command in either the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` or 
:guilabel:`Powershell`:

.. code-block:: powershell

   PS C:\> systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"

.. code-block:: powershell
   :copyable: false

   OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
   OS Version:                10.0.17134 N/A Build 17134
   System Type:               x64-based PC

.. important:: If you are running any edition of Windows Server 2008
   R2 or Windows 7, please install `a hotfix to resolve an issue with
   memory mapped files on Windows 
   <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`_.

Run MongoDB Community Edition

.. warning::

   Do not make :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` visible on public networks without

   designed to be run in trusted environments, and the database does not
   enable "Secure Mode" by default.

Manually Create a Windows Service for MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.

The following procedure assumes you have installed MongoDB Community 
using the ``.msi`` installer with the path 
``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\``.

If you have installed in an alternative directory, you must
adjust the paths as appropriate.
