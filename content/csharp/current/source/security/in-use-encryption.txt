      .. warning:: MongoDB 8.2 Known Issue

         On Windows platforms, you cannot run version 8.2.0 of ``mongocryptd`` with
         the default spawn arguments. To avoid this issue, you must manually start the ``mongocryptd``
         process and specify the ``--logpath`` argument. Alternatively, use the
         :ref:`Automatic Encryption Shared Library <qe-reference-shared-library>`
         instead of ``mongocryptd``.

         To learn more about this issue and how to resolve it, see :ref:`8.2-known-issues`
         in the MongoDB 8.2 Release Notes.
