The schema generation tool :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` outputs a schema
file in :ref:`Document Relational Definition Language <drdl>` (DRDL)
format. Examine the generated schema's table structure and field types
to verify that the generated schema supports your reporting
requirements.

You can manually edit the schema definition files to perform the
following actions:

- Add fields that :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` didn't discover within
  the subset of documents that it sampled
- Remove fields
- Remove tables
- Rename tables, so long as the ``collection`` field remains the same
- Rename fields using the ``sqlname`` option

When you're done editing your ``.drdl`` file, you can follow the steps in
one of the following options:

- Option 1. Upload the schema, give it a name, and start :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`,
  specifying both the schema's name, source, and mode, as in the following steps:

  1. Use :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` to :commandoption:`upload` the schema
     to your MongoDB deployment, similar to the following example:

     .. code-block:: sh
   
      mongodrdl upload --host <hostName> --schemaSource schemas --drdl ./movies.drdl

     The string representation of the :ref:`ObjectId <document-bson-type-object-id>`
     of the uploaded schema is returned:

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false
   
        5d793f3f6a26a3ce66c304ea

  2. Name your schema, using the :commandoption:`name-schema <name-schema>`
     command, similar to the following example:

     .. code-block:: sh
   
        mongodrdl name-schema --name movies --schemaSource schemas --schema 5d793f3f6a26a3ce66c304ea

  3. Start :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` with a named schema, using
     :option:`--schemaSource <mongosqld --schema>`,
     :option:`--schemaMode <mongosqld --schema>`,
     and :option:`--schemaName <mongosqld --schemaName>` options,
     similar to the following example:

     .. code-block::

        mongosqld --schemaMode custom --schemaSource schemas --schemaName movies

- Option 2. Start :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` with the
  :option:`--schema <mongosqld --schema>` option to specify the path to the
  ``.drdl`` schema file.
