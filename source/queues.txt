Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use MongoDB as your database for
Laravel Queue. Laravel Queue allows you to create queued jobs that are
processed in the background.

Configuration
-------------

To use MongoDB as your database for Laravel Queue, change
the driver in your application's ``config/queue.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

   'connections' => [
       'database' => [
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           // You can also specify your jobs-specific database
           // in the config/database.php file
           'connection' => 'mongodb',
           'table' => 'jobs',
           'queue' => 'default',
           // Optional setting
           // 'retry_after' => 60,
       ],
   ],

The following table describes properties that you can specify to configure
the behavior of the queue:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``driver``
     - **Required** Queue driver to use. The value of
       this property must be ``mongodb``.

   * - ``connection``
     - Database connection used to store jobs. It must be a
       ``mongodb`` connection. The driver uses the default connection if
       a connection is not specified.

   * - ``table``
     - **Required** Name of the MongoDB collection to
       store jobs to process.

   * - ``queue``
     - **Required** Name of the queue.

   * - ``retry_after``
     - Specifies how many seconds the queue connection should wait
       before retrying a job that is being processed. The value is
       ``60`` by default.

To use MongoDB to handle *failed jobs*, create a ``failed`` entry in your
application's ``config/queue.php`` file and specify the database and
collection:

.. code-block:: php

   'failed' => [
       'driver' => 'mongodb',
       'database' => 'mongodb',
       'table' => 'failed_jobs',
   ],

The following table describes properties that you can specify to configure
how to handle failed jobs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``driver``
     - **Required** Queue driver to use. The value of
       this property must be ``mongodb``.

   * - ``database``
     - Database connection used to store jobs. It must be
       a ``mongodb`` connection. The driver uses the default connection
       if a connection is not specified.

   * - ``table``
     - Name of the MongoDB collection to store failed
       jobs. The value is ``failed_jobs`` by default.

To register failed jobs, you can use the default failed
job provider from Laravel. To learn more, see
`Dealing With Failed Jobs
<https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/queues#dealing-with-failed-jobs>`__ in
the Laravel documentation on Queues.

Job Batching
------------

**Job batching** is a Laravel feature that enables you to execute a
batch of jobs and related actions before, after, and during the
execution of the jobs from the queue. To learn more about this feature,
see `Job Batching <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/queues#job-batching>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

In MongoDB, you don't have to create a designated collection before
using job batching. The ``job_batches`` collection is created
automatically to store metadata about your job batches, such as
their completion percentage.

To enable job batching, create the ``batching`` entry in your
application's ``config/queue.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

    'batching' => [
       'driver' => 'mongodb',
       'database' => 'mongodb',
       'table' => 'job_batches',
   ],

The following table describes properties that you can specify to configure
job batching:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``driver``
     - **Required** Queue driver to use. The value of
       this property must be ``mongodb``.

   * - ``database``
     - Database connection used to store jobs. It must be a
       ``mongodb`` connection. The driver uses the default connection if
       a connection is not specified.

   * - ``table``
     - Name of the MongoDB collection to store job
       batches. The value is ``job_batches`` by default.

Then, add the service provider in your application's ``config/app.php``
file:

The {+odm-short+} automatically provides the
``MongoDB\Laravel\MongoDBBusServiceProvider::class`` class as the
service provider for job batching.
