Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify configuration options for a
collection in your {+odm+} application.

Configure Collection Options
----------------------------

You can specify configuration options for a collection by using the
``:collection_options`` argument with the ``store_in``
macro. The ``:collection_options`` argument accepts any collection option that
your {+ruby-driver+} and {+mdb-server+} versions support.

.. note::

   You must explicitly create a collection to apply any specified collection
   options. Create your collection by running the collection management Rake task, as
   shown in :ref:`mongoid-create-collection-rake` section of this guide.

To learn more about collection options available in the {+ruby-driver+},
see the :ruby:`Databases and Collections </databases-collection/>` guide
in the {+ruby-driver+} documentation.

The following sections show examples of how to configure collection options when
using {+odm+}.

Time Series Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over a
period of time. The following example shows how to configure a time series
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/collection-config.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-time-series-config
   :end-before: # end-time-series-config
   :emphasize-lines: 7-13

To learn more about time series collections, see the :manual:`Time Series Collections
</core/timeseries-collections/#time-series-collections/>` guide in the MongoDB {+server-manual+}.

Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Capped collections have maximum size or document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond a specified threshold. The following example shows how to configure
a capped collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/collection-config.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-capped-collection-config
   :end-before: # end-capped-collection-config
   :emphasize-lines: 4-7

To learn more about capped collections, see the :manual:`Capped Collections
</core/capped-collections/>` guide in the MongoDB {+server-manual+}.

Default Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collations are sets of rules for how to compare strings, typically in a
particular natural language. The following example shows how to specify a
default collation to use on a
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/collection-config.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-default-collation-config
   :end-before: # end-default-collation-config
   :emphasize-lines: 4-8

To learn more about collations, see the :manual:`Collation
</reference/collation/>` guide in the MongoDB {+server-manual+}.

.. _mongoid-create-collection-rake:

Collection Management Rake Task
-------------------------------

To apply the collection options you specify in your {+odm+} application, you
must explicitly create the corresponding collection. To do so, use the
``db:mongoid:create_collections`` Rake task by running the following command in
your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   rake db:mongoid:create_collections

You can also run the ``create_collection`` command on a single model in the
Rails console, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Model.create_collection
