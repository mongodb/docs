Roll Back a Deployment
======================

Overview
--------

You can roll back an App's configuration to a previously deployed
version. App Services can automatically redeploy any of an App's
{+deployment-history-size+} most recent deployments. For older
deployments, you must manually get and deploy the configuration files
(e.g. from source control).

A redeploy rolls back your application's configuration to match the
earlier version.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You will need the following to rollback an App in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      You will need the following to rollback an App with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/api-project-app-id.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: View Your App's Deployment History

            You can redeploy from your App's Deployment History page. To
            get there, click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left
            navigation menu and then select the :guilabel:`History` tab.

         .. step:: Redeploy a Deployment

            In the deployment history list, find the deployment you want
            to roll back to. Click the :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button for
            that deployment.

         .. step:: Confirm Rollback Success

            After the deployment completes, you'll see the deployment success banner.
            The new deployment appears in your Deployment History.

            If you have GitHub deployment enabled, it also contains a link to the
            commit in the GitHub repository.

            In the linked GitHub repository, the commit author is the
            ``mongodb-realm`` bot.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Find the Deployment ID

            You need the ``_id`` of the deployment you want to redeploy.
            To find it, call the :admin-api-endpoint:`List Deployments
            <operation/adminListDeployments>` endpoint, which responds
            with a list of the App's {+deployment-history-size+} most
            recent deployments.

            Find the deployment you want to redeploy in the list and
            copy its ``_id``.

                    }
                  ]

         .. step:: Redeploy the App

            You can roll back to a previous deployment by calling the
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Redeploy a Deployment
            <operation/adminRedeployDeployment>` endpoint. Pass the
            ``_id`` of the deployment you want to redeploy as the
            ``deploymentId`` parameter.

            .. code-block:: bash

               curl -X GET \
                 https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/deployments/{deploymentId}/redeploy \
                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
