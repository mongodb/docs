- X.509 internal authentication between MongoDB nodes in a cluster.
- X.509 authentication from clients to your MongoDB instances.
- |tls| to encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in a replica set
  or sharded cluster.
- |tls| to encrypt connections client applications and MongoDB
  deployments.
