stepnum: 7
ref:  create-org-require-api-access-list
content: |
   When you create a new organization, |mms| requires IP access
   lists for the {+admin-api+} by default. If you require an IP
   access list, your {+admin-api+} keys can make API requests
   only from the location-based IP or |cidr| addresses that you specify
   in the IP access list.
   
   To disable the IP access list requirement and allow your 
   {+admin-api+} keys to make requests from any address on the internet, toggle 
   :guilabel:`Require IP Access List for the {+admin-api+}`
   to :guilabel:`OFF`.
   
   To learn more, see :ref:`access-list-for-api-operations`.
