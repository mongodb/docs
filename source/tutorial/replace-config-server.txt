=======================
Replace a Config Server
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This procedure replaces an inoperable
:ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` in a
:doc:`sharded cluster </core/sharding>`. Use this procedure only
to replace a config server that has become inoperable (e.g. hardware
failure).

This process assumes that the hostname of the instance will not change.
If you must change the hostname of the instance, use the procedure to
:doc:`migrate a config server and use a new hostname
<migrate-config-servers-with-different-hostnames>`.

Considerations
--------------

In the course of this procedure *never* remove a config server from
the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` parameter on any of the :program:`mongos`
instances. If you need to change the name of a config server,
always make sure that all :program:`mongos` instances have three
config servers specified in the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting at all
times.

Procedure
---------

#. Disable the cluster balancer process temporarily. See
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` for more information.

#. Provision a new system, with the same hostname as the previous
   host.

   You will have to ensure that the new system has the same IP address
   and hostname as the system it's replacing *or* you will need to
   modify the DNS records and wait for them to propagate.

#. Shut down the *one* (and only one) config server that you are
   replacing. Copy all of this host's :setting:`~storage.dbPath` file
   system tree from the current system to the system that will provide
   the new config server. This command, issued on the system with the
   data files, may resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rsync -az /data/configdb mongodb.config2.example.net:/data/configdb

#. Update DNS and/or networking so that new config server is
   accessible by the sane name as the previous config server.

#. Start the *new* config server. The default invocation is:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr

#. Re-enable the balancer to allow the cluster to resume normal
   balancing operations. See the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` section for more
   information on managing the balancer process.
