Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a **change stream** to monitor real-time
changes to your data. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+} feature that
allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a collection, database,
or deployment.

When using the {+php-library+}, you can call the ``watch()`` method to return an
instance of ``MongoDB\ChangeStream``. Then, you can iterate through the 
``MongoDB\ChangeStream`` instance to monitor data changes, such as updates,
insertions, and deletions.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your PHP application, instantiate a ``MongoDB\Client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following value to your ``$collection`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-db-coll
   :end-before: end-db-coll

.. tip:: 

   To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
   :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Some examples use the ``toJSON()`` function to represent change events, which are BSON 
documents, as Extended JSON. To use this function, paste the following code into your
application file:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-to-json
   :end-before: end-to-json

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method. The instance on which you
call the ``watch()`` method determines the scope of events that the change
stream monitors. You can call the ``watch()`` method on instances of the following
classes:

- ``MongoDB\Client``: Monitor all changes in the MongoDB deployment
- ``MongoDB\Database``: Monitor changes in all collections in the database
- ``MongoDB\Collection``: Monitor changes in the collection

The following example opens a change stream on the ``restaurants`` collection
and outputs changes as they occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :start-after: start-open-change-stream
   :end-before: end-open-change-stream
   :language: php
   :dedent:

To begin watching for changes, run the preceding code. Then, in a separate
shell, modify the ``restaurants`` collection. The following example updates
a document that has a ``name`` field value of ``'Blarney Castle'``:

.. _php-change-stream-update:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
   :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
   :language: php
   :dedent:

When you update the collection, the change stream application prints the change
as it occurs. The printed change event resembles the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "_data" : "..." }, "operationType" : "update", "clusterTime" :
   { "$timestamp" : { ... } }, "wallTime" : { "$date" : "..." }, "ns" : { "db" :
   "sample_restaurants", "coll" : "restaurants" }, "documentKey" : { "_id" : 
   { "$oid" : "..." } }, "updateDescription" : { "updatedFields" : { "cuisine" : "Irish" },
   "removedFields" : [  ], "truncatedArrays" : [  ] } }

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

To modify the change stream output, you can pass pipeline stages in an array as a
parameter to the ``watch()`` method. You can include the following stages in the
array:

- ``$addFields`` or ``$set``: Adds new fields to documents
- ``$match``: Filters the documents
- ``$project``: Projects a subset of the document fields
- ``$replaceWith`` or ``$replaceRoot``: Replaces the input document with the
  specified document
- ``$redact``: Restricts the contents of the documents
- ``$unset``: Removes fields from documents

The following example passes a pipeline that includes the ``$match`` stage to the
``watch()`` method. This instructs the ``watch()`` method to output events only
when update operations occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
   :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
   :language: php
   :dedent:

.. tip:: Operations with Builders

   You can use a builder pattern to create the change stream pipeline.
   To learn more, see the :ref:`php-builders` guide.

Modify ``watch()`` Behavior
---------------------------

To modify the behavior of the ``watch()`` method, you can pass an options array
as a parameter to ``watch()``. The following table describes useful options you
can set in the array:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``fullDocument``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document after the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see the :ref:`php-change-stream-pre-post-image` section of this
         guide.

   * - ``fullDocumentBeforeChange``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document as it was before the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`php-change-stream-pre-post-image`.

   * - ``startAfter``
     - | Instructs ``watch()`` to start a new change stream after the
         operation specified in the resume token. This field allows notifications to
         resume after an invalidate event.
       | Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the ``_id``
         field. Pass the entire ``_id`` field of the change event document that
         represents the operation you want to resume after.
       | This option is mutually exclusive with ``resumeAfter`` and ``startAtOperationTime``.

   * - ``startAtOperationTime``
     - | Instructs the change stream to only provide changes that occurred at or after
         the specified timestamp. 
       | This option is mutually exclusive with ``startAfter`` and ``resumeAfter``.

   * - ``collation``
     - | Sets the collation to use for the change stream cursor.

For a full list of ``watch()`` options, see `MongoDB\\Collection::watch()
<{+api+}/method/MongoDBCollection-watch/>`__ in the API
documentation.

.. _php-change-stream-pre-post-image:

Include Pre-Images and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You can enable pre-images and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses MongoDB v6.0 or later.

By default, when you perform an operation on a collection, the
corresponding change event includes only the delta of the fields
modified by that operation. To see the full document before or after a
change, specify the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` or the ``fullDocument``
options in an array parameter to ``watch()``.

The **pre-image** is the full version of a document *before* a change. To include the
pre-image in the change stream event, set the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` option
to one of the following values:

- ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes
  a pre-image of the modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, this
  change event field has a ``null`` value.
- ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_REQUIRED``: The change event includes a pre-image
  of the modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, the
  server raises an error.  

The **post-image** is the full version of a document *after* a change. To include the
post-image in the change stream event, set the ``fullDocument`` option to
one of the following values:

- ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_UPDATE_LOOKUP``: The change event includes a
  copy of the entire changed document from some time after the change.
- ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes
  a post-image of the modified document for change events. If the post-image is not
  available, this change event field has a ``null`` value.
- ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_REQUIRED``: The change event includes a post-image
  of the modified document for change events. If the post-image is not available, the
  server raises an error.

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method on a collection and includes the post-image
of updated documents by setting the ``fullDocument`` option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.php
   :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
   :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
   :language: php
   :dedent:

With the change stream application running in a separate shell, updating a
document in the ``restaurants`` collection by using the :ref:`preceding update
example <php-change-stream-update>` prints a change event resembling the following
output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3-6

   { "_id" : { "_data" : "..." }, "operationType" : "update", "clusterTime" :
   { "$timestamp" : { ... } }, "wallTime" : { "$date" : "..." },
   "fullDocument" : { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." }, "address" : { "building" : 
   "202-24", "coord" : [ -73.925044200000002093, 40.559546199999999772 ], "street"
   : "Rockaway Point Boulevard", "zipcode" : "11697" }, "borough" : "Queens",
   "cuisine" : "Irish", "grades" : [ ...], "name" : "Blarney Castle", "restaurant_id" :
   "40366356" }, "ns" : { "db" : "sample_restaurants", "coll" : "restaurants" },
   "documentKey" : { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." } }, "updateDescription" :
   { "updatedFields" : { "cuisine" : "Irish" }, "removedFields" : [  ],
   "truncatedArrays" : [  ] } }
