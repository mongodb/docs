   You can either:

   - Copy the ``mongosh`` binary into a directory listed in your
     ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Run the following
     commands from the directory where you extracted the download file:

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp mongosh /usr/local/bin/
       sudo cp mongosh_crypt_v1.dylib /usr/local/lib/

   - Create symbolic links to the ``MongoDB Shell``. Switch to the
     directory where you extracted the files from the ``.tgz`` archive.
     Run the following command to create links to a directory already
     in your ``PATH`` such as ``/usr/local/bin``. 

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
