*Time to Complete: 8 minutes*

Prerequisites
-------------

- To complete this tutorial you will need a
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_ cluster. Refer
  to the :atlas:`Create a Cluster </create-new-cluster/>` documentation
  for instructions on creating an |service| cluster.

- Whitelist the IP address from which you will be
  going through this tutorial in your |service|
  :atlas:`project whitelist </security-whitelist/>`.

Load the Sample Data into Your |service| Cluster
------------------------------------------------

|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
cluster. To load sample data into your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data.rst

Add the Supply Store Collection as a Data Source
------------------------------------------------

Once |service| finishes loading the data, you can add the collection
containing the sample data as a :doc:`data source </data-sources>` in
|charts-short|. Adding a collection as a data source links the
collection to |charts-short| and allows you to visualize that data.

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-data-source-supplies.rst

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have established the data source in |charts-short|, you
can :ref:`Create a New Dashboard <order-data-new-dash>` which will
use this data source to create visualizations.
