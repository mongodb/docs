Patch Releases
--------------

.. _1.7.3-c2c-release-notes:

1.7.3 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**June 4, 2024**

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.0.0 where the destination may have missing
  or extra indexes after mongosync is committed. This is an unlikely
  edge case.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.0.0 where mongosync may miss change events
  for a document. This is an unlikely edge case that is only possible if
  the destination server version is MongoDB 5.0 or earlier.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.7.0 that could result in size mismatches
  between source and destination capped collections. This can only
  affect migrations if all of the following conditions are met:
  
  - The source cluster is MongoDB 6.0 or earlier.
  
  - The destination cluster is MongoDB 7.0 or later.
  
  - A capped collection's size was modified during a migration.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.0.0 where mongosync ignored the
  ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages`` field in ``modify`` change events.
  This could result in a destination collection having a different value
  for this field compared to its source collection. mongosync now
  correctly handles this field.

- Mitigated bug introduced in v1.0.0 that could result in missed change
  events when mongosync is interrupted and resumed. This is an unlikely
  edge case.

Other Changes:

- Adds a two minute delay when restarting and resuming sync operations.

Limitations:

- You must stop the balancer on both the source and destination sharded
  clusters for the entire lifetime of a migration. If you try to start
  mongosync while the balancer is still running, it throws an error.

- You must not run the ``moveChunk`` or ``moveRange`` commands on the
  destination cluster. If you try to run these commands on the source
  cluster, mongosync throws an error.

- mongosync reads from the destination cluster using the ``primary``
  read preference. If you try to start mongosync with a different read
  preference, it throws an error.


.. _1.7.2-c2c-release-notes:

1.7.2 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**April 4, 2024**

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.5.0 where mongosync could miss change
  events when reading documents from a lagging secondary node by
  disabling the Oplog Rollover Resilience mechanism.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.1.0 where mongosync could miss
  copying documents during long running reads in the initial
  copying phase if the source cluster is sharded and the source
  balancer is enabled.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.5.0 that could result in data
  inconsistencies when mongosync is killed or paused during
  the initial collection copy phase and then resumed.

  This can only affect migrations if:

  - The migration includes mixed _id types and the destination
    cluster runs MongoDB 4.4 or earlier.

  - The migration includes capped collections and the
    destination cluster runs MongoDB 6.0 or later.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.0.0 where indexes could be created
  on the destination cluster that were dropped on the source
  cluster during migration.

  This can only affect migrations where the given index is both
  created and dropped while mongosync is running.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.0.0 that could result in
  collections being created on the destination cluster with
  incorrect types, options, or indexes.

  This can only affect migrations where collections are dropped
  or renamed while mongosync is running and the source or
  destination cluster runs MongoDB 6.0.0 to 6.0.12 or MongoDB
  7.0.0 or 7.0.3.

- Fixed bug introduced in v1.1.0 that could result in a
  mongosync crash if shard key indexes on the source cluster
  have inconsistent values across shards for the "background"
  index build option.

  This can only affect migrations that involve sharded
  collections and source clusters older than MongoDB 6.0.

Other Changes:

- Disables the Oplog Rollover Resilience mechanism.

- Live upgrade to mongosync 1.7.2 is not allowed.

- Reduces latency of the mongosync API.

Limitations:

- mongosync must read from the source cluster using the
  :readmode:`primary` read preference. If you try to start mongosync
  with a different read preference, it throws an error.

- You must stop the balancer on a sharded source cluster until
  mongosync finishes the collection copy phase. If you try to
  start mongosync while the balancer is still running, it throws
  an error.

- You must not run the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` or :dbcommand:`moveRange`
  commands on the source cluster. If these are run on the
  source cluster, mongosync throws an error.

.. _1.7.1-c2c-release-notes:

1.7.1 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**November 9, 2023**

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug that caused mongosync to crash when attempting to live
  upgrade from version 1.6. The bug does not result in modified user data
  and doesn't preclude the sync from being continued using version 1.7.1.

.. _1.7.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.7.0 Release
-------------

**October 18, 2023**

Live Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/live-upgrade.rst

For details, see :ref:`c2c-versioning-live-upgrade`.

Synchronize Data Between Clusters with Different MongoDB Server Major Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/cross-version-sync.rst

Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

- ``mongosync`` now truncates logged fields that contain more than 1,024
  characters.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed bug introduced in ``mongosync`` 1.5.0 that may cause ORR to insert
  capped collection documents out of order. That is, documents on the source
  and destination cluster may not be deleted from the capped collection in the
  same order. This bug is only triggered if documents are inserted into a
  capped collection during migration, before or while the Collection Copy phase
  is working on the same capped collection.

- Fixed bug introduced in 1.6 that caused ``mongosync`` to fail during
  initialization if the user specified only an exclusion filter and there were
  no fully excluded databases.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.7.3, the minimum supported version of MongoDB is 6.0.13 and 7.0.6.
