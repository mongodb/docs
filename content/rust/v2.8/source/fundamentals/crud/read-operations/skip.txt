Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to perform a read
operation that skips a specified number of documents when returning results.

Sample Data for Examples
------------------------

The examples in this guide use the following ``Book`` struct as a model for
documents in the ``books`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/skip.rs
   :start-after: start-book-struct
   :end-before: end-book-struct
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

The following code shows how to insert sample data into the ``books``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/skip.rs
   :start-after: start-sample-data
   :end-before: end-sample-data
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

Skip Documents
--------------

You can skip results retrieved by a query, or you can skip results within an
aggregation pipeline. 

If the number of skipped documents exceeds the number of matched documents for a
query, then that query returns no documents.

Find operations return documents in a natural order that is not sorted on any
fields. To avoid skipping random documents, use the ``sort()`` method to sort
documents on a field with a unique value before setting a skip option. To learn
more, see the :ref:`rust-sort-guide` guide.

.. _rust-skip-example:

Query Results Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To skip documents, you can initialize a ``FindOptions`` instance and specify the
number of documents you want to skip using the ``skip()`` method. Then, pass
your ``FindOptions`` struct as a parameter to the ``find()`` method.

This example runs a ``find()`` operation that performs the following actions:

- Sorts the results in ascending order of their ``author`` field values
- Skips the first two documents
- Returns the remaining documents

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/skip.rs
      :start-after: start-skip-example
      :end-before: end-skip-example
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Book { name: "A Dance with Dragons", author: "Martin", length: 1104 }
      Book { name: "Atlas Shrugged", author: "Rand", length: 1088 }

.. _rust-aggregation-skip:

Aggregation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``$skip`` stage in an aggregation pipeline to skip documents. To
learn more about aggregation operations, see the :ref:`rust-aggregation` guide.

This example runs an aggregation pipeline that performs the following actions:

- Sorts the results in ascending order of their ``author`` field values
- Skips the first document
- Returns the remaining documents

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/skip.rs
      :start-after: start-aggregation-example
      :end-before: end-aggregation-example
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("Les Misérables"), "author": String("Hugo"), "length": Int32(1462)})
      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("A Dance with Dragons"), "author": String("Martin"), "length": Int32(1104)})
      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("Atlas Shrugged"), "author": String("Rand"), "length": Int32(1088)})
