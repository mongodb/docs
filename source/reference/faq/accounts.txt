If you created your |service| account using a Gmail or Google Apps

organizations and projects:

  email address associated to your account. This is most often the case
  with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
- Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

- Ask |a-service| user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to
  invite you to the organization to which you lost access, or
- Contact |mdb-support|.

To delete a project for an organization, you can delete from the
