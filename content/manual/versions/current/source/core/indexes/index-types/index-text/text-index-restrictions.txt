Text indexes have these restrictions:

One Text Index per Collection

Text Search and Multi-Word Strings

Text Index and Sort
-------------------

Text indexes cannot improve performance for sort operations. This
restriction applies to both single-field and compound text indexes.

.. _text-index-compound-restrictions:

Compound Text Index
-------------------

A :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` can include a text index
key in combination with ascending and descending index keys. However,
compound text indexes have these restrictions:

.. include:: /includes/fact-compound-index-with-text-restrictions.rst

For examples of compound text indexes, see these pages:

- :ref:`compound-text-index-example`
- :ref:`limit-entries-scanned`

Collation Option
----------------

Text indexes only support binary comparison, and do not support the
:ref:`collation <collation>` option. Binary comparison compares the
numeric Unicode value of each character in each string, and does not
account for letter case or accent marks.

To create a text index on a collection that has a non-simple
collation, you must explicitly specify ``{ collation: { locale: "simple"
} }`` when you create the index.

For example, consider a collection named ``collationTest`` with a
collation of ``{ locale: "en" }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
      "collationTest",
      {
         collation: { locale: "en" }
      }
   )

To create a text index on the ``collationTest`` collection, you must
specify ``{ collation: { locale: "simple" } }``. The following command
creates a text index on the ``quotes`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collationTest.createIndex(
      {
         quotes: "text"
      },
      {
         collation: { locale: "simple" }
      }
   )
