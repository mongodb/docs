LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of 
|llm| applications through the use of "chains." Chains are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined for a variety of AI use cases, including
|rag|.

By integrating {+avs+} with LangChain, you can use 
|service| as a vector database, use {+avs+} to perform semantic 
search over your data, and implement |rag| by chaining together 
{+avs+} as a retriever. To learn more about |rag|,
see :ref:`ai-key-concepts`.
