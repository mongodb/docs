MongoDB supports |aws| private endpoints using the `{+aws-pl+}
<https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature only for your {+dl+}s. 
You can edit the comment associated with a private endpoint for {+dl+}s 
from the |service| User Interface and |api|. 

Edit Private Endpoint Through the User Interface 
------------------------------------------------

To edit the comment associated with a private endpoint from your 
|service| UI: 

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-privatelink.rst

Edit Private Endpoint Through the API 
-------------------------------------

To edit a private endpoint through the |api|, send a ``POST`` request 
to the :ref:`privateNetworkSettings <adl-api>` endpoint with the unique 
ID of the private endpoint to edit. If there is no change to the 
comment associated with the specified endpoint, |service| makes no 
change to the endpoint ID list. If there is a change to the comment 
associated with the specified endpoint, |service| updates the 
``comment`` value only in the endpoint ID list.

To learn more about the |api| syntax and options, see 
:ref:`api-pvt-link-create-one`.
