  Create an ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-enterprise.repo`` file so that
  you can install MongoDB enterprise directly, using ``yum``.
action:
  - heading: For the *latest* stable release of MongoDB Enterprise
    pre: |
      Use the following repository file:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-enterprise]
      name=MongoDB Enterprise Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-enterprise/stable/$basearch/
      gpgcheck=1
      enabled=1
      gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.2.asc
  - pre: |
      ``.repo`` files for each release can also be found `in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/>`_.
      Remember that odd-numbered minor release versions (e.g. 2.5) are development versions and are unsuitable
      for production deployment.

  You can install either the latest stable version of MongoDB Enterprise or a

    sudo yum install -y mongodb-enterprise

      character: "'"
    pre: |
      Specify each component package individually and append the
      version number to the package name, as in the following example
      that installs the ``3.2.1`` release of MongoDB:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install -y mongodb-enterprise-3.2.1 mongodb-enterprise-server-3.2.1 mongodb-enterprise-shell-3.2.1 mongodb-enterprise-mongos-3.2.1 mongodb-enterprise-tools-3.2.1
  - heading:
      text: Pin a specific version of MongoDB Enterprise.
      character: "'"
    pre: |
      Although you can specify any available version of MongoDB
      Enterprise, ``yum`` will upgrade the packages when a newer
      version becomes available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin
      the package by adding the following ``exclude`` directive to your
      ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-enterprise,mongodb-enterprise-server,mongodb-enterprise-shell,mongodb-enterprise-mongos,mongodb-enterprise-tools
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use different naming conventions.
  See the :v2.4:`2.4 version of documentation for more information
