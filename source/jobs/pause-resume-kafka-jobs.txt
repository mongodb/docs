When you have an Apache Kafka supported migration job, you can pause and 
resume the migration job. You may want to pause a migration job for maintenance 
windows or planned outages on your source database. 

About this Task
---------------

- You can **only** pause and resume Kafka or Confluent Cloud Kafka
  supported continuous migration jobs.

- The amount of time that a job can be paused depends on the log 
  retention period of your source relational database.

Before you Begin
----------------

You must enable Kafka support for Relational Migrator. For details, see 
:ref:`kafka-intro`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Create a continous migration job
     
      For details on creating a continuous migration job, see 
      :ref:`create a migration job <rm-create-jobs>`.

   .. step:: Pause the migration job
     
      a. Wait for the migration job to enter the CDC stage. Once the migration job 
         enters the CDC stage click the :icon-fa5:`pause` :guilabel:`Pause` 
         button on the :guilabel:`Job Overview` 
         pane. 

      #. Click :guilabel:`Pause CDC` on the pop-up modal to confirm
         you would like to pause the migration job. The status of the 
         :guilabel:`CDC Stage` updates to :guilabel:`Paused`.

         .. warning::

            You must resume the migration job within your source 
            database's CDC retention period to ensure no events are lost.

   .. step:: Resume the migration job

      To resume a job, click the :icon-lg:`Play` :guilabel:`Resume` 
      button. The status of the CDC stage updates to :guilabel:`Running`.
      This status indicates Relational Migrator is actively capturing 
      data from the source database.
