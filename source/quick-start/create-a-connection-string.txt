Create a Connection String
==========================

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

To connect to an instance or deployment not hosted on Atlas, see
:ref:`Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB <rust-other-ways-to-connect>`.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas Connection String

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <rust-quick-start-create-deployment>`,
      log in to your Atlas account and navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Database` section and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button
      for your new deployment.

      Proceed to the :guilabel:`Connect your application` section and select
      "Rust" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.

      Select the :guilabel:`Password (SCRAM)` authentication mechanism.
      
      Deselect the :guilabel:`Include full driver code example` to view
      the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your Connection String

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it
      to your clipboard.

   .. step:: Update the Placeholders

      Paste this connection string into a a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` placeholders with
      your database user's username and password.
      
      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.
