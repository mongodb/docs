Shard a Collection Using a Hashed Shard Key
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.4

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` use a :ref:`hashed
index <index-hashed-index>` of a field as the :term:`shard key` to
partition data across your sharded cluster.

For tips on choosing the right field as your hashed shard key, see
:ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding`. For limitations on hashed indexes, see
:ref:`index-hashed-index`.

Basic Procedure
---------------

To shard a collection using a hashed shard key, issue an operation in
the :program:`mongo` shell that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( "records.active", { a: "hashed" } )

This operation shards the ``active`` collection in the ``records``
database, using a hash of the ``a`` field as the shard key.

Specify the Initial Number of Chunks
------------------------------------

If you shard an empty collection using a hashed shard key, MongoDB
automatically creates and migrate chunks so that each shard has two
chunks. You can control how many chunks MongoDB creates sharding the
collection using :dbcommand:`shardCollection` with the
``numInitialChunks`` parameter.

.. important::

   Hashed shard keys are supported in MongoDB versions 2.4 and
   higher. After sharding a collection with a hashed shard key, you must
   use the MongoDB 2.4 or higher :program:`mongos` and
   :program:`mongod` instances in your sharded cluster.
