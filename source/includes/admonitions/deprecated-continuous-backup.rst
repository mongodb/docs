.. admonition:: Continuous Backup Deprecated
   :class: important

   MongoDB deprecated the Continuous Backup feature. Clusters that use
   Continuous Backup can continue to use it. MongoDB recommends using
   :doc:`Cloud Provider Snapshots </backup/cloud-provider-snapshots/>`.
   Effective 23 March 2020, all net new clusters can *only* use Cloud
   Provider Snapshots.
