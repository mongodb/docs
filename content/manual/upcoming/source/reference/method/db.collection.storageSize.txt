   :returns: The total amount of storage in bytes allocated to this 
             collection for document storage.

             :option:`default for WiredTiger <mongod
             --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor>`), the storage size
             reflects the compressed size and may be smaller than the
             value returned by :method:`db.collection.dataSize()`.
