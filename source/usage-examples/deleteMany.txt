=========================
Delete Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete several documents in a collection at once using the
:node-api:`collection.deleteMany() <Collection.html#deleteMany>` method.
Pass a query document to the ``deleteMany()`` method to specify a subset
of documents in the collection to delete. If you do not provide a query
document (or if you provide an empty document), MongoDB matches all documents
in the collection and deletes them. While you can use ``deleteMany()``
to delete all documents in a collection, consider using
:node-api:`drop() <Collection.html#drop>` instead for better performance
and clearer code.

You can specify additional options in the ``options`` object passed in
the second parameter of the ``deleteMany()`` method. You can also pass a
:node-api:`callback method <Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpCallback>`
as an optional third parameter. For more detailed information, see
:node-api:`the deleteMany() API documentation <Collection.html#deleteMany>`.

``deleteMany()`` behaves in two different ways depending on whether you
provide a callback method:

- if you do not specify a callback method, ``deleteMany()`` returns a
  :mdn:`Promise <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`
  that resolves to an object

- if you specify a callback method, ``deleteMany()`` returns
  nothing, and instead passes the result or error object to the
  callback method

The
:node-api:`result object <Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpResult>`
contains multiple keys in the event of a successful
execution. You can use the ``deletedCount`` key to determine the number
of documents deleted by the operation.

The error object contains ``errmsg``, a human-readable explanation of
what caused the operation to fail.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes multiple documents from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query to
match and delete movies with the title "Santa Claus".
