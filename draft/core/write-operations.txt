Write Operations
================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

All operations that create or modify data in the MongoDB instance are
write operations. MongoDB represents data as :term:`BSON documents
<document>` stored in :term:`collections <collection>`. Write
operations target one collection and are atomic on the level of a
single document: no single write operation can atomically affect more
than one document or more than one collection.

This document introduces the write operators available in MongoDB as
well as presents strategies to increase the efficiency of writes in
applications.

Write Concern
-------------

.. note:: The :doc:`driver write concern </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   change created a new connection class in all of the MongoDB
   drivers, called ``MongoClient`` with a different default write
   concern. See the :doc:`release notes </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   for this change, and the release notes for the driver you're using
   for more information about your driver's release.

.. _write-concern-considerations:

Operational Considerations and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients issue write operations with some level of :term:`write
concern`, which describes the level of concern or
guarantee the server will provide in its response to a write operation.
Consider the following levels of conceptual write concern:

- *none*: Write operations are not acknowledged by MongoDB, and may
  not succeed in the case of connection errors that the client is not yet aware of, or
  if the :program:`mongod` produces an exception (e.g. a duplicate key
  exception for :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>`.) While this
  operation is efficient because it does not require the database to
  respond to every write operation, it also incurs a significant risk
  with regards to the persistence and durability of the data.

- *tcp ack*: MongoDB does not acknowledge the receipt of write
  operation as with a write concern level of *none*; however, the
  driver will receive and handle network errors, in the case of a
  network disconnection or other kind of socket error.

  Before the releases outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`,
  this was the default write concern.

- *receipt acknowledgment*: The :program:`mongod` will confirm the
  receipt of the write operation, allowing the client to catch
  network, duplicate key, and other exceptions. After the releases
  outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`, this is the default
  write concern. [#default-write-concern]_

- *journal commit*: The :program:`mongod` will confirm the write
  operation only after it has written the operation to the
  :term:`journal`. This confirms that the write operation can survive a
  :program:`mongod` shutdown and ensures that the write operation is
  durable.

  While *receipt acknowledgment* without *journal commit* provides the
  fundamental basis for write concern, there is an up-to 100
  millisecond window between journal commits where the write operation
  is not fully durable. Require *journal commit* as part of the write
  concern to provide this durability guarantee.

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` present an additional layer of
consideration for write concern. Basic write concern level affect the
write operation on only one :program:`mongod` instance. The ``w``
argument to :dbcommand:`getLastError` makes it possible to guarantee
that the write operation has propagated to the members of a replica
set. See the :ref:`Write Concern for Replica Sets
<replica-set-write-concern>` for more information.

.. [#default-write-concern] The default write concern is to call
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` with no arguments. For replica sets, you
   can define the default write concern settings in the
   :data:`getLastErrorDefaults <settings.getLastErrorDefaults>`. If
   :data:`getLastErrorDefaults <settings.getLastErrorDefaults>` does
   not define a default write concern setting,
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` defaults to basic receipt acknowledgment.

.. _write-concern-operation:
.. _write-concern-internals:

Internal Operation of Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide write concern, :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` issue
the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command after a write operation and
receive a document with information about the last operation. This
document's ``err`` field contains either:

- ``null``, which indicates the write operations have completed
  successfully, or

- a description of the last error encountered.

The definition of a "successful write" depends on the arguments
specified to :dbcommand:`getLastError`, or in replica sets, the
configuration of :data:`getLastErrorDefaults
<settings.getLastErrorDefaults>`. When deciding the level of write
concern for your application, become familiar with the
:ref:`write-concern-considerations`.

The :dbcommand:`getLastError` has the following options to configure write
concern requirements.

- ``j`` or "journal" option

  This option confirms that the :program:`mongod` instance has written
  the data to the on-disk journal and ensures data is not lost if the
  :program:`mongod` instance shuts down unexpectedly. Set to ``true`` to
  enable, as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, j: "true" } )

- ``w`` option

  This option provides the ability to disable write concern entirely *as
  well as* specifies the write concern operations for :term:`replica sets
  <replica set>`. By default, the ``w`` option is set to ``1``, which
  provides basic receipt acknowledgment on a single :program:`mongod`
  instance or on the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

  The ``w`` option takes the following values:

  - ``-1``:

    Disables all acknowledgment of write operations, including
    networking errors.

  - ``0``:

    Disables basic acknowledgment of write operations, but returns
    information about networking errors to the application.

    .. note:: If you disable basic operation acknowledgment write
       concern but enable the journal commit write concern, the journal
       commit overrides the no write concern, as in the following
       operation:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, w: 0, j: "true" } )

       The setting with the ``j`` (journal) prevails, which provides
       acknowledgment of write operations from a single :program:`mongod`
       instance as well as confirmation of the journal commit.

  - ``1``:

    Provides acknowledgment of write operations on a standalone
    :program:`mongod` or the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

  - *A number greater than 1*:

    Guarantees that write operations have propagated successfully to
    the specified number of replica set members including the primary.
    If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the number of set
    members that hold data, MongoDB waits for the non-existent members
    to become available, which means MongoDB blocks indefinitely.

  - ``majority``:

    Confirms that write operations have propagated to the majority of
    configured replica set: nodes must acknowledge the write operation
    before it succeeds. This ensures that write operation will *never*
    be subject to a rollback in the course of normal operation, and
    furthermore allows you to prevent hard coding assumptions about the
    size of your replica set into your application.

  - *A tag set*:

    By specifying a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`
    you can have fine-grained control over which replica
    set members must acknowledge a write operation to satisfy the required
    level of write concern.

For more information on write concern and replica sets, see :ref:`Write
Concern for Replica Sets <replica-set-write-concern>` for more information..

In sharded clusters, :program:`mongos` instances will pass write
concern on to the shard :program:`mongod` instances.

.. _write-operations-bulk-insert:

Bulk Inserts
------------

In some situations you may need to insert or ingest a large amount of
data into a MongoDB database. These *bulk inserts* have some
special considerations that are different from other write
operations.

The :method:`insert() <db.collection.insert()>` method, when passed an
array of documents, will perform a bulk insert, and inserts each
document atomically. :doc:`Drivers </applications/drivers>`
provide their own interface for this kind of operation.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
   :method:`insert() <db.collection.insert()>` in the :program:`mongo`
   shell gained support for bulk inserts in version 2.2.

Bulk insert can significantly increase performance by distributing
:ref:`write concern <write-operations-write-concern>` costs. In the
drivers, you can configure write concern for batches rather than on a
per-document level.

Drivers also have a ``ContinueOnError`` option in their insert
operation, so that the bulk operation will continue to insert
remaining documents in a batch even if an insert fails.

.. note::

   .. versionadded::  2.0
      Support for ``ContinueOnError`` depends on version 2.0 of the
      core :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` components.

If the bulk insert process generates more than one error in a batch
job, the client will only receive the most recent error. All bulk
operations to a :term:`sharded collection` run with
``ContinueOnError``, which applications cannot disable. See
:ref:`sharding-bulk-inserts` section for more information on
consideration for bulk inserts in sharded clusters.

For more information see your :doc:`driver documentation
</applications/drivers>` for details on performing bulk inserts in
your application. Also consider the following resources:
:ref:`write-operations-sharded-clusters`,
:ref:`sharding-bulk-inserts`, and
:doc:`/administration/import-export`.

.. _write-operations-indexing:

Indexing
--------

After every insert, update, or delete operation, MongoDB must update
*every* index associated with the collection in addition to the data
itself. Therefore, every index on a collection adds some amount of
overhead for the performance of write operations.

In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read
operations* are worth the insertion penalty; however, when optimizing
write performance, be careful when creating new indexes and always
evaluate the indexes on the collection and ensure that your queries are
actually using these indexes.

For more information on indexes in MongoDB consider :doc:`/indexes`
and :doc:`/applications/indexes`.

.. _write-operations-isolation:

Isolation
---------

When a single write operation modifies multiple documents, the
operation as a whole is not atomic, and other operations may
interleave. The modification of a single document, or record, is always
atomic, even if the write operation modifies multiple sub-document
*within* the single record.

No other operations are atomic; however, you can attempt to isolate a
write operation that affects multiple documents using the
:doc:`isolation operator </reference/operator/atomic>`.

To isolate a sequence of write operations from other read and write
operations, see :doc:`/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits`.

Architecture
------------

.. _write-operations-replica-sets:

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, all write operations go to the
set's :term:`primary`, which applies the write operation then records
the operations on the primary's operation log or :term:`oplog`. The
oplog is a reproducible sequence of operations to the data
set. :term:`Secondary` members of the set are continuously replicating the
oplog and applying the operations to themselves in an asynchronous
process.

Large volumes of write operations, particularly bulk operations, may
create situations where the secondary members have difficulty applying
the replicating operations from the primary at a sufficiently rate: this
can cause the secondary's state to fall behind that of the primary. Secondaries
that are significantly behind the primary present problems for normal
operation of the replica set, particularly :ref:`failover
<replica-set-failover-administration>` in the form of :ref:`rollbacks
<replica-set-rollback>` as well as general :ref:`read consistency
<replica-set-consistency>`.

To help avoid this issue, you can customize the :ref:`write concern
<write-operations-write-concern>` to return confirmation of the write
operation to another member [#write-concern-throttling]_ of the replica
set every 100 or 1,000 operations. This provides an opportunity for
secondaries to catch up with the primary. Write concern can slow the
overall progress of write operations but ensure that the secondaries
can maintain a largely current state with respect to the primary.

For more information on replica sets and write operations, see
:ref:`replica-set-write-concern`, :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`,
:ref:`replica-set-oplog`, and :ref:`replica-set-procedure-change-oplog-size`.

.. [#write-concern-throttling] Calling :dbcommand:`getLastError`
   intermittently with a ``w`` value of ``2`` or ``majority`` will slow
   the throughput of the write operation but will prevent bulk inserts.

.. _write-operations-sharded-clusters:

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a :term:`sharded cluster`, MongoDB directs a given write operation to
a :term:`shard` and then performs the write on a particular
:term:`chunk` on that shard. Shards and chunks are range-based.
:term:`Shard keys <shard keys>` affect how MongoDB distributes documents
among shards. Choosing the correct shard key can have a great impact on
the performance, capability, and functioning of your database and
cluster.

For more information, see :doc:`/administration/sharding` and
:ref:`write-operations-bulk-insert`.
