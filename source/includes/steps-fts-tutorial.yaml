ref: enter-index-definition
content: |
  The ``movies`` collection is large, so in order to save space we will
  only index the ``title``, ``genres``, and ``plot`` fields.

  Replace the default definition with the following:

  .. code-block:: json

     {
       "mappings": {
         "dynamic": false,
         "fields": {
           "title": {
             "type": "string",
             "analyzer": "lucene.standard",
             "multi": {
               "keywordAnalyzer": {
                 "type": "string",
                 "analyzer": "lucene.keyword"
               }
             }
           },
           "genres": {
             "type": "string",
             "analyzer": "lucene.standard"
           },
           "plot": {
             "type": "string",
             "analyzer": "lucene.standard"
           }
         }
       }
     }

  The above index definition specifies the :ref:`standard analyzer
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` as the default analyzer for all three
  indexed fields. It also specifies the :ref:`keyword analyzer
  <ref-keyword-analyzer>` as an alternate analyzer for the ``title``
  field, with the name ``keywordAnalyzer``. The keyword analyzer
  indexes the entire field as a single term, so it only returns
  results if the search term and the specified field match exactly. 
  The index definition also specifies :ref:`standard analyzer
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` as the analyzer by default for queries 
  on the ``genres`` field, which is an array of strings. For indexing 
  arrays, |fts| only requires the data type of the array elements. You 
  don't have to specify that the data is contained in an array in 
  the index definition. 

  For more information about static and dynamic field mappings, see
  :ref:`index definitions <ref-index-definitions>`. For more
  information about ``multi`` analyzer designations, see
  :ref:`ref-path`.

  Leave the default index name ``default`` in place and click the
  :guilabel:`Create Index` button.

  .. note::
  
     If you use the name ``default`` for your index you do not need
     to specify it by name when querying against it. If you use a 
     custom name you must add the ``"index": <index-name>`` parameter
     to all :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` queries.

  The index should take about one minute to build. While it is
  building, the :guilabel:`Status` column reads ``Build in

title: Run your first Atlas Search query.
ref: run-first-query
content: |
  The following query searches for the word ``baseball`` in
  the ``plot`` field. It includes a :manual:`$limit
  </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit the output
  to 5 results and a :manual:`$project
  </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to exclude all
  fields except ``title`` and ``plot``.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.movies.aggregate([
       {
         $search: {
           "text": { 
             "query": "baseball", 
             "path": "plot"
           }
         }
       },
       {
         $limit: 5
       },
       {
         $project: {
           "_id": 0,
           "title": 1,
           "plot": 1
         }
       }
     ])

  The above query returns the following results:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

     { "plot" : "A trio of guys try and make up for missed opportunities
        in childhood by forming a three-player baseball team to compete
        against standard children baseball squads.", "title" : "The Benchwarmers" }
     { "plot" : "A young boy is bequeathed the ownership of a professional 
        baseball team.", "title" : "Little Big League" }

        player, Lou Gehrig.", "title" : "The Pride of the Yankees" }
     { "plot" : "Babe Ruth becomes a baseball legend but is unheroic to those
        who know him.", "title" : "The Babe" }

  pipeline stage, see its reference page. For complete aggregation
  pipeline documentation, see the :manual:`MongoDB Server Manual

title: Run a more complex query. 
ref: more-complex-query
content: |
  ``$search`` has several :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` for
  constructing different types of queries. The following query uses the
  :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator to combine several operators
  into a single query. It has the following search criteria:

  - The ``plot`` field must contain either ``Hawaii`` or ``Alaska``.
  - The ``plot`` field must contain a four-digit number, such as a
    year.
  - The ``genres`` field must not contain either ``Comedy`` or
    ``Romance``.
  - The ``title`` field must not contain ``Beach`` or ``Snow``.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.movies.aggregate([
       {
         $search: {
           "compound": {
             "must": [ {
               "text": {
                  "query": ["Hawaii", "Alaska"],
                  "path": "plot"
               },
             },
             {
               "regex": {
                  "query": "([0-9]{4})",
                  "path": "plot",
                  "allowAnalyzedField": true
               }
             } ],
             "mustNot": [ {
               "text": {
                 "query": ["Comedy", "Romance"],
                 "path": "genres"
               }
             },
             {
               "term": {
                 "query": ["Beach", "Snow"],
                 "path": "title"
               }
             } ]
           }
         }
       }, 
       { 
         $project: { 
           "title": 1,
           "plot": 1,
           "genres": 1,
           "_id": 0 
         } 
       }
     ])

  The above query returns the following results:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

     { "plot" : "A modern aircraft carrier is thrown back in time to 1941
       near Hawaii, just hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.",
       "genres" : [ "Action", "Sci-Fi" ], "title" : "The Final Countdown" }
     { "plot" : "Follows John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, from his
       selection of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate to

title: Run a query using a ``multi`` analyzer. 
ref: more-multi-query
content: |
  In the index definition you created in step 9, you specified that the
  ``title`` field should be able to use either the :ref:`standard
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer or the :ref:`keyword
  <ref-keyword-analyzer>` analyzer for queries. The following query
  uses the alternate analyzer, named ``keywordAnalyzer``, to search
  for exact matches on the string ``The Count of Monte Cristo``.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.movies.aggregate([
       {
         $search: {
           "text": {
             "query": "The Count of Monte Cristo",
             "path": { "value": "title", "multi": "keywordAnalyzer" }
           }
         }
       }, 
       { 
         $project: { 
           "title": 1,
           "year": 1,
           "_id": 0 
         } 
       }
     ])

  The above query returns the following results:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

     { "title" : "The Count of Monte Cristo", "year" : 1934 }
     { "title" : "The Count of Monte Cristo", "year" : 1954 }
     { "title" : "The Count of Monte Cristo", "year" : 1998 }

  By contrast, the same query using the ``standard`` analyzer would
  find all the movies with the word ``Count`` or ``Monte`` or
  ``Cristo`` in the title.
