Overview
--------

Consider a scenario in which you want to insert a document into a collection,
update multiple other documents, then delete a document. If you use
individual methods, each operation requires its own database call. This guide
shows you how to use bulk write operations to perform multiple write operations
in a single database call.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>` tutorial.

Define the Write Operations
---------------------------

For each write operation you want to perform, create an instance of one of
the following operation classes:

- ``InsertOne``
- ``UpdateOne``
- ``UpdateMany``
- ``ReplaceOne``
- ``DeleteOne``
- ``DeleteMany``

Then, pass a list of these instances to the ``bulk_write()`` method.

The following sections show how to create and use instances of the preceding classes.

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an instance of ``InsertOne`` and specify
the document you want to insert.

The following example creates an instance of ``InsertOne``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-insert-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-insert-one
   :language: python
   :copyable:

You can also create an instance of ``InsertOne`` by passing an instance of a custom class
to the constructor. This provides additional type safety if you're using a type-checking
tool. The instance you pass must inherit from the ``TypedDict`` class.

.. note:: TypedDict in Python 3.7 and Earlier

   .. include:: /includes/type-hints/typeddict-availability.rst

The following example constructs an ``InsertOne`` instance by using a custom
class for added type safety:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-insert-one-typed
   :end-before: end-bulk-insert-one-typed
   :language: python
   :copyable:

To insert multiple documents, create an instance of ``InsertOne`` for each document.

.. include:: /includes/write/unique-id-note.rst

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a document, create an instance of ``UpdateOne`` and pass in
the following arguments:

- A **query filter** that specifies the criteria used to match documents in your collection
- The update operation you want to perform. For more information about update
  operations, see the :manual:`Field Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update-field/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

``UpdateOne`` updates *the first* document that matches your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateOne``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-one
   :language: python
   :copyable:

To update multiple documents, create an instance of ``UpdateMany`` and pass in
the same arguments. ``UpdateMany`` updates *all* documents that match your query
filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateMany``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-many
   :language: python
   :copyable:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replace operation removes all fields and values of a specified document and
replaces them with new ones. To perform a replace operation, create an instance
of ``ReplaceOne`` and pass it a query filter and the fields and values you want
to store in the matching document.

The following example creates an instance of ``ReplaceOne``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-replace-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-replace-one
   :language: python
   :copyable:

You can also create an instance of ``ReplaceOne`` by passing an instance of a custom class
to the constructor. This provides additional type safety if you're using a type-checking
tool. The instance you pass must inherit from the ``TypedDict`` class.

.. note:: TypedDict in Python 3.7 and Earlier

   .. include:: /includes/type-hints/typeddict-availability.rst

The following example constructs a ``ReplaceOne`` instance by using a custom
class for added type safety:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-replace-one-typed
   :end-before: end-bulk-replace-one-typed
   :language: python
   :copyable:

To replace multiple documents, you must create an instance of ``ReplaceOne`` for each document.

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/tip-type-checkers.rst

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a document, create an instance of ``DeleteOne`` and pass in a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. ``DeleteOne`` removes
only *the first* document that matches your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteOne``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-one
   :language: python
   :copyable:

To delete multiple documents, create an instance of ``DeleteMany`` and pass in a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. ``DeleteMany`` removes
*all* documents that match your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteMany``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-many
   :language: python
   :copyable:

Call the ``bulk_write()`` Method
--------------------------------

After you define a class instance for each operation you want to perform,
pass a list of these instances to the ``bulk_write()`` method.
By default, the method runs the operations in the order
they're defined in the list.

The following example performs multiple write operations by using the
``bulk_write()`` method:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
      :start-after: start-bulk-write-mixed
      :end-before: end-bulk-write-mixed
      :language: python

   .. output::
      
      BulkWriteResult({'writeErrors': [], 'writeConcernErrors': [], 'nInserted': 2, 'nUpserted': 0, 'nMatched': 2, 'nModified': 2, 'nRemoved': 1, 'upserted': []}, acknowledged=True)

If any of the write operations fail, {+driver-short+} raises a
``BulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations.
``BulkWriteError`` provides a ``details`` attribute that includes the operation
that failed, and details about the exception.

.. note::

   When {+driver-short+} runs a bulk operation, it uses the ``write_concern`` of the
   collection in which the operation is running. The driver reports all write
   concern errors after attempting all operations, regardless of execution order. 

Customize Bulk Write Operations
-------------------------------

The ``bulk_write()`` method optionally accepts additional
parameters, which represent options you can use to configure the bulk write
operation. If you don't specify any additional options, the driver does not customize
the bulk write operation.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``ordered``
     - | If ``True``, the driver performs the write operations in the order
         provided. If an error occurs, the remaining operations are not
         attempted. 
       |
       | If ``False``, the driver performs the operations in an
         arbitrary order and attempts to perform all operations.
       | Defaults to ``True``.

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | Specifies whether the operation bypasses document-level validation. For more
         information, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``False``.

   * - ``session``
     - | An instance of ``ClientSession``. For more information, see the `API
         documentation <{+api-root+}pymongo/client_session.html#pymongo.client_session.ClientSession>`__.

   * - ``comment``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`delete command
         fields </reference/command/delete/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let``
     - | A map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/delete/#std-label-delete-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example calls the ``bulk_write()`` method from the preceding example, with the ``ordered`` option set
to ``False``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.py
   :start-after: start-bulk-write-unordered
   :end-before: end-bulk-write-unordered
   :language: python
   :copyable:

If any of the write operations in an unordered bulk write fail, {+driver-short+}
reports the errors only after attempting all operations.

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution. The order can
   differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.

Return Value
------------

The ``bulk_write()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` object. The
``BulkWriteResult`` object contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``acknowledged``
     - | Indicates if the server acknowledged the write operation.

   * - ``bulk_api_result``
     - | The raw bulk API result returned by the server.
         
   * - ``deleted_count``
     - | The number of documents deleted, if any.

   * - ``inserted_count``
     - | The number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``matched_count``
