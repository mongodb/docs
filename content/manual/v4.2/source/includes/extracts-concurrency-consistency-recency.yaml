  Depending on the read concern, clients can see the results of writes
  before the writes are :term:`durable`:

ref: concurrent-operations-single-document-write
content: |
   Write operations are atomic with respect to a single document; i.e.
   if a write is updating multiple fields in the document, a read operation
   will never see the document with only some of the fields updated.
   However, although a client may not see a *partially* updated
   document, read uncommitted means that concurrent read operations may still
   see the updated document before the changes are made :term:`durable`.

   With a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, a set of read and write
   operations to a single document is serializable. With a replica set,
   a set of read and write operations to a single document is serializable
   *only* in the absence of a rollback.

ref: concurrent-operations-multi-document-writes
content: |

   When a single write operation (e.g.
   :method:`db.collection.updateMany()`) modifies multiple documents,
   the modification of each document is atomic, but the operation as a
   whole is not atomic.

   When performing multi-document write operations, whether through a
   single write operation or multiple write operations, other
   operations may interleave.

   #. Non-point-in-time read operations. Suppose a read operation
      begins at time *t*\ :sub:`1` and starts reading documents. A
      write operation then commits an update to one of the documents at
      some later time *t*\ :sub:`2`. The reader may see the updated
      version of the document, and therefore does not see a
      point-in-time snapshot of the data.

   #. Non-serializable operations. Suppose a read operation reads a
      document *d*\ :sub:`1` at time *t*\ :sub:`1` and a write
      operation updates *d*\ :sub:`1` at some later time *t*\ :sub:`3`.
      This introduces a read-write dependency such that, if the
      operations were to be serialized, the read operation must precede
      the write operation. But also suppose that the write operation
      updates document *d*\ :sub:`2` at time *t*\ :sub:`2` and the read
      operation subsequently reads *d*\ :sub:`2` at some later time
      *t*\ :sub:`4`. This introduces a write-read dependency which
      would instead require the read operation to come *after* the
      write operation in a serializable schedule. There is a dependency
      cycle which makes serializability impossible.

   #. Reads may miss matching documents that are updated during the
      course of the read operation.

ref: monotonic-writes
content: |

   MongoDB provides monotonic write guarantees, by default, for
   standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and replica set.

   For monotonic writes and sharded clusters, see
   :ref:`causal-consistency`.

---
ref: isolate-cursor-snapshot
content: |

   MongoDB cursors can return the same document more than once in some
   situations. As a cursor returns documents, other operations may
   interleave with the query. If one of these operations changes the
   indexed field on the index used by the query, then the cursor could
   return the same document more than once.

   Queries that use :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` can, in
   some cases, return duplicate values. If a cursor using a unique index
   interleaves with a delete and insert of documents sharing the same
   unique value, the cursor may return the same unique value twice from
   different documents.

---
ref: lock-general
content: |
    MongoDB uses multi-granularity locking [#mgl-ref]_ that allows
    operations to lock at the global, database or collection level, and
    allows for individual storage engines to implement their own
    concurrency control below the collection level (e.g., at the
    document-level in WiredTiger).

    MongoDB uses reader-writer locks that allow concurrent readers
    shared access to a resource, such as a database or collection.
---
ref: lock-sharding
content: |
   In a sharded cluster, locks apply to each individual shard, not to
   the whole cluster; i.e. each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is
   independent of the others in the sharded cluster and uses its own
   :ref:`locks <faq-concurrency-locking>`. The operations on one
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance do not block the operations on any others.

ref: lock-replica-set-primary

   When writing to a :term:`replica set`, the lock's scope
   applies to the :term:`primary`.

   If any voting member of a replica set uses the :ref:`in-memory

   If any voting member of a replica set uses the :ref:`in-memory
   storage engine <storage-inmemory>` and
   :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` is ``true``,
   :writeconcern:`"majority"` write operations may fail. These include
   operations that inherently use :writeconcern:`"majority"` write
   concern, such as the :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command, or
   various :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods that by default use
   :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern, such as :doc:`user
   management methods </reference/method/js-user-management/>` and
   :doc:`role management methods
   </reference/method/js-role-management>`.

ref: no-journaling-rollback
content: |
   
   With :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` set to ``false``,
   MongoDB does not wait for :writeconcern:`w: "majority" <"majority">`
   writes to be written to the on-disk journal before acknowledging the
   writes. As such, :writeconcern:`majority` write operations could
   possibly roll back in the event of a transient loss (e.g. crash and
   restart) of a majority of nodes in a given replica set.
