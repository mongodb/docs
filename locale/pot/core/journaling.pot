msgid "When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the on-disk journal before the changes are present in the data files on disk. This document discusses the implementation and mechanics of journaling in MongoDB systems.  See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-journaling` for information on configuring, tuning, and managing journaling."

msgid "With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal subdirectory within the directory defined by :setting:`~storage.dbPath`, which is :file:`/data/db` by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory. A dirty shutdown (crash) leaves files in the journal directory; these are used to automatically recover the database to a consistent state when the mongod process is restarted."

msgid "Journal files are append-only files and have file names prefixed with ``j._``. When a journal file holds 1 gigabyte of data, MongoDB creates a new journal file. Once MongoDB applies all the write operations in a particular journal file to the database data files, it deletes the file, as it is no longer needed for recovery purposes. Unless you write *many* bytes of data per second, the journal directory should contain only two or three journal files."

msgid "If you place the journal on a different filesystem from your data files you *cannot* use a filesystem snapshot alone to capture valid backups of a :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory. In this case, use :method:`~db.fsyncLock()` to ensure that database files are consistent before the snapshot and :method:`~db.fsyncUnlock()` once the snapshot is complete."

msgid "MongoDB may preallocate journal files if the :program:`mongod` process determines that it is more efficient to preallocate journal files than create new journal files as needed. The amount of time required to pre-allocate lag might last several minutes, during which you will not be able to connect to the database. This is a one-time preallocation and does not occur with future invocations."

msgid "The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB data files. The ``shared view`` is the only view with direct access to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :program:`mongod` asks the operating system to map your existing on-disk data files to the ``shared view`` virtual memory view. The operating system maps the files but does not load them. MongoDB later loads data files into the ``shared view`` as needed."

The ``private view`` is the first place MongoDB applies new :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>`. Upon a journal commit, MongoDB copies the changes made in the ``private view`` to the ``shared view``, where they are then available for uploading to the database data files."

msgid "The journal is an on-disk view that stores new write operations after MongoDB applies the operation to the ``private view`` but before applying them to the data files. The journal provides durability. If the :program:`mongod` instance were to crash without having applied the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files."

msgid "At default intervals of 60 seconds, MongoDB asks the operating system to flush the ``shared view`` to disk. This brings the data files up-to-date with the latest write operations.

msgid "As part of journaling, MongoDB routinely asks the operating system to remap the ``shared view`` to the ``private view``, in order to save physical RAM. Upon a new remapping, the operating system knows that physical memory pages can be shared between the ``shared view`` and the ``private view`` mappings."
