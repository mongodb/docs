Annotation Type PrimaryKey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_annotations_PrimaryKey:



io.realm.annotations
====================

**Implemented interfaces:**



- `java.lang.annotation.Annotation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html>`__ 


The \@PrimaryKey annotation will mark a field as a primary key inside Realm. Only one field in a RealmObject class can have this annotation, and the field should uniquely identify the object. Trying to insert an object with an existing primary key will result in an ``io.realm.exceptions.RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException`` . Primary key cannot be changed after the object created.

Primary keys also count as having the :ref:`Index <io_realm_annotations_Index>`  annotation.



It is allowed to apply this annotation on the following primitive types: byte, short, int, and long. String, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, ObjectId and UUID are also allowed, and further permitted to have ``null``  as a primary key value.



This annotation is not allowed inside Realm classes marked as ``@RealmClass(embedded = true)`` .
