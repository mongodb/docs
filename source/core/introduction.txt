Welcome to MongoDB. This document provides a brief introduction to MongoDB
and some key concepts. See the :doc:`installation guides </installation>` for
information on downloading and installing MongoDB.

.. This document provides a brief introduction to MongoDB and some key
   concepts and walks you through the process of installing and using
   MongoDB.

What is MongoDB
---------------

MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high
performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

Document Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed
of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON
objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,
and arrays of documents.

The advantages of using documents are:

- Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in
  many programming language.

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

- Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

High Performance
````````````````

MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

- Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database
  system.

- Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded
  documents and arrays.

High Availability
`````````````````

To provide high availability, MongoDB's replication facility, called
replica sets, provide:

- *automatic* failover.

- data redundancy.

A :ref:`replica set <replication-introduction>` is a group of
MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy
and increasing data availability.

Automatic Scaling
`````````````````

MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its *core*
functionality.

- Automatic :ref:`sharding <sharding-introduction>` distributes
  data across a cluster of machines.

- Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for low-latency
  high throughput deployments.
