===================
LDAP Authentication
===================

Overview
--------

|mms| can use a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service to
store users and manage user authentication. Users continue to log in
using the standard MMS interface. After successful LDAP
authentication, MMS synchronizes the ``firstName``, ``lastName``, and ``email``
attributes in a LDAP user record with their MMS user record. Integration
requires adding LDAP user record values in the MMS configuration file.

Upon submission of login form data, MMS authenticates in two steps:

1. First, MMS searches the LDAP server for a matching LDAP user record with the
   MMS ``mms.ldap.bindDn`` and ``mms.ldap.bindPassword`` configuration values to
   match the username.

#. With a match, MMS searches the LDAP server with the user record attribute
   defined for the ``mms.ldap.user.searchAttribute`` parameter to authenticate for
   MMS access.

Upon successful login with LDAP, the first user completes a welcome form to
create the initial MMS group.

Prerequisites
-------------

- LDAP server installed, configured, and accessible to MMS.

- An LDAP group name used to populate the ``mms.ldap.global.role.owner``
  configuration value used to match LDAP records with MMS data.

- MMS server installed and configured.

It's also possible to create LDAP groups to assign to users with read only or
other non-administrative roles, then update the global roles property settings
as needed. In this case, create one or more additional LDAP groups.

Considerations
--------------

For successful integration, each user record sent by the LDAP server must
contain the list of LDAP groups assigned to the user.

The first user to login with LDAP authentication must have the LDAP Owner role
assigned to their account. The ``mms.ldap.global.role.owner`` property
setting in the MMS configuration file must match an LDAP owner group.

For example, if LDAP has an ``admin`` group for use by MMS admins, set the
``mms.ldap.global.role.owner`` property to ``admin`` in the MMS configuration file.

There is no method to transition an existing MMS deployment with
independent user management to use LDAP for user management. You will need
to need to start over with a fresh installation of the latest version of MMS.

Procedure
---------

1. Define LDAP record schema attributes and values.

#. Update the LDAP server configuration values in the MMS configuration file.

#. Update the LDAP user configuration values in the MMS configuration file.

#. Update the Global Role configuration values in the MMS configuration file.

The section below defines configuration values to update for each step.

Configuration Files
-------------------

Configuration parameters connect one or more LDAP groups to roles used in MMS,
as well as retrieve user data to authenticate users.

LDAP Server Configuration Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update this LDAP server property in the MMS :file:`conf-mms.properties`
configuration file.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40, 60

   * - **Property**
     - **Value**
   * - ``mms.userSvcClass``
     - ``com.xgen.svc.mms.svc.user.UserSvcLdap``

LDAP User Configuration Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update these LDAP directory schema properties in the MMS :file:`conf-mms.properties`
configuration file:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30, 30, 40

   * - **Property**
     - **Example**
     - **Description**
   * - mms.ldap.url
     - ``ldap://174.129.71.167:3890``
     - The URI for the LDAP server
   * - mms.ldap.bindDn
     - ``_search_``
     - The LDAP user used to execute searches for other users
   * - mms.ldap.bindPassword
     - ``dISDFFFnj7WMmc``
     - The credentials for the search user
   * - mms.ldap.user.baseDn
     - ``c\=users,d\=identity``
     - The base dn used for searching for users
   * - mms.ldap.user.searchAttribute
     - ``uid``
     - The LDAP user record attribute MMS uses to search then authenticate
       users when a user types their username into the MMS login form.
   * - mms.ldap.user.firstName
     - ``givenName``
     - The LDAP user attribute that contains the user's first name.
   * - mms.ldap.user.lastName
     - ``sn``
     - The LDAP user attribute that contains the user's last name.
   * - mms.ldap.user.email
     - ``mail``
     - The LDAP user attribute that contains the user's email address.
   * - mms.ldap.user.group
     - ``groups``
     - The LDAP user attribute that contains the list of groups that the user
       belongs to. These can be ``cn s`` or ``dn s``. It doesn't matter as long
       as they are consistent with those provided in the MMS global role
       configuration, explained below.

Global Role Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Global parameters can be in any format for an LDAP group. They can be a ``cn``
(Common Name) or a ``dn`` (Distinguished Name). The format must match the
property specified by the ``mms.ldap.user.group`` configuration property
defined in the table above.

Update these LDAP directory schema properties in the MMS :file:`conf-mms.properties`
configuration file:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40, 20, 40

   * - **Property**
     - **Example**
     - **Description**
   * - mms.ldap.global.role.read_only
     - ``AcmeDbas``
     - The LDAP group attribute name for users assigned the global read-only
       role in MMS. This role can only view data in MMS.
   * - mms.ldap.global.role.monitoring_admin
     - ``AcmeDbas``
     - The LDAP group attribute name for users assigned the global monitoring
       administrative role in MMS. This role can view hosts, charts, and other
       data, as well as monitor hosts, manage monitoring settings, download the
       monitoring agent, and other tasks.
   * - mms.ldap.global.role.backup_admin
     - ``AcmeDbas``
     - The LDAP group attribute name for users assigned the global backup administrative
       role in MMS. This role can view backup status, snapshot lists, and
       modify backup settings, as well as start/stop/terminate backups, request
       restores, view/edit host passwords, and other tasks.
   * - mms.ldap.global.role.owner
     - ``AcmeDbas``
     - The LDAP group attribute name for users assigned the global owner role in MMS.
       This role can perform all administrative tasks in MMS.

.. START-COMMENT
   * - mms.ldap.global.role.automation_admin
     - ``AcmeDbas``
     - The LDAP group attribute name for users assigned the global automation
       administrative role in MMS. This role can view all configurations,
       machines, and other data, as well as provision machines, edit
       configuration files, download the automation agent, and other tasks.
