``isMaster``
------------

For :manual:`isMaster </reference/command/isMaster>` command, the 
response always contains a document in which ``isMaster: true``. It 
also includes operational parameters. 

{+adl+} supports the optional ``saslSupportedMechs`` field set to the ``<db.user>``.

.. note:: About the ``hello`` Command

   {+adl+} also supports the ``hello`` command, which is an alias for 
   the ``isMaster`` command. The ``hello`` command returns a document 
   that is identical to the document returned by the ``isMaster`` 
   command. In the document returned by the ``hello`` command, the 
   ``isWritablePrimary`` field is set to ``true`` instead of the 
   ``isMaster`` field. We recommend the ``hello`` command instead of 
   ``isMaster``.

``killCursors``
---------------

The :manual:`killCursors </reference/command/killCursors>` command 
kills the specified cursor or cursors for a collection.

``listCollections``
-------------------

The :manual:`listCollections </reference/command/listCollections>` 
command retrieves information about the collections in a database, such 
as collection names and options. The response contains information that 
can be used to create a cursor to the collection information.
Results are ordered alphabetically by collection name.

{+adl+} supports the following options:

- ``filter`` (Exact match only.)
- ``nameOnly``
- ``authorizedCollections``

``listDatabases``
-----------------

The :manual:`listDatabases </reference/command/listDatabses>` command 
provides a list of all existing databases in alphabetical order. You must use the ``admin`` 
database to run the ``listDatabases`` command.

The following options are supported:

- ``filter`` (Exact match only.)
- ``nameOnly``
- ``authorizedDatabases``

The ``listDatabases`` command always returns ``sizeOnDisk: 0`` and 
``empty: false`` so it can return quickly, without scanning all the
files in the |data-lake|.
