Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to retrieve data from your MongoDB
collections using **read operations**.

Read operations allow you to do the following:

- Retrieve documents from your collections by using :ref:`find operations <golang-retrieve-find>`
- Perform transformations on documents in your collections by using :ref:`aggregation operations <golang-retrieve-aggregation>`

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the examples in this guide, load these documents into the
``ratings`` collection of the ``tea`` database with the following
snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/tea-sample-data-ending.rst

.. _golang-retrieve-find:

Find Operations
---------------

Use **find operations** to retrieve data from MongoDB. Find operations
consist of the ``Find()`` and ``FindOne()`` functions.

Find All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Find()`` function expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The function returns *all* documents that match the filter
as a ``Cursor`` type.

To learn how to access data in a cursor, see :ref:`golang-cursor`.

Find One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FindOne()`` function expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The function returns *the first document* that matches the
filter as a ``SingleResult`` type.

To learn how to access data in a ``SingleResult`` see :ref:`golang-bson-unmarshalling`.

.. _golang-retrieve-options:

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of ``Find()`` and ``FindOne()`` by passing
in a ``FindOptions`` and ``FindOneOptions`` type respectively. If you
don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

You can configure the commonly used options in both types with the
following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.  
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLimit()`` 
     - | The maximum number of documents to return. 
       | Default: ``0`` 

       .. note::

          This option is not available for ``FindOneOptions``. The
          ``FindOne()`` function internally uses ``SetLimit(-1)``.

   * - ``SetProjection()`` 
     - | The fields to include in the returned documents. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSkip()`` 
     - | The number of documents to skip.
       | Default: ``0``

   * - ``SetSort()`` 
     - | The field and type of sort to order the matched documents. You can specify an ascending or descending sort.
       | Default: none

Example
```````

The following example passes a context, filter, and ``FindOptions`` to
the ``Find()`` function, which performs the following actions:

- Matches documents where the ``rating`` falls between ``5`` and ``10``
- Returns the ``type`` and ``rating``, but excludes the ``_id`` 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin find docs
   :end-before: end find docs

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{type Masala} {rating 7}]
   [{type Earl Grey} {rating 9}]

Example
```````

The following example passes a context, filter, and ``FindOneOptions``
to the ``FindOne()`` function, which performs the following actions:

- Matches all documents
- A descending sort on the ``rating`` field
- Returns the ``type`` and ``rating``, but excludes the ``_id`` 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin find one docs
   :end-before: end find one docs

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{type Masala} {rating 10}]

.. _golang-retrieve-aggregation:

Aggregation Operations
----------------------

Use **aggregation operations** to retrieve and transform data from
MongoDB. Perform aggregation operations using the ``Aggregate()``
function.

Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Aggregate()`` function expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and
an **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation pipeline defines how to
transform data through stages. Some of the stages are matching
documents, renaming fields, and grouping values.

The function returns the resulting documents in a ``Cursor`` type. If
you omit the :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-match>`
stage, the pipeline proceeds using all documents in the collection.

To learn how to access data in a cursor, see :ref:`golang-cursor`.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Aggregate()`` function optionally takes an ``AggregateOptions``
type, which represents options you can use to modify its behavior. If
you don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for
each option.

The ``AggregateOptions`` type allows you to configure options with the
following functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``SetAllowDiskUse()`` 
     - | Whether to write to temporary files.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetBatchSize()`` 
     - | The number of documents to return in each batch.  
       | Default: none

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Whether to allow the write to opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.  
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetMaxTime()`` 
     - | The maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetMaxAwaitTime()`` 
     - | The maximum amount of time for the server to wait on new documents to satisfy a tailable cursor query.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetComment()`` 
     - | An arbitrary string to help trace the operation through the database profiler, currentOp and logs.
       | Default: ``""``

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents to retrieve.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLet()`` 
     - | Specifies parameters for the aggregate expression, which improves command readability by separating the variables from the query text.
       | Default: none

Example
```````

The following example passes a context and an aggregation pipeline that
performs the following actions:

- Groups reviews by types
- Calculates the average rating of each type

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregate docs
   :end-before: end aggregate docs

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Masala has an average rating of 8.5
   Earl Grey has an average rating of 7
