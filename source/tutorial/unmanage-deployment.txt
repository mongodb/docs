================================
Remove Processes from Monitoring
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` processes from |mms|
monitoring by "unmanaging" them. Unmanaging a process removes it from the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page and from management by |mms| but does not shut
it down. When you unmanage a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`
process, it continues to run. It simply isn't managed by |mms| anymore.

Considerations
--------------

If you intend to shut down a process and intend to do so through |mms|, do
that first, before unmanaging the process. See
:doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.

   If the process runs on an EC2 server, you can skip the "shutdown" and
   "unmanage" procedures and instead just terminate the EC2 instance. See
   :ref:`terminate-aws-server`.

Instead of removing processes from monitoring, you can optionally disable
their alerts, which allows you to continue to view the processes in the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page. See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.

Procedure
