.. procedure::
   :style: normal
      
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
      
   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` Dialog.

      - If you already have one or more {+database-deployments+}, click
        :guilabel:`Create` to display the 
        :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      - If this is your first {+database-deployment+}:
        
        a. Click :guilabel:`Build a Database`.
        #. Click :guilabel:`advanced configuration options` at the top of
           the screen to display the
           :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      
   .. step:: Select a {+database-deployment+} type.
      
      Use the tabs at the top of the screen to select your 
      {+database-deployment+} type. You can deploy the following 
      {+database-deployments+} from this page:
      
      Shared Clusters
        Shared clusters include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
        These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
        learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
        You can begin your project with a shared cluster and upgrade to a
        production-ready tier at a future time.
      
      Dedicated Clusters
        Dedicated clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
        ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
        and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
        datasets and high-traffic applications. Dedicated clusters can be
        deployed into a single geographical region or multiple geographical regions.
      
      {+Serverless-Instances+}
        {+Serverless-instances+} require minimal configuration and are best for
        applications that aren't critical and experience low or variable traffic. To learn
        more about {+serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Choose a
        {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.
      
      To create a {+serverless-instance+}, see 
      :doc:`Create a New {+Serverless-Instance+} </tutorial/create-serverless-instance>` 
      for next steps.
      
   .. step:: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.

      The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
      options for the available cluster tiers, network latency for clients
      accessing your cluster, the geographic location of the nodes in your
      cluster, and the :doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`.
      
      From the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` section, you can also
      choose to *deploy your cluster across multiple regions*. Multi-region
      clusters can better withstand data center outages and may contain
      dedicated geographic regions for localized reads, thereby improving
      performance. To learn how to deploy a multi-region cluster, see
      :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.
      
      For {+dedicated-clusters+}, from the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`
      section, you can also choose to *deploy separate Search Nodes for
      workload isolation*. To learn more about dedicated Search Nodes, see 
      :ref:`what-is-search-node`. To learn how to configure Search Nodes,
      see :ref:`configure-search-nodes`.
      
      To learn more, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.
      
   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier`.

      The selected tier dictates the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops|
      specification for each data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the
      cluster. 
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-auto-scaling-brief.rst
      
      For more information on how to select an appropriate cluster tier and
      storage settings for your workload, see
      :ref:`create-cluster-instance` and :ref:`create-cluster-storage`.
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-analytics-nodes-tier.rst
      
      For ``M10+`` {+clusters+}, you can also select a different tier for
      your Search Nodes. To learn more about the available tiers for your
      Search Nodes, see :ref:`select-tiers-for-search-nodes`. 
      
   .. step:: Select any :guilabel:`Additional Settings`.
      
      From the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section, you can:

   .. step:: Specify the :guilabel:`Cluster Details`.
      
      From the :guilabel:`Cluster Details` section, you can:
      
      - Specify the :guilabel:`Cluster Name`.
      
        This label identifies the {+cluster+} in |service|.
        
        .. note::
        
           |service| creates your hostname based on your {+cluster+} name.
       
        You can't change the {+cluster+} name after |service| deploys the 
        {+cluster+}. {+Cluster+} names can't exceed 64 characters in 
        length.

        .. include:: /includes/fact-sensitive-info-resource-tags.rst
      
   .. step:: Proceed to checkout.

      Click :guilabel:`Create Cluster` below the form and complete the 
      billing information only if it doesn't already exist. If your
      organization already has the billing information, |service| deploys
      your cluster.  
      
   .. step:: Update your :guilabel:`Billing Address` details as needed.
