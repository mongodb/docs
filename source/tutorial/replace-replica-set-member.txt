============================
Replace a Replica Set Member
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This procedure changes the hostname for a member of a :term:`replica
set` but preserves all other configuration options.

The procedure can be useful if you must replace an existing deployment
with a new deployment. If the new deployment uses the same configuration
options but different hostnames, use this procedure.

To change the hostname for a replica set member, use
:method:`rs.reconfig()` to change the value of the member's
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` field. The
:method:`rs.reconfig()` method does not change the value of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n]._id` field.

.. example::

   To change the hostname to ``mongo2.example.net`` for the replica set
   member configured at ``members[0]``, issue the following sequence of
   commands:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[0].host = "mongo2.example.net"
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

.. warning::

   Any replica set configuration change can trigger the current
   :term:`primary` to step down, which forces an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. This
   causes the current shell session, and clients connected to this replica set,
   to produce an error even when the operation succeeds.
