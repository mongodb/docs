sh.splitAt()

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.splitAt(namespace, query)

   Splits the chunk containing the document specified by the query as if
   that document were at the "middle" of the collection, even if the
   specified document is not the actual median of the collection.

   .. include:: /reference/method/sh.splitAt-param.rst

   Use this command to manually split chunks unevenly. Use the
   ":method:`sh.splitFind()`" function to split a chunk at the actual
   median.

   In most circumstances, you should leave chunk splitting to the
   automated processes within MongoDB. However, when initially deploying
   a :term:`sharded cluster` it is necessary to perform some measure of
   :term:`pre-splitting` using manual methods including
   :method:`sh.splitAt()`.
