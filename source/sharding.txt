Sharding

.. _sharding-background:

Sharding distributes a
single logical database system across a cluster of machines. Sharding
uses range-based portioning to distribute :term:`documents <document>`
based on a specific :term:`shard key`.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe sharding.

For an overview, see :doc:`/core/sharding`. To configure, maintain, and
troubleshoot sharded clusters, see :doc:`/administration/sharding`.
For deployment architectures, see :doc:`/administration/sharding-architectures`.
For details on the internal operations of sharding, see :doc:`/core/sharding-internals`.
For procedures for performing certain sharding tasks, see the
:ref:`Tutorials <sharding-tutorials>` list.
