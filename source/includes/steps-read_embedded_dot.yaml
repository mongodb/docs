  If you wish to select documents that exactly match just one of the
  fields in an embedded JSON object, use  :term:`dot notation`
  (``"field.nestedField"``).

  When querying using dot notation, the field and nested field must be
  inside quotation marks.
  
  The following example selects all documents where the field ``uom``
  nested in the ``size`` field equals ``"in"``:

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Note that the result record has a ``uom`` of ``in``.
