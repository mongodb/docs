The App client is the interface to the App Services
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication functionality
<dotnet-authenticate>`, :ref:`functions <dotnet-call-a-function>`, and
:ref:`sync management <dotnet-sync>`.

Access the App Client
---------------------

Pass the App ID for your App, which you can 
:ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.initialize-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-app-client-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

For most use cases, you only need your application's App ID to connect
to App Services. For granular control of your app connection, such as 
custom timeouts for connections and the log level, you can optionally pass an 
:dotnet-sdk:`AppConfiguration <reference/Realms.Sync.AppConfiguration.html>` 
object to the 
:dotnet-sdk:`App.Create() <reference/Realms.Sync.App.html#Realms_Sync_App_Create_Realms_Sync_AppConfiguration_>` 
method. The following example sets the LogLevel and the request timeout:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.appConfig.cs
   :language: csharp

You can create multiple App client instances to connect to multiple
Apps. All App client instances that share the same App ID use the same 
underlying connection.
