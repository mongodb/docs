======================
Shut Down a Deployment
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can shut down all the servers in a deployment, whether a
:term:`sharded cluster`, :term:`replica set`, or a deployment of just one
:term:`standalone server <standalone>`.

This procedure terminates all the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
instances in the deployment. The procedure does not, however, remove the
servers from MMS. MMS continues to monitor the servers and display their
status in the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. To remove a deployment from MMS
monitoring, see :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.

To restart a deployment that has been shut down, see
:doc:`/tutorial/restart-deployment`.
