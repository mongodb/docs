2024 Releases
-------------

.. _backend_20240821:

21 August 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New Apps can no longer enable GraphQL or Static Hosting. Apps that already have these 
  features will continue to have access until September 30 2025.

.. _backend_20240807:

07 August 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Device Sync
  - Fixed bug where some destructive changes in push-pull were not being handled properly
  - Fixed bug where unlinking a data source with Sync enabled would crash the UI
  - Fixed bug where failing to get Sync state would incorrectly show Sync as terminated

.. _backend_20240724:

24 July 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- GraphQL and Static Hosting Deprecation 

  - Apps that use GraphQL or Static Hosting will now display banners in their App Services 
    UI alerting customers of both the GraphQL and Static Hosting deprecations. For more
    information, refer to the :ref:`migrate-hosting-graphql` page.

  - The GraphQL template app (``web.graphql.todo``) is no longer available when creating a new
    app through the App Services UI, CLI, or Admin API.

- Fixed bug where disabled Triggers were not resuming properly after being enabled.

- Fixed bug where the Change Origin of Trigger deployments made in the Data Services UI were registered as Admin API
  instead of Atlas UI.

.. _backend_20240710:

10 July 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`Enabling automatic deployment <deploy-github>` allows App Services to automatically push a copy of your App to your designated repository, 
  making the :guilabel:`Export your application and upload to GitHub` section in the :guilabel:`Deployment` screen unnecessary. The section is removed and 
  the description under the :guilabel:`Enable Automatic Deployment` section is updated to make this behavior clear. 

- Deployment logs for your application now record the ``user_id`` for Admin API and CLI requests.

- Fixed bug where :ref:`match expressions <database-triggers-match-expression>` for Triggers were converted to incorrect formats if they contained a regular expression (``$regex``).

- App Services Function names can now include hyphens (-).

- When a free or shared Atlas cluster exceeds 500 collections, the max number of collections for these tiers, you will get an error message.
  For more information on the operational limits of free or shared clusters, see the :atlas:`Free and Shared Cluster Operational Limits </reference/free-shared-limitations/#operational-limits>`.

- Version metadata for :ref:`Partition-Based Sync Apps <partition-based-sync>` will now be pruned if the deployment version is older than 60 days.
  For more information on viewing previous App deployments, see :ref:`Deployment History <deployment-history>`. 

- Removed the option to change from Flexible Sync to Partition-Based Sync mode. The :guilabel:`Sync Types` field in the 
  :guilabel:`Device Sync` configuration screen now only displays if the cluster is associated with a Partition-Based Sync App. 
  Then, the option to switch sync modes will be left available, as we recommend :ref:`migrating to Flexible Sync <realm-sync-migrate-modes>`.

- Adding or removing collections for :ref:`Data Ingest <asymmetric-sync>` is a destructive change that requires restarting Sync. 
  In the :guilabel:`Device Sync` configuration screen, a modal now appears to allow you to terminate and restart Sync when confirming additions or removals for Data Ingest collections.

- Fixed bug where :ref:`revoking all of a user's current sessions <revoke-user-sessions>` did not immediately disconnect the user.
  Now, a user cannot stay connected or sync after all sessions are revoked.

.. _backend_20240626:

26 June 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Enable Atlas Events: App Services Apps react to changes made in their linked clusters.

  - On cluster deletion, Apps delete datasources and all resources linked to the datasources if they are connected to the deleted cluster.

  - When a user updates a cluster (for example, an instance size change), the next usage of a MongoDB client with
    the cluster will have a start time of 5 seconds or longer, due to refreshing client connection details. 

- CLI Improvements

  - The CLI defaults to a local deployment model on App creation.

  - The ``push`` command with a ``--dry-run`` flag now prints out the App diff.

  - The CLI command, ``appservices app diff``, now returns the App diff even when there is an error, such as a breaking change.

- To make billing more intuitive, App Services usage is charged at a daily instead of monthly rate. 
  Free tier App limits are updated to reflect the new daily model. For more information, see the :ref:`Billing <billing>` page. 

- :ref:`Datasource client configuration documents <appconfig-data_sources>` missing the ``cluster_size`` field are updated to include the field.

- If a Function name contains incorrect formatting upon creation of the Function, the Function name now appears in the validation error message for easy identification.
 
- :ref:`Timeseries collections <time-series-limitation>` not using data ingest are sync incompatible. 

.. _backend_20240605:

5 June 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for nested collections in ``Mixed`` properties is now available. To learn more, refer to :ref:`<collections-in-mixed>`. 

- Improvements to the Function Editor for all Apps, including the following changes:

  - A new :guilabel:`Format Code` button to format function code.

  - A new :guilabel:`Clear & Run` button that replaces the :guilabel:`Clear Result` button.
  
  - Autocomplete for common functionalities and App Services context.

- App error logs now include GraphQL failures.

- Users can no longer disable client max offline time. Users can continue to increase or decrease
  the number of days for client max offline time where necessary.

- Device Sync apps with an indexed queryable field now support schemas that do not contain the indexed queryable field. 
  Previously, the indexed queryable field was required to appear in the schemas of all of your Sync collections. 

.. _backend_20240522:

22 May 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Client requests that are successfully authenticated through Private Link do not get 
  checked against the app's IP Access List.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the timeout variable, ``maxTimeMS``, to accept ``float64`` for ``db.aggregate``
  and ``db.coll.aggregate`` commands.
