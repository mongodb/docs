Introduction
------------

Many applications make use of sensitive data such as confidential personal details, payment information, or proprietary data. In some jurisdictions, this type of data is subject to governance, privacy, and security compliance mandates. Unauthorized access of sensitive data or a failure to comply with a mandate often results in significant reputation damage and financial penalties. Therefore, it is important to keep sensitive data secure.

MongoDB offers several methods that protect your data from unauthorized access including:
 
* `Role-based access control <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authorization/>`_
* `Monitoring and logging <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/auditing/>`_
* `TLS/SSL network transport encryption <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-transport-encryption/>`_
* `Encryption at rest <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-encryption-at-rest/>`_

Another MongoDB feature that prevents unauthorized access of data is `Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-client-side-encryption/>`_. This feature allows a developer to selectively encrypt individual fields of a document on the client-side before it is sent to the server. This keeps the encrypted data private from the providers hosting the database as well as any user that has direct access to the database.

This guide provides steps for setup and implementation of CSFLE with a practical example.

.. note::

  Client-side Field Level Encryption is available starting in MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise only.

Problem
~~~~~~~

In this scenario, we secure sensitive data on a Medical Care Management System which stores patients' personal information, insurance information, and medical records for a fictional company, *MedcoMD*. None of the patient data is public, and certain data such as their social security number (SSN), insurance policy number, and vital sign measurements are particularly sensitive and subject to privacy compliance. It is important for the company and the patient that the data is kept private and secure.

MedcoMD needs this system to satisfy the following use cases:

- Doctors use the system to access Patients' medical records, insurance information, and add new vital sign measurements.
- Receptionists use the system to verify the Patients' identity, using a combination of their contact information and the last four digits of their Social Security Number (SSN).
- Receptionists can view a Patient's insurance policy provider, but not their policy number.
- Receptionists cannot access a Patient's medical records.

MedcoMD is also concerned with disclosure of sensitive data through any of the following methods:

- Accidental disclosure of data on the Receptionist's publicly-viewable screen.
- Direct access to the database by a superuser such as a database administrator.
- Capture of data over an insecure network.
- Access to the data by reading a server's memory.
- Access to the on-disk data by reading database or backup files.

What can MedcoMD do to balance the functionality and access restrictions of their Medical Care Management System?

Solution
~~~~~~~~

The MedcoMD software engineers review the Medical Care Management System specification and research the proper solution for limiting access to sensitive data.

The first MongoDB security feature they evaluated was `Role-Based Access Control <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authorization/>`_ which allows administrators to grant and restrict collection-level permissions for users. With the appropriate role definition and assignment, this solution prevents accidental disclosure of data and access. However, it does not prevent capture of the data over an insecure network, direct access of data by a superuser, access to data by reading the server's memory, or access to on-disk data by reading the database or backup files.

The next MongoDB security features they evaluated were `Encryption at Rest <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-encryption-at-rest/>`_ which encrypts the database files on disk and `Transport Encryption using TLS/SSL <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-transport-encryption/>`_ which encrypts data over the network. When applied together, these two features prevent access to on-disk database files as well as capture of the data on the network, respectively. When combined with Role-Based Access Control, these three security features offer near-comprehensive security coverage of the sensitive data, but lack a mechanism to prevent the data from being read from the server's memory.

Finally, the MedcoMD developers discovered a feature that independently satisfies all the security criteria. Client-side Field Level Encryption allows the developers to specify the fields of a document that should be kept encrypted. Sensitive data is transparently encrypted/decrypted by the client and only communicated to and from the server in encrypted form. This mechanism keeps the specified data fields secure in encrypted form on both the server and the network. While all clients have access to the non-sensitive data fields, only appropriately-configured CSFLE clients are able to read and write the sensitive data fields.

MedcoMD will provide Receptionists with a client that is not configured to access data encrypted with CSFLE. This will prevent them from viewing the sensitive fields and accidentally leaving them displayed on-screen in a public area. MedcoMD will provide Doctors with a client with CSFLE enabled which will allow them to access the sensitive data fields in the privacy of their own office.

Equipped with CSFLE, MedcoMD can keep their sensitive data secure and compliant to data privacy regulations with MongoDB.

A. Create a Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB `Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-client-side-encryption/>`_ uses an encryption strategy called *envelope encryption* in which keys used to encrypt/decrypt data (called **data encryption keys**) are encrypted with another key (called the **master key**). For more information on the features of envelope encryption and key management concepts, see `AWS Key Management Service Concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping>`_.

The master key, used by the MongoDB driver to create and encrypt data keys, should be stored remotely in a `Key Management System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management#Key_management_system>`_. The data encryption keys, generated and used by the MongoDB driver to encrypt and decrypt document fields, are stored in a key vault collection in the same database as the encrypted data.

In this step, we generate a local master key to expedite setup of our development environment.

.. admonition:: Local Master Keys Are Not Secure
   :class: important

   To ensure that the master key cannot be compromised, do not use a local master key in a production environment. Instead, use a secure KMS such as `AWS KMS <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`_.

   We demonstrate how to transition from a locally-hosted master key to a remote AWS KMS master key in a later step of this guide.

        The following script generates a 96-byte local master key and saves it to a file called ``master-key.txt`` in the directory from which the script is executed.

        .. code-block:: java

          import java.io.FileOutputStream;
          import java.io.IOException;
          import java.security.SecureRandom;

          public class CreateMasterKeyFile {
            public static void main(final String[] args) {

              final byte[] localMasterKey = new byte[96];
              new SecureRandom().nextBytes(localMasterKey);

              try (FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream("master-key.txt")) {
                stream.write(localMasterKey);
              } catch (IOException e)  {
                e.printStackTrace();
              }
            }
          }


B. Define a JSON Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`JSON Schema
<http://json-schema.org/>`_ is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and
validate JSON documents. MongoDB extends the JSON Schema standard to allow CSFLE
to use automatically encrypt and decrypt the fields of documents in a collection.

The following fields are required in the JSON Schema to enable automatic
encryption and decryption for each field:

* The encryption algorithm (:manual:`Deterministic Encryption </core/security-client-side-encryption#deterministic-encryption>` or :manual:`Random Encryption </core/security-client-side-encryption#random-encryption>`)
* The data key
* The BSON Type (only required by deterministically encrypted fields)

.. note::

    A single data key can be used for all encrypted fields, or you can use individual data keys that are specific to each field.


The MedcoMD engineers receive specific requirements for the fields of
data and their encryption strategies. The following table illustrates
the data model of the Medco Management System.



.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field type
     - Encryption Algorithm
     - BSON Type
   * - Name
     - Non-Encrypted
     - String
   * - SSN
     - Deterministic
     - Int
   * - Blood Type
     - Random
     - String
   * - Medical Records
     - Random
     - Array
   * - Insurance: Policy Number
     - Deterministic
     - Int (embedded inside `insurance` object)
   * - Insurance: Provider
     - Non-Encrypted
     - String (embedded inside `insurance` object)




To automatically encrypt and decrypt data, the MedcoMD engineers create
a JSON Schema that specifies which fields should be encrypted, and which
encryption method to use. Initially, they define a data key for all
fields in the data model by specifying the `encryptMetadata
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/security-client-side-automatic-json-schema/#encryptmetadata-schema-keyword>`_
attribute. All child properties will inherit this encryption key unless
specifically overwritten.

.. code-block:: javascript

        {
            "bsonType" : "object",
            "encryptMetadata" : {
                "keyId" : // copy and paste your keyID generated here
            },
            "properties": {
                // copy and paste your fields here
            }
        }

MedcoMD engineers create JSON objects for each field and append them to
the `properties` map.

SSN
+++
``ssn`` is a field representing the patient's social security number. This
field is sensitive and should be encrypted. MedcoMD engineers decide
upon deterministic encryption based on the following properties:

* Queryable
* High cardinality

.. code-block:: json

    "ssn": {
        "encrypt": {
            "bsonType": "int",
            "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
        }
    }



Blood Type
++++++++++
``bloodType`` is a field representing the patient's blood type. This field is
sensitive and should be encrypted. MedcoMD engineers decide
upon random encryption based on the following properties:

* No plans to query
* Low cardinality

.. code-block:: json

    "bloodType": {
        "encrypt": {
            "bsonType": "string",
            "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random"
        }
    }


Medical Records
+++++++++++++++
``medicalRecords`` is an array field holding a set of medical records. Each
medical record document specifies information, such as the patient's blood
pressure, weight, and heart rate.  This field is sensitive and should be
encrypted. MedcoMD engineers decide upon random encryption based on
the following properties:

* Array fields must use random encryption with CSFLE to enable auto-encryption

.. code-block:: json

    "medicalRecords": {
        "encrypt": {
            "bsonType": "array",
            "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random"
        }
    }

Insurance: Policy Number
++++++++++++++++++++++++
``insurance.policyNumber`` is a field embedded inside the ``Insurance`` object
field and represents the patient's policy number. This policy number is a
distinct and sensitive field. MedcoMD engineers decide upon
deterministic encryption based on the following properties:

* Queryable
* High cardinality

.. code-block:: json

    "insurance": {
        "bsonType": "object",
        "properties": {
            "policyNumber": {
                "encrypt": {
                    "bsonType": "int",
                    "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
                }
            }
        }
    }
