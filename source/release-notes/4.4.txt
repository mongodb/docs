.. _4.4-rel-notes-agg:

Aggregation
-----------

Union All (``$unionWith`` Stage)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :pipeline:`$unionWith` aggregation stage,
providing the ability to combines pipeline results from multiple
collections into a single result set.

For details, see :pipeline:`$unionWith`.

Custom Aggregation Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB provides the following new operators
that allow users to define custom aggregation expressions:

- :group:`$accumulator`

- :expression:`$function`

With the addition of these new operators, you can use aggregation to
write custom JavaScript expressions instead of relying on
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :query:`$where`.

.. note::

   Even before version 4.4, various map-reduce expressions could also
   be rewritten using :doc:`other aggregation pipeline operators
   </meta/aggregation-quick-reference>`, such as :pipeline:`$group`,
   :pipeline:`$merge`, etc., without requiring custom functions.
   
For more information, see
:doc:`/reference/map-reduce-to-aggregation-pipeline`.

.. _4.4-rel-notes-new-agg-operators:

New Aggregation Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   
   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :group:`$accumulator`
     
     - Returns the result of a user-defined
       :ref:`accumulator operator <agg-operators-group-accumulators>`.

   * - :expression:`$binarySize`
    
     - Returns the size of a given string or binary data value's
       content in bytes.

   * - :expression:`$bsonSize`
     - Returns the size in bytes of a given document (i.e. bsontype
       ``Object``) when encoded as :term:`BSON`.
     
   * - :expression:`$first`

     - Returns the first element in an array.

     - Replaces the first instance of a matched string in a given input.

   * - :expression:`$replaceAll`

     - Replaces all instances of a matched string in a given input.

General Aggregation Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$out``
````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$out` can output to a collection in
a different database. In earlier versions, :pipeline:`$out` can output
to a collection to the same database where the aggregation is run.

``$indexStats``
```````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4 (also available starting in 4.2.4),
:pipeline:`$indexStats` includes the following fields in its output:

.. container::

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 35 65
   
      * - Field
        - Description

      * - :ref:`shard <indexStats-output-shard>`

        - Name of the shard, if applicable.

      * - :ref:`spec <indexStats-output-spec>`
        - Index specification document

      * - :ref:`building <indexStats-output-building>`
        - A boolean flag that indicates if the index is currently being built.

``$merge``
``````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-merge-same-collection-behavior.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-merge-same-collection-warning.rst

.. _4.4-agg-planCachesStats-changes:

``$planCacheStats`` Changes
```````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-planCache-changes.rst

``$collStats`` Changes
``````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$collStats` accepts the 
``queryExecStats`` field as an argument document. Providing this field
returns the following fields in the output:

.. include:: /includes/fact-queryexecstats-reference.rst

``explain`` Changes
```````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, when you run the  
:method:`db.collection.explain().aggregate() <db.collection.explain()>` 
method in ``executionStats`` and ``allPlansExecution`` modes, each 
:doc:`pipeline stage </aggregation>` listed in the :doc:`explain output 
</reference/explain-results>` includes  :data:`nReturned 
<explain.executionStats.nReturned>` and 
:data:`executionTimeMillisEstimate 
<explain.executionStats.executionStages.executionTimeMillisEstimate>`.

Replica Sets
------------

Resumable Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, a secondary performing initial sync can attempt
to resume the sync process if interrupted by a *transient* (i.e.
temporary) network error, collection drop, or collection rename. The
sync source must also run MongoDB 4.4 to support resumable initial sync.
If the sync source runs MongoDB 4.2 or earlier, the secondary must
restart the initial sync process as if it encountered a non-transient
network error.

By default, the secondary tries to resume initial sync for 24 hours.
MongoDB 4.4 adds the
:parameter:`initialSyncTransientErrorRetryPeriodSeconds` server
parameter for controlling the amount of time the secondary attempts to
resume initial sync. If the secondary cannot successfully resume the
initial sync process during the configured time period, it selects a new
healthy source from the replica set and restarts the initial
synchronization process from the beginning. 

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, the secondary would restart the entire initial
sync if it encountered an error during the process.

Streaming Replication 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, *sync from* sources send a continuous 
stream of :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` entries to their 
syncing secondaries. 

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, secondaries fetched batches of :doc:`oplog 
</core/replica-set-oplog>` entries by issuing a request to their *sync 
from* source and waiting for a response. This required a network roundtrip 
for each batch of :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` entries. MongoDB 
4.4 adds the :parameter:`oplogFetcherUsesExhaust` startup parameter for 
disabling streaming replication and using the older replication behavior.

For details, see :ref:`replica-set-streaming-replication`.

Rollback Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-rollback-directory.rst

Minimum Oplog Retention Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-minimum-oplog-retention-period.rst

To configure the minimum oplog retention period when starting the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, either:

- Add the :setting:`storage.oplogMinRetentionHours` setting to the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` :ref:`configuration
  file <configuration-options>`.

  *-or-*

- Add the :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours 
  <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>` command line option.

To configure the minimum oplog retention period on a running
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`. Setting
the minimum oplog retention period while the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
is running overrides any values set on startup. You must update
the value of the corresponding configuration file setting or
command line option to persist those changes through a server
restart.

.. important::

   The oplog can grow without constraint so as to retain oplog entries
   for the configured number of hours. This may result in reduction or
   exhaustion of system disk space due to a combination of high write
   volume and large retention period.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/replica-set-oplog`

Indexes Build Simultaneously on Data-Bearing Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-fcv.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-nolink.rst

By default, index builds use a commit quorum of all data-bearing voting
members. To start an index build with a non-default commit quorum,
MongoDB 4.4 adds the :ref:`commitQuorum
<createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` parameter to
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` or its shell helpers
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`db.collection.createIndexes()`.

To modify the quorum required for an in-progress index
build, MongoDB 4.4 introduces the new :dbcommand:`setIndexCommitQuorum`
command.

See :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` for more information.

Replica Set Reconfiguration Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes to ``replSetReconfig``
``````````````````````````````
.. container::
  
  .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-replSetReconfig-majority.rst

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-replSetReconfig-single-node-voting-change.rst

Changes to ``replSetGetConfig``
```````````````````````````````

.. container::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-replSetGetConfiguration-commitmentStatus.rst

.. |moreinfo| replace:: For more information, see the
   :ref:`replSetGetConfig <replSetGetConfig-commitmentStatus>` command.

Changes to Replica Configuration Document
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. container::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-replSetGetConfig-term-field.rst

Preferred Initial Sync Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify the preferred initial sync
source using the :parameter:`initialSyncSourceReadPreference` parameter.
You can only set this parameter on :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup, using
either the :setting:`setParameter` configuration file setting or the
:option:`--setParameter <mongod --setParameter>` command line option.

:parameter:`initialSyncSourceReadPreference` supports following read
preference modes:

- :readmode:`primary`
- :readmode:`primaryPreferred` (Default for voting replica set members)
- :readmode:`secondary`
- :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
- :readmode:`nearest` (Default for newly added *or* non-voting replica set members)

If the replica set has disabled :rsconf:`chaining
<settings.chainingAllowed>`, the default
:parameter:`initialSyncSourceReadPreference` read preference mode 
is :readmode:`primary`.

You cannot specify a tag set or ``maxStalenessSeconds`` to
:parameter:`initialSyncSourceReadPreference`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`replica-set-initial-sync-source-selection`

.. _4.4-mirrored-reads:

Mirrored Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB provides :ref:`mirrored reads
   <mirrored-reads>` to pre-warm electable secondary members' cache with
   the most recently accessed data. With mirrored reads, the primary can
   mirror a subset of :ref:`operations
   <mirrored-reads-supported-operations>` that it receives and send them
   to a subset of electable secondaries. Pre-warming the cache of a
   secondary can help restore performance more quickly after an election.

   .. note::

      The primary's response to the client is not affected by the
      mirror reads. The mirrored reads are "fire-and-forget" operations
      by the primary; i.e., the primary does not await the response for
      the mirrored reads.

Mirrored Reads Parameter
````````````````````````

.. container::

   MongoDB 4.4 adds the following mirrored reads parameter. You can set
   the parameter at startup using the :setting:`setParameter`
   configuration file setting or the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
   --setParameter>` command line option or at runtime with
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command:

   .. container::

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 20 80
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Parameter
           - Description
   
         * - :parameter:`mirrorReads`

           - Specifies the ``samplingRate`` and ``maxTimeMS`` settings for
             mirrored reads.

             ``{ samplingRate: <float>, maxTimeMS: <int> }``

             A ``samplingRate`` of ``0`` turns off mirrored reads.

Mirrored Reads Metrics
``````````````````````

.. container::

   The command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` and its corresponding
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`db.serverStatus()` return
   :serverstatus:`mirroredReads` if you specify the field's inclusion
   in the operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, mirroredReads: 1 } )

   or

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus( { mirroredReads: 1 } )

Replica Set Write Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, replica set members in the
:replstate:`STARTUP2` state do not participate in write majorities.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/replica-set-write-concern`

Sharded Clusters
----------------

Refinable Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in 4.4, MongoDB provides the
   :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. With the new command,
   you can refine a collection's shard key by adding a suffix field or
   fields to the existing key. Refining a collection's shard key allows
   for a more fine-grained data distribution and can address situations
   where the existing key has led to :ref:`jumbo (i.e. indivisible)
   chunks <jumbo-chunks>` due to insufficient cardinality.

   For example, you may have an existing ``orders`` collection with the
   shard key ``{ customer_id: 1 }``. You can change the shard key by
   adding a suffix ``order_id`` field to the shard key so that ``{
   customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }`` becomes the new shard key, allowing
   data distribution by both ``customer_id`` and ``order_id`` fields.

   To use the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, the sharded
   cluster must have :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>`
   of ``4.4``. For more information, see the
   :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command.

   .. note::

      After you refine the shard key, it may be that not all documents in
      the collection have the suffix field(s). To populate the missing
      shard key field(s), see :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

      Before refining the shard key, ensure that all or most documents in
      the collection have the suffix fields, if possible, to avoid having
      to populate the field afterwards.

   In earlier versions, once you select a shard key, you cannot modify the
   shard key.

**Missing Shard Keys**

.. container::

   With the ability to refine a shard key with a suffix, it may be that
   not all documents in the collection have the suffix fields. Starting in
   version 4.4, documents in a sharded collection can be missing the shard
   key fields. In earlier versions, shard key fields must exist in every
   document for a sharded collection. For details, see
   :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

Hedged Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   To minimize latencies, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, by default, can
   use :ref:`hedge reads <mongos-hedged-reads>`. With hedged reads, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can route read operations to multiple
   members per each queried shard and return results from the first
   respondent per shard. By default, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
   support using hedged reads. To turn off a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance's support for hedged reads, set the
   :parameter:`readHedgingMode` parameter for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.


   Hedged reads are specified per operation as part of the read
   preference. Non-``primary`` :doc:`read preferences
   </core/read-preference>` support hedged reads. Read preference
   :readmode:`nearest` specifies hedged read by default.

   For more information, see:

   - :ref:`mongos-hedged-reads`

   - :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-mongos`

Hedged Read Parameters
``````````````````````

.. container::

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Parameter
        - Description

      * - :parameter:`readHedgingMode`

        - Enables or disables :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance's support for
          hedged reads.

      * - :parameter:`maxTimeMSForHedgedReads`

        - Specifies the maximimum time limit (in milliseconds) for the
          additional read sent to :ref:`hedge a read operation
          <mongos-hedged-reads>`.

Hedged Read Option for Read Preference
``````````````````````````````````````

.. container::

   To specify hedged read for a read preference, MongoDB 4.4 introduces
   the :ref:`read-preference-hedged-read`. To set using a MongoDB
   driver, refer to the driver :ecosystem:`read preference API
   documentation</drivers>`.

   The following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods can accept hedge
   options to enable hedged read for the specified read preference:

   - :method:`cursor.readPref()`

   - :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` 

Hedged Read Metrics
```````````````````

.. container::

   The command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` and its corresponding
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`db.serverStatus()` return
   :serverstatus:`hedgingMetrics`.

``balancerCollectionStatus`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   MongoDB 4.4 provides the command :dbcommand:`balancerCollectionStatus`
   and the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method
   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()` that return information about
   whether the chunks of a sharded collection are balanced (i.e. do not
   need to be moved) as of the time the command is run or need to be
   moved. With the command, users can verify that initial chunk creation
   and migration has finished.

Improved ``mongos`` Startup Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongos` adds the following new
default startup behavior:

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` will now preload a sharded cluster's routing
  table on startup, rather than doing so on-demand for the first
  incoming client connection.

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` will now prewarm its connection pool to shard
  hosts on startup, rather than doing so on-demand for incoming
  client connections.

This behavior results in faster servicing of initial client
connections after a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is started or
restarted. In particular, this allows sites that employ multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances to restart them as necessary, or add new
ones, without initial client requests to those instances needing to wait
on connection establishment.

Both routing table preloading and connection pool prewarming are enabled
by default.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following parameters for controlling this behavior:

- :parameter:`loadRoutingTableOnStartup` 

  - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)
  - Enables or disables support for preloading the routing table on
    startup for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

- :parameter:`warmMinConnectionsInShardingTaskExecutorPoolOnStartup`

  - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled) 
  - Enables or disables support for prewarming the connection pool on
    startup for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

- :parameter:`warmMinConnectionsInShardingTaskExecutorPoolOnStartupWaitMS`

  - *Default*: ``2000`` (2 seconds)
  - Sets the timeout in milliseconds before client connections
    to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` are allowed regardless of established
    connection pool size.

Improved Routing Table Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is no longer required after
executing the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` or :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`
commands. These two commands now automatically refresh a sharded
cluster's routing table as needed when run. Manually issuing the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command is still recommended in the cases
described under
:ref:`flushRouterConfig Considerations<flushrouterconfig-considerations>`.

.. _4.4-rel-notes-sharding-compound-hashed:

Compound Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can shard a collection using a compound
shard key with a single hashed field. Prior to 4.4, MongoDB did not
support compound shard keys with a hashed field.

Compound hashed sharding supports features like :ref:`zone sharding
<zone-sharding>`, where the prefix (i.e. first) non-hashed field or
fields support zone ranges while the hashed field supports more even
distribution of the sharded data. For example, the following operation
shards a collection on a compound hashed shard key that supports zoned
sharding:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "examples.compoundHashedCollection",
     { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB" : 1, "fieldC" : "hashed" }
   )

Compound hashed sharding also supports shard keys with a hashed prefix
for resolving data distribution issues related to :ref:`monotonically
increasing fields <shard-key-monotonic>` For example, the
following operation shards a collection on a compound hashed shard key
where the hashed field is the shard key prefix:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "examples.compoundHashedCollection",
     { "_id" : "hashed", "fieldA" : 1}
   )

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding` , :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-compound-hashed-index`

Chunk Migration Failover Resiliency Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following changes improve :term:`chunk`
migrations and :term:`orphaned document` cleanup resiliency during
failover:

- Chunk ranges awaiting cleanup after a chunk migration are now
  persisted in the :data:`config.rangeDeletions` collection and
  replicated throughout the shard. In the event of a failover, the
  shard's new primary reads the documents in the
  :data:`config.rangeDeletions` collection and resumes deleting the
  corresponding ranges. The document that describes a range awaiting
  cleanup is deleted from the :data:`config.rangeDeletions` collection
  after the range is deleted.

- The :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command no longer deletes orphaned
  documents from a shard. Instead, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` waits
  for orphaned documents that are scheduled for deletion from a shard to
  be deleted.

Set the :parameter:`disableResumableRangeDeleter` parameter to ``true``
on a shard's primary to pause range deletion on the shard.

General Sharded Clusters Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Index Consistency Checks
````````````````````````

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :doc:`config server
   </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` primary, by default, checks for
   index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections. The
   command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns the field
   :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` to report on index
   inconsistencies when run on the config server primary.

   To configure the index consistency checks, MongoDB provides the
   following parameters:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 40 65
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Description

      * - :parameter:`enableShardedIndexConsistencyCheck`
    
        - Enable or disable the index consistency checks. 

      * - :parameter:`shardedIndexConsistencyCheckIntervalMS`

        - The interval at which the config server's primary checks the
          index consistency of sharded collections.

Concurrent ``removeShard`` Operations
`````````````````````````````````````

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can have more than one
   :dbcommand:`removeShard` operation in progress.

   In earlier versions, :dbcommand:`removeShard` returns an error if
   another :dbcommand:`removeShard` operation is in progress.

Shard Key Limit
```````````````

.. container::

   Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB removes the 512-byte limit on the
   shard key size. For MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, a shard key cannot
   exceed 512 bytes.

Partial Results
```````````````

.. container::

   Starting in 4.4, if the :dbcommand:`find` or subsequent
   :dbcommand:`getMore` commands return partial results due to the
   unavailability of the queried shard(s), the output includes a
   boolean flag ``partialResultsReturned``.

Jumbo Chunk Migration
`````````````````````

.. container::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-migrate-jumbo-chunks.rst

Improved Catalog Cache Refresh 
``````````````````````````````

Starting in 4.4, if there is a stale chunk, the catalog cache is only 
refreshed when :ref:`routers <sharded-cluster-query-routing>` access 
a shard that previously had or currently has that chunk. 

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, any stale chunk caused the entire chunk distribution 
for a collection to be marked as stale and forced all 
:ref:`routers <sharded-cluster-query-routing>` who contact the shard 
to refresh their shard catalog cache. MongoDB 4.4 adds the 
:parameter:`enableFinerGrainedCatalogCacheRefresh` startup parameter 
for disabling catalog cache refresh for only a targeted shard and using 
the older catalog cache refresh behavior. The 
:parameter:`enableFinerGrainedCatalogCacheRefresh` parameter defaults to 
``true``.

Automatically Split ``system.sessions`` Collection
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in version 4.4 (and 4.2.7), MongoDB automatically splits the
``system.sessions`` collection into at least 1024 chunks and
distributes the chunks uniformly across shards in the cluster.

.. _4.4-projection:

Projection
----------

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, as part of making
:method:`~db.collection.find` and
:method:`~db.collection.findAndModify` projection consistent with
aggregation's :pipeline:`$project` stage, 

- The :method:`~db.collection.find` and
  :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify` projection can accept
  aggregation expressions and aggregation syntax, including the use of
  literals and aggregation variables. With the use of aggregation
  expressions and syntax, you can project new fields or project
  existing fields with new values.

- The :method:`~db.collection.find` and
  :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify` projection can specify
  embedded fields using the nested form; e.g. ``{ field: { nestedfield:
  1 } }`` as well as :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>`. In
  earlier versions, you can only use the dot notation.

For more information, see:

- :method:`db.collection.find()`
- :method:`db.collection.findOneAndDelete()`
- :method:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace()`
- :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`
- :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`

``$meta`` Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. container::

   ``$meta`` Keyword Support
      .. list-table::


         * - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :expression:`$meta` operator adds
             support for retrieving the ``indexKey`` metadata. The ``indexKey``
             metadata is for debugging purposes only and not for application
             logic. See :expression:`$meta` for more information.

   ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` Usage with ``find()``
      .. list-table::


         * - Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB makes the following
             :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` changes when used
             with :method:`db.collection.find()`:

             - You must specify the :query:`$text` operator in the query
               predicate to use :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>`.
       
             - You can sort the resulting documents by their search relevance,
               i.e. :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>`, without also
               having to project the ``textScore``.

               | In earlier versions, to include :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore"
                 } <$meta>` expression in the :method:`~cursor.sort()`, you must
                 also include the same expression in the projection.
               |

             - If you include the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>`
               expression in both the projection and sort, i.e.
               ``db.collection.find(<$text search>, <projection>).sort(<sort>)``,
               the projection and sort documents can have different field names
               for the expression.

               | In previous versions of MongoDB, if you include the :expression:`{
                 $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` in both the projection and sort, you
                 must specify the same field name in both places.

             For more information, see :ref:`project-meta-textscore-sort`. For
             examples of ``"textScore"`` projections and sorts, see
             :ref:`ex-text-search-score`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`4.4-compatibility-meta-textscore`

Transactions
------------

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4 with :ref:`feature compatibility version
   (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``, you can create collections and indexes
   inside a :doc:`multi-document transaction </core/transactions>`
   unless the transaction is a cross-shard write transaction.

   When creating a collection inside a transaction:

   - You can :ref:`implicitly create a collection
     <transactions-operations-ddl-implicit>`, such as with:

     - an insert operation against a non-existing collection; 

     - an update/findAndModify operation with ``upsert: true`` against
       a non-existing collection.

   - You can explicitly create a collection using the
     :dbcommand:`create` command or its helper
     :method:`db.createCollection()`.

   When :ref:`creating an index <transactions-operations-ddl-explicit>`
   inside a transaction:

   - You can create an index on a non-existing collection. The
     collection is created as part of the operation.

   - You can create an index on a new empty collection created earlier
     in the same transaction.

   For more details, see :ref:`transactions-create-collections-indexes`.

   MongoDB 4.4 adds a new parameter
   :parameter:`shouldMultiDocTxnCreateCollectionAndIndexes` which can
   enable (default) or disable collection and index creation inside a
   transaction. When setting the parameter for a sharded cluster, set
   the parameter on all shards.

   For explicit creation of a collection or an index inside a
   transaction, the transaction read concern level must be
   :readconcern:`"local"`. Explicit creation is through:

Security Improvements
---------------------

New Kerberos Validation Tool ``mongokerberos``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise 4.4 provides a new :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos`
tool for validating your platform's Kerberos configuration for use with
MongoDB, and for testing end-to-end client authentication through
Kerberos. When run, :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` returns a report
indicating any issues encountered, and provides potential advice for
resolving them. :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` is available in MongoDB
Enterprise only.

OCSP
~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB enables, by default, the use of OCSP
(Online Certificate Status Protocol) to check for certificate
revocation. The use of OCSP eliminates the need to periodically
download a :setting:`Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
<net.tls.CRLFile>` and restart the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` with the updated CRL.

In versions 4.0 and 4.2, the use of OCSP is available only through the
use of :setting:`system certificate store
<net.tls.certificateSelector>` on Windows or macOS.

.. seealso::

   - :doc:`/core/security-transport-encryption`

OCSP Stapling/Must Staple

   As part of its OCSP support, MongoDB 4.4 supports the following on
   Linux:

   .. include:: /includes/list-ocsp-support.rst

OCSP Parameters
```````````````

.. container::

   MongoDB 4.4 adds the following OCSP parameters. You can set these
   parameters at startup using the :setting:`setParameter` configuration
   file setting or the :option:`--setParameter <mongod --setParameter>`
   command line option:

   .. include:: /includes/list-table-ocsp-parameters.rst

.. _4.4-rel-notes-certificate-expiration-warning:

x.509 Certificates Nearing Expiry Trigger Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos`
logs a warning on connection if the presented x.509 certificate
expires within ``30`` days of the ``mongod/mongos`` system clock.
Specifically, the following connections to a ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` 
can trigger x.509 certificate expiry warnings:

- A :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or an application using a 
  :ecosystem:`MongoDB driver </drivers>` establishing a 
  :ref:`TLS connection <ssl-clients>` *or* performing 
  :ref:`x.509 client authentication <x509-client-authentication>` with
  a certificate expiring in less than 30 days. (i.e. 
  the certificate specified to :option:`mongo --tlsCertificateKeyFile 
  <mongo --tlsCertificateKeyFile>` or 
  :urioption:`tlsCertificateKeyFile`).

- A :binary:`~bin.mongod` cluster member performing 
  :ref:`x.509 membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  with a certificate expiring in less than 30 days. (i.e. the 
  certificate specified to 
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`,
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterCertificateSelector`,
  :option:`mongod --tlsClusterFile <mongod --tlsClusterFile>` or
  :option:`mongod --tlsClusterCertificateSelector 
  <mongod --tlsClusterCertificateSelector>`).

- A :binary:`~bin.mongos` cluster member performing
  :ref:`x.509 membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  with a certificate expiring within 30 days. (i.e. the certificate 
  specified to
  (i.e. the 
  certificate specified to 
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`,
  :setting:`net.tls.clusterCertificateSelector`,
  :option:`mongos --tlsClusterFile <mongos --tlsClusterFile>` or
  :option:`mongos --tlsClusterCertificateSelector`).

The warning log message resembles the following:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   <Timestamp> W NETWORK [connection] Peer certificate <Certificate Subject Name> expires...

Consider proactively renewing client x.509 certificates nearing
expiration to ensure continued connectivity to the cluster.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :parameter:`tlsX509ExpirationWarningThresholdDays`
parameter for controlling certificate expiration warning threshold. Set
the parameter to ``0`` to disable the warning. For complete
documentation, see :parameter:`tlsX509ExpirationWarningThresholdDays`.

TLS 1.3 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On CentOS 8 and RHEL 8, MongoDB 4.4 (as well as versions 4.2, 4.0, and
3.6) support TLS1.3.

User to DN Mapping Exits on Network or Authentication Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongod`, :binary:`~bin.mongos`, or
:binary:`~bin.mongoldap` returns an error if one of the user to
Distinguished Name (DN) mappings cannot be evaluated due
to networking or authentication failures to the LDAP server.

The :binary:`~bin.mongod`, :binary:`~bin.mongos`, or
:binary:`~bin.mongoldap` rejects the connection request and does not
check the remaining mappings, if any.

To specify the user to DN mapping, see:

- :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping`
- :option:`mongod --ldapUserToDNMapping`
- :option:`mongos --ldapUserToDNMapping`
- :option:`mongoldap --ldapUserToDNMapping`

Structured Logging
------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` / :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances now output all log messages in :ref:`structured JSON format
<log-message-json-output-format>`. Log entries are written as a series
of key-value pairs, where each key indicates a log message field type,
such as "severity", and each corresponding value records the associated
logging information for that field type, such as "informational".

This includes log output sent to the *file*, *syslog*, and *stdout*
(standard out) :ref:`log destinations <log-message-destinations>`, as
well as the output of the :dbcommand:`getLog` command.

Previously, log entries were output as plaintext.

The following log messages in JSON format indicate that a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` is listening and ready for connections:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:13.533+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":23015,   "ctx":"listener","msg":"Listening on","attr":{"address":"127.0.0.1"}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:13.533+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":23016,   "ctx":"listener","msg":"Waiting for connections","attr":{"port":27001,"ssl":"off"}}

Structured logging with key-value pairs allows for efficient log
analysis by automated tools or log ingestion services, and makes
programmatic :ref:`log parsing <log-message-parsing>` easier and more
powerful.

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-jq-with-structured-logging.rst

For more information on structured logging, including a detailed
examination of log entry components as well as command-line parsing
examples, see :doc:`Log Messages </reference/log-messages>`.

Multiple LDAP Password Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the ``ldapQueryPassword``
:dbcommand:`setParameter` command accepts either a string or 
an array of strings. If set to an array, each password is tried 
until one succeeds. This can be used to perform a rollover of the 
LDAP account password without downtime for MongoDB.

Platform Support
----------------

Added Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds support for the following platforms:

- **RHEL / CentOS / Oracle 8** on the
  :ref:`PPC64LE <prod-notes-supported-platforms-PPC64LE>` and
  :ref:`s390x <prod-notes-supported-platforms-s390x>` architectures

- **SLES 15** on the :ref:`s390x <prod-notes-supported-platforms-s390x>`
  architecture

- **Ubuntu 20.04** on the
  :ref:`x86_64 <prod-notes-supported-platforms-x86_64>`,
  :ref:`PPC64LE <prod-notes-supported-platforms-PPC64LE>`,
  :ref:`ARM64 <prod-notes-supported-platforms-ARM64>`, and
  :ref:`s390x <prod-notes-supported-platforms-s390x>` architectures

Removed Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 removes support for the following platforms:

- **Amazon Linux 2013.03**

- **RHEL / CentOS / Oracle 6** on the
  :ref:`s390x <prod-notes-supported-platforms-s390x>` architecture

- **Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2**

- **Windows 8 / Server 2012**

- **Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2**

- **macOS 10.12**

See :ref:`prod-notes-supported-platforms` for the full list of platforms
and architectures supported in MongoDB 4.4.

Mongo Shell
-----------

Mongo Shell Supports AWS IAM Credentials for Atlas Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports
using `AWS IAM credentials
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>`__
to authenticate to a `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__ cluster that
has been configured for AWS IAM authentication.

Authenticating in this manner uses the new ``MONGODB-AWS``
:urioption:`authentication mechanism <authMechanism>`, and requires that
you provide an AWS access key ID and a secret
access key, which may be specified in the :ref:`connection string
<connection-string-auth-options>` or on the command-line via the
:option:`--username <mongo --username>` and :option:`--password
<mongo --password>` options.

Additionally, if you are using an `AWS session token
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html>`__
for authentication with temporary credentials when using an `AssumeRole
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__
request, or when working with AWS resources that specify this value such
as Lambda, you may provide that session token in the connection string
using the  ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` :urioption:`authMechanismProperties`
value, or on the command-line via the :option:`--awsIamSessionToken
<mongo --awsIamSessionToken>` option.

Alternatively, if the AWS access key ID, secret access key, or
session token are defined on your platform using their respective
`AWS IAM environment variables
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list>`__
the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell will use these environment
variable values to authenticate; you do not need to specify them in the
connection string.

See :ref:`Connection String Authentication Options
<connection-string-auth-options>`
for usage, and :ref:`Connecting to an Atlas Cluster using MONGODB-AWS
<connections-string-example-mongodb-aws>` for examples.

Tools

New ``mongokerberos`` Kerberos Validation Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise 4.4 provides a new :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos`
tool for validating your platform's Kerberos configuration for use with
MongoDB, and for testing end-to-end client authentication through
Kerberos. When run, :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` returns a report

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, ``mongoreplay`` is removed from MongoDB
packaging. ``mongoreplay`` and its related documentation are migrated to
the `mongodb-labs <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongoreplay>`__
github project. Projects in ``mongodb-labs`` are experimental and not
officially supported by MongoDB.

Indexes
-------

.. _4.4-rel-notes-compound-hashed-index:

Compound Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds support for creating compound indexes with a single
:ref:`hashed field <index-type-hashed>`. MongoDB 4.2 and earlier
only supported single field hashed indexes.

The following operation creates a compound hashed index on ``country``
and ``_id``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.examples.createIndex( { "country" : 1, "_id" : "hashed" } )

Compound hashed indexes require :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion
<view-fcv>` set to ``4.4``.

.. seealso:: :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-sharding-compound-hashed`

Hidden Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB adds the ability to hide or unhide
indexes from the query planner. An index hidden from the query planner
is not evaluated as part of query plan selection.

By hiding an index from the planner, users can evaluate the potential
impact of dropping an index without having to drop the index. If the
impact is negative, the user can unhide the index instead of having to
recreate a dropped index. And because indexes are fully maintained
while hidden, hidden indexes are immediately available for use once
unhidden.

For details, see :doc:`/core/index-hidden`.

To support :doc:`hidden indexes </core/index-hidden>`, MongoDB
introduces:

- A new index option ``hidden``. The option can be specified in the
  following operations:

  - :ref:`createIndexes  <cmd-createIndexes-hidden>` command

  - :ref:`db.collection.createIndex() <method-createIndex-hidden>` and
    :ref:`db.collection.createIndexes() <method-createIndexes-hidden>` methods

  - :collflag:`collMod <index>` command

- New :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper methods to hide or unhide
  existing indexes:

  - :method:`db.collection.hideIndex()`

  - :method:`db.collection.unhideIndex()`


``dropIndexes`` Can Abort In-Progress Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an index specified to :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` is still building,
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes` attempts to abort the in-progress build.
Aborting an index build has the same effect as dropping the built index.
Prior to MongoDB 4.4, :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` would return an error if
the collection had any in-progress index builds. This behavior also
applies to the shell helpers :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` and
:method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()`.

- The indexes specified to :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` /
  :method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` must be the entire set of
  in-progress builds associated to a given index builder, i.e. the
  indexes built by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes` or
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.

- The index specified to :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` must be
  the only index associated to the index builder, i.e. the indexes built
  by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes` or
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.

To drop a specific index out of a set of related in-progress builds,
wait until the index builds complete and specify that index to
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes` or its shell helpers.

For more complete documentation, see:

- :ref:`dropIndexes-cmd-index-builds` for the :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command.
- :ref:`dropIndexes-method-index-builds` for the :method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` method.

Networking
----------

.. _4.4-rel-notes-tcp-fast-open:

Support for TCP Fast Open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` support TCP Fast Open (TFO) connections by
default. TFO requires both the client and the ``mongod/mongos``
host machines support and enable TFO:

Windows
  The following Windows operating systems support TFO:

  - Microsoft Windows Server 2016 or later.
  - Microsoft Windows 10 Update 1607 or later.

macOS
  macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and later support TFO

Linux
  Linux operating systems running Linux Kernel 3.7 or later can
  support inbound TFO connections.

  Linux operating systems running Linux Kernel 4.11 or later can
  support both inbound and outbound TFO connections.

  Set the value of ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen`` to enable 
  support for inbound and/or outbound TFO connections:

  - Set to ``1`` to enable only outbound TFO connections
  - Set to ``2`` to enable only inbound TFO connections
  - Set to ``3`` to enable inbound and outbound TFO connections.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following parameters for controlling 
TFO:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenServer` 
     - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)
     
       Enables or disables support for inbound TFO connections to the
       ``mongod/mongos``

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenClient`
     - *Default*: ``true`` (Enabled)

       *Linux Operating System Only* 
       
       Enables or disables support for outbound TFO connections
       from the ``mongod/mongos``.

   * - :parameter:`tcpFastOpenQueueSize`
     - *Default*: ``1024``

       Control the size of the queue of pending TFO connections.

MongoDB 4.4 adds the following counters to the output of 
:dbcommand:`serverStatus` and :method:`db.serverStatus()`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Counter
     - Description

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.kernelSetting` 
     - *Linux only* 
     
       Indicates kernel support for TFO.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.serverSupported` 
     - Indicates operating system support for incoming TFO connections.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.clientSupported` 
     - Indicates operating system support for outgoing TFO connections.

   * - :serverstatus:`network.tcpFastOpen.accepted` 
     - Indicates the total number of accepted incoming TFO connections 
       to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` since the
       ``mongod/mongos`` last started.

A complete discussion of TFO is outside the scope of this documentation.

General Improvements
--------------------

.. _4.4-rel-notes-sort-memory-limit:

Blocking Sort Limit Increased
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order for a
given :method:`cursor.sort()` operation, MongoDB must perform a blocking
sort on the data. A blocking sort indicates that MongoDB must consume
and process all input documents to the sort before returning results.
Blocking sorts do not block concurrent operations on the
collection or database.

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB returned an error if a blocking sort
operations required more than 32 megabytes of system memory. Starting in
MongoDB 4.4, blocking sort operations increase the limit on system
memory to use for the sort operation to 100 megabytes. For blocking sort
operations which require more than 100 megabytes of system memory,
MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query specifies
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).

For more information on sorting and index use, see
:ref:`sort-index-use`.

``find`` Can Use Temporary Files To Support Large Non-Indexed Sorts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds a new option :ref:`allowDiskUse
<find-cmd-allowDiskUse>` to the :dbcommand:`find` command. With
:ref:`allowDiskUse: true <find-cmd-allowDiskUse>`, the operation can use
temporary files on disk when processing a non-indexed ("blocking") 
:ref:`sort <find-cmd-sort>` operation that exceeds the 
100 megabyte memory limit. Prior to MongoDB 4.4, a :dbcommand:`find`
operation with a blocking sort failed if it exceeded the memory limit
while processing the sort.

For the :method:`db.collection.find()` shell method with
:method:`cursor.sort()`, MongoDB 4.4 adds the 
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` cursor modifier.

:ref:`allowDiskUse <find-cmd-allowDiskUse>` and
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` have no effect if MongoDB can satisfy
the sort using an :ref:`index <index-sort>`, *or* if the
blocking sort requires less than 100 megabytes of memory.

For instructions on enabling :ref:`allowDiskUse <find-cmd-allowDiskUse>` 
for queries issued through a MongoDB driver, defer to the documentation 
for your preferred 
:ecosystem:`MongoDB 4.4-compatible driver </drivers>`.

Collection Namespace Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4,

Validation Data Throughput Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-validate-data-throughput.rst

.. seealso:: :ref:`4.4-validate-method-signature`

``compact`` Behavior Change 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocking 
````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :dbcommand:`compact` only blocks the following 
metadata operations: 

- :method:`db.collection.drop`
- :method:`db.collection.createIndex` and 
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes`
- :method:`db.collection.dropIndex` and 
  :method:`db.collection.dropIndexes`

:dbcommand:`compact` does not block :ref:`crud` for the database it is 
currently operating on.  

Previously, :dbcommand:`compact` blocked all operations for 
the database it was operating on, including :ref:`crud`, and was 
therefore only appropriate for use during scheduled maintenance 
periods. 

``force`` Option 
````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the ``force`` flag forces :dbcommand:`compact` 
to run on the :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica set`.

Previously, the ``force`` option, when set to ``true`` enabled 
:dbcommand:`compact` to run on the :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica 
set` and if set to ``false``, returned an error when run on a 
:term:`primary`.

.. seealso:: 

   :ref:`compact`

``mongod --repair`` Behavior Change 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :option:`mongod --repair` rebuilds all 
indexes for the following: 

- Collections with inconsistencies between the collection data and 
  one or more indexes.
- Salvaged and modified collections. 

In earlier versions of MongoDB, the :option:`mongod --repair` option 
rebuilt all indexes for all collections.

``serverStatus`` Output Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field Name Change
`````````````````

:dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns
:serverstatus:`flowControl.locksPerKiloOp` instead of
:serverstatus:`flowControl.locksPerOp`.

       - :data:`initialSyncAttempts.totalTimeUnreachableMillis <replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus.initialSyncAttempts>`

.. _4.4-rel-notes-db-auth-passwordPrompt:

db.auth() Can Prompt for Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
:ref:`db-auth-syntax-username-password` prompts for the password if
you do not pass in the password or the :method:`passwordPrompt()`
method for the ``<password>``.

Support for ``$natural`` Sort on Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-natural-sort-views.rst


Support for Diagnostic Backtrace Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
processes running on Linux will now log a backtrace for each of their
running threads upon receipt of a ``SIGUSR2`` signal. This backtrace can
be analyzed for diagnostic information or provided to MongoDB support as
needed. This functionality is currently available only on the ``x86_64``
architecture. For more information on using this feature, see
:ref:`sigusr2-diagnostic-backtrace`.

Container-aware FTDC Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :ref:`FTDC <ftdc-stub>` now reports utilization
data for a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running in a container from the
perspective of the container, as opposed to the host operating system.
See :ref:`ftdc-stub` for more information.

Updated ``ulimit`` Startup Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will log a startup
warning if a platform's configured ``ulimit`` value for number of open
files is under ``64000``. Previously, a warning would only be
logged if this value was under ``1000``. See
:ref:`recommended-ulimit-settings` for more information.

New ``replanReason`` Database Profiler Output Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :data:`replanReason<system.profile.replanReason>`
field to
:doc:`database profiler output </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
and :doc:`diagnostic log messages </reference/log-messages>`. The
``replanReason`` field contains the reason the query system evicted a
:ref:`cached plan <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

``dbStats`` and ``collStats`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command and its :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
helper :method:`db.stats()` return:

- :data:`~dbStats.totalSize`, which is the sum of
  :data:`~dbStats.storageSize` and :data:`~dbStats.indexSize`.

The :dbcommand:`collStats` command, its :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
helper :method:`db.collection.stats()`, and the :pipeline:`$collStats`
aggregation stage return:

- :data:`~collStats.totalSize`, which is the sum of
  :data:`~collStats.storageSize` and :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize`.

- :data:`~collStats.freeStorageSize`, which is the amount of storage
  available for reuse.

Hint Available for Additional Database Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following database commands can accept
a ``hint`` argument to specify the index to use:

- The :dbcommand:`delete` command and the associated
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods
  :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()` and
  :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()`.

- The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command and the associated
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods:

  - :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`,
  - :method:`db.collection.findOneAndDelete()`,
  - :method:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace()`,
  - :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`

See:

- :dbcommand:`delete`
- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`

JavaScript Execution on ``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB allows JavaScript execution on
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. To disable JavaScript execution on a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance:

- Set
  :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` configuration option to false, or 

- Specify the :option:`--noscripting <mongos --noscripting>`
  command-line option.

Earlier versions of MongoDB do not allow JavaScript execution on
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Global Default Read and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` 4.4+
   :class: note

   Each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set or sharded cluster
   *must* have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <set-fcv>` set to at
   least ``4.4`` to configure global default read and write concern.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, replica sets and sharded clusters support
configuring global default read and write concern settings. Clients
which do not explicitly specify a given read or write concern setting
inherit the corresponding global default setting.

To configure default global default read or write concern, MongoDB adds
the :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` administrative command. For replica
sets, issue the command against the :term:`primary` member. For sharded
clusters, issue the command from a :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

To retrieve the global default read or write concern settings, MongoDB
adds the :dbcommand:`getDefaultRWConcern` administrative command.

Read Concern Provenance
```````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, read concern objects may include a
``provenance`` field, indicating where the read concern originated.

The following table shows the possible read concern ``provenance``
values and their significance:

.. include:: /includes/fact-rc-provenance-table.rst

If a read operation is logged or profiled, the operation entry contains
the read concern object, including the ``provenance`` field.

.. include:: /includes/fact-provenance-diagnostic.rst

Write Concern Provenance
````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, write concern objects may include a
``provenance`` field, indicating where the write concern originated.

The following table shows the possible write concern ``provenance``
values and their significance:

.. include:: /includes/fact-wc-provenance-table.rst

If a write operation is logged or profiled, the operation entry contains
the write concern object, including the ``provenance`` field.

.. include:: /includes/fact-provenance-diagnostic.rst

``currentOp`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The :pipeline:`$currentOp` includes
  :data:`~$currentOp.dataThroughputAverage` and
  :data:`~$currentOp.dataThroughputLastSecond` information when
  reporting on validate operations in progress.

- The :dbcommand:`currentOp` command includes
  :data:`~currentOp.dataThroughputAverage` and
  :data:`~currentOp.dataThroughputLastSecond` information when
  reporting on validate operations in progress.

New KMIP Connection Parameters for ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 Enterprise introduces two new configuration settings to
enhance the initial connection to a KMIP server, as part of Kerberos
authentication:

Connection Retries
``````````````````

To control the number of times the :binary:`~bin.mongod` retries a
failed initial connection to the KMIP server:

- Set the :setting:`security.kmip.connectRetries` configuration option,
  or

- Specify the :option:`mongod --kmipConnectRetries` command-line option.

Connection Timeout
``````````````````

To control the timeout, in milliseconds, to wait for the initial
response from the KMIP server before giving up, or retrying:

- Set the :setting:`security.kmip.connectTimeoutMS` configuration
  option, or

- Specify the :option:`mongod --kmipConnectTimeoutMS` command-line
  option.

These settings are available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

New Startup Option for ``mongod`` 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new :parameter:`processUmask` startup option for :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
allows you to set permissions through `umask 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask>`_ for groups and other users when 
:parameter:`honorSystemUmask` is set to ``false``.

``mapReduce`` Ignores ``verbose`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command and the
:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` shell method ignore the
:ref:`verbose <cmd-mapreduce-verbose>` option.

``explain`` Support for ``mapReduce``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, you can use the :dbcommand:`explain` command
or the :method:`db.collection.explain()` shell method to preview the
results of :dbcommand:`mapReduce` or
:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`. 

Improvements to ``explain`` Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4:

- :doc:`Explain results </reference/explain-results/>` for commands run
  on sharded clusters include a top-level :ref:`serverInfo <serverInfo>`
  object for the :binary:`~bin.mongos` in addition to the ``serverInfo``
  objects returned for each shard. This is also available in versions 
  4.2.2, 4.0.14, and 3.6.16.

- :doc:`Explain results </reference/explain-results/>` include the
  :ref:`serverInfo <serverInfo>` object when
  :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline` is ``true``. In
  previous versions of MongoDB, ``explain`` results would occasionally
  not include the ``serverInfo`` object when
  :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline` was ``true``. This is 
  also available in versions 4.2.2, 4.0.14, and 3.6.16.

- :doc:`Explain results </reference/explain-results/>` for aggregation include 
  the :data:`nReturned <explain.executionStats.nReturned>` and 
  :data:`executionTimeMillisEstimate 
  <explain.executionStats.executionStages.executionTimeMillisEstimate>` fields 
  for each :doc:`pipeline stage </aggregation>` when you run 
  :method:`db.collection.explain().aggregate() <db.collection.explain()>` 
  method in ``executionStats`` and ``allPlansExecution`` modes.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Explain results </reference/explain-results/>`.

``comment`` Option Available to all Database Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, all database commands support specifying a
``comment`` field, in the following fashion:

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { <command> , "comment" : <any BSON type> })

Once set, the comment appears alongside records of the command in the
following locations:

- :ref:`mongod log messages <log-messages-ref>`, in the
  ``attr.command.cursor.comment`` field.
- :ref:`Database profiler <profiler>` output, in the :data:`command.comment
  <system.profile.command>` field.
- :dbcommand:`currentOp` output, in the :data:`command.comment
  <currentOp.command>` field.

A comment must be a valid :ref:`BSON object <bson-types>`
(string, integer, array, etc).

Improvements to Positional ``$`` Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, when using the positional :projection:`$`
operator, you can specify different array fields between the query
document and projection document.

For example, if you insert the following document into a collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.foo.insertOne( { a: [ "one", "two", "three" ], b: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } )

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can use the following query to project
only the first element from field ``b`` for a document that matches
the query specified on field ``a``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.foo.findOne( { a: "one" }, { "b.$": 1 } )

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-behavior-project-different-array.rst

In previous versions of MongoDB, this operation fails because the array
field being limited **must** appear in the query document.
