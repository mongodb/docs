   * - Configuration Option
     - Limitation

   * - Cloud Service Provider and Region
     - |service| can deploy ``M0`` Free Tier clusters to the 
       :ref:`amazon-aws` ``us-east-1 (N. Virginia, USA)`` or 
       ``eu-central-1 (Frankfurt, Germany)`` region. This does not 
       affect other clusters in the |service| project.
       
       |service| can deploy ``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters to a subset of 
       regions on :ref:`amazon-aws`, :ref:`google-gcp`, and 
       :ref:`microsoft-azure`.

     - Version is set to ``MongoDB 3.4 with WiredTiger`` and cannot
       be modified for ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared clusters.

   * - Instance Size
     - You must select the ``M0`` instance size to deploy a Free Tier 
       cluster.

   * - Instance Memory
     - You cannot configure memory for ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared
       instances.

   * - Instance Storage
     - You cannot configure storage size for ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5``
       shared instances.

   * - Replication Factor
     - Replication Factor is set to ``3 Nodes`` and cannot be modified for
       ``M0`` Free Tier, or ``M2/M5`` shared clusters.

   * - Do You Want A Sharded Cluster
     - You cannot deploy a ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster 
       as a Sharded Cluster.

   * - Do You Want To Enable Backup
     - You cannot enable backups on ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared
       clusters.

   * - Test Failovers
     - You cannot perform primary failover testing on ``M0`` Free Tier or
       ``M2/M5`` shared clusters.

The following table lists the operational limitations of |service| 
``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>`
     - |service| Free Tier clusters do not support the
       ``allowDiskUse`` option for the
       :manual:`aggregation command </reference/command/aggregate>`
       or its
       :manual:`helper method 
       </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`.

   * - Throughput
     - Maximum of 100 operations per second allowed for ``M0`` Free Tier and
       ``M2/M5`` shared clusters.

   * - Query Utilization
     - The percentage of time that a query is running over any five
       minute period must remain under 100% on ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5``
       shared clusters .

   * - Connections
     - ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters are allowed a maximum
       of 100 connections.

   * - Network bandwidth

     - Restricted to 2 x the storage size limit per week for both incoming and
       outgoing. That is:

       - ``M0``: 1 GB per week 

       - ``M2``: 4 GB per week

       - ``M5``: 10 GB per week

   * - Javascript
     - ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared clusters do not support

   * - API Access
     - You cannot modify or configure an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster using 
       the :doc:`/reference/api/clusters` API endpoint. A subset of 
       API endpoints support ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared clusters.

   * - Number of Free Tier clusters
     - You can deploy at most *one* Free Tier cluster per |service| 
       project.

   * - Database Commands
