Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to retrieve data from your MongoDB
database. To retrieve data, use read operations.

Read operations allow you to do the following:

- Retrieve a subset of documents from your collection using a :ref:`find operation <retrieve-find>` 
- Perform transformations on retrieved documents from your collection using an :ref:`aggregate operation <retrieve-aggregate>`
- Monitor real-time changes to your database using a :ref:`change stream <retrieve-watch>` 

.. _retrieve-paint-order-collection:

Sample Data for Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections feature examples of how the owner of a paint
store manages their customers' orders. For each order, the owner keeps
track of the color and quantity, which corresponds to the ``color`` and
``qty`` fields in their ``paint_order`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "purple", "qty": 4 }
   { "_id": 4, "color": "green", "qty": 11 }

.. _retrieve-find:

Find Operation
--------------

Use the find operation to retrieve a subset of your existing data in
MongoDB. You can specify what data to return including which documents
to retrieve, in what order to retrieve them, and how many to retrieve. 

To perform a find operation, call the ``find()`` method on an instance
of a ``MongoCollection``. This method searches a collection for documents that
match the query filter you provide. For more information on how to
specify a query, see our :doc:`Specify a Query
</fundamentals/crud/query-document>` guide. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The owner would like to know which orders contain greater than three, but
less than nine cans of paint from their :ref:`paint_order collection <retrieve-paint-order-collection>`.

To address this scenario, the owner finds orders to match the criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Retrieve.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin findExample
   :end-before: end findExample

For more information on how to build filters, see our :doc:`Filters Builders
</fundamentals/builders/filters>` guide.

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 2, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "purple", "qty": 4 }

After the owner runs this query, they find two orders that matched the
criteria. 

For a runnable ``find()`` example, see our :doc:`Find Multiple
Documents </usage-examples/find>` page. 

.. _retrieve-aggregate:

Aggregate Operation
-------------------

Use the aggregate operation to perform the stages in an aggregation
pipeline.  An aggregation pipeline is a multi-staged transformation that
produces an aggregated result. 

To perform an aggregate operation, call the ``aggregate()`` method on an
instance of a ``MongoCollection``. This method accepts aggregation
expressions to run in sequence. To perform aggregations, you can
define aggregation stages that specify how to match documents, rename
fields, and group values. For more information, see our
:doc:`Aggregation </fundamentals/aggregation>` guide.

Example
~~~~~~~

The owner would like to know which paint color is the most purchased
(highest quantity sold) from their :ref:`paint_order collection <retrieve-paint-order-collection>`.

To address the scenario, the owner creates an aggregation pipeline that:

- Matches all the documents in the ``paint_order`` collection
- Groups orders by colors 
- Sums up the quantity field by color
- Orders the results by highest-to-lowest quantity

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Retrieve.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregateExample
   :end-before: end aggregateExample

The following shows the output of the preceding aggregation:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": "green", "qty": 19 }
   { "_id": "purple", "qty": 14 }

After the owner runs the aggregation, they find that "green" is the most
purchased color.

For more information on how to construct an aggregation pipeline, see
the MongoDB server manual page on :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>`.

.. _retrieve-watch:

Change Streams
--------------

Open a change stream to monitor real-time changes to a collection.
Change streams can subscribe to specific types of data changes and 
immediately produce change events. For more information on change
streams, see the MongoDB server manual page on :manual:`Change Streams
</changeStreams>`. 

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method on an instance of a
``MongoCollection``, ``MongoDatabase``, or ``MongoClient``. 
You can pass an aggregation pipeline to this method to notify you as
soon as a change occurs.

.. important::

   Change streams don't support standalone MongoDB instances because
   standalone MongoDB instances don't have an oplog. 

The instance you call the ``watch()`` method on determines the scope of
events which the change stream listens for. If you call ``watch()`` on a
``MongoCollection``, the method monitors a collection. If you call
``watch()`` on a ``MongoDatabase``, the method monitors all the
collections in the database. If you call ``watch()`` on a
``MongoClient``, the method monitors a standalone MongoDB instance, a
replica set, or a sharded cluster. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The owner would like to receive notifications for when customers submit new
orders or update their orders in the :ref:`paint_order collection <retrieve-paint-order-collection>`.

To address this scenario, the owner:

- Creates an aggregation pipeline that filters for "insert" and "update" operation types
- Creates a change stream on the aggregation pipeline
- Prints changes picked up by the change stream

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Retrieve.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin watchExample
   :end-before: end watchExample

After creating the change stream, the owner gets notifications for
future inserts or updates to their collection.

An insert notification looks similar to the following:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   Received a change to the collection: ChangeStreamDocument{
      operationType=OperationType{value='insert'},
      resumeToken={"_data": "825EC..."},
      namespace=database.collection,
      ...
   }

For a runnable ``watch()`` example, see our :doc:`Watch For
Changes </usage-examples/watch>` page.
