The user information on this page applies to deployments hosted in 
all of the following environments unless specified otherwise:

{+atlas+} Limitations
------------------------------

The following limitations apply only to deployments hosted in
{+atlas+}. If any of these limits present a problem for your organization, 
contact :atlas:`Atlas support </support>`.

* The available {+atlas+} :atlas:`built-in roles </security-add-mongodb-users/#std-label-atlas-user-privileges>` 
  and :atlas:`specific privileges </security-add-mongodb-users/#std-label-atlas-specific-privileges>` 
  support a subset of MongoDB commands. 
  See :atlas:`Unsupported Commands in M10+ Clusters </unsupported-commands/#std-label-paid-tier-command-limitations>` 
  for more information.

* {+atlas+} supports a maximum of 100 database users per {+atlas+}
  project. If you require more than 100 database users on a project,
  contact :atlas:`Atlas support </support>`.

* You must use the :atlas:`Atlas CLI </cli/stable/command/atlas-dbusers-create>`, 
  :atlas:`Atlas Administration API </reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Database-Users>`, 
  Atlas UI, or a supported :atlas:`integration </partner-integrations/#std-label-partner-integrations>` 
  to add, modify, or delete database users on {+atlas+} database deployments.
  Otherwise, {+atlas+} rolls back any user modifications.

.. _add-user-prereq:

Prerequisites
-------------

If you have enabled access control for your deployment, you can use
the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to create the first
user in the system. This first user must have privileges to create
other users. As of MongoDB 3.0, with the localhost exception, you
can only create users on the ``admin`` database. Once you create the
first user, you must authenticate as that user to add subsequent users.
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` provides more detail about
adding users when enabling access control for a deployment.

For routine user creation, you must possess the following permissions:

.. include:: /includes/access-create-user.rst

To create users for {+atlas+}, you must have
:atlas:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Organization-Owner>` 
or :atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner>` 
access to {+atlas+}. These roles are unique to {+atlas+} and are 
separate from database users. 
To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles>`.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   The following procedures use :ref:`authentication-scram`
   authentication. For additional information on other authentication
   mechanisms, see :ref:`create-users-examples`.

Configure Database Users for {+atlas+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A {+atlas+} project can have users with different authentication methods.

You cannot change a user's authentication method after creating that
user. To use an alternative authentication method, you must create a
new user.

Configure database users for your {+atlas+} deployment who 
use :ref:`authentication-scram` authentication:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI
      :tabid: cli   

      The Atlas CLI uses the following commands to create new database users and 
      X.509 certificates. The options you specify determine the authentication method.

      To create a database user for your project using the Atlas CLI, 
      run the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         atlas dbusers create [builtInRole]... [options]

      To create a new Atlas-managed X.509 certificate for the specified 
      database user using the Atlas CLI, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         atlas dbusers certs create [options]

      To learn more about the syntax and parameters for the previous commands, 
      see the Atlas CLI documentation for 
      :atlas:`atlas dbusers create </cli/stable/command/atlas-dbusers-create>` and
      :atlas:`atlas dbusers certs create </cli/stable/command/atlas-dbusers-certs-create>`.

      .. see:: Related Links

         - :atlas:`Install the Atlas CLI </cli/stable/install-atlas-cli>`
         - :atlas:`Connect to the Atlas CLI </cli/stable/connect-atlas-cli>`

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps/add-scram-user.rst

.. _create-users-examples:

Examples
--------

To create a user in a MongoDB deployment, you connect to the
deployment, and then use the :method:`db.createUser()` method
or :dbcommand:`createUser` command to add the user.

Username/Password Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a user in the ``reporting``
database with the specified name, password, and roles.

.. tip::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   use reporting
   db.createUser(
     {
       user: "reportsUser",
       pwd: passwordPrompt(),  // or cleartext password
       roles: [
          { role: "read", db: "reporting" },
          { role: "read", db: "products" },
          { role: "read", db: "sales" },
          { role: "readWrite", db: "accounts" }
       ]
     }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` provides more details about
enforcing authentication for your MongoDB deployment.

Kerberos Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-kerberos.rst

For Kerberos authentication, you must add the Kerberos principal
as the username. You do not need to specify a password.

The following operation adds the Kerberos principal ``reportingapp@EXAMPLE.NET``
with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "reportingapp@EXAMPLE.NET",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
and :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-windows-with-kerberos-authentication`
provide more details about setting up Kerberos authentication for your
MongoDB deployment.

LDAP Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-ldap.rst

For LDAP authentication, you must specify a username. You do not need
to specify the password, as that is handled by the LDAP service.

The following operation adds the ``reporting`` user
with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "reporting",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-activedirectory` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-openldap` provide more detail about
using authenticating using LDAP.

To learn more about setting up LDAP authentication for {+atlas+},
see :atlas:`Add Database Users</security-add-mongodb-users/#add-database-users>` 
in the {+atlas+} documentation.

x.509 Client Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-x509.rst

For x.509 Client Certificate authentication, you must add the value of
the ``subject`` from the client certificate as a MongoDB user. Each
unique x.509 client certificate corresponds to a single MongoDB user.
You do not need to specify a password.

The following operation adds the client certificate subject
``CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry``
user with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

.. seealso::

   For more information about setting up x.509 Client Certificate
   authentication for your MongoDB deployment, see the following
   tutorials:

   - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`

   To learn more about setting up x.509 Client Certificate authentication for {+atlas+},
   see :atlas:`Add Database Users</security-add-mongodb-users/#add-database-users>` 
   in the {+atlas+} documentation.

Next Steps
----------

To manage users, assign roles, and create custom roles for your
self-hosted MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB Community deployment, 
see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles`.

You can also :atlas:`manage users, assign roles </security-add-mongodb-users>`, 
and :atlas:`create custom roles </security-add-mongodb-roles>` 
for your {+atlas+} deployment.
