Overview
--------

If you choose to stop using |mms| Automation for a group, |mms| will continue to monitor the
group's deployments but will track metrics at a less granular level and store metrics for
a shorter period. To stop using Automation, you must **unmanage** all the group's
deployments. You can do so using the :guilabel:`Unmanage All` option, as described here.

To instead unmanage individual deployments and still use Automation for the group, see
:doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.

.. _unmanage-all:

Unmanage All Deployments
------------------------

1. Click the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab, then click the :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

2. Click the ellipsis icon and select :guilabel:`Unmanage All`.
