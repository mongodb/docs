Object Document Mappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB and our partners provide several object-document mappers (ODMs) for Node.js that
let developers work with MongoDB data as objects. One popular ODM is **Mongoose**,
which helps enforce a semi-rigid schema at the application level and provides features
to assist with data modeling and manipulation. **Prisma**, another ODM, helps
ensure data consistency by offering a type-safe database client and an intuitive schema. 

For more information about using ODMs with MongoDB, see the following resources:

- :website:`MongoDB ORMs, ODMs, and Libraries </developer/products/mongodb/mongodb-orms-odms-libraries/>`
- `Mongoose <https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html>`__ official documentation
- `Prisma <https://www.prisma.io/docs>`__ official documentation
