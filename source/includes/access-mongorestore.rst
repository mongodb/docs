   To restore users and :ref:`user-defined roles <user-defined-roles>` on a
   given database, you must have access to the ``admin`` database. MongoDB
   stores the user data and role definitions for all databases in the
   ``admin`` database.

   Specifically, to restore users to a given database, you must have the
   :authaction:`insert` :ref:`action <security-user-actions>` on the ``admin``
   database's :data:`admin.system.users` collection. The :authrole:`restore`
   role provides this privilege.
