If you have strict data protection requirements, you can enable a 
{+bcp+} to protect your backup data.

Prohibited Actions
------------------

If you enable a {+bcp+}, no user, regardless of role, can do the 
following actions:

- Disable the {+bcp+} without MongoDB support. To disable a {+bcp+}, 
  the security or legal representative specified for the {+bcp+} must 
  :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an extensive 
  verification process.

  .. note::

     The only exception applies to empty projects that contain no 
     active or paused {+clusters+} and no retained snapshots from 
     previously terminated {+clusters+}. If a project is empty, users 
     with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role or the 
     :authrole:`Project Owner` role can disable the {+bcp+}.

- Modify the :ref:`backup policy <configure-backup-policy>` for an 
  individual {+cluster+} below the minimum requirements set in the 
  {+bcp+}.

- :ref:`Delete a backup snapshot <delete-snapshot>`.

- Decrease the :ref:`retention time <configure-backup-policy>` for a 
  snapshot after it's taken.

- Disable :ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+} <create-cluster-backups>`.

- Disable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>` if the 
  {+bcp+} has the 
  :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option set 
  to :guilabel:`On` without MongoDB Support. To disable 
  {+PIT-Restore+}, the security or legal representative specified for 
  the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and 
  complete an extensive verification process.

- Reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window <create-pit-policy>` 
  without MongoDB Support. To reduce the {+PIT-Restore+} 
  :guilabel:`Restore Window`, the security or legal representative 
  specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
  <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification process.

- Delete :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` specified in the 
  {+bcp+} without MongoDB Support. To delete policy items specified in 
  the {+bcp+}, the security or legal representative specified for the 
  {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an 
  extensive verification process.

- :ref:`Delete the project <delete-project>` if any snapshots exist. 
  If you can't remove all projects, you can't :ref:`delete the 
  organization <delete-organization>`.

.. _bcp-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

After you enable a {+bcp+}, the following behaviors apply:

- A {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup storage costs. You 
  can't adjust the retention or delete a backup to reduce the 
  backup storage costs. To learn more, 
  see :ref:`atlas-billing`.

- All new and existing {+clusters+} have {+Cloud-Backup+} automatically 
  enabled and use the project-level {+bcp+}. |service| augments any 
  preexisting :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policies 
  <configure-backup-policy>` to meet the minimum requirements of the 
  {+bcp+}. All new {+clusters+} use the {+bcp+} unless the mininum 
  requirements of the :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policy 
  <configure-backup-policy>` expand beyond the mininum requirements of 
  the {+bcp+}.
  
- You can modify the :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policies 
  <configure-backup-policy>` at any time. If you reduce the frequency 
  of a {+cluster+}-level backup policy, the change applies only to 
  future backups. Any existing :term:`oplog` remains for the original 
  window. The minimum requirements of the {+bcp+} apply.

- If the {+bcp+} has the 
  :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions`
  option set to :guilabel:`On` and you enable, modify, or 
  delete :ref:`multi-region snapshots <snapshot-distribution>`, any 
  snapshots already taken remain.

- When you :ref:`resume a {+cluster+} <resume-cluster>`, |service| 
  automatically enables {+Cloud-Backup+}. If the {+bcp+} has 
  the :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option 
  set to :guilabel:`On`, |service| automatically enables 
  {+PIT-Restore+} and adjusts the restore window according to the 
  {+bcp+}. |service| automatically modifies the backup to meet the 
  minimum requirements of the {+bcp+}.

- If you :ref:`terminate a {+cluster+} <terminate-cluster>`, |service| 
  maintains all existing snapshots after the termination according to 
  your backup policy. |service| retains the :term:`oplog` for 
  :ref:`restoring a point in time with {+pit-restore+} 
  <recover-pit-continuous-cloud-backup>` in a static state until 
  |service| can no longer use them for {+pit-restore+}.

- If you :ref:`terminate a {+cluster+} <terminate-cluster>`, you can't create another
  {+cluster+} with the same name because |service| uses the name to 
  identify snapshots.   

- Whenever a user enables, modifies, or disables a {+bcp+}, |service| 
  reflects the event in the :ref:`Project Activity Feed 
  <view-activity-feed>`.

Required Access
---------------

To configure a {+bcp+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. 
Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner`` 
to the project before configuring a {+bcp+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Only MongoDB Support can do the following actions:

  - Approve requests to disable a {+bcp+}.
   
  - Disable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>` if the 
    {+bcp+} has the 
    :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option 
    set to :guilabel:`On`.

  - Reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window 
    <create-pit-policy>`.

  - Delete :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` specified in 
    the {+bcp+}.
    
- Only the specified security or legal representative can 
  :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

- You can apply a {+bcp+} to ``M10+`` {+dedicated-clusters+} only.

  .. note::

     You can't convert a {+dedicated-cluster+} to an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+},
     an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+Shared-cluster+}, {+Serverless-instance+},
     or a {+Flex-cluster+}.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-compliancePolicy-enable.rst
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api
 
      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides the 
      :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint </updateDataProtectionSettings>` in the 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Cloud Backups </Cloud-Backups>` resource to update or 
      enable the Backup Compliance Policy settings for the project.
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst

         .. step:: Enable the {+bcp+}.

            .. include:: /includes/fact-you-cannot-disable-bcp.rst

            Toggle :guilabel:`Backup Compliance Policy` to :guilabel:`On`.

            The :guilabel:`Edit Backup Compliance Policy` dialog box 
            opens. 

            .. note::

               This {+bcp+} applies as the minimum backup policy to all 
               {+clusters+} in the project. The {+bcp+} protects all 
               existing snapshots. The {+bcp+} prevents any user, 
               regardless of role, from modifying or deleting existing 
               snapshots prior to their expiration. Changes made to 
               this {+bcp+} apply only to future snapshots. If you 
               enable a {+bcp+}, the {+bcp+} limits your ability to 
               reduce backup storage costs. You can't adjust the 
               retention or delete a backup to reduce the backup 
               storage costs.

         .. step:: Configure your backup policy.

            Each row in the :guilabel:`Backup Policy Frequency and Retention` 
            table represents a backup policy item.

            .. important::

               After you save the {+bcp+}, you can't delete 
               :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` 
               specified in the {+bcp+} without MongoDB Support. To delete 
               policy items specified in the {+bcp+}, the security or legal 
               representative specified for the {+bcp+} must 
               :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an 
               extensive verification process. Ensure that you have the 
               correct policy items before you save the {+bcp+}.

               a. Do one of the following steps:
      
                  - Select the frequency unit from :guilabel:`Frequency Unit` 
                    for a policy item.

                  - Click :guilabel:`Add Frequency Unit` to add a new policy 
                    item to your backup policy.

               #. Select the frequency for the frequency unit from the
                  :guilabel:`Every` column.

               #. Specify the retention time for the policy item in
                  the :guilabel:`Retention Time` column and the units for the 
                  retention time in the column to the right.

         .. step:: (Optional) Configure the restore window.

            a. Toggle 
               :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` to :guilabel:`On`.
      
            #. Specify a :guilabel:`Restore Window`.

               .. important::

                  You can't configure a restore window that is longer 
                  than the :ref:`Hourly Snapshot Retention Time 
                  <creating-backup-policy>`. After you save this 
                  {+bcp+}, you can't change this setting without 
                  MongoDB support. To change this setting, the security 
                  or legal representative specified for the {+bcp+} 
                  must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and 
                  complete an extensive verification process.

         .. step:: (Optional) Require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters.

            Toggle :guilabel:`Require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters` to :guilabel:`On`.

            .. note::

               To enable this option, you must 
               :ref:`Enable Encryption at Rest <security-kms-encryption>` for 
               all current {+clusters+}. You can't enable this option 
               on :ref:`paused {+clusters+}
               <paused-cluster-considerations>` that don't have 
               Encryption at Rest enabled.

         .. step:: (Optional) Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions.

            You can prevent {+cluster+} users from deleting backups 
            copied to other regions even if you change the 
            :guilabel:`Copy to other regions` option to 
            :guilabel:`Off`. To learn more, see 
            :ref:`snapshot-distribution`.

            Toggle :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions` to :guilabel:`On`.
     
         .. step:: Confirm and save the {+bcp+}.

            a. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

               .. include:: /includes/fact-you-cannot-disable-bcp.rst

            #. Specify the :guilabel:`First Name` and 
               :guilabel:`Last Name` of a security or legal 
               representative.

            #. Specify the :guilabel:`Email address of a representative`.

               .. important::

                  An invalid or incorrect email address prevents you 
                  from modifying or enabling this {+bcp+} until you 
                  correct it with MongoDB Support. Specify the email 
                  address that the representative uses to sign into the 
                  Support portal.

            #. If you are *sure* that you want to save the {+bcp+}, 
               specify the project name to continue.

            #. Click the checkbox to confirm that you understand that 
               when you enable a {+bcp+}, no user, regardless of role, 
               can modify or delete backup snapshots. If you enable a 
               {+bcp+}, the {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce 
               backup storage costs and you can *not* adjust the 
               retention or delete a backup to reduce backup storage 
               costs. Only MongoDB Support can disable 
               a {+bcp+}. Only the specified security or legal 
               representative can :ref:`request support 
               <request-support>` to disable a {+bcp+}.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Confirm and Save`.
