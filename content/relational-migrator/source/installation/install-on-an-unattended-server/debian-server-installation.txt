You can install {+rel-mig+} on a Debian server. This installation method 
allows {+rel-mig+} to run on an unattended server. When running on an 
unattended server, {+rel-mig+} binds to any IP and port on the server 
and exposes it as a web application.

About this Task
---------------

{+rel-mig+} uses the following file locations on Debian Linux:

.. include:: /includes/fact-file-location-linux.rst

Steps
-----

.. _install-debian-server:

Install {+rel-mig+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest ``.deb`` binary from the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Update the system package manager repositories:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt update

#. (For headless Linux distributions) Create the required directories:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir /usr/share/desktop-directories/

#. Install {+rel-mig+}.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install ./mongodb-relational-migrator_<version_number>-1_amd64.deb

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers 
   into your {+rel-mig+} directory.

   a. To download and install MySQL or Oracle drivers, see the following:

      - `MySQL: latest 8.3.x version, Platform Independent Version <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`_

      - `Oracle: 21.6.0.0 of ojdbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html>`_

   b. Copy the driver files to ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib``.

      To copy the driver, use the following example: 

      .. code-block:: bash
      
         curl https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/jdbc/216/ojdbc11.jar -O -L -b -o

   For more information, see :ref:`Install on a Local Machine <local-machine-install>`.

#. Change the directory to the {+rel-mig+} ``/bin`` location and start the application.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin

      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. Enable {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended standalone server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties. 

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration 
   properties.

   It is recommended that you configure TLS/SSL for {+rel-mig+} on your unattended
   server. You can bind {+rel-mig+} to any IP and port on the server. For additional 
   information, see `TLS/SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that {+rel-mig+} runs on.

   By default, {+rel-mig+} is configured to run on port ``8278``. To change 
   the port {+rel-mig+} runs on, update the ``server.port`` line in your
   ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port. For example, you may
   wish to use port ``80`` for HTTP or port ``443`` for HTTPS.

#. Run {+rel-mig+} using the binary.

   The ``bin`` directory path is ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin``.
   To run {+rel-mig+} using the binary, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin

      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``~/Migrator/Logs/migrator.log``.

   - When running {+rel-mig+} as a system service, the path is under 
     the service userâ€™s home directory.

.. _debian-system-service:

Run as a System Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install {+rel-mig+} on a Debian server, you can also set up 
{+rel-mig+} to run as a system service. When running {+rel-mig+} 
as a system service, {+rel-mig+} automatically starts when the server starts.

1. Create a ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 

   Copy the text below into the ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. Replace 
   the binary path as needed.

   .. code-block::

      [Unit]
      Description=MongoDB {+rel-mig+}

      [Service]
      ExecStart="/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin/MongoDB {+rel-mig+}"

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

#. Reload ``systemd`` to read the newly-created service.

   .. code-block::

      systemctl daemon-reload

#. Enable the {+rel-mig+} service to automatically start when the server starts. 

   You can manage the service with the following ``systemctl`` commands: 

   .. code-block::

      systemctl enable migrator.service

      systemctl start migrator.service 


Troubleshooting
---------------

If your installation fails with an error, use the following command to see error details:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dpkg -i ./mongodb-relational-migrator_<version_number>-1_amd64.deb
