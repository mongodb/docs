Manage Your Account
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The :guilabel:`Administration` tab lets you personalize
your console and activate or deactivate a variety of features. The
:guilabel:`Administration` tab provides the pages described here.

.. _profile-page:

Account Page
------------

The :guilabel:`Account` page allows users to update their personal
information.

The username, email address, and password are also used for `jira.mongodb.org
<http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. Changing your email address or password in |mms|
will also change the email address and password you use to log into Jira.

- :guilabel:`User Name`: Displays the user's name. You cannot change your
  username.

- :guilabel:`Email Address`: Displays the email address |mms| associates with
  your account. You can change your email address by clicking on the
  ":guilabel:`pencil`" icon.

- :guilabel:`Mobile Phone Number`: The number to use to receive SMS
  alerts, including two-factor authentication codes.

- :guilabel:`Password`: Allows you to change your |mms| password. Passwords must
  fulfill |mms|'s :ref:`password requirements <password-requirements>`.

- :guilabel:`Two-Factor Authentication`: |mms| requires two factor authentication
  for login. For details, see :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`.

  .. only:: classic or cloud

     To delete or reset two-factor authentication, `contact |mms| Support
     <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_.

  .. only:: onprem

     To delete or reset two-factor authentication, contact your |mms| system
     administrator.

.. _mms-personalization:

Personalization Page
--------------------

The :guilabel:`Personalization` page allows users to configure the console
to suit their needs and preferences. The available fields depend on the
user's :doc:`role </reference/user-roles>`.

- :guilabel:`My Time Zone`: Sets your local time zone.

- :guilabel:`My Date Format`: Allows you to select your preferred
  date format.

- :guilabel:`Page Shown When Switching Groups`: Sets which page of the |mms|
  console you will see when you select a different group. If you
  select :guilabel:`Current`, |mms| will not change pages when you select a
  different group.

- :guilabel:`Display Opcounters On Separate Charts`: Allows you to control the
  presentation of Opcounter Charts. If enabled, |mms| charts each opcounter type
  separately. Otherwise, each opcounter type is overlaid together in a single
  chart.

- :guilabel:`Display Chart Annotations`: Toggles the presence of chart
  annotations. Chart annotations overlay information about significant
  system events on the charts. For example, with chart annotations |mms|
  will draw a red vertical line over the charts.

- :guilabel:`Receive |mms| Newsletters`: Allows you to opt-in to, or opt-out of
  receiving e-mail newsletters about |mms|.

API Keys & Whitelists Page
--------------------------

:guilabel:`API Keys & Whitelists` lets you :doc:`generate an API key
</tutorial/enable-public-api>` for your |mms| group. Use the API key to support
automated installation of your Monitoring Agent with scripts included with the
agent installation files.

You can also define an :guilabel:`API Whitelist` of IP addresses permitted
to invoke operations that require a higher level of security. See
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-public-api` for more information.

My Groups Page
--------------

:guilabel:`My Groups` displays the |mms| groups you belong to. From here you
can :ref:`add a group <create-group>`.

Group Settings Page
-------------------

These settings apply to all users in the group. To set group settings, see
:ref:`manage-group-settings`.

Users Page
----------

:guilabel:`Users` displays the group's users and their :doc:`roles
</reference/user-roles>`. From here you can :doc:`add and manage users
</tutorial/manage-users>`.

Agents Page
-----------

The :guilabel:`Agent` page displays the status of your installed agent and
provides links to download new agents, in both ``.zip`` and ``.tar.gz``
formats. The software is dynamically assembled with your API key.
Instructions are included to set up and start the downloaded agent, as
well as create a new user for the agent if MongoDB authentication is used.

The :guilabel:`Agents` page includes the following information about your
installed agents:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
