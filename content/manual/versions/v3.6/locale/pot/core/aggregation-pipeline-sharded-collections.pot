msgid "For aggregation operations that must run on multiple shards, if the operations do not require running on the database's primary shard, these operations will route the results to a random shard to merge the results to avoid overloading the primary shard for that database. The :pipeline:`$out` stage and the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage require running on the database's primary shard."
