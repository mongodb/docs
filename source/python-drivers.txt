Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Python
drivers. Add one of the following drivers to your application to work with
MongoDB in Python:

- :doc:`PyMongo </pymongo>` for synchronous Python applications

  - `PyMongoArrow <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-arrow-driver/current/>`__, a
    PyMongo extension for loading MongoDB query result sets as Apache Arrow tables

- :doc:`Motor </motor>` for asynchronous Python applications

Compatibility
-------------

You can connect your application to deployments hosted in the following 
environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments.rst

To learn more about connecting your application to deployments hosted in MongoDB 
Atlas, see :atlas:`Connect from Your Application </driver-connection>`.

Tools and Projects
------------------

- The `Full Stack FastAPI App Generator <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/full-stack-fastapi-mongodb>`__
  simplifies setup of web applications that use the FastAPI, React, and MongoDB
  (FARM) stack. You can learn more about this tool on the
  :website:`MongoDB blog. </blog/post/introducing-full-stack-fast-api-app-generator-for-python-developers>` 

  .. important::

     The MongoDB Full Stack FastAPI App Generator is an experimental project
     and is not yet supported by MongoDB.
