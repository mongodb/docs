  :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique>` from management.

  |onprem| 4.2 and later differs from 4.0 in how it manages index. To
  view, create, or delete indexes after this upgrade, use :doc:`Data
  Explorer </data-explorer/>`.

  .. warning::

     Don't drop your :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique>`.
     You need only remove them from management.

  If Automation did not manage your Backup or Monitoring Agents, you
  can add any Backup or Monitoring settings you had before at the
  :guilabel:`Add Custom Configuration Options for your MongoDB Agent
  (Optional)` step.

  .. important:: Deployments using Kerberos Authentication

     Don't add either of the following settings from the legacy Agents:

     - ``krb5Principal``
     - ``krb5Keytab``

     Your legacy Agents authenticated with Kerberos as separate database
     users. Because the {+mdbagent+} combines the functions of the
     legacy Agents, it employs a *single* database user. To upgrade to 
     the {+mdbagent+} and continue using Kerberos, you must:

     1. Create a new :ref:`Kerberos User Principal
        <create-krb5-upn-for-mongodb-agent>` and :ref:`database user
        <create-mongodb-user-for-mongodb-agent>` for the
        {+mdbagent+}.
     #. Update the :ref:`Agent authentication configuration
        <enable-kerberos-mms>` in the |mms| :guilabel:`Authentication &
        TLS` settings with the new {+mdbagent+} Principal and Keytab 
        files.

     You can remove the legacy Monitoring and Backup Agent users after
     updating to the {+mdbagent+}. 

  To add options that you had for your
  :ref:`Backup Agent <mongodb-agent-backup-settings>` and
  :ref:`Monitoring Agent <mongodb-agent-monitoring-settings>`:

  a. Under the :guilabel:`Backup Configurations` section:

     i. Type the desired :ref:`setting <mongodb-agent-backup-settings>`
        in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and its corresponding value in
        the :guilabel:`Value` box.

     #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
        :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

     #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

  b. Under the :guilabel:`Monitoring Configurations` section:

     i. Type the desired :ref:`setting
        <mongodb-agent-monitoring-settings>` in the :guilabel:`Setting`
        box and the corresponding value in the
        :guilabel:`Value` box.

     #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
        :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

     #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

  c. Once you have added all the settings necessary for your deployment, click :guilabel:`Next`.


  You can click the :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` to remove any settings that
  you have added.

  .. important::

     |mms| does not validate any of these settings. Make sure that the
     settings and values are correct.
