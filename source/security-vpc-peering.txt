.. warning::

   |service| does not support Network Peering between clusters 
   deployed in a single region on different cloud providers.
   For example, you cannot set up Network Peering between 
   an |service| cluster hosted in a single region on AWS and an 
   application hosted in a single region on GCP.

Required Access
---------------

To set up a Network Peering connection, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
the project.

Configure Network Containers
----------------------------

Create a Network Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the |service| |cidr| without configuring Network Peering,
see :oas-atlas-op:`Create a New Network Peering Container </createOneNewNetworkPeeringContainer>`.
You must use the |api| to create the container without
Network Peering.

View Network Containers

Configure an |service| Network Peering Connection
-------------------------------------------------

To configure |service| Network Peering for a cluster, perform the
procedure on the tab corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.
You also configure the |service| |vpc| |cidr| during this procedure.

      Considerations
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      DNS Configuration
      `````````````````

      |dns| resolves the cluster's hostnames to their public |ipaddr|
      address rather than their internal |ipaddr| address if:

      - :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` are disabled,
      - :guilabel:`DNS resolution` is disabled, and
      - The user accesses the |service| cluster from outside a peered
        :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>`.

      To learn more about how to enable these options, see
      :aws:`Updating DNS Support for Your VPC </AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`.

      If the applications deployed within |aws| use custom |dns|
      services and :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering with |service|,
      see :ref:`the FAQ <atlas-faq-custom-dns>` to learn how to
      connect using private connection strings.

      Deployments in Multiple Regions
      ```````````````````````````````

      |service| deployments in multiple regions must have a peering
      connection for each |service| region.

      For example: If you have a |vpc| in Sydney and |service|
      deployments in Sydney and Singapore, create two peering
      connections.

      AWS VPC Peering Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/fact-aws-vpc-prereqs.rst

      Configure Network Peering for an AWS-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure |service| |vpc| Peering for an |aws|\-backed
      cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/vpc-aws.rst

      Before your new |vpc| peer can connect to your |service| cluster, 
      you must:

      - Locate the |vpc| |cidr| block addresses (or subset), or the
        Security Groups, associated with the |vpc| configured
        in your project.
      - Add at least one of these |cidr| blocks to the
        :ref:`access list <access-list>`.

      Considerations
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |vpc| peering connections |service| have the following limitations:

      - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) supports two network modes: routes-based and VPC-native. While VPC-native GKE clusters 
        can connect to |service| clusters, route-based GKE clusters can't connect to |service| clusters via peering because |service| 
        doesn't accept custom routes when |vpc| peering connections are created. Consider using Public IP allow lists for 
        route-based GKE clusters.
      - Google App Engine (Standard), Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run can't connect to |service| clusters over |vpc| 
        peering connections. To connect over |vpc| peering, these services require a serverless |vpc| Access connector.
      - Clients can't connect to Atlas clusters with |gcp| VPN (Virtual Private Network) or Interconnect because 
        |service| doesn't accept custom routes when |vpc| peering connections are created. Consider creating :ref:`private 
        endpoints <private-endpoint>`.

      Configure VPC Peering for a GCP-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure |service| |vpc| Peering for a |gcp|\-backed
      cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/vpc-gcp.rst

      You must add your |vpc| |cidr| block address (or subset)
      associated with the peer |vpc| to the
      :ref:`IP access list <access-list>` before your new |vpc| peer 
      can connect to your |service| cluster. When connecting to your 
      cluster, you must use the new :ref:`private connection strings 
      <atlas-faq-connstring-private>` to utilize the peering.

      .. seealso::

         :gcp:`Auto mode IP ranges </vpc/docs/vpc#ip-ranges>`.

      Rolling Back a |gcp| Container with a Restricted Set of Regions
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      After a |gcp| container with a restricted set of regions is generated, 
      that project is locked into that set of regions. Any attempts to use other 
      regions will generate an error message similar to what you find below:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false

         There are no more regions supported with your existing configuration. Try changing to
         a different cluster tier or changing your region configuration.

      To resolve this error, follow this general process:

      1. :ref:`Remove all clusters from the Google Cloud container <terminate-cluster>`.

      #. Delete the |gcp| container using the {+atlas-admin-api+}. See :oas-atlas-op:`Remove One 
         Network Peering Container </deletePeeringContainer>`.

      #. Create a new |gcp| container without restricted regions with an Atlas CIDR block of 
         at least ``/18`` using the {+atlas-admin-api+}. See :oas-atlas-op:`Create a New Network 
         Peering Container </createPeeringContainer>`.

      :tabid: azure

      .. note::

         Effective March 31, 2020, |service| has removed the
         **Peering-Only Mode** limitations for all existing and new
         Azure clusters. To learn how to use these new features, see
         the :ref:`FAQ on changes to Azure network peering 
         <atlas-faq-azure-gcp-peering-only>`

      Azure Roles Required to Configure a Network Peering Connection
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To learn the |azure| roles that you need to create a Network
      Peering connection, see the :azure:`Azure documentation
      </virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-peering#permissions>`.

      Configure Network Peering for an Azure-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure Network Peering for an |azure|-backed cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/network-peering-azure.rst

      You must add the |cidr| block address (or subset)
      associated with the peer VNet to the
      :ref:`whitelist <access-list>` before your network peer
      can connect to your |service| cluster. When connecting to your 
      cluster, you must use the new :ref:`private connection string 
      <atlas-faq-connstring-private>` to utilize the peering.
