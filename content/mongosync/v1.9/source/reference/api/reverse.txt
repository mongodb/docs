Description
-----------

Reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

For example:

- You have a ``COMMITTED`` sync operation.

- ``cluster0`` is the source and ``cluster1`` is the destination.

- After the sync operation is ``COMMITTED``, new writes occur only on
  the destination cluster. The source cluster will not accept new
  writes.

In this scenario, you can use the ``reverse`` endpoint to sync
writes from ``cluster1`` to ``cluster0``, including any writes
that occurred on ``cluster1`` after ``mongosync`` reached
``canWrite=true``.  To check the ``canWrite`` status during
sync, use the :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint.

For more information and a tutorial on using the ``reverse`` endpoint,
see :ref:`c2c-reverse-process`. 

Requirements
------------

To use the ``reverse`` endpoint:

- ``mongosync`` must be configured when the initial sync begins. The
  call to the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` API endpoint must set:
  
  - ``reversible`` to ``true``
  - ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``.

.. note::

   :ref:`c2c-write-blocking` is a prerequisite for running ``reverse``.

You cannot update these options after the sync starts. 

- ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.
- The destination cluster oplog must not roll over between 
  ``mongosync`` reaching ``canWrite=true`` and receiving
  the ``/reverse`` request.

.. warning::

   :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>` on the source cluster must not use
   the legacy format.

   To validate that collection indexes on the source cluster use the proper
   formatting, see :ref:`c2c-validate-unique-index`.

Validate Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to reverse direction, ``mongosync`` requires that all :ref:`unique
<index-type-unique>` indexes on the source cluster (except for ``_id``) do not
have legacy unique index keys.

Before you Begin
````````````````

You can ensure that non-``_id`` unique indexes use the correct formatting on the
source cluster with the :pipeline:`$collStats` aggregation stage. To run this
aggregation pipeline on your collection, copy and paste the example code,
replacing ``<collection>`` with the collection name and ``<field_name>`` with
the name of the indexed field. You must run this on all nodes, for all
collections that have unique indexes. Note that only the non-``_id`` unique
indexes need to have formatVersion ``13`` or ``14``.

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: javascript 

       db.<collection>.aggregate( [ 
         { $collStats: { storageStats: { } } },
         { $project: { "storageStats.indexDetails.<field_name>.metadata.formatVersion": 1 } }
       ] )

   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript

      [
        {
          storageStats: {
            indexDetails: { <field_name>: { metadata: { formatVersion: 14 } } }
          }
        }
      ]

Unique indexes with formatVersion ``13`` or ``14`` are guaranteed to not 
have legacy keys.

If you have unique indexes of a different formatVersion, you can also 
use the :method:`db.collection.validate` method with ``full = false`` to 
confirm if there are legacy index keys. You must run this on all nodes 
for all collections with unique indexes. ``validate()`` returns a 
warning if legacy format index keys are detected.

Steps
`````

To update the format version of the indexes for compatibility with 
``mongosync``, you must :ref:`resync <resync-replica-member>` all nodes
in the original source cluster. To resync all nodes: 


.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Resync all secondaries, one by one. 

      For a tutorial on resyncing nodes, see :ref:`Resync a Member of a
      Replica Set <resync-replica-member>`. 

   .. step:: Step down the primary node and step up one of the secondary nodes.
   
   .. step:: Resync the old primary node from the new primary node.

Example

The following example reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Behavior
--------

The ``reverse`` endpoint starts the ``REVERSING`` state. ``mongosync`` swaps the 
source and destination clusters and resumes applying change events.

If the ``reverse`` sync is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``RUNNING`` state. The synchronization continues in the reverse
direction from the original sync job. You do not need to restart the
entire sync process to copy the original data.

To view the mapping direction for the synchronization of the source and
destination clusters, use the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>`
endpoint and check the ``directionMapping`` object.

Embedded Verifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The embedded verifier is enabled by default for replica set
migrations and performs verification checks for the forward
direction of reversible sync. When you call the ``/reverse``
endpoint, ``mongosync`` disables the verifier. The verifier
remains disabled, even after additional calls to the
``/reverse`` endpoint.

Endpoint Protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |endpoint| replace:: ``reverse``
.. include:: /includes/fact-api-endpoint

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``reverse`` endpoint does not support :ref:`filtered sync
<c2c-filtered-sync>`.
