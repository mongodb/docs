Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients, including other
members of the replica set, cannot connect to an instance bound only to
localhost. To override and bind to other ip addresses, use the
:setting:`net.bindIp` configuration file setting or the ``--bind_ip``
command-line option to specify a list of ip addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
:setting:`net.bindIp` setting (or ``--bind_ip``) if your replica set
members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote clients to
connect to your replica set.

.. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

For more information, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`

Initial Syncs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the upgrade, ensure that no initial sync is in
progress. Performing the upgrade while an initial sync is in
progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

Read Concern Majority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB enables support for :v3.6:`"majority"
</reference/read-concern-majority>` read concern by default.

For MongoDB 3.6.1 - 3.6.x, you can disable read concern
:v3.6:`"majority" </reference/read-concern-majority>` to prevent the
storage cache pressure from immobilizing a deployment with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture. Disabling
:v3.6:`"majority" </reference/read-concern-majority>` read concern also
disables support for :v3.6:`change streams </changeStreams>`

For more information, see :v3.6:`Disable Read Concern Majority
</reference/read-concern-majority/#disable-read-concern-majority>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Version |oldversion|
    All replica set members must be running version |oldversion|. To
    upgrade a replica set from an |olderseries| and earlier, *first*
    :doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
    3.4-series release </release-notes/3.4-upgrade-replica-set>`, and
    then follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to
    |newversion|.

- Feature Compatibility Version
     The |oldversion| replica set must have
     ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``.

     To ensure that all members of the replica set have
     ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``, connect to each
     replica set member and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

     All members should return a result that includes
     ``"featureCompatibilityVersion": "3.4"``.

     To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
     following command on the primary. A majority of the data-bearing
     members must be available:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

     For more information, see
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

- Replica Set Member State
    Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
    :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a
"rolling" upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available:
