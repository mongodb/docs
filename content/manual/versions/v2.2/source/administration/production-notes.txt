Overview
--------

This page details system configurations that affect MongoDB,
especially in production.

Backups
-------

To make backups of your MongoDB database, please refer to
:doc:`/administration/backups`.

Networking
----------

Always run MongoDB in a *trusted environment*, with network rules that
prevent access from *all* unknown machines, systems, or networks. As
with any sensitive system dependent on network access, your MongoDB
deployment should only be accessible to specific systems that require
access: application servers, monitoring services, and other MongoDB
components.

See documents in the :doc:`/security` section for additional
information, specifically:

- :ref:`security-port-numbers`
- :ref:`security-firewalls`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`

For Windows users, consider the `Windows Server Technet Article on TCP
Configuration <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349797.aspx>`_
when deploying MongoDB on Windows.

MongoDB on Linux
----------------

If you use the Linux kernel, the MongoDB user community has
recommended Linux kernel 2.6.36 or later for running MongoDB in
production.

Because MongoDB preallocates its database files before using them and
because MongoDB uses very large files on average, you should
use the Ext4 and XFS file systems if using the Linux kernel:

- If you use the Ext4 file system, use at least version 2.6.23 of the
  Linux Kernel.

- If you use the XFS file system, use at least version 2.6.25 of the
  Linux Kernel.

For MongoDB on Linux use the following recommended configurations:

- Turn off ``atime`` for the storage volume with the :term:`database
  files <dbpath>`.

- Set the file descriptor limit and the user process limit above 20,000,
  according to the suggestions in :doc:`/administration/ulimit`. A low
  ulimit will affect MongoDB when under heavy use and will produce
  weird errors.

- Do not use ``hugepages`` virtual memory pages, MongoDB performs
  better with normal virtual memory pages.

- Disable NUMA in your BIOS. If that is not possible see :ref:`NUMA
  <production-numa>`.

- Ensure that readahead settings for the block devices that store the
  database files are acceptable. See the :ref:`Readahead
  <production-readahead>` section

- Use NTP to synchronize time among your hosts. This is especially
  important in sharded clusters.

.. _production-readahead:

Readahead
---------

For random access use patterns set readahead values low, for example
setting readahead to a small value such as 32 (16KB) often works well.

.. _production-virtualization:

MongoDB on Virtual Environments
-------------------------------

The section describes considerations when running MongoDB in some of the
more common virtual environments.

EC2
~~~

MongoDB is compatible with EC2 and requires no configuration changes
specific to the environment.

VMWare
~~~~~~

MongoDB is compatible with VMWare. Some in the MongoDB community have
run into issues with VMWare's memory overcommit feature and suggest
disabling the feature.

You can clone a virtual machine running MongoDB. You might use this to
spin up a new virtual host that will be added as a member of a replica
set. If journaling is enabled, the clone snapshot will be consistent. If
not using journaling, stop :binary:`~bin.mongod`, clone, and then restart.

OpenVZ
~~~~~~

The MongoDB community has encountered issues running MongoDB on OpenVZ.

Disk and Storage Systems
------------------------

Swap
~~~~

Configure swap space for your systems. Having swap can prevent issues
with memory contention and can prevent the OOM Killer on Linux systems
from killing :binary:`~bin.mongod`. Because of the way :binary:`~bin.mongod`
maps memory files to memory, the operating system will never store
MongoDB data in swap.

RAID
~~~~

Most MongoDB deployments should use disks backed by RAID-10.

RAID-5 and RAID-6 do not typically provide sufficient performance to
support a MongoDB deployment.

RAID-0 provides good write performance but provides limited
availability, and reduced performance on read operations, particularly
using Amazon's EBS volumes: as a result, avoid RAID-0 with MongoDB
deployments.

.. _production-nfs:

Remote Filesystems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some versions of NFS perform very poorly with MongoDB and NFS is not
recommended for use with MongoDB. Performance problems arise when both
the data files and the journal files are both hosted on NFS: you may
experience better performance if you place the journal on local or
``iscsi`` volumes. If you must use NFS, add the following NFS options
to your ``/etc/fstab`` file: ``bg``, ``nolock``, and ``noatime``.

Many MongoDB deployments work successfully with Amazon's *Elastic
Block Store* (EBS) volumes. There are certain intrinsic performance
characteristics, with EBS volumes that users should consider.

Hardware Requirements and Limitations
-------------------------------------

MongoDB is designed specifically with commodity hardware in mind and
has few hardware requirements or limitations. MongoDB core components
runs on little-endian hardware primarily x86/x86_64 processors. Client
libraries (i.e. drivers) can run on big or little endian systems.

When installing hardware for MongoDB, consider the following:

- As with all software, more RAM and a faster CPU clock speed are
  important to productivity.

- Because databases do not perform high amounts of computation,
  increasing the number cores helps but does not provide a high level of
  marginal return.

- MongoDB has good results and good price/performance with SATA SSD
  (Solid State Disk) and with PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect).

- Commodity (SATA) spinning drives are often a good option as the
  speed increase for random I/O for more expensive drives is not that
  dramatic (only on the order of 2x), spending that money on SSDs or
  RAM may be more effective.

.. _production-numa:

MongoDB on NUMA Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: The discussion of NUMA in this section does not apply
   to deployments where :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances run on Windows.

MongoDB and NUMA, Non-Uniform Access Memory, do not work well
together. When running MongoDB on NUMA hardware, disable NUMA for
MongoDB and run with an interleave memory policy. NUMA can cause a
number of operational problems with MongoDB, including slow
performance for periods of time or high system processor usage.

.. note::

   On Linux, MongoDB version 2.0 and greater checks these
   settings on start up and prints a warning if the system is
   NUMA-based.

To disable NUMA for MongoDB, use the ``numactl`` command and start
:binary:`~bin.mongod` in the following manner:

.. code-block:: sh

   numactl --interleave=all /usr/bin/local/mongod

Adjust the ``proc`` settings using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode

To fully disable NUMA you must perform both operations. However, you can
change ``zone_reclaim_mode`` without restarting mongod. For more
information, see documentation on `Proc/sys/vm
<http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt>`_.

See the `The MySQL "swap insanity" problem and the effects of NUMA
<http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/>`_
post, which describes the effects of NUMA on databases. This blog post
addresses the impact of NUMA for MySQL; however, the issues for
MongoDB are similar. The post introduces NUMA its goals, and
illustrates how these goals are not compatible with production
databases.

Performance Monitoring
----------------------

iostat
~~~~~~

On Linux, use the iostat command to check if disk I/O is a bottleneck
for your database. Specify a number of seconds when running iostat to
avoid displaying stats covering the time since server boot.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   iostat -xmt 1

Use the mount command to see what device your :setting:`data directory
<dbpath>` resides on.

Key fields from ``iostat``:

- ``%util``: this is the most useful field for a quick check, it
  indicates what percent of the time the device/drive is in use.

- ``avgrq-sz``: average request size. Smaller number for this value
  reflect more random IO operations.

bwm-ng
~~~~~~

`bwm-ng <http://www.gropp.org/?id=projects&sub=bwm-ng>`_ is a
command-line tool for monitoring network use. If you suspect a
network-based bottleneck, you may use ``bwm-ng`` to begin your
diagnostic process.

.. _gotchas:

Production Checklist
--------------------

64-bit Builds for Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always use 64-bit Builds for Production. MongoDB uses memory mapped
files. See the :ref:`32-bit limitations <faq-32-bit-limitations>` for
more information.

32-bit builds exist to support use on development machines and also for
other miscellaneous things such as replica set arbiters.

BSON Document Size Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit -- at the time of this writing
16MB per document. If you have large objects, use :doc:`GridFS
</applications/gridfs/>` instead.

Set Appropriate Write Concern for Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`write concern <write-concern>` for more information.

Dynamic Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data in MongoDB has a *dynamic schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This
facilitates iterative development and polymorphism. However,
collections often hold documents with highly homogeneous
structures. See :doc:`/core/data-modeling` for more information.

Some operational considerations include:

- the exact set of collections to be used

- the indexes to be used, which are created explicitly except for the
  ``_id`` index

- shard key declarations, which are explicit and quite important as it
  is hard to change shard keys later

One very simple rule-of-thumb is not to import data from a
relational database unmodified: you will generally want to "roll up"
certain data into richer documents that use some embedding of nested
documents and arrays (and/or arrays of subdocuments).

Updates by Default Affect Only **one** Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the ``multi`` parameter to ``true`` to :method:`update
<db.collection.update()>` multiple documents that meet the query
criteria. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell syntax is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.my_collection_name.update(my_query, my_update_expression, bool_upsert, bool_multi)

Set ``bool_multi`` to ``true`` when updating many documents. Otherwise
only the first matched will update.

Case Sensitive Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB strings are case sensitive. So a search for ``"joe"`` will not
find ``"Joe"``.

Consider:

- storing data in a normalized case format, or

- using regular expressions ending with ``/i``

- and/or using :doc:`$toLower </reference/operator/aggregation/toLower/>` or
  :doc:`$toUpper </reference/operator/aggregation/toUpper/>` in the
  :doc:`aggregation framework </applications/aggregation/>`

Type Sensitive Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB data -- which is JSON-style, specifically, :meta-driver:`BSON
</legacy/bson/>` format -- have several data types.

Consider the following document which has a field ``x`` with the
*string* value ``"123"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x : "123" }

Then the following query which looks for a *number* value ``123`` will
**not** return that document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.mycollection.find( { x : 123 } )

Locking
~~~~~~~

Older versions of MongoDB used a "global lock"; use MongoDB v2.2+ for
better results. See the :doc:`Concurrency </faq/concurrency/>` page for
more information.

Packages
~~~~~~~~

Be sure you have the latest stable release if you are using a package
manager. You can see what is current on the Downloads page, even if you
then choose to install via a package manager.

Use Odd Number of Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Replica sets </replication/>` perform consensus elections. Use
either an odd number of members (e.g., three) or else use an arbiter to
get up to an odd number of votes.

Don't disable journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`Journaling </administration/journaling/>` for more information.

Keep Replica Set Members Up-to-Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is important as MongoDB replica sets support automatic failover.
Thus you want your secondaries to be up-to-date. You have a few options
here:

1. Monitoring and alerts for any lagging can be done via various means.
   MMS shows a graph of replica set lag

#. Using :ref:`getLastError <replica-set-write-concern>` with
   ``w:'majority'``, you will get a timeout or no return if a majority of
   the set is lagging. This is thus another way to guard against lag and
   get some reporting back of its occurrence.

#. Or, if you want to fail over manually, you can set your secondaries
   to ``priority:0`` in their configuration. Then manual action would be
   required for a failover. This is practical for a small cluster; for a
   large cluster you will want automation.

Additionally, see information on :ref:`replica set rollbacks
<replica-set-rollback>`.

Additional Deployment Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pick your shard keys carefully! There is no way to modify a shard
  key on a collection that is already sharded.

- You cannot shard an existing collection over 256 gigabytes. To shard
  large amounts of data, create a new empty sharded collection, and
  ingest the data from the source collection using an application
  level import operation.

- Unique indexes are not enforced across shards except for the shard
  key itself. See :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-unique-keys-for-sharded-collections`.

- Consider :doc:`pre-splitting </administration/sharded-clusters>` a
  sharded collection before a massive bulk import. Usually this isn't
  necessary but on a bulk import of size it is helpful.

- Use :doc:`security/auth </administration/security/>` mode if you
  need it. By default :setting:`auth` is not enabled and
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` assumes a trusted environment.

- You do not have :doc:`fully generalized transactions
  </tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations/>`. Create rich documents
  and read the preceding link and consider the use case -- often there
  is a good fit.

- Disable NUMA for best results. If you have NUMA enabled,
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` will print a warning when it starts.

- Avoid excessive prefetch/readahead on the filesystem. Check your
  prefetch settings. Note on linux the parameter is in *sectors*, not
  bytes. 32KBytes (a setting of 64 sectors) is pretty reasonable.

- Check :doc:`ulimit </administration/ulimit/>` settings.

- Use SSD if available and economical. Spinning disks can work well
  but SSDs' capacity for random I/O operations work well with the update
  model of :binary:`~bin.mongod`. See :ref:`production-nfs` for more info.

- Ensure that clients keep reasonable pool sizes to avoid overloading
  the connection tracking capacity of a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
