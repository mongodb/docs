.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-federation.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Federated Database Instance`.

      If you have an existing {+fdi+}, instead click 
      :guilabel:`Create Federated Database` in the 
      top right corner of the dashboard. 

   .. step:: Connect to a Data Source and add sample data to your {+fdi+}.

      You can use a sample dataset to start exploring 
      {+asql+} through {+adf+} without configuring a data source 
      yourself. This tutorial references a specific sample dataset.

      .. note::

         To connect to your own data instead, click 
         :guilabel:`Add Data Sources`. To learn more about 
         configuring different types of data sources, see 
         :ref:`config-adf`.

         If you want to configure data from a |service| cluster, you 
         must use MongoDB version 5.0 or greater for that cluster to 
         take advantage of {+asql+}.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Add Sample Data`.
      
      #. Select ``AWS S3`` from the :guilabel:`Filter` dropdown if it 
         isn't selected already.
      
      #. Expand the |s3| store ``sample-data-atlas-data-lake`` 
         if it isn't expanded already.

      For this tutorial, configure your {+fdi+} as follows using the 
      :guilabel:`Federated Database Instance` panel:
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Rename the default collection.

            Click :icon-fa4:`pencil` next to the default collection 
            ``VirtualCollection0`` to edit its name. For this tutorial, 
            rename your collection ``Sessions``.

         .. step:: Create a second collection.

            Click :icon-fa4:`plus-square` next to the default name 
            ``VirtualDatabase0`` to add a collection to the database. 
            For this tutorial, name your new collection ``Users``.

         .. step:: Add data to your virtual database.

            Drag and drop the following data sources into the 
            respective {+fdi+} virtual collections:

            - ``/mflix/sessions.json``, into the ``Sessions`` 
              collection, and
            - ``/mflix/users.json`` into the ``Users`` collection.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      Your {+fdi+} appears on the :guilabel:`Data Federation` page.
