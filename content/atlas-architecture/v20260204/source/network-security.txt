{+service+} provides secure network configuration defaults for your
database deployments, such as:

- Mandatory |tls-ssl| connection encryption
- {+vpc+}\s for all projects with one-or-more {+Dedicated-clusters+}
- Authentication that uses {+ip-access-list+}s and only accepts database connections
  from sources you explicitly declare

You can further configure these protections to meet your unique security
needs and preferences.

Use the recommendations on this page to plan for the network security
configuration of your {+clusters+}.

Features for {+service+} Network Security
-----------------------------------------

{+service+} enforces |tls-ssl| encryption for all connections to your
databases.

We recommend using M10+ dedicated {+clusters+}, because all {+service+} projects with 
one or more M10+ dedicated {+clusters+} receive their own dedicated: 

- |vpc| on {+aws+} or {+gcp+}. 
- |vnet| on |azure|.

{+service+} deploys all dedicated clusters inside this |vpc| or |vnet|.

By default, all access to your {+clusters+} is blocked. You must explicitly allow 
an inbound connection by one of the following methods:

- Add private endpoints, which {+service+} adds automatically to your {+ip-access-list+}. 
  No other access is automatically added.
- Use |vpc| or |vnet| peering to add private IP addresses.
- Add public IP addresses to your {+ip-access-list+}.

You can also use multiple methods together for added security.

.. _arch-center-tls:

|tls|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} enforces mandatory |tls| encryption of connections to your
databases. |tls| 1.2 is the default protocol. To learn more, see the
:guilabel:`Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version` section of
:ref:`Configure Additional Settings
<create-cluster-additional-settings>`.

.. _arch-center-ip-access-list:

{+ip-access-list+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an |service| administrator, you can:

Configure {+ip-access-list+}s to limit which IP addresses can
attempt authentication to your database.

Allow access only from the IP addresses
and |cidr| block IP ranges that you add to your {+ip-access-list+}.
We recommend that you permit access to the smallest network segments
possible, such as an individual ``/32`` address.

Deny application servers and other clients access to your {+service+}
{+clusters+} if their IP addresses aren't included in your {+ip-access-list+}.

Configure :atlas:`temporary access list entries
</security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries>`
that expire automatically after a user-defined period.

Firewall Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting from your client application servers to {+service+} and passing 
through a firewall that blocks outbound network connections, you must also configure 
your firewall to allow your applications to make outbound connections to |tcp| traffic 
on {+service+} hosts. This grants your applications access to your {+clusters+}.

{+service+} {+cluster+} public IPs remain the same in the majority of
cases of {+cluster+} changes such as :ref:`vertical scaling
<sizing-auto-scaling>`,
:atlas:`topology </reference/glossary/#std-term-topology>` changes, or
:ref:`maintenance events <configure-maintenance-window>`. However,
certain topology changes, such as a :ref:`conversion from replica set
to sharded cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`, the
:ref:`addition of shards <scale-cluster-shardNum>`, or a :ref:`region
change <scale-cluster-region>` require that you use new IP addresses. 

In the case of converting from a replica set to a sharded cluster, the 
failure to reconnect the application clients might cause your application 
to suffer from data outages. If you use a |dns| seed list 
connection string, your application automatically connects to the |mongos| 
for your sharded cluster. If you use a standard connection string, 
you must update your connection string to reflect your new cluster topology.

In the case of adding new shards, the failure to reconnect the application 
clients may cause your application to suffer from a data outage.

.. _arch-center-private-endpoints:

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A private endpoint facilitates a one-way connection from a |vpc|, that you manage 
directly, to your {+service+} |vpc|, without permitting {+service+} to initiate a
reciprocal connection. This allows you to make use of secure connections
to {+service+} without extending your network trust boundary. The following
private endpoints are available:

- {+aws+} :aws:`PrivateLink </vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-overview.html>`,
  for connections from {+aws+} |vpc|\s
- {+azure+} :azure:`Private Link </private-link/private-link-overview>`,
  for connections from {+azure+} {+vnet+}s
- :gcp:`Private Service Connect </vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`,
  for connections from {+gcp+} |vpc|\s

.. figure:: /includes/images/private-link.svg
   :alt: "An image representing how MongoDB Atlas private endpoints work."
   :figwidth: 750px

.. _arch-center-vpc-vnet-peering:

VPC/{+vnet+} Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network peering allows you to connect your own |vpc|\s with |a-service|
|vpc| to route traffic privately and isolate your data flow from the
public internet. {+service+} maps |vpc|\s one-to-one to {+service+} projects.

Most operations performed over a |vpc| connection originate from your
application environment, minimizing the need for {+service+} to make
outbound access requests to peer |vpc|\s. However, if you configure {+service+}
to use |ldap| authentication, you must enable {+service+} to
connect outbound to the authentication endpoint of your peer |vpc| over the |ldap|
protocol. Note that |ldap| authentication is deprecated on {+service+} with 8.0. 
We recommend that you use `Workforce Identity Federation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/oidc/workforce/>`__ 
and `Workload Identity Federation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/oidc/workload/>`__ instead.




You can choose your {+service+} |cidr| block with the |vpc| peering wizard
before you deploy your first {+cluster+}. The {+service+} |vpc| |cidr|
block must not overlap with the |cidr| block of any |vpc| you intend to
peer to. {+service+} limits the number of MongoDB instances per |vpc|
based on the |cidr| block. For example, a project with a |cidr| block of
``/24`` is limited to the equivalent of 27 3-node replica sets.

Recommendations for {+service+} Network Security
------------------------------------------------

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Single-Region Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments in a single region
   :expanded: true

   Single-region deployments have no unique considerations for {+service+} network security.

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments across multiple regions or multiple cloud providers
   :expanded: true

   Multi-region deployments secured with private endpoints have the following unique considerations: 

   - For global private endpoints, {+service+} automatically generates a |srv| record 
     that points to all {+service+} cluster nodes. The MongoDB driver attempts to 
     connect to each |srv| record from your application. This allows the driver to 
     handle a failover event without waiting for |dns| replication and without 
     requiring you to update the driver's connection string.
   - In order to facilitate automatic |srv| record generation for all nodes in your 
     {+service+} cluster, you must establish a |vpc| peering connection between 
     your application |vpc|\s, and you must connect your application |vpc|\s to your 
     MongoDB |vpc| using PrivateLink or equivalent.
   - You must enable private endpoints in every region that you have an {+service+} 
     cluster deployed.
   - {+gcp+} Private Service Connect is region-specific. However, you can configure 
     :gcp:`global access </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
     to access private endpoints from a different region.

     To learn more, see :ref:`Multi-Region Support <private-endpoint-ha>`.

All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following recommendations apply to all :ref:`deployment paradigms
<arch-center-paradigms>`.

Private Endpoints
`````````````````

We recommend that you set up private endpoints for all new staging and production 
projects to limit the extension of your network trust boundary.

In general, we recommend using private endpoints for every {+service+} project, 
because this approach provides the most granular security and eases the 
administrative burden that can come from managing {+ip-access-list+}\s and large 
blocks of IP addresses as your cloud network scales. There is a cost associated 
with each endpoint. So, you may not need private endpoints in 
lower environments, but you should leverage them in higher environments to limit 
the extension of your network trust boundary.

If VPCs or VNets in which your application is deployed can't be peered with one 
another, potentially due to a combination of on-premises and cloud deployments, 
you might want to consider a regional private endpoint. 

With regional private endpoints, you can do the following:

- Connect a single private endpoint to multiple VNets or VPCs without peering 
  them directly to each other.

- Mitigate partial region failures in which one or more services within a region fails.

To network with regional endpoints, you must do the following:

- Perform regular and robust health checks to help validate successful connectivity 
  and operations between cluster and application. You can either ping your cluster 
  with the ``db.runCommand("ping")`` command to confirm connectivity quickly, or 
  you can run ``rs.conf()`` to get detailed information about each node in your cluster. 
  
- Use a distinct connection string for each region.
  
- Use cross-region routing to {+service+} to maintain availability in case of an 
  {+service+} |vpc| disconnection.

To learn more about private endpoints
in {+service+}, including limitations and considerations, see :atlas:`Learn About Private Endpoints in {+service+} </security-private-endpoint/>`. To learn how to set up private
endpoints for your {+clusters+}, see
:atlas:`Set Up a Private Endpoint for a Dedicated Cluster </security-cluster-private-endpoint/>`.

Cloud Provider-Specific Guidance
`````````````````````````````````
- |aws|: We recommend |vpc| peering across all of your self-managed VPCs that 
  need to connect to {+service+}. Leverage global private endpoints.

- |azure|: We recommend VNet peering across all of your self-managed VNets that 
  need to connect to {+service+}. Leverage global private endpoints.

- |gcp|: Peering is not required across your self-managed VPCs when using 
  GlobalConnect. All {+service+} regions must be networked with private endpoints 
  to your self-managed VPC in each region. 

|gcp| Private Endpoints Considerations and Limitations
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Atlas services are accessed through GCP Private Service Connect endpoints on 
ports starting from 1024. The ports can change under specific circumstances, 
including (but not limited to) cluster changes.

- {+gcp-psc+} must be active in all regions into which you 
  deploy a multi-region cluster. You will receive an error 
  if {+gcp-psc+} is active in some, but not all, targeted 
  regions.

- In order to maintain a manageable number of internally stored connection 
  strings that allow a driver to connect to all nodes in a multi-region cluster, 
  which is required in order to assure the driver is connected to a dynamically 
  assigned primary node within the cluster and can thus perform all operations 
  against the database, you can do only one of the following:

  - Deploy nodes in more than one region, and have one
    private endpoint per region.
  - Have multiple private endpoints in one region, and no
    other private endpoints. 

    .. important::

       This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
       example, if you create more than one private endpoint
       in a single region in |gcp|, you can't create
       private endpoints in |aws| or any other |gcp|
       region.

  To learn more, see :ref:`Why are regionalized endpoints only available for sharded clusters? <atlas_regionalized-pl>`.

  In sharded clusters, inter-node traffic is routed through mongos processes, 
  which are connected to all nodes within the cluster by default. As such, you 
  can create any number of private endpoints in a given region. See 
  :ref:`(Optional) Regionalized Private Endpoints for Multi-Region Sharded Clusters <atlas_regionalized-pl>` 
  to learn more.

- You can have up to 40 nodes when you deploy |service| projects 
  that use {+gcp-psc+} across **multiple regions**. This total 
  excludes the following instances:

  - |gcp| regions communicating with each other
  - {+Free-clusters+} or {+Shared-clusters+}

- Addressable targets include:

  - Each |mongod| instance in a replica set deployment 
    (sharded clusters excluded).
  - Each |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment.
  - Each |bic| instance across all dedicated clusters in the
    project.

- |gcp| {+google-psc+} supports up to 1024 outgoing 
  connections per virtual machine. As a result, you can't 
  have more than 1024 connections from a single |gcp| 
  virtual machine to an |service| cluster.

  To learn more, see the |gcp|
  :gcp:`cloud NAT documentation 
  </nat/docs/ports-and-addresses>`.

- |gcp| {+google-psc+} is region-specific. However, you
  can configure :gcp:`global access 
  </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
  to access private endpoints from a different region.
  
  To learn more, see :ref:`Multi-Region Support <private-endpoint-ha>`.

IP Access Lists
```````````````

We recommend that you configure an {+ip-access-list+} for your API keys and programmatic 
access to allow access only from trusted IP addresses such as your CI/CD pipeline 
or orchestration system. These {+ip-access-list+}\s are set on the {+service+} 
control plane upon provisioning a service account and are separate from {+ip-access-list+}\s
which can be set on the {+service+} project data plane for connections to the {+clusters+}. 

When you configure your {+ip-access-list+}, we recommend that you:

- Use temporary access list entries in situations where team members
  require access to your environment from temporary work locations or during 
  break-glass scenarios where production access to humans is required to resolve 
  a production-down scenario. We recommend that you build an automation script to 
  quickly add temporary access to prepare for these incidents.
- Define {+ip-access-list+} entries covering the smallest network segments
  possible. To do this, favor individual IP addresses where possible,
  and avoid large |cidr| blocks.

VPC/{+vnet+} Peering
````````````````````

If you configure |vpc| or {+vnet+} peering, we recommend that you:

- To maintain tight network trust boundaries, configure security groups
  and :aws:`network ACLs </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html>`
  to prevent inbound access to systems inside your application |vpc|\s
  from the {+service+}-side |vpc|.
  
- Create new |vpc|\s to act as intermediaries between sensitive
  application infrastructure and your {+service+} |vpc|\s. |vpc|\s are
  intransitive, allowing you to only expose those components of your
  application that need access to {+service+}.

Automation Examples: {+service+} Network Security
-------------------------------------------------

The following examples configure connections between your application
environment and your {+service+} {+clusters+} using {+ip-access-list+}s,

      Create an {+ip-access-list+} Entry
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following command for each connection you want to
      allow. Change the entries to use the appropriate options and
      your actual values:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: true

         atlas accessList create 192.0.2.15 --type ipAddress --projectId 5e2211c17a3e5a48f5497de3 --comment "IP address for app server 2" --output json

      Create a VPC Peering Connection
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following code for each |vpc| you want to peer to your
      {+service+} |vpc|. Replace ``aws`` with ``azure`` or ``gcp`` as
      appropriate, and change the options and values to the
      appropriate ones for your |vpc| or {+vnet+}:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: true

	 atlas networking peering create aws --accountId 854333054055 --atlasCidrBlock 192.168.0.0/24 --region us-east-1 --routeTableCidrBlock 10.0.0.0/24 --vpcId vpc-078ac381aa90e1e63

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform

      .. note::

         Before you can create resources with Terraform, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization. Store your API key as environment
           variables by running the following command in the terminal:

           .. code-block::

              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      Create an {+ip-access-list+} Entry
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To add an entry to your {+ip-access-list+}, create the following
      file and place it in the directory of the project you want to
      grant access to. Change the IDs and names to use your values:

      accessEntryForAddress1.tf
      `````````````````````````````
