Overview
++++++++

|mms| roles allow you to grant users different levels of access to |mms|. You
can grant a user the privileges needed to perform a specific set of tasks
and no more.

.. only:: onprem

   If you use LDAP authentication for |mms|, you must create LDAP groups for each
   available role described below then assign users to LDAP groups. There is no
   round trip synchronization between your LDAP server and |mms|.

To assign user roles, see :ref:`assign-roles-to-users`. You cannot
assign your own roles.
