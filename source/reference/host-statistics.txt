Chart Annotations
-----------------

Annotations may appear as colored vertical lines on your charts to
indicate server events. The following color/event combinations
are:

- A *red bar* indicates a server restart.

- A *purple bar* indicates the server is now a primary.

- A *yellow bar* indicates the server is now a secondary.

If you do not wish to see the chart annotations, you can disable them
on the :guilabel:`Administration` tab's :guilabel:`Personalization` page.
