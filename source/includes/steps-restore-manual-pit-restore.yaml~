  This step is optional. Run it if you need Point-in-Time Restore. If you
  need this step, complete it and then run steps 21 and 22. If you
  don't need this step, then proceed to step 23.
  In this step, you download and run the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility on the
  target instance for the replica set, and then stop the instance.

  a. Download the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility to your host.
     
     If you closed the restore panel, click :guilabel:`Continuous
     Backup in Deployment`, :guilabel:`More`, and then
     :guilabel:`Download MongoDB Backup Restore Utility`.

  #. Start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance without authentication
     enabled using the extracted snapshot directory as the data
     directory. Depending on your path, you may need to
     specify the path to the |mongod| binary.

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod  --port <ephemeralPort> \
                --dbpath </path/to/datafiles> \
                --setParameter ttlMonitorEnabled=false

     .. warning::
     
        The MongoDB Backup Restore Utility doesn't support
        authentication, so you can't start this temporary database with
        authentication.

  #. Run the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility on your target host.
     Run it once for the replica set.

     .. include:: /includes/fact-pre-configured-mbru-command.rst

     The ``mongodb-backup-restore-util`` command uses the following
     options:

     .. include:: /includes/fact-restore-manual-replica-set-onprem.rst

     :icon:`check-circle` means that if you copied the
     ``mongodb-backup-restore-util`` command provided in
     |application|, this field is pre-configured.

  #. Stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` on the instance. Depending on your path,
     you may need to specify the path to {+mongosh+}. Run:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongosh --port <ephemeralPort> \
              --eval "db.getSiblingDB('admin').shutdownServer()"

stepnum: 21
level: 4
title: "(Point-in-Time Restore Only) Restart the Instance to Recover the Oplog."
ref: restart-rs
content: |
  This step is needed only if you ran step 20. If you didn't need to run
  step 20, then proceed to step 23.

  Start the |mongod| using the following command, specifying these
  parameters:

  - ``<bind_ip>`` to the host serving this replica set member that you
    specified in the replica set configuration.
  - ``<port>`` to the <ephemeralPort> that you
    specified when you started the temporary standalone instance.
  
  This action replays the oplog up to the latest entry, including
  those inserted when you ran the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility.

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod  --dbpath </path/to/datafiles> \
             --port <ephemeralPort> \
             --bind_ip <host-serving-this-replica-set-member>
             --setParameter recoverFromOplogAsStandalone=true
             --setParameter takeUnstableCheckpointOnShutdown=true
             --setParameter startupRecoveryForRestore=true

  After you complete this step, the actual restore process is completed.
