=====================
Using Geospatial Data
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB supports location-based applications using geospatial
coordinate with rich location aware queries that return documents
based on location, and a special geospatial index type to support
these queries. This document introduces geospatial data modeling,
indexing operations, and queries using the special :ref:`geospatial
query operators <geospatial-query-operators>`. For more information about
the geospatial indexes and its operations see :doc:`Geospatial Indexes
</core/geospatial-indexes>`.

Queries
-------

MongoDB provides special :ref:`geospatial query operators
<geospatial-query-operators>` for performing queries on location data
inside of normal :func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation. The
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command also returns results using geospatial
indexes, but also includes additional geospatial information in the
return documents.

.. note::

   By default all MongoDB assumes that coordinate systems are on flat
   planes and all distances calculated by the :dbcommand:`geoNear` use
   the Pythagorean distance formula.

   MongoDB can also calculate and return accurate results for
   locations in a :ref:`spherical <geospatial-spherical-representation>`
   coordinate system, suing :ref:`spherical query operations <geospatial-spherical-queries>`.

.. index:: geospatial queries; exact

Exact
~~~~~

You can use the :func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method to query
directly for an exact match on a location. These queries take the
following prototypical form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: [ x, y ] } )

This query will return any document that where the value of ``[ x, y
]`` is *exactly* the same as the one specified in the query. To return
all documents in the ``places`` collection with values in the ``loc``
field that are exactly ``[ 42, 42 ]``, consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { "loc": [ 42, 42 ] } )

Exact geospatial queries are only useful in a limited selection of
cases, :ref:`proximity <geospatial-query-proximity>` and :ref:`bounded
<geospatial-query-bounded>` provide more useful results.

.. index:: geospatial queries; proximity
.. _geospatial-query-near:
.. _geospatial-query-proximity:

Proximity
~~~~~~~~~

Proximity queries take a coordinate pair and return a result set of
documents from the geospatial index that are close to the query
coordinates, sorted by distance. You can use the :operator:`$near`
operator in a :func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` query to return
the 100 closest points to a coordinate (e.g.  ``[ x, y ]``.)  These
queries have the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } } )

Consider the following example query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } } )

This operation will return documents from a collection named
``places`` that has a geospatial index on the ``loc`` field, near the
coordinates ``[ -74, 40.74 ]``.

In addition to :operator:`near`, the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command
provides equivalent geospatial query functionality, but provides
additional options *and* returns additional information for each
document found. In its most simple form, the :dbcommand:`geoNear`
command has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "[collection]", near: [ x, y ] } )

The following command returns the same results as the :operator:`near`
in the previous example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "places", near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } )

Limit
`````

To impose a limit on the result set other than the default 100
document limit, use the :func:`limit() <cursor.limit()>` method with
:func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` queries, in the following
prototype operation.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } } ).limit(n)

The following example, will return only 20 results of the above query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } } ).limit(20)

You may also use the ``num`` option with the :dbcommand:`geoNear` near
command, as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "collection", near: [ x, y ], num: z } )

The following command returns the same results as the :operator:`near`
in the previous example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "collection", near: [ -74, 40.74 ], num: 20 } )

.. index:: $maxDistance
.. index:: geospatial queries; distance limit

Distance
````````

To limit the result set by a distance from the query point, MongoDB
provides the :operator:`$maxDistance` operator that you can use in
:func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` queries with the
:operator:`$near` operator, as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } , $maxDistance : z } )

:dbcommand:`geoNear` provides equivalent functionality with the
``maxDistance`` option, as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "collection", near: [ x, y ], maxDistance: z } )

The distance specified in :operator:`maxDistance` is in the same units
as the coordinate system specifed. For example, if the indexed
location data is in meters, the distance unit is also in meters.

.. _geospatial-within:
.. _geospatial-query-bounded:

Bounded
~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the ability to return documents using geospatial
index that have coordinates located inside of a bounded shape. Bounded
queries use the :operator:`$within` operator, and MongoDB does not
sort the result set. Because result sets from bounded queries are not
sorted, they are faster than :ref:`proximity
<geospatial-query-proximity>` queries.

The :operator:`$within` operator returns points within the following
shapes:

- circles,
- rectangles (i.e. "boxes,") or
- polygons.

Bounded queries take the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field> :
                              { "$within" :
                                { <shape> : <shape dimensions> }
                              }
                       } )

The following sections provide examples of bounded queries using the
:operator:`$within` operator.

Circles
```````

To return results within the :ref:`bounds <geospatial-query-bounded>`
of a circle, you must specify the center and the radius of the circle,
using the :operator:`$within` operator and the :operator:`$center`
operator. Consider the following prototype query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { "field": { "$within": { "$center": [ center, radius ] } } } )

The following example query will return all documents that have
coordinates that exist within the circle centered on ``[-74, 40.74]``
with a radius of ``10``, using a geospatial index on the ``loc`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { "loc": { "$within":
                               { "$center": [ [-74, 40.74], 10 ] }
                            }
                   } )

Boxes
`````

To return results within the :ref:`bounds <geospatial-query-bounded>`
of a rectangle or box, you must specify the lower-left and upper-right
corners of the shape, using the :operator:`$within` operator and the
:operator:`$box` option. Consider the following prototype query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { "field": { "$within": { "$box": [ coordinate0, coordinate1 ] } } } )

The following query will return all documents that have coordinates
that exist within the rectangle, where the lower-left corner is at ``[
0, 0 ]`` and the upper-right corner is at ``[ 5, 5 ]`` using a
geospatial index on the ``loc`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { "loc": { "$within": { "$box": [ [0, 0] , [5, 5] ] } } } )

Polygons
````````

.. versionadded:: 1.9
   Support for polygon queries.

To return results within the :ref:`bounds <geospatial-query-bounded>`
of a polygon, you must specify the points where the sides of the
polygon meet in an array, using the :operator:`$within` operator and
the :operator:`$box` option. Consider the following prototype query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find({ "loc": { "$within": { "$polygon": [ points ] } } })

The last point in the ``points`` array is automatically connected to
the first point in the polygon. Therefore, given the following array
of points:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [4,0], [3,2], [2,3], [2,4], [4,5]

The following query will return all documents that have coordinates
that exist within the bounds of the polygon, where the sides of the
polygon connects at the above points using a geospatial index on the
``loc`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find({ "loc": { "$within": { "$polygon":
                                          [4,0], [3,2], [2,3], [2,4], [4,5]
                           } } })

.. _geospatial-query-spherical:

Spherical
~~~~~~~~~

If the coordinates in your documents represent points on a
spherical plane, :ref:`proximity <geospatial-query-proximity>` and
some :ref:`bounded <geospatial-query-bounded>` queries will not return
accurate results. To compensate, you can use the following spherical
queries which adjust for these errors. The following table provides a
list of spherical query operators and their flat system equivalents:

========================== ===================
 Spherical                  Flat
-------------------------- -------------------
:operator:`$nearSphere`    :operator:`$near`
:operator:`$centerSphere`  :operator:`$center`
========================== ===================

The :dbcommand:`geoNear` will return results for spherical systems if
you specify the ``{ spherical: true }`` option to the command.

.. admonition:: Spherical Queries Use Radians for Distance

   You must convert distances to radians when performing a spherical
   query, and convert the distances returned from radians into the
   units that your application uses.

   To convert:

   - *distance to radians*: divide the distance by the radius of the
     sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the same units as the distance
     measurement.

   - *radians to distnace*: multiply the radian measure by the radius
     of the sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the units system that you want to
     convert the distance to.

   The radius of the Earth is ``3963.192`` miles or ``6378.137``
   kilometers.


The following query would return documents from the ``places``
collection, within the circle described by the center ``[ -74, 40.74 ]``
with a radius of ``100`` kilometers:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $centerSphere: [ [ -74, 40.74 ] ,
                                           100 / 6378.137 ] } } )

Remember that you must convert the distance of the radius to
radians. This conversion *must* happen in your client
(i.e. application) code.

The following spherical proximity query, returns all documents in the
collection ``places`` within ``100`` miles from the point ``[ -74,
40.74 ]`` using the geospatial index.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "places",
                    near: [ -74, 40.74 ],
                    maxDistance: { 100 / 3963.192 },
                    spherical: true
                  }  )

:dbcommand:`geoNear` returns documents in this result set sorted by
their distance from the ``[ -74, 40.74 ]`` point.

.. warning::

   Spherical queries that wrap around the poles or at the transition
   from ``-180`` to ``180`` longitude raise an error.

.. note::

   While the default Earth-like bounds for geospatial indexes are
   between ``-180`` inclusive, and ``180``, valid values for latitude
   are between ``-90`` and ``90``.

Multi-location Documents
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   Support for multiple locations in a document.

In general, MongoDB cannot support more than one set of coordinates in
a document; however, using :ref:`multi-key indexes <index-type-multi-key>`,
you *can* index multiple coordinates in a single document. In the
simplest example, you may have a field (e.g. ``locs``) that holds an
array of geospatial coordinates, as in the following prototype data
model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "locs": [
              [ 55.5, 42.3 ],
              [ -74, 44.74 ],
              { "lat": 55.3, "long": 40.2 }
            ]
   }

The values of the array may either be arrays holding coordinates, as
in ``[ 55.5, 42.3 ]`` or embeded documents as in ``{ "lat": 55.3,
"long": 40.2 }``.

You could then create an index on the ``locs`` field, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { "locs": "2d" } )

You may also model the location data as a field inside of a
sub-document. In this case, the document would contain field
(e.g. ``addresses``) that held an array of documents where each
document has a field (e.g. ``loc:``) that holds location
coordinates. Consider the following prototype data model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "name": "...",
    "addresses": [
                   {
                    "context": "home",
                    "loc": [ 55.5, 42.3 ]
                   },
                   {
                    "context": "home",
                    "loc": [ -74, 44.74 ]
                   }
                 ]
   }

Then, create the geospatial index on the ``addresses.lock`` field as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { "addresses.loc": "2d" } )
