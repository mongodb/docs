The MongoDB shell provides the following methods to delete documents
from a collection:

- To delete multiple documents, use
  :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()`.

- To delete a single document, use :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-sample-data-examples.rst

Delete All Documents
--------------------

To delete all documents from a collection, pass an empty
:ref:`filter<document-query-filter>` document ``{}`` to the
:method:`db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

.. example::

   To delete all documents from the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use sample_mflix

      db.movies.deleteMany({})
 
   The method returns a document with the status of the operation. For
   more information and examples, see
   :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()`.

Delete All Documents that Match a Condition
-------------------------------------------

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to
delete. The :ref:`filters <document-query-filter>` use the same syntax
as read operations.

To specify equality conditions, use ``<field>:<value>`` expressions in
the query filter document.

To delete all documents that match a deletion criteria, pass a filter
parameter to the :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

.. example::

   To delete all documents from the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
   where the ``title`` equals ``"Titanic"``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use sample_mflix

      db.movies.deleteMany( { title: "Titanic" } )

   The method returns a document with the status of the operation. For
   more information and examples, see
   :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()`.

Delete Only One Document that Matches a Condition
-------------------------------------------------

To delete at most a single document that matches a specified filter
(even though multiple documents may match the specified filter) use the
:method:`db.collection.deleteOne()` method.

.. example::

   To delete the *first* document from the ``sample_mflix.movies``
   collection where the ``cast`` array contains ``"Brad Pitt"``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use sample_mflix

      db.movies.deleteOne( { cast: "Brad Pitt" } )
