Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.renameCollection(target, dropTarget)

   Renames a collection. Provides a wrapper for the
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` :term:`database command`.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.collection.renameCollection-param.rst

Behavior
--------

The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method operates within a
collection by changing the metadata associated with a given collection.

Refer to the documentation :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for additional
warnings and messages.

.. warning::

   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command will invalidate open cursors
   which interrupts queries that are currently returning data.

- The method has the following limitations:

  - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` cannot move a collection
    between databases. Use :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for these
    rename operations.

  - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` is not supported on
    sharded collections.

  - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-rename.rst

Example
-------

Call the :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method on a
collection object. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.rrecord.renameCollection("record")

This operation will rename the ``rrecord`` collection to ``record``. If
the target name (i.e. ``record``) is the name of an existing collection,
then the operation will fail.
