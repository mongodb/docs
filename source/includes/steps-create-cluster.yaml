  From the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` section, you can also
  choose to deploy your cluster across multiple regions. Multi-region
  clusters can better withstand data center outages and may contain
  dedicated geographic regions for localized reads, thereby improving
  performance. 

  .. important::

     You cannot deploy clusters across government and commercial 
     regions.
  
  .. seealso:: |service| documentation
