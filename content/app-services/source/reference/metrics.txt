App Services provides a variety of metrics related to App Services and Device
Sync. You can access your metrics data with the Admin API's
:admin-api-endpoint:`Retrieve App Services metrics
<tag/metrics/operation/adminGetMetrics>` endpoint.

The exact metrics returned may be subject to change.

Metric Format
-------------

When you request metrics, you specify a start time, end time, and time
granularity such as "hourly". The response contains a list of **measurement**
objects, one for each metric listed below. Each measurement object contains a
list of **data points** that represent that metric's value at a specific time.

For example, you request hourly metrics from 12:00am to 11:59pm Tuesday. App
Services sends back a list of measurements. Each measurement contains about 24
data points (one for each hour between start and end time). The value field of
each data point is the value of that metric at the time specified by the
timestamp.

Units
-----

App Services expresses each metric in one of the following units:

- BYTES_PER_SECOND
- MILLISECONDS
- SCALAR
- SCALAR_PER_SECOND

A **scalar** is a singular value representing a magnitude or count. Its exact
interpretation depends on the metric.

A **scalar per second** represents a count over time ("rate"). The value is
effectively the total count since the previous data point divided by the number
of seconds since the previous data point.

Some scalar per second values are expressed as a 95th percentile. This means
that the measurement for the given metric is below the given value 95% of the time
and above it the other 5% of the time.
