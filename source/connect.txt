This page outlines how to use |vsce-full| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. note:: MongoDB Atlas

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.
   |service| is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |vsce| to your deployment.

   To create a cluster on the |service| free tier, run the command 
   ``MongoDB: Open Overview Page`` in the |vscode-short| Command 
   Palette and then click :guilabel:`Create free cluster`.

   To create an |service| cluster using a Terraform template included
   with |vsce|, see :ref:`vsce-create-cluster-terraform`.

If you need to install |vsce|, see :ref:`vsce-install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |vsce| to a replica set, use either the
  replica set :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name`
  when filling in your connection information. It is not recommended to
  connect directly to an individual replica set member.

  - If the member to which you are connected switches from a
    :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
    :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
    the result of an election, |vsce| may either forcibly close
    the connection or display stale data.

- You can't connect |vsce| directly to an :atlas:`analytics node 
  </faq/#what-are-analytics-nodes>`.

- |vsce| appends the ``appName`` connection string option with a value
  of ``mongodb-vscode <version>`` for all deployment connections.

.. - If you are using Kerberos as your authentication mechanism, do not 
..  specify the :guilabel:`Password` in the connection form.

.. _vsce-connect-task:

Create a Connection
-------------------

|vsce| provides two options to connect to your deployment:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Connection Method
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Connect with Connection String`
     - This method is faster and easier than 
       using the advanced connection settings. Use this option 
       if your deployment is hosted on |service| or you already have a 
       connection string for a deployment available.

   * - :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Settings`
     - This method lets you build a connection string with a form.
       Use this option if you need to customize the connection 
       string and want to see available connection options.

.. note::

   To specify where |vsce| connections are saved, use 
   the :guilabel:`Default Connection Saving Location`
   :ref:`setting <vsce-settings>`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connect with Connection String
      :tabid: connect-with-connection-string

      When you provide a connection string, |vsce| supports
      most :manual:`Connection String Options
      </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
      supported by MongoDB.

.. _vsce-connect-task-atlas-streams:

Connect to Atlas Stream Processing
----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.50

You can use |vsce| to connect to `Atlas Stream Processing 
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-stream-processing>`__
by providing a Stream Processing Interface (SPI) connection string.

For details on how to configure Atlas Stream Processing, see 
:ref:`manage-spi`. 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Open the connections pane

      a. Expand the :guilabel:`Connections` pane in the left navigation 
         if it is collapsed.

      #. Click the More Actions menu (...) and select
         :guilabel:`Add MongoDB Connection with Connection String...`

   .. step:: Paste in an SPI connection string

      To obtain an SPI connection string login to your 
      `Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__ account.
      Click :guilabel:`Stream Processing` from the left-hand navigation 
      and then select a Stream Processing Instance. Click 
      :guilabel:`Connect` and choose :guilabel:`MongoDB for VSCode` from
      the :guilabel:`Choose a Connection Method` page of the connect 
      dialog.

      .. tip::

         For full details on using and configuring 
         Atlas Stream Processing, see :ref:`what-is-atlas-sp`. 

      The following code block is an example of SPI connection string:

      .. code-block::

         mongodb://user1:password1@atlas-stream-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy.virginia-usa.a.query.mongodb.net/?authSource=admin&readPreference=primary&ssl=true&directConnection=true

      Once you are connected, the stream connection displays under 
      the :guilabel:`Connections` pane:

      .. figure:: /images/vsce-stream-connection-example.png
         :figwidth: 700px
         :alt: Image of a stream connection

   .. step:: Open a new |vsce| playground

      After successfully connecting to your Atlas Stream, click 
      :guilabel:`Create New Playground` on the :guilabel:`Playgrounds` 
      pane. A stream processing playground template displays with 
      pre-populated code that allows you to list stream connections 
      and process stream data:

.. _vsce-activate-connection:

Activate a Connection 
---------------------

You can connect |vsce| to only one deployment at a time. To change the
active connection to a different deployment, or to connect to a 
deployment from which you were disconnected:

.. include:: /includes/steps/activate-connection.rst

Launch MongoDB Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can connect the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>` or legacy
:binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell to your active deployment.


Considerations
``````````````

- The shell that |vsce| uses to connect to your deployment is
  determined by the :guilabel:`Shell` setting in your
  :ref:`extension settings <vsce-settings>`. You can choose either
  the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>` or the legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell.

- The path to your selected shell must exist in your system's ``PATH``.
  If it does not exist in your ``PATH``, the operation errors.

Procedure
`````````

To connect the shell to your active deployment:

a. In the |vsce| :guilabel:`Connections` list, right-click your active
   deployment.

#. Select :guilabel:`Launch MongoDB Shell`.

|vsce| opens the :guilabel:`Terminal` window in VS Code and launches
the shell connected to your selected deployment.
