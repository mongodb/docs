If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to |newversion| using your package
manager. 

Follow the appropriate |installationdoc| for your Linux system. This
requires adding a repository for the new release, then performing
the actual upgrade process.
