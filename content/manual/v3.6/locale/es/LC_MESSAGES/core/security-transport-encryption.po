"MongoDB supports TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) "
"to encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic. TLS/SSL ensures that MongoDB"
" network traffic is only readable by the intended client."

"MongoDB TLS/SSL implementation uses OpenSSL libraries. MongoDB's TLS/SSL "
"encryption only allows use of strong TLS/SSL ciphers with a minimum of "

"To use TLS/SSL with MongoDB , you must have the TLS/SSL certificates as "
":file:`PEM` files, which are concatenated certificate containers."

"MongoDB can use any valid TLS/SSL certificate issued by a certificate "
"authority or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed "
"certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted, there"
" will be *no* validation of server identity. Although such a situation "
"will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you vulnerable to"
" a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by a trusted "
"certificate authority will permit MongoDB drivers to verify the server's "
"identity."
