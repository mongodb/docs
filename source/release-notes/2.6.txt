========================================================
Release Notes for MongoDB 2.6 (Development Series 2.5.x)
========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.6 is currently in development, as part of the 2.5
development release series. While 2.5-series releases are currently
available, these versions of MongoDB, including the 2.6 release 
candidate builds, are for **testing only and
not for production use**.

This document will eventually contain the full release notes for
MongoDB 2.6; before its release this document covers the 2.5
development series as a work-in-progress.

.. contents:: See the :doc:`full index of this page <2.6-changes>` for
              a complete list of changes included in 2.6 (Development
              Series 2.5.x).

Downloading
-----------

You can download the 2.6 release candidate on the `downloads page`_ in the
:guilabel:`Development Release (Unstable)` section. There are no
distribution packages for development releases, but you can use the
binaries provided for testing purposes. See
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`,
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows`, or
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x` for the basic installation
process.

Changes
-------

Major Features
++++++++++++++

SASL Library Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise uses Cyrus SASL instead of GNU SASL (``libgsasl``).
This change has the following SASL2 and Cyrus SASL library and GSSAPI
plugin dependencies:

For Debian or Ubuntu, install the following: 

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install cyrus-sasl2-dbg cyrus-sasl2-mit-dbg libsasl2-2 libsasl2-dev libsasl2-modules libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit


For CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Amazon AMI, install the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum install cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-lib cyrus-sasl-devel cyrus-sasl-gssapi

For SUSE, install the following: 

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo zypper install cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-devel cyrus-sasl-gssapi

LDAP Support for Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise provides support for proxy authentication of users.  This
change allows administrators to configure a MongoDB cluster to authenticate
users via Linux PAM or by proxying authentication requests to a specified LDAP
service.

.. warning::

   Because this change uses ``SASL PLAIN`` mechanism to transmit the
   user password to the MongoDB server, you should, in general, use
   only on a trusted channel (VPN, SSL, trusted wired network).

Configuration
`````````````

LDAP support for user authentication requires proper configuration of
the ``saslauthd`` daemon process as well as introduces a new server
parameter, ``saslauthdPath``. ``saslauthdPath`` is the path to the Unix
Domain Socket of the ``saslauthd`` instance to use for proxy
authentication.

``saslauthd`` Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use with ActiveDirectory, start ``saslauthd`` with the following
config file contents:

.. code-block:: none

   ldap_servers: <ldap uri, e.g. ldaps://ad.mydomain.com>
   ldap_use_sasl: yes
   ldap_mech: DIGEST-MD5
   ldap_auth_method: fastbind

MongoDB Server Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure the MongoDB server with the ``saslauthdPath`` parameter:

- If ``saslauthd`` has a socket path of ``/<some>/<path>/saslauthd``,
  set the ``saslauthdPath`` parameter to
  ``/<some>/<path>/saslauthd/mux``. 

- Otherwise, set the ``saslauthdPath`` to the empty string to use the
  library's default value.

Authenticate in the ``mongo`` Shell
```````````````````````````````````

To use this authentication mechanism in the :program:`mongo` shell, you
**must** pass ``digestPassword: false`` to :method:`db.auth()` when
authenticating on the ``$external`` database, since the server must
receive an undigested password to forward on to ``saslauthd``, as in
the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.auth(
            {
              mechanism: "PLAIN", 
              user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET",
              password: "some1nterestingPwd",
              digestPassword: false
            } 
          )
