Overview
--------

|service| |global-write-clusters| use a highly curated implementation 
of sharded cluster :manual:`zones </core/zone-sharding>` to support 
location-aware read and write operations for globally distributed 
application instances and clients. |global-write-clusters| support 
deployment patterns such as:

- Low-latency read and write operations for globally distributed
  clients.

- Uptime protection during partial or full regional outages.

- Location-aware data storage in specific geographic regions.

- Workload isolation based on cluster member types.

For instructions on creating a Global Cluster, see
:ref:`create-new-global-write-cluster`.

|service| supports enabling |global-write| when deploying an ``M30`` or 
greater sharded cluster. For replica sets, 
:doc:`scale </scale-cluster>` the cluster to at least an ``M30``
tier and enable |global-write|. All shard nodes deploy with the 
selected cluster.

.. important::

   You cannot disable |global-write| for a cluster once deployed.

Additional Global Cluster Reference
-----------------------------------

|service| |global-write-clusters| require developers to define 
single or multi-region :guilabel:`Zones`, where each zone supports
write and read operations from geographically local shards. You can also
configure zones to support global low-latency secondary reads. For more 
information on |global-write| zones, see :ref:`global-writes-zones`.

|service| does not auto-configure or auto-shard collections. 
Sharded collections must meet specific compatibility requirements to 
utilize |global-write|. For more information on guidance and 
requirements for sharding collections for |global-write|, see 
:ref:`global-writes-collections`.

The |service| :ref:`data-explorer` supports creating sharded
collections with specific validations for |global-write|. For complete
documentation, see :ref:`de-shard-collection-for-global-writes`.
