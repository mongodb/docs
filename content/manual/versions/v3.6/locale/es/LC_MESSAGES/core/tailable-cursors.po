"By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has"
" exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped "
"collections </core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable Cursor* "
"that remains open after the client exhausts the results in the initial "
"cursor. Tailable cursors are conceptually equivalent to the ``tail`` Unix"
" command with the ``-f`` option (i.e. with \"follow\" mode). After "
"clients insert new additional documents into a capped collection, the "
"tailable cursor will continue to retrieve documents."

"Use tailable cursors on capped collections that have high write volumes "
"where indexes aren't practical. For instance, MongoDB :doc:`replication "
"</replication>` uses tailable cursors to tail the primary's "
":term:`oplog`."

"If your query is on an indexed field, do not use tailable cursors, but "
"instead, use a regular cursor. Keep track of the last value of the "
"indexed field returned by the query. To retrieve the newly added "
"documents, query the collection again using the last value of the indexed"
" field in the query criteria, as in the following example:"
