Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about time series collections in the MongoDB
Node.js driver.

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

We recommend that you create a time series collection using the MongoDB Shell.
Learn more about how to install and run the MongoDB Shell in the :mdb-shell:`MongoDB Shell documentation <>`.
For detailed instructions on creating a time series collection
using the MongoDB Shell, see our
:manual:`MongoDB Manual entry on time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/#create-a-time-series-collection>`.

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

Since you query a time series collection in the same way you query other
collection types in MongoDB, the Node.js driver has no features specifically for
querying time series data.

For more information on querying data in the MongoDB Node.js driver, see the
following resources:

- :ref:`Guide On Read Operations <nodejs-driver-retrieve-data-overview>`
- :ref:`Guide On Aggregation <nodejs-aggregation-overview>`

.. note:: Window Functions

   MongoDB version 5.0 introduces window functions into the MongoDB aggregation
   pipeline. You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data. For more information, see
   :manual:`the reference documentation for the $setWindowFields aggregation stage </reference/operator/aggregation/setWindowFields/#-setwindowfields--aggregation->`.
