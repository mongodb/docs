MongoDB runs as a standard program. You can start MongoDB from a
command line by issuing the :binary:`~bin.mongod` command and specifying
options.  For a list of options, see the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
reference. MongoDB can also run as a Windows service. For details, see
:ref:`manually-create-windows-service`. To install MongoDB, see
:doc:`/installation`.

The following examples assume the directory containing the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process is in your system paths. The
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process is the primary database process that runs on
an individual server. :binary:`~bin.mongos` provides a coherent MongoDB
interface equivalent to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the perspective of a
client. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` binary provides the administrative
shell.

This document discusses the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process; however,
some portions of this document may be applicable to :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances.

.. _start-mongod-processes:

Start ``mongod`` Processes
--------------------------

By default, MongoDB listens for connections from clients on port
``27017``, and stores data in the ``/data/db`` directory.

On Windows, this path is on the drive from which you start MongoDB. For
example, if you do not specify a :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, starting a MongoDB
server on the ``C:\`` drive stores all data files in ``C:\data\db``.

To start MongoDB using all defaults, issue the following command at
the system shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

Specify a Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want :binary:`~bin.mongod` to store data files at a path *other
than* ``/data/db`` you can specify a :setting:`~storage.dbPath`. The
:setting:`~storage.dbPath` must exist before you start :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If it
does not exist, create the directory and the permissions so that
:binary:`~bin.mongod` can read and write data to this path. For more
information on permissions, see the :doc:`security operations
documentation </administration/security-checklist>`.

To specify a :setting:`~storage.dbPath` for :binary:`~bin.mongod` to use as a data
directory, use the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option. The
following invocation will start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and store
data in the ``/srv/mongodb`` path

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb/

Specify a TCP Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a single process can listen for connections on a network
interface at a time. If you run multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes
on a single machine, or have other processes that must use this port,
you must assign each a different port to listen on for client
connections.

To specify a port to :binary:`~bin.mongod`, use the :option:`--port
<mongod --port>` option on the command line. The following command
starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` listening on port ``12345``:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 12345

Use the default port number when possible, to avoid confusion.

Start ``mongod`` as a Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a :binary:`~bin.mongod` process as a daemon (i.e. :setting:`~processManagement.fork`),
*and* write its output to a log file, use the :option:`--fork
<mongod --fork>` and :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`
options. You must create the log directory; however, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
will create the log file if it does not exist.

The following command starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a daemon and records log
output to ``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Additional Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an overview of common configurations and deployments
for common use cases, see
:doc:`/administration/configuration`.

.. _terminate-mongod-processes:

Stop ``mongod`` Processes
-------------------------

In a clean shutdown a :binary:`~bin.mongod` completes all pending
operations, flushes all data to data files, and closes all data
files. Other shutdowns are *unclean* and can compromise the validity of the
data files.

.. COMMENT add the following to the last sentence when the paragraph
   when maintain-valid-data-files is published.

   and may lead to corruption. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/maintain-valid-data-files` for more information.

To ensure a clean shutdown, always shutdown :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances using one of the following methods:

Use ``shutdownServer()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell using
the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` method as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.shutdownServer()

Calling the same method from a :term:`init script` accomplishes the same result.

For systems with :setting:`~security.authorization` enabled, users may only issue
:method:`db.shutdownServer()` when authenticated to the ``admin``
database or via the localhost interface on systems without
authentication enabled.

Use ``--shutdown``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported on Linux only. From the command line, shut down the 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` using the :option:`--shutdown <mongod --shutdown>`
option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --shutdown

Use ``CTRL-C``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in interactive mode
(i.e. without :option:`--fork <mongod --fork>`), issue ``Control-C``
to perform a clean shutdown.

Use ``kill``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported on Linux and macOS only. From the command line, shut down a 
specific :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance using one of the following 
commands:

.. code-block:: none

   kill <mongod process ID>
   kill -2 <mongod process ID>

.. _kill-sigterm:

``SIGTERM`` and Replica Sets
````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.0.8 (and 3.6.15), if a replica set primary receives a
``SIGTERM``, the primary attempts to step down before shutting down. 

- If the step down succeeds, the instance does not vote in the ensuing
  election of the new primary, and continues its shutdown.

- If the step down fails, the instance continues its shutdown.

``SIGKILL``
```````````

.. warning::

   Never use ``kill -9`` (i.e. ``SIGKILL``) to terminate a mongod instance.

.. _stop-replica-set:

Stop a Replica Set
------------------

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is the :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica
set`, the shutdown process for this :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has
the following steps:

#. Check how up-to-date the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` are.

#. If no secondary is within 10 seconds of the primary,
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` will return a message that it will not shut down.
   You can pass the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command a ``timeoutSecs``
   argument to wait for a secondary to catch up.

#. If there is a secondary within 10 seconds of the primary, the primary
   will step down and wait for the secondary to catch up.

#. After 60 seconds or once the secondary has caught up, the primary
   will shut down.

Force Replica Set Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is no up-to-date secondary and you want the primary to shut
down, issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command with the ``force``
argument, as in the following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, force : true})

To keep checking the secondaries for a specified number of seconds if
none are immediately up-to-date, issue :dbcommand:`shutdown` with the
``timeoutSecs`` argument. MongoDB will keep checking the secondaries for
the specified number of seconds if none are immediately up-to-date. If
any of the secondaries catch up within the allotted time, the primary
will shut down. If no secondaries catch up, it will not shut down.

The following command issues :dbcommand:`shutdown` with ``timeoutSecs``
set to ``5``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, timeoutSecs : 5})

Alternately you can use the ``timeoutSecs`` argument with the
:method:`db.shutdownServer()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shutdownServer({timeoutSecs : 5})
