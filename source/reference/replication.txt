Replication Methods in the ``mongo`` Shell
------------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30,70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name

     - Description

   * - :method:`rs.add()`

     - Adds a member to a replica set.

   * - :method:`rs.addArb()`

     - Adds an :term:`arbiter` to a replica set.

   * - :method:`rs.conf()`

     - Returns the replica set configuration document.

   * - :method:`rs.freeze()`

     - Prevents the current member from seeking election as primary for a period of time.

   * - :method:`rs.help()`

     - Returns basic help text for :term:`replica set` functions.

   * - :method:`rs.initiate()`

     - Initializes a new replica set.

   * - :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()`

     - Prints a report of the status of the replica set from the perspective of the primary.

   * - :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`

     - Prints a report of the status of the replica set from the perspective of the secondaries.

   * - :method:`rs.reconfig()`

     - Re-configures a replica set by applying a new replica set configuration object.

   * - :method:`rs.remove()`

     - Remove a member from a replica set.

   * - :method:`rs.slaveOk()`

     - Sets the ``slaveOk`` property for the current connection. Deprecated. Use :method:`~cursor.readPref()` and :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` to set :term:`read preference`.

   * - :method:`rs.status()`

     - Returns a document with information about the state of the replica set.

   * - :method:`rs.stepDown()`

     - Causes the current :term:`primary` to become a secondary which forces an :term:`election`.

   * - :method:`rs.syncFrom()`

     - Sets the member that this replica set member will sync from, overriding the default sync target selection logic.


Replication Database Commands
-----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30,70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name

     - Description

   * - :dbcommand:`applyOps`

     - Internal command that applies :term:`oplog` entries to the current data set.

   * - :dbcommand:`isMaster`

     - Displays information about this member's role in the replica set, including whether it is the master.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetAbortPrimaryCatchUp`

     - Forces the elected :term:`primary` to abort sync (catch up) then complete the transition to primary.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze`

     - Prevents the current member from seeking election as :term:`primary` for a period of time.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetGetConfig`

     - Returns the replica set's configuration object.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`

     - Returns a document that reports on the status of the replica set.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetInitiate`

     - Initializes a new replica set.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance`

     - Enables or disables a maintenance mode, which puts a :term:`secondary` node in a ``RECOVERING`` state.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig`

     - Applies a new configuration to an existing replica set.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`

     - Forces the current :term:`primary` to *step down* and become a :term:`secondary`, forcing an election.

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom`

     - Explicitly override the default logic for selecting a member to replicate from.

   * - :dbcommand:`resync`

     - Forces a :binary:`~bin.mongod` to re-synchronize from the :term:`master`. For master-slave replication only.
