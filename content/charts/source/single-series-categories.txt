Create a Single-Series Chart with Multiple Aggregations
=======================================================

.. meta::
   :description: Create single-series charts with multiple aggregated values using various chart types like bar, column, line, and area charts.

You can create a single-series chart that contains multiple aggregated
values. These aggregated values can be from either the same field or
different fields in your :ref:`data source <data-sources>`. Use this
functionality to visualize multiple aggregated values without grouping
your data into categories.

Supported Chart Types
---------------------

You can include multiple aggregations in your single-series chart on the
following chart types:

- Grouped and Stacked :ref:`Bar Charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`

- Grouped and Stacked :ref:`Column Charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`

- Discrete :ref:`Line Charts <line-area-chart-ref>`

- Discrete :ref:`Area Charts <line-area-chart-ref>`

Procedure
---------

To create a single-series chart that contains multiple aggregated
values:

.. include:: /includes/steps/single-series-multiple-fields.rst

Behavior
--------

- When you encode multiple aggregation fields, the :guilabel:`Series`
  encoding channel is disabled.

- When you create a single-series chart with only aggregated values,
  each aggregated value is treated as its own category. If you encode a
  :guilabel:`Category` field in addition to your aggregation fields, the
  aggregated values become series (instead of categories). To learn
  more, see :ref:`multiple-field-mappings`.

Example
-------

The following chart uses the :guilabel:`Sample Data: Movies`
data source to show the mean IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings
across all movies.

.. figure:: /images/charts/single-series-multi-agg.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Movie Ratings Multiseries Chart

The chart contains two aggregation encoding channels:

- Mean ``imdb.rating``
- Mean ``tomatoes.rating``

Since no field is applied to the category encoding channel, the chart
shows the mean ratings across all movies, irrespective of any
categorical grouping.
