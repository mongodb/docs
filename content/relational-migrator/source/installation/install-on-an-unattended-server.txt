You can install {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server on both Linux 
and Windows systems. The unattended server installation binds Relational 
Migrator to any IP and port on the server and exposes it as a web application.

Use Case
--------

Installing {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server is ideal for larger 
production-scale migration projects. If you expect your production job to 
run for more than a few days, it is recommended to configure production monitoring 
and alerting.

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For critical production workloads and/or long-running CDC syncs, Kafka is recommended.
Kafka allows users to configure the underlying cluster for high availability and 
automatic failure recovery. For more information, see :ref:`<kafka-intro>`.

Behavior
--------

- It is recommended that you configure TLS/SSL on your unattended server.
  You can bind {+rel-mig+} to any IP and port on the server.

- When you install {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server, you can set up 
  {+rel-mig+} to run as a system service. As a system service, Relational 
  Migrator automatically starts when the server starts.

- When you install {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server, you can enable 
  external access to {+rel-mig+} on Windows. By enabling external access, 
  incoming connections are allowed on the same port as {+rel-mig+}.
