Overview
--------

In the **X.509** authentication mechanism, the server and client use the
:wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>` protocol to exchange X.509 public-key
certificates. You can use this mechanism to authenticate to MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB
Enterprise Advanced, and MongoDB Community Edition.

.. tip:: X.509 Mechanism

   To learn how to use TLS/SSL with the {+library-short+},
   see the :ref:`php-tls` guide.

   For more information about X.509 certificates, see
   :manual:`Use x.509 Certificates to Authenticate Clients on Self-Managed Deployments
   </tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Specify X.509 Authentication
----------------------------

To use the X.509 authentication mechanism, set the following connection options:

- ``tls``: Set to ``true``.
- ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``: The file path of the ``.pem`` file that contains your
  client certificate and private key.
- ``authMechanism``: Set to ``'MONGODB-X509'``.

You can set these options in two ways: by passing an options array to the
``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through parameters in your connection URI.
Select the :guilabel:`MongoDB\\Client` or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to
see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-mongodb-X509-client
         :end-before: end-mongodb-X509-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-mongodb-X509-uri
         :end-before: end-mongodb-X509-uri
