replSetStepDown
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   Forces the :term:`primary`
   of the replica set to relinquish its status as primary. This
   initiates an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`.

   .. include:: /reference/command/replSetStepDown-field.rst

   .. warning:: :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients
      currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps
      ensure that clients maintain an accurate view of the replica
      set.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0
      If there is no :term:`secondary` within 10 seconds of the
      primary, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will not succeed to
      prevent long running elections.

Example
-------

The following example specifies that the former primary avoids
reelection to primary for 120 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120 } )

.. slave-ok, admin-only
