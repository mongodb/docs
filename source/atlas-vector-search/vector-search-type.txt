You can use the ``vectorSearch`` type to index fields for running 
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. You can define the index for the
vector embeddings that you want to query and the boolean, date, objectId, 
numeric, string, or UUID values that you want to use to pre-filter your
data. Filtering your data is useful to narrow the scope of your semantic
search and ensure that certain vector embeddings are not considered for 
comparison, such as in a multi-tenant environment.

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
{+atlas-cli+}, {+mongosh+}, or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`
to :ref:`create <avs-create-index>` your {+avs+} index. 

.. note:: 

   You can't use the deprecated :ref:`knn-beta-ref` operator to query
   fields indexed using the ``vectorSearch`` type index definition. 

.. _avs-types-vector-search-considerations:

Considerations 
--------------

In a ``vectorSearch`` type index definition, you can index arrays with
only a single element. You can't index fields inside arrays of documents
or fields inside arrays of objects. You can index fields inside
documents using the dot notation. 

Before indexing your embeddings, we recommend converting your embeddings
to |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with
subtype ``float32``, ``int1``, or ``int8`` for efficient storage
in your |service| {+cluster+}.  To learn more, see :ref:`how to convert
your embeddings to BSON vectors <avs-bindata-vector-subtype>`.

   :linenos:

   {
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",

       },
       ...
     ]
   }

{+avs+} Index Fields
--------------------------------

The {+avs+} index definition takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 15 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type 
     - Necessity
     - Purpose

   * - ``fields``
     - array of documents 
     - Required 
     - Vector and filter fields to index, one per document. At least one
       document *must* contain the field definition for the vector
       field. You can optionally also index boolean, date, number, objectId,
       string, and UUID fields, one per document, for pre-filtering the data.

   * - ``fields.type``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Field type to use to index fields for :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`.
       You can specify one of the following values:  
       
       - ``vector`` - for fields that contain vector embeddings.
       - ``filter`` - for fields that contain boolean, date, objectId, numeric, 
         string, or UUID values. 

   * - ``fields.path``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Name of the field to index. For nested fields, use dot notation
       to specify path to embedded fields.
       
       You *cannot* index field names with two consecutive dots or field names
       ending with dots. For example, {+avs+} doesn't support indexing the
       following field names: ``foo..bar`` or ``foo_bar.``.

   * - ``fields.numDimensions``
     - int
     - Required
     - Number of vector dimensions that {+avs+} enforces at index-time and
       query-time. You must specify a value less than or equal to
       ``8192``. For indexing :manual:`BinData
       </reference/method/BinData/>` or quantized vectors, value must be
       one of the following:

       - ``1`` to ``8192`` for ``int8`` vectors for ingestion.
       - Multiple of ``8`` for ``int1`` vectors for ingestion.
       - ``1`` to ``8192`` for ``binData(float32)`` and
         ``array(float32)`` vectors for automatic scalar quantization.
       - Multiple of ``8`` for ``binData(float32)`` and
         ``array(float32)`` vectors for automatic binary quantization.
       
       You can set this field only for ``vector`` type fields.

   * - ``fields.similarity``
     - string
     - Required
     - .. _fields-similarity:
      
       Vector similarity function to use to search for top K-nearest 
       neighbors. You can set this field only for ``vector`` type
       fields. Value can be one of the following: 

       - ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. 
       - ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between 
         vectors. 
       - ``dotProduct`` - measures similarity like ``cosine``, but takes 
         into account the magnitude of the vector.  
         
       To learn more, see :ref:`avs-similarity-functions`.

   * - ``fields.quantization``
     - string
     - Optional
     - .. _fields-quantization:

       Type of automatic vector quantization for your vectors. You can
       specify the type of quantization to apply on your vectors. Use
       this setting only if your embeddings are ``float`` or ``double``
       vectors. Value can be one of the following:  

       - ``none`` - Indicates no automatic quantization for the vector
         embeddings. Use this setting if you have pre-quantized vectors
         for ingestion. If omitted, this is the default value. 
       - ``scalar`` - Indicates scalar quantization, which transforms
         values to 1 byte integers.    
       - ``binary`` - Indicates binary quantization, which transforms
         values to a single bit. To use this quantization,
         ``numDimensions`` must be a multiple of 8. 

       If precision is critical, select ``none`` or ``scalar`` instead
       of ``binary``. 

       To learn more, see :ref:`avs-quantization`.

.. _avs-types-vector:

About the ``vector`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your index definition's ``vector`` field must contain an array of numbers of 
*one* of the following types: 

- |bson| ``double`` 
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``float32``  
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``int1`` 
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``int8`` 

.. note:: 

   To learn more about generating |bson| :manual:`BinData
   </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with subtype ``float32``
   ``int1`` or ``int8`` for your data, see 
   :ref:`avs-bindata-vector-subtype`.

   .. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-avs-int1-ingestion-preview.rst

You must index the vector field as the ``vector`` type inside the
``fields`` array.

The following syntax defines the ``vector`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4-8

   {
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": <field-to-index>,
         "numDimensions": <number-of-dimensions>,
         "similarity": "euclidean | cosine | dotProduct",
         "quantization": "none | scalar | binary"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

.. _avs-similarity-functions:

About the Similarity Functions 
``````````````````````````````

{+avs+} supports the following similarity functions: 

- ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. This
  value allows you to measure similarity based on varying dimensions. To
  learn more, see :wikipedia:`Euclidean <Euclidean_distance>`.  
- ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between  vectors.
  This value allows you to measure similarity that isn't scaled by
  magnitude. You can't use zero magnitude vectors with ``cosine``. To
  measure cosine similarity, we recommend that you normalize your
  vectors and use ``dotProduct`` instead.  
- ``dotProduct`` - measures similarity like ``cosine``, but takes into
  account the magnitude of the vector. If you normalize the magnitude,
  ``cosine`` and ``dotProduct`` are almost identical in measuring
  similarity.   
         
  To use ``dotProduct``, you must normalize the vector to unit length at
  index-time and query-time.  

The following table shows the similarity functions for the various types:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 25 25 25 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Vector Embeddings Type
     - ``euclidean``
     - ``cosine``  
     - ``dotProduct``

   * - ``binData(int1)`` :icon-fa5:`star`
     - √
     - 
     - 

   * - ``binData(int8)`` :icon-fa5:`star`
     - √
     - √
     - √

   * - ``binData(float32)`` :icon-fa5:`asterisk`
     - √
     - √
     - √

   * - ``array(float32)`` :icon-fa5:`asterisk`
     - √
     - √
     - √

:icon-fa5:`star` For vector ingestion.

:icon-fa5:`asterisk` For automatic scalar or binary quantization.

For best performance, check your embedding model to determine which
similarity function aligns with your embedding model's training
process. If you don't have any guidance, start with ``dotProduct``.
Setting ``fields.similarity`` to the ``dotProduct`` value allows you
to efficiently measure similarity based on both angle and magnitude.
``dotProduct`` consumes less computational resources than ``cosine``
and is efficient when vectors are of unit length. However, if your
vectors aren't normalized, evaluate the similarity scores in the
results of a sample query for ``euclidean`` distance and ``cosine``
similarity to determine which corresponds to reasonable results. 

.. _avs-types-filter:

About the ``filter`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally index boolean, date, number, objectId, string, and
UUID fields to pre-filter your data. Filtering your data is useful to
narrow the scope of your semantic search and ensure that not all vectors
are considered for comparison. It reduces the number of documents
against which to run similarity comparisons, which can decrease query
latency and increase the accuracy of search results. 

You must index the fields that you want to filter by using the
``filter`` type inside the ``fields`` array. 

The following syntax defines the ``filter`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 8-9

   {
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         ...
       },
       {
         "type": "filter",
         "path": "<field-to-index>"
       },

.. _avs-edit-index:

Edit an {+avs+} Index
-----------------------------------

You can change the :ref:`index definition <avs-types-vector-search>`
of an existing {+avs+} index from the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
{+atlas-cli+}, {+mongosh+}, or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`. 
You can't rename an index or change the index type. If you need to
change an index name or type, you must create a new index and delete the old one.

.. important::

   After you edit an index, {+avs+} rebuilds it. 
   While the index rebuilds, you can continue to run vector 
   search queries by using the old index definition. 
   When the index finishes rebuilding, the old index is automatically 
   replaced. This process is similar to |fts| indexes. To learn more,
   see :ref:`index-create-and-update`. 

Required Access 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have the :authrole:`Project Search Index Editor` or higher role to
edit an {+avs+} index.

Index Status
------------

When you create the {+avs+} index, the :guilabel:`Status` column shows 
the current state of the index on the primary node of the cluster. 
Click the :guilabel:`View status details` link below the status to view 
the state of the index on all the nodes of the cluster.

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Not Started 
     - |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Initial Sync 
     - |service| is building the index or re-building the 
       index after an edit. When the index is in this state:
       
       - For a new index, {+avs+} doesn't serve queries until the 
         index build is complete. 
       - For an existing index, you can continue to use the old index 
         for existing and new queries until the index rebuild 
         is complete.

   * - Active
     - Index is ready to use.

   * - Recovering
     - Replication encountered an error. This state commonly occurs 
       when the current replication point is no longer available on the 
       |mongod| oplog. You can still query the existing index until it 
       updates and its status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. Use the 
       error in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`Fix Issues <atlas-search-alerts>`.

   * - Failed 
     - |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`Fix Issues <atlas-search-alerts>`.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.

While |service| builds the index and after the build completes, the 
:guilabel:`Documents` column shows the percentage and number of 
documents indexed. The column also shows the total number of documents 
in the collection.
