To move your applications to the cloud, you can migrate data from your
existing MongoDB deployments into
`MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`_. The following table
helps you choose between different tools for migrating common deployment
configurations into |service|.

.. cond:: onprem

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 45 55
   
      * - Deployment Configuration
        - Migration Strategy
   
      * - Your data is in |mms| and your network allows flexibility in
          ingress rules.
        
        - :atlas:`Pull data into Atlas </migration-live-atlas-managed>`
          from |mms|. In this type of Live Migration, |service| requires
          access to the source deployment in |mms| through
          the deployment's firewall.
   
      * - Your data is in |mms| and your network doesn't allow
          flexibility in ingress rules.
        
        - :ref:`Push your data into Atlas <migrate-to-atlas>` from |mms|.
          In this type of Live Migration, |service| receives data from
          |mms| without requiring access through the firewall.
   
      * - Your data is in MongoDB Community and your network doesn't
          allow flexibility in ingress rules.
          
        - :ref:`Push your MongoDB Community data into Atlas <migrate-community-to-atlas>`
          after adding your Community deployment to |mms|.
          In this type of Live Migration, |service| receives data from
          |mms| without requiring access through the firewall.

      

      * - Your data is in a MongoDB deployment and you don't have access
          to the :term:`oplog`.
        - Use :binary:`mongorestore <bin.mongorestore>` to run a
          self-managed migration. To learn more, see
          :atlas:`Seed with mongorestore </import/mongorestore/>`.
