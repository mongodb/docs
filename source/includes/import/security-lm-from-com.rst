|service| doesn't migrate any user or role data to the destination {+cluster+}.

If the source {+cluster+} enforced authentication, before you migrate you
must re-create the appropriate authentication mechanism used by your
applications on the destination |service| {+cluster+}. The following
table lists authentication mechanisms and how to configure them in |service|.
