     * - Field
       - Action

     * - MongoDB Deployment Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       - Toggle this slider to :guilabel:`ON`.

     * - TLS CA File Path
       - The |tls| |certauth| file is a ``.pem``-format certificate
         file that contains the root certificate chain from the
         |certauth|. The {+mdbagent+} uses this same |certauth| file
         to connect to every item in your deployment.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-PKCS8-not-supported.rst

         Type the file path to the |tls| |certauth| file on every host
         running a MongoDB process:

         - Type the file path on all Linux hosts in the first box.

         - Type the file path on all Windows hosts in the second box.

         This enables the :setting:`net.tls.CAFile` setting for the
         MongoDB processes in the project.

         Click :guilabel:`Validate` to test that each host in your
         deployment has a |tls| |certauth| at the paths you specified.

     * - Cluster TLS CA File Path
       - The :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority
         used to validate the certificate presented by a client establishing a connection.
         Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.
         :setting:`net.tls.clusterCAFile` requires that :setting:`net.tls.CAFile` is set.

         If you do not specify the :setting:`net.tls.clusterCAFile`, the cluster uses the :file:`.pem` file specified in the
         :setting:`net.tls.CAFile` option.

         :setting:`net.tls.clusterCAFile` lets you use separate Certificate
         Authorities to verify the client-to-server and server-to-client
         portions of the TLS handshake.

     * - Client Certificate Mode
       - Select if client applications or {+mdbagent+}\s must present a
         |tls| certificate when connecting to a |tls|\-enabled MongoDB
         deployments. Each MongoDB deployment checks for certificates
         from these client hosts when they try to connect. If you
         choose to require the client |tls| certificates, make sure
         they are valid.

         Accepted values are:

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 75
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Optional
              - Every client may present a valid |tls| certificate when
                connecting to MongoDB deployments. {+mdbagent+}\s might
                use |tls| certificates if you *don't* set the |mongod|
                :parameter:`tlsMode` to ``None``.

            * - Required
              - Every MongoDB deployment in this project starts with
                |tls|\-encrypted network connections. All Agents
                must use |tls| to connect to any MongoDB
                deployment.

  If you enable more than one authentication mechanism, you must specify which

  to your deployment.

  a. Select {{mechanism}}.

     |mms| creates users for the agents with the required user roles in the
     admin database for each existing deployment in |mms|. When you add a new
     deployment, |mms| creates the required users in the new deployment.

  .. important::

     You can authenticate users using LDAP, Kerberos, or X.509 certificates 
     without requiring local user documents in the ``$external`` 
     database as long as you enable LDAP authorization first. When such a user successfully
     authenticates, MongoDB performs a query against the LDAP server to
     retrieve all groups which that LDAP user possesses and transforms those
     groups into their equivalent MongoDB roles.

     MongoDB processes restart in a rolling fashion when you apply 
     these changes.

  Skip this step if you selected :guilabel:`Saslauthd` in the previous
  step.

  If you selected :guilabel:`Native LDAP Authentication`, complete the following steps:

  a. Provide the following values:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting

          - Value

        * - Server URL

          - Specify the ``hostname:port`` combination of one or more LDAP servers.

        * - Transport Security 

          - Select ``TLS`` to encrypt your LDAP queries. If you do not
            need to encrypt the LDAP queries, select ``None``.

        * - Timeout (ms)  

          - Specify how long an authentication request should wait before timing out.

        * - Bind Method  

          - Select either ``SASL`` or ``Simple``. 

            :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If you choose the ``Simple`` bind
            method, select ``TLS`` from the 
            :guilabel:`Transport Security` because the
            ``Simple`` bind method passes the password in plain text.

        * - SASL Mechanisms  

          - Specify which SASL authentication service MongoDB uses with 
            the LDAP server.

        * - Query User (LDAP Bind DN)

          - Specify the LDAP Distinguished Name to which MongoDB binds when 
            connecting to the LDAP server.

        * - Query Password (LDAP Bind DN)

          - Specify the password with which MongoDB binds when connecting to an 
            LDAP server.

        * - New Query Password (LDAP Bind DN)
        
          - (Optional). Use this field if you want to rotate the LDAP password.
            Specify the new password with which MongoDB will bind when
            connecting to an LDAP server. Specifying a new password in
            this field allows you to smoothly rotate the query password.

            .. important::

               After you rotate the password on the LDAP server side,
               move the contents of the :guilabel:`New Query Password`
               field into the :guilabel:`Query Password` field and make
               the :guilabel:`New Query Password` field empty.

        * - LDAP User Cache Invalidation Interval (s)  

          - Specify how long MongoDB waits to flush the LDAP user cache.
            Defaults to ``30`` seconds.

        * - User to Distinguished Name Mapping

          - Specify an array of JSON documents that provide the ordered
            transformation(s) MongoDB performs on the authenticated MongoDB
            usernames. MongoDB then matches the transformed username 
            against the LDAP DNs.

        * - Validate LDAP Server Config

          - Select ``ON`` to validate the LDAP server configuration
            or ``OFF`` to skip validation.

            If ``ON`` and the configuration is invalid, the MongoDB
            deployment will not start.

  #. In the :guilabel:`LDAP Authorization` section, enter values for the
     following fields:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting

          - Value

        * - :guilabel:`LDAP Authorization`

          - Toggle to :guilabel:`ON` to enable LDAP authorization.

        * - :guilabel:`Authorization Query Template`

          - Specify a template for an LDAP
            query URL to retrieve a list of LDAP groups for an LDAP 
            user.

        * - :guilabel:`User to Distinguished Name Mapping`

          - Specify an array of JSON documents that provide the ordered
            transformation(s) MongoDB performs on the authenticated MongoDB
            usernames. MongoDB then matches the transformed username 
            against the LDAP DNs.
