Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
perform **bulk operations**.

Bulk operations perform multiple write operations against one or more
collections within a database. In MongoDB, you refer to a collection by combining
the database name and the collection name in the format ``<database>.<collection>``. 

Bulk operations help reduce the number of calls to the server. Instead of sending
a request for each operation, you can perform multiple operations within one action.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`node-bulk-sample-data` presents the sample data that is used by the
  bulk operation examples.
- :ref:`node-bulk-operation-types` describes how to use different bulk operation 
  types to perform bulk insert, replace, update, and delete operations.
- :ref:`node-bulk-return-type` describes the return object that results from your
  bulk write operations.
- :ref:`node-bulk-handle-exceptions` describes the exceptions that occur if 
  any of the operations in a bulk write operation fail.
- :ref:`node-bulk-addtl-info` provides links to resources and API documentation for
  types and methods mentioned in this guide.

.. important::

   To perform bulk write operations, ensure that your application meets the
   following requirements:

   - You are connected to MongoDB Server version 3.2 or later.
   - You are using {+driver-short+} version 3.6 or later.

.. _node-bulk-sample-data:

Sample data
-----------

The examples in this guide use the following sample documents, which are stored
in the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-sample-data
   :end-before: end-sample-data 

.. _node-bulk-operation-types:

Bulk Operation Types
--------------------

Insert
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk insert operation, create a bulk operation object for each document
you want to insert. Then, pass a list of these operations to the ``bulkWrite()``
method.

The following table describes the fields of the bulk operation object for an insert
operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``insertOne`` 
     - | This represents an insert operation.
       | Type: ``Operation``

   * - ``document`` 
     - | The document to insert.
       | Type: ``Document``

.. _bulk-insert-docs-example:

Insert Documents Example
````````````````````````
This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies four ``InsertOneModel`` instances in an array. Each ``InsertOneModel`` 
  represents a document to be inserted into the ``movies`` collection within the
  ``db`` databse. 
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.
- Prints the number of inserted documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-insert
      :end-before: end-insert
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted documents: 4

.. _node-bulk-replace-operation:

Replace
~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` object for 
each document you want to replace. Then, pass a list of models to the ``bulkWrite()``
method. 

The following table describes ``ReplaceOneModel`` fields that you can set by calling
their corresponding builder methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches the document you want to replace.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``replacement`` 
     - | The replacement document.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more 
         about collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``String`` or ``Object``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``Bson``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
       | By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``Boolean``

Replace Documents Example
`````````````````````````
This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies two ``ReplaceOneModel`` instances in an array. The ``ReplaceOneModel`` 
  instances contain instructions to replace documents representing movies in the
  ``movies`` collection.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.
- Prints the number of modified documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-replace
      :end-before: end-replace
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Modified documents: 2

.. _node-bulk-update-operation:

Update
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or ``UpdateManyModel``
instance for each update you want to make. Then, pass an array of these models to the 
``bulkWrite()`` method. An ``UpdateOneModel`` updates only one document that 
matches a filter, while an ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all documents that match 
a filter.

The following table describes the fields you can set for ``UpdateOneModel`` and 
``UpdateManyModel`` fields that you can set:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to update. When 
         specified in an ``UpdateOneModel``, only the first matching document will 
         be updated. When specified in an ``UpdateManyModel``, all matching documents
         will be updated.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``update`` 
     - | The update to perform.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``arrayFilters`` 
     - | (Optional) A set of filters specifying which array elements an update 
         applies to if you are updating an array-valued field.
       | Type: ``Array``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about 
         collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Object``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``String or Object``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
         By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``Boolean``

Update Documents Example
````````````````````````

This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies an ``UpdateOneModel`` and an ``UpdateManyModel`` instance in an array. 
  These models contain instructions to update documents representing movies in the
  ``movies`` collection.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.
- Prints the number of modified documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-update
      :end-before: end-update
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Modified documents: 2

.. _node-bulk-delete-operation:

Delete
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or ``DeleteManyModel``
instance for each delete operation. Then, pass an array of these models to the 
``bulkWrite()`` method. A ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes only one document that matches
a filter, while a ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all documents that match a filter.

The following table describes the fields you can set for ``DeleteOneModel`` and 
``DeleteManyModel``:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to delete. When 
         specified in a ``DeleteOneModel``, only the first matching document will
         be deleted. When specified in a ``DeleteManyModel``, all matching documents
         will be deleted.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about 
         collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Object``

     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``String or Object``

Delete Documents Example
````````````````````````

This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies a ``DeleteOneModel`` and a ``DeleteManyModel`` instance in an array. 
  These models contain instructions to delete documents representing movies in the
  ``movies`` collection.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.
- Prints the number of deleted documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-delete
      :end-before: end-delete
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Deleted documents: 2

.. _node-bulk-return-type:

Return Type
-----------

The ``bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` object, which provides
information about your bulk operation.

The ``BulkWriteResult`` object has the following fields:

- ``insertedCount``: the number of inserted documents
- ``matchedCount``: the number of matched documents
- ``modifiedCount``: the number of updated documents
- ``upsertedCount``: the number of upserted documents
- ``deletedCount``: the number of deleted documents

.. _node-bulk-handle-exceptions:

Handling Exceptions
-------------------

If any of the operations in a bulk write operation fail, the Node.js driver throws
a ``MongoBulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations if the 
``ordered`` option is set to ``true``. If ``ordered`` is set to ``false``, it will
attempt to continue with subsequent operations.

A ``MongoBulkWriteError`` object contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``message`` 
     - | The error message. 
       | Type: ``String``

   * - ``writeErrors`` 
     - | An array of errors that occured during the bulk write operation.
       | Type: ``BulkWriteError[]``

   * - ``writeConcernErrors`` 
     - | Write concern errors that occured during execution of the bulk write operation.
       | Type: ``WriteConnectionError[]``   

   * - ``result`` 
     - | The results of any successful operations performed before the exception was 
         thrown.
       | Type: ``BulkWriteResult[]``   

   * - ``err`` 
     - | The underlying error object, which may contain more details.
       | Type: ``Error``
