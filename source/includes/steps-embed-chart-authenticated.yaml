title: (*Optional*) Specify a filter function to inject per user.
ref:
level: 4
content: |
   You can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for
   each user who views the chart. The function has access to your
   Embedding Authentication Provider's token via ``context.token``, and
   can filter the chart data based on the token.

   This filter ensures that viewers of an embedded chart see only their
   own data, which is useful when embedding charts with potentially
   sensitive information.

   .. example::

      The following filter function only renders data where the
      ``ownerId`` field of a document matches the value of
      the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's ``sub`` field:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         function getFilter(context) {
           return { ownerId: context.token.sub };
         }

title: (*Optional*) Specify filterable fields for your chart.
ref: authenticated-filterable-fields
level: 4
content: |
   Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By
   default, no fields are whitelisted, meaning the chart cannot be
   filtered until you explicitly whitelist at least one field.

   To learn more about filterable fields, see
   :ref:`specify-filter-fields`.

title: Copy the :guilabel:`Chart ID` and :guilabel:`Chart Base URL`

   Use these values in your application code together with your
   Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart.
