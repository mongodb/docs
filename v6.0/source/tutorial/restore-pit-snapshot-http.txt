Restore from a Specific Point-in-Time

To restore a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` using |http|, |mms|
creates and displays a download link to the appropriate
snapshot in snapshot storage.

After clicking the download link, |mms| streams the snapshot to the
target snapshot host.

.. note::

   PIT restores include points in time and oplog timestamps. |pit|
   restores include checkpoints for sharded clusters running |fcv-link|
   of 4.0 or earlier.

Considerations
--------------

- The |mms| point-in-time restore might have oplog gaps in some
  situations such as the following:

  - If the oplog tailing stops because of an issue with :term:`backup
    job <backup job>` tailing the oplog and the oplog rolls over before
    {+mdbagent+} tails it again.

  - After a topology change until |mms| completes a new snapshot.

  - After the |fcv| change, which causes a gap between the time |mms| detects
    the |fcv| change and |mms| completes a new snapshot. You can't apply a
    point-in-time restore across MongoDB version changes.

  - After a restore until |mms| completes a new snapshot.

- If there is an oplog gap after |mms| takes the latest snapshot, then a
  point-in-time restore fails if the restore time selected is after
  the oplog gap began and before the next snapshot. Once |mms| takes the
  next snapshot, you can use point-in-time restore as normal from that
  snapshot time onward.

- You only see oplog gaps when you attempt and fail a point-in-time
  restore.

- You can request a point-in-time restore to a specific point in time
  that includes stale data.

Procedure
---------

1. The user selects a timestamp:

   - Through the |mms| application:

     1. Click on a timestamp.
     #. Submit their request.

   - Through the :doc:`API </reference/api/restorejobs/get-one-single-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`:

     1. Find the cluster to restore.
     #. :doc:`Create new Restore Job </reference/api/restorejobs/create-one-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`
        for that cluster.

#. |mms| creates a RestoreJob document.

#. |mms| sets the RestoreJob document status to
   :guilabel:`Transferring...` and starts streaming the
   :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` in the requested format from the
   :opsmgr:`snapshot store </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot-store>` to |mms|. Each
   Snapshot Store streams its snapshot components through |mms|:

   a. A :term:`blockstore <backup blockstore database>` streams
      blocks.
   #. A :opsmgr:`S3 snapshot store </reference/glossary/#std-term-S3-snapshot-store>` streams the blocks.

#. With the status set to :guilabel:`Waiting for Customer...`, |mms|
   creates a |url|.

#. The user clicks the :guilabel:`get link` link, then
   :guilabel:`Download` in the |mms| application to download the
   :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`.

#. The user downloads the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility from the |mms|
   application to the target snapshot host.

   .. note::
      
      The |mbru| can be used with any restore. If the utility is
      installed on the host where you want to restore the snapshot, the
      user doesn't need to download it again.

#. The user starts a temporary MongoDB instance on the target snapshot
   host. The fetched :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` is applied to the snapshot restored
   to this instance.

#. The user runs the |mbru| to request the :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>`.

#. The |mbru| fetches the oplog for the point-in-time snapshot.

#. The |mbru| applies the oplog to snapshot in the temporary MongoDB
   instance.

#. The user exports the restored database from the temporary MongoDB
   instance.
