To reverse the direction of a sync operation, use the following
procedure to :ref:`commit your sync <c2c-cutover-process>` and call the
``reverse`` endpoint. 

Reversing sync allows you to keep clusters in continuous sync after you
commit. After you commit a sync, you can't resume continuous sync between
two clusters since ``mongosync`` can only sync into empty destination
clusters. If you need to use the same two clusters after cutover, you
can call the ``reverse`` endpoint to keep the clusters in sync.

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you can reverse your sync direction, you must configure
``mongosync`` and use the :ref:`c2c-api-start` endpoint to set the
following parameters:

- ``reversible`` to ``true``
- ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``.

For more information on limitations and requirements of reversing sync,
see :ref:`c2c-api-reverse`. 

.. important:: 

   If you are migrating from a pre-6.0 source cluster, you cannot reverse sync.

Steps
-----

Use these steps to reverse the direction of your sync:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Finalize your sync.

      Follow the :ref:`c2c-cutover-process` tutorial to enable write
      blocking and finalize your data migration. 

      :gold:`IMPORTANT:` ``mongosync`` does not support
      :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync` during the reverse sync process. 

   .. step:: Call the ``reverse`` endpoint.
   
      Call the ``reverse`` endpoint to reverse the direction of your sync 
      operation. Your original source cluster becomes your new destination cluster 
      and your original destination cluster becomes your new source cluster. 
      
      ``mongosync`` replicates all writes that you performed on your new
      source cluster after you unblocked writes (during step 4 of the
      :ref:`c2c-cutover-process`) to the
      new destination cluster.
