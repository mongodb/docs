New API for Independent Shard Scaling (v20240805)
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting with API resource version 20240805 of the :ref:`Atlas Admin API <api-versioning-overview>`,
you can now independently scale the {+cluster+} tier for each shard of a :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>`.

.. warning::

   The new API version is a breaking change that irreversabily changes the state of your {+cluster+}.
   If you use the new API to independently scale the {+cluster+} tier of the shards in your sharded {+cluster+},
   you won't be able to use previous symmetrical-only |api| versions to manage that {+cluster+}.

This new API version is a significant change to the underlying scaling model of |service| {+Clusters+}.
The new API is capable of describing asymmetric {+clusters+}, where each shard has different configurations.
The ``replicationSpec.numShards`` field is not present in the new API schema.
Each shard *must* be specified as a separate element of the ``replicationSpecs``,
even for symmetric {+clusters+} in which all shards are configured the same.
