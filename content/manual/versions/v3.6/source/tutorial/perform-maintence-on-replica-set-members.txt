Overview
--------

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` allow a MongoDB deployment to
remain available during the majority of a maintenance window.

This document outlines the basic procedure for performing maintenance on
each of the members of a replica set. Furthermore, this particular
sequence strives to minimize the amount of time that the
:term:`primary` is unavailable and control the impact on the
entire deployment.

Use these steps as the basis for common replica set operations,
particularly for procedures such as :doc:`upgrading to the latest
version of MongoDB </tutorial/upgrade-revision>`.

Procedure
---------

For each member of a replica set, starting with a secondary member,
perform the following sequence of events, ending with the primary:

- Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a standalone.

- Perform the task on the standalone instance.

- Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a member of the replica
  set.
