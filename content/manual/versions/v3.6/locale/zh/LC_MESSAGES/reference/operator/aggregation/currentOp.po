"Returns a stream of documents containing information on active and/or "

":pipeline:`$currentOp` offers a better alternative to the "
":dbcommand:`currentOp` command and the :method:`db.currentOp` method. The"
" latter two commands are limited to returning all operations in a single "

":pipeline:`$currentOp` pipelines return a cursor, they are not subject to"
" these limitations."
