   :description: Learn how to count documents in a collection by using the MongoDB Node.js Driver, with methods for both estimated and accurate counts.

The Node.js driver provides two methods for counting documents in a
collection:

- `collection.countDocuments() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#countDocuments>`__ returns the number of documents in
  the collection that match the specified query. If you specify an empty
  query document, ``countDocuments()`` returns the total number of
  documents in the collection.

- `collection.estimatedDocumentCount() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#estimatedDocumentCount>`__ returns an
  **estimation** of the number of documents in the collection based on
  collection metadata.

``estimatedDocumentCount()`` is faster than ``countDocuments()`` because
the estimation uses the collection's metadata rather than scanning the
collection. In contrast, ``countDocuments()`` takes longer to return, but
provides an **accurate** count of the number of documents and supports
specifying a filter. Choose the appropriate method for your workload.

To specify which documents you wish to count, ``countDocuments()``
accepts a :doc:`query </fundamentals/crud/query-document>` parameter.
``countDocuments()`` counts the documents that match the specified query.

``countDocuments()`` and ``estimatedDocumentCount()`` support optional
settings that affect the method's execution. Refer to the reference
documentation for each method for more information.

.. tip::

   You can improve performance when using ``countDocuments()`` to return the
   total number of documents in a collection by avoiding a collection scan. To
   do this, use a :manual:`hint </reference/method/cursor.hint>` to take
   advantage of the built-in index on the ``_id`` field. Use this technique only
   when calling ``countDocuments()`` with an empty query parameter.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      collection.countDocuments({}, { hint: "_id_" });

Example
-------

The following example estimates the number of documents in the
``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database, and then returns
an accurate count of the number of documents in the ``movies``
collection with ``Canada`` in the ``countries`` field.

.. note:: Identical Code Snippets

   The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no
   TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case.

Running the preceding sample code, you see the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Estimated number of documents in the movies collection: 23541
   Number of movies from Canada: 1349
