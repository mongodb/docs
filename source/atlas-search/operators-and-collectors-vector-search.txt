Operators
---------

The ``$search`` aggregation pipeline stage has the following operators:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>`
     - Performs a search-as-you-type query from an incomplete input string.

   * - :ref:`compound <compound-ref>`
     - Combines other operators into a single query.

   * - :ref:`embeddedDocument <embedded-document-ref>`
     - Queries fields in embedded documents, which are documents that 
       are elements of an array.

   * - :ref:`equals <equals-ref>`
     - Works in conjunction with the :ref:`boolean <boolean-ref>` and 
       :ref:`objectId <objectId-ref>` data types.

   * - :ref:`exists <exists-ref>`
     - Tests for the presence of a specified field.

   * - :ref:`geoShape <geoshape-ref>`
     - Queries for values with specified geo shapes.

   * - :ref:`geoWithin <geowithin-ref>`
     - Queries for points within specified geographic shapes.

   * - :ref:`knnBeta <knn-beta-ref>`
     - Performs vector search using :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest neighbors)` 
       algorithm.

   * - :ref:`moreLikeThis <more-like-this-ref>`
     - Queries for similar documents.

   * - :ref:`near <near-ref>`
     - Queries for values near a specified :ref:`number
       <bson-data-types-number>`, :ref:`date <bson-data-types-date>`, or
       :ref:`geo point <bson-data-types-geo>`.

   * - :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>`
     - Searches documents for terms in an order similar to the query.

   * - :ref:`queryString <querystring-ref>`
     - Supports querying a combination of indexed fields and values.

   * - :ref:`range <range-ref>`
     - Queries for values within a specific numeric or date range.

   * - :ref:`regex <regex-ref>`
     - Interprets the ``query`` field as a regular expression.

   * - :ref:`search <search-ref>`
     - **Deprecated.** Performs analyzed search. Use :ref:`text 
       <text-ref>` operator instead.

   * - :ref:`span <span-ref>`
     - Specifies relative positional requirements for query predicates
       within specified regions of a text field.

   * - :ref:`term <term-ref>`
     - **Deprecated.** Performs unanalyzed search. 

   * - :ref:`text <text-ref>`
     - Performs textual analyzed search.

   * - :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-ref>`
     - Supports special characters in the query string that can match 
       any character.

Collectors
----------

Collectors return a document representing the metadata :ref:`results 
<fts-metadata-results>`, typically an aggregation over the matching 
search results. 

The |fts| aggregation pipeline stage has the following collector:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :ref:`facet <fts-facet-ref>`
     - Groups query results by values or ranges in specified, faceted 
       fields and returns the count for each of those groups.
