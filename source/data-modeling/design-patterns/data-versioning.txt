Your schema may need to change over time to account for changing
technical requirements. When your schema changes, you can use schema
design patterns to retain your original document structure. By retaining
historical versions of documents and schemas, you avoid
performance-intensive schema migrations and downtime.

Use Cases
---------

Versioning patterns are useful when your data requirements change and
you want to keep historical data in its original form. For example:

- An insurance company lets customers modify their policy to insure
  additional items. When a customer changes their policy, the insurance
  company keeps a record of the policy changes over time. The company
  uses the **Document Versioning** pattern to track policy revisions by
  storing each update in a separate document. Historical data is stored
  in a separate collection, and does not impact queries on current data.

- A company stores customer contact information. In the original schema,
  various contact methods like ``homePhone``, ``cellPhone``, and
  ``email`` are stored in individual fields. Over time, fewer customers
  have ``homePhone`` numbers, so the company modifies the schema to move
  contact information to a generic ``contacts`` document, which has
  variable subfields. After the schema change, the company implements
  the **Schema Versioning** pattern, and adds a ``schemaVersion`` field
  to tell the application how it should query each document.
