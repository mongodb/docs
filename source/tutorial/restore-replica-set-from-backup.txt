   :description: Restore a replica set from backups by seeding test deployments or for disaster recovery, using efficient procedures to deploy restored data.

This procedure outlines the process for taking MongoDB data and
restoring that data into a new :term:`replica set`. Use this approach
for seeding test deployments from production backups or as part
of disaster recovery.

.. important::
   You *cannot* restore a single data set to three new :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances and **then** create a replica set. If you copy the data set
   to each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and then create the replica set,
   MongoDB will force the secondaries to perform an :term:`initial
   sync`. The procedures in this document describe the correct and
   efficient ways to deploy a restored replica set.

You can also use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to restore database files
using data created with :binary:`~bin.mongodump`. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools` for more information.

.. _restore-add-members:

Add Members to the Replica Set
------------------------------

MongoDB provides two options for restoring secondary members of a
replica set:

- :ref:`Manually copy the database files <restore-rs-copy-db-files>`
  to each data directory.

- :ref:`Allow initial sync <restore-rs-initial-sync>` to distribute
  data automatically.

.. note::

   If your database is large, initial sync can take a long time to
   complete. For large databases, it might be preferable to copy the
   database files onto each host.


.. _restore-rs-copy-db-files:

Copy Database Files and Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data by copying MongoDB data
files directly.

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-secondary-from-backup-directly.rst

.. _restore-rs-initial-sync:

Update Secondaries using Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data using the default :ref:`initial
sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` operation.
