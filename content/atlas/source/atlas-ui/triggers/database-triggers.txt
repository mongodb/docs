Database Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic whenever a database
change occurs on a linked MongoDB |service| cluster. You can configure Triggers on
individual collections, entire databases, and on an entire cluster.

Unlike SQL data triggers, which run on the database server, |service| database
Triggers run on a serverless compute layer that scales independently of the
database server. Triggers automatically call |service|
:ref:`Functions <atlas-functions>` and can forward events to external handlers
through {+aws+} EventBridge.

Use database Triggers to implement event-driven data interactions. For
example, you can automatically update information in one document when a
related document changes or send a request to an external service
whenever a new document is inserted.

Database Triggers use MongoDB :manual:`change streams </changeStreams>`
to watch for real-time changes in a collection. A change stream is a
series of :ref:`database events <atlas-database-events>` that each
describe an operation on a document in the collection. Your app opens a
single change stream for each collection with at least one enabled
Trigger. If you enable multiple Triggers for a collection they all
share the same change stream.

.. important:: Change Stream Limitations

   There are limits on the total number of change streams you can open
   on a cluster, depending on the cluster's size. For more information, see
   :ref:`change stream limitations <atlas-service-limitations-change-streams>`.

   Additionally, you cannot define a database Trigger on a
   {+Flex-Cluster+} or {+fdi+} because they do not support change streams.

You control which operations cause a Trigger to fire as well as what
happens when it does. For example, you can run a Function whenever a
specific field of a document is updated. The Function can access the
entire change event, so you always know what changed. You can also pass
the change event to :ref:`AWS EventBridge <aws-eventbridge>` to handle
the event outside of |service|.

Triggers support :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match>`
expressions to filter change events and :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>`
expressions to limit the data included in each event.

.. _atlas-trigger-recursion:

.. warning::

   In deployment and database level Triggers, it is possible to configure Triggers
   in a way that causes other Triggers to fire, resulting in recursion.
   Examples include a database-level Trigger writing to a collection within the
   same database, or a cluster-level logger or log forwarder writing logs to
   another database in the same cluster.

Configuration
-------------

Database Triggers have the following configuration options:

Trigger Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within the :guilabel:`Trigger Details` section, you can select the scope that you want the Trigger to
:guilabel:`Watch Against`, based on the level of granularity you want. Your
options are:

- :guilabel:`Collection`, when a change occurs on a specified collection
- :guilabel:`Database`, when a change occurs on any collection in a
  specified database
- :guilabel:`Deployment`, when deployment changes occur on a specified
  cluster.

  If you select the Deployment source type, the following
  databases are *not watched* for changes:

  - The admin databases ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config``
  - The sync databases ``__realm_sync`` and ``__realm_sync_<app_id>``

  .. important::

     The deployment-level source type is only available on dedicated tiers.

Depending on which source type you are using, the additional options differ. The
following table describes these options.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Source Type
     - Options

   * - :guilabel:`Collection`
     - |

       - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`. The name of the MongoDB cluster that the
         Trigger is associated with.

       - :guilabel:`Database Name`. The MongoDB database that contains the watched
         collection.

       - :guilabel:`Collection Name`. The MongoDB collection to watch. Optional.
         If you leave this option blank, the Source Type changes to "Database."

       - :guilabel:`Operation Type`. The :ref:`operation types
         <atlas-database-event-operation-types>` that cause the Trigger to fire.
         Select the operation types you want the Trigger to respond to. Options
         include:

         - Insert
         - Update
         - Replace
         - Delete

         **Note:** Update operations executed from MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB |service|
         Data Explorer fully replace the previous document. As a result,
         update operations from these clients generate ``Replace``
         change events rather than ``Update`` events.

       - :guilabel:`Full Document`. If enabled, ``Update`` change events include
         the latest :manual:`majority-committed </reference/read-concern-majority/>`
         version of the modified document *after* the change was applied in
         the ``fullDocument`` field.

         .. include:: /includes/triggers/note-full-document.rst

       - :guilabel:`Document Preimage`. When enabled, change events include a
         copy of the modified document from immediately *before* the change was
         applied in the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` field. This has
         :ref:`performance considerations <atlas-pre-image-perf>`. All change events
         except for ``Insert`` events include the document preimage.

         If you leave this option blank, the source type changes to ``Deployment``
         unless you are on a shared tier, in which case |service| will not
         let you save the Trigger.

       - :guilabel:`Operation Type`. The :ref:`operation types
         <atlas-database-event-operation-types>` that cause the Trigger to fire.
         Select the operation types you want the  Trigger to respond to.
         Options include:

.. _atlas-pre-image-perf:

.. tip:: Preimages and Performance Optimization

   Preimages require additional storage overhead that may affect
   performance. If you're not using preimages on a collection,
   you should disable preimages. To learn more, see :ref:`Disable
   Collection-Level Preimages
   <atlas-database-triggers-disable-collection-level-preimages>`.

   Document preimages are supported on non-sharded |service| clusters running
   MongoDB 4.4+, and on sharded |service| clusters running MongoDB 5.3 and later.
   You can upgrade a non-sharded cluster (with preimages) to a
   sharded cluster, as long as the cluster is running 5.3 or later.

   * - :guilabel:`Auto-Resume`

     - .. include:: /includes/triggers/trigger-auto-resume.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Event Ordering`
     - If enabled, Trigger events are processed in the order in which they occur.
       If disabled, events can be processed in parallel, which is faster when
       many events occur at the same time.

       If event ordering is enabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur
       sequentially based on the timestamps of the change events. If event ordering is
       disabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur independently.

       **Tip:** To improve performance for Triggers that respond to bulk database
       operations, :ref:`disable event
       ordering.<atlas-database-triggers-disable-event-ordering>`

   * - :guilabel:`Skip Events On Re-Enable`
     - Disabled by default. If enabled, any change events that occurred while this
       Trigger was disabled will not be processed.

Event Type
~~~~~~~~~~

Within the :guilabel:`Event Type` section, you choose what action is taken when
the Trigger fires. You can choose to run a :ref:`Function <atlas-functions>` or use
:ref:`AWS EventBridge <atlas-aws-eventbridge>`.

Advanced

Within the :guilabel:`Advanced` section, the following *optional* configuration
options are available:

     - .. include:: /includes/triggers/trigger-match-expression.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Maximum Throughput`

     - .. _atlas-triggers-maximum-throughput:

       If the linked data source is a dedicated server (M10+ Tier),
       you can increase the :ref:`maximum throughput <atlas-event_processing_throughput>`
       beyond the default 10,000 concurrent processes.

       **Important:** To enable maximum throughput, you must disable Event Ordering.

       Before increasing the maximum throughput, consider whether one or more of
       your Triggers are calling a rate-limited external API. Increasing the
       Trigger rate might result in exceeding those limits.

       Increasing the throughput may also add a larger workload, affecting
       overall cluster performance.

.. _atlas-database-events:

Change Event Types
------------------

.. _atlas-database-event-operation-types:

Database change events represent individual changes in a specific
collection of your linked MongoDB |service| cluster.

Every database event has the same operation type and structure as the
:manual:`change event </reference/change-events/>` object that was
emitted by the underlying change stream. Change events have the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 15

   * - Operation Type
     - Description

   * - **Insert Document** (All Trigger types)
     - Represents a new document added to the collection.

   * - **Update Document** (All Trigger types)
     - Represents a change to an existing document in the collection.

   * - **Delete Document** (All Trigger types)
     - Represents a document deleted from the collection.

   * - **Replace Document** (All Trigger types)
     - Represents a new document that replaced a document in the collection.

   * - **Create Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents the creation of a new collection.

   * - **Modify Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents the modification collection.

   * - **Rename Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents collection being renamed.

   * - **Drop Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents a collection being dropped.

   * - **Shard Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents a collection changing from unsharded to sharded.

   * - **Reshard Collection** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents a change to a collection's sharding.

   * - **Refine Collection Shard Key** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents a change in the shard key of a collection.

   * - **Create Indexes** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents the creation of a new index.

   * - **Drop Indexes** (Database and Deployment Trigger types only)
     - Represents an index being dropped.

   * - **Drop Database** (Deployment Trigger type only)
     - Represents a database being dropped.

Database change event objects have the following general form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      _id : <ObjectId>,
      "operationType": <string>,
      "fullDocument": <document>,
      "fullDocumentBeforeChange": <document>,
      "ns": {
         "db" : <string>,
         "coll" : <string>
      },
      "documentKey": {
        "_id": <ObjectId>
      },
      "updateDescription": <document>,
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>
   }

Database Trigger Example
------------------------

An online store wants to notify its customers whenever one of their
orders changes location. They record each order in the ``store.orders``
collection as a document that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     _id: ObjectId("59cf1860a95168b8f685e378"),
     customerId: ObjectId("59cf17e1a95168b8f685e377"),
     orderDate: ISODate("2018-06-26T16:20:42.313Z"),
     shipDate: ISODate("2018-06-27T08:20:23.311Z"),
     orderContents: [
       { qty: 1, name: "Earl Grey Tea Bags - 100ct", price: NumberDecimal("10.99") }
     ],
     shippingLocation: [
       { location: "Memphis", time: ISODate("2018-06-27T18:22:33.243Z") },
     ]
   }

To automate this process, the store creates a database Trigger that
listens for ``Update`` change events in the ``store.orders`` collection.
When the Trigger observes an ``Update`` event, it passes the
:ref:`change event object <atlas-database-events>` to its associated Function,
``textShippingUpdate``. The Function checks the change event for any
changes to the ``shippingLocation`` field and, if it was updated, sends
a text message to the customer with the new location of the order.

.. _atlas-suspended_triggers:
.. _atlas-resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Suspended Triggers
------------------

Database Triggers may enter a suspended state in response to an event
that prevents the Trigger's change stream from continuing. Events that
can suspend a Trigger include:

- :manual:`invalidate events </reference/change-events/#invalidate-event>`
  such as ``dropDatabase``, ``renameCollection``, or those caused by
  a network disruption.

- the **resume token** required to resume the change stream is no longer in the
  cluster :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`. The App logs
  refer to this as a ``ChangeStreamHistoryLost`` error.

- a ``$match`` stage filters out an oplog entry containing the resume token from the
  oplog. The next matching event will not have the resume token, so the Trigger
  cannot resume.

In the event of a suspended or failed Trigger, |service| sends the
project owner an email alerting them of the issue.

.. _atlas-automatically-resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Automatically Resume a Suspended Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a Trigger to automatically resume if the Trigger was suspended
because the resume token is no longer in the oplog.
The Trigger does not process any missed change stream events between
when the resume token is lost and when the resume process completes.

When :ref:`creating or updating a Database Trigger
<atlas-create-a-database-trigger>` in the {+atlas-ui+}:

a. Navigate to the configuration page of the Trigger you want to automatically
   resume if suspended.

#. In the :guilabel:`Advanced (Optional)` section, select :guilabel:`Auto-Resume
   Triggers`.

#. Save and deploy the changes.

.. _atlas-manually-resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Manually Resume a Suspended Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you manually resume a suspended Trigger, your App attempts to resume the Trigger
at the next change stream event after the change stream stopped.
If the resume token is no longer in the cluster oplog, the Trigger
must be started without a resume token. This means the Trigger begins
listening to new events but does not process any missed past events.

You can adjust the oplog size to keep the resume token for more time after
a suspension by :atlas:`scaling your |service| cluster </scale-cluster/>`.
Maintain an oplog size a few times greater than
your cluster's peak oplog throughput (GB/hour) to reduce the risk of a
suspended Trigger's resume token dropping off the oplog
before the Trigger executes.
View your cluster's oplog throughput in the **Oplog GB/Hour** graph in the
:atlas:`|service| cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics/>`.

You can restart a suspended Trigger from the {+atlas-ui+} or with the App Services CLI.

            On the :guilabel:`Triggers` page, find the Trigger that you want to
            disable in the list of Triggers. |service| marks suspended Triggers

            :manual:`resume token </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>` or
            open a new change stream.

            Indicate whether or not to use a resume token, then click :guilabel:`Resume Database Trigger`.

            **Note:** If you use a :manual:`resume token
            </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>`, |service|
            attempts to resume the Trigger's underlying change
            stream at the event immediately following the last
            change event it processed. If successful, the Trigger
            processes any events that occurred while it was
            suspended. If you do not use a resume token, the
            Trigger begins listening for new events but will not
            fire for any events that occurred while it was
            suspended.

         .. step:: Verify the Trigger Configuration File Exists

            If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already
            include an up-to-date configuration file for the suspended Trigger.
            You can confirm that the configuration file exists by looking
            in the ``/triggers`` directory for a :ref:`Trigger configuration file
            <config-database-trigger>` with the same name as the Trigger.

         .. step:: Redeploy the Trigger

            After you have verified that the Trigger configuration file exists,
            push the configuration back to your app. App Services
            automatically attempts to resume any suspended Triggers included
            in the deployment.

.. _atlas-last-cluster-time-processed:

Trigger Time Reporting
----------------------

The list of Triggers in the {+atlas-ui+} shows three timestamps:

**Last Modified**

This is the time the Trigger was created or most recently changed.

**Latest Heartbeat**

|service| keeps track of the last time a Trigger was run. If the Trigger
is not sending any events, the server sends a heartbeat to ensure the Trigger's
resume token stays fresh. Whichever event is most recent is shown as the
:guilabel:`Latest Heartbeat`.

**Last Cluster Time Processed**

|service| also keeps track of the :guilabel:`Last Cluster Time Processed`,
which is the last time the change stream backing a Trigger emitted an event. It
will be older than the :guilabel:`Latest Heartbeat` if there have been no events
since the most recent heartbeat.

Performance Optimization
------------------------

.. _atlas-database-triggers-disable-event-ordering:

Disable Event Ordering for Burst Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider disabling event ordering if your Trigger fires on a collection that
receives short bursts of events (e.g. inserting data as part of a daily batch
job).

Ordered Triggers wait to execute a Function for a particular event until
the Functions of previous events have finished executing. As a
consequence, ordered Triggers are effectively rate-limited by the run
time of each sequential Trigger Function. This may cause a significant
delay between the database event appearing on the change stream and the
Trigger firing. In certain extreme cases, database events might fall off
the oplog before a long-running ordered Trigger processes them.

Unordered Triggers execute Functions in parallel if possible, which can be
significantly faster (depending on your use case) but does not guarantee that
multiple executions of a Trigger Function occur in event order.

.. _atlas-database-triggers-disable-collection-level-preimages:

Disable Collection-Level Preimages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Document preimages require your cluster to record additional data about
each operation on a collection. Once you enable preimages for any
Trigger on a collection, your cluster stores preimages for every
operation on the collection.

The additional storage space and compute overhead may degrade Trigger
performance depending on your cluster configuration.

To avoid the storage and compute overhead of preimages, you must disable
preimages for the entire underlying MongoDB collection. This is a
separate setting from any individual Trigger's preimage setting.

If you disable collection-level preimages, then no active Trigger on
that collection can use preimages. However, if you delete or disable all
preimage Triggers on a collection, then you can also disable
collection-level preimages.

To learn how, see :ref:`Disable Preimages for a Collection
<disable-collection-preimages>`.

.. _atlas-database-triggers-match-expression:

Use Match Expressions to Limit Trigger Invocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can limit the number of Trigger invocations by specifying a :manual:`$match
</reference/operator/aggregation/match>` expression in the :guilabel:`Match
Expression` field. |service| evaluates the match expression against the
change event document and invokes the Trigger only if the expression evaluates
to true for the given change event.

The match expression is a JSON document that specifies the query conditions
using the :manual:`MongoDB read query syntax </reference/operator/query/>`.

We recommend only using match expressions when the volume of Trigger events
measurably becomes a performance issue. Until then, receive all events and
handle them individually in the Trigger Function code.

The exact shape of the change event document depends on the event that caused
the Trigger to fire. For details, see the reference for each event type:

- :manual:`insert </reference/change-events/insert>`
- :manual:`update </reference/change-events/update>`
- :manual:`replace </reference/change-events/replace>`
- :manual:`delete </reference/change-events/delete>`
- :manual:`create </reference/change-events/create>`
- :manual:`modify </reference/change-events/modify>`
- :manual:`rename </reference/change-events/rename>`
- :manual:`drop </reference/change-events/drop>`
- :manual:`shardCollection </reference/change-events/shardCollection>`
- :manual:`reshardCollection </reference/change-events/reshardCollection>`
- :manual:`refineCollectionShardKey </reference/change-events/refineCollectionShardKey>`
- :manual:`dropDatabase </reference/change-events/dropDatabase>`

The following match expression allows the Trigger to fire
only if the change event object specifies that the ``status`` field in
a document changed.

``updateDescription`` is a field of the :manual:`update Event object </reference/change-events/update>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "updateDescription.updatedFields.status": {
      "$exists": true
    }
  }

The following match expression allows the Trigger to fire only when a
document's ``needsTriggerResponse`` field is ``true``. The ``fullDocument``
field of the :manual:`insert </reference/change-events/insert>`,
:manual:`update </reference/change-events/update>`, and :manual:`replace
</reference/change-events/replace>` events represents a document after the
given operation. To receive the ``fullDocument`` field, you must enable
:guilabel:`Full Document` in your Trigger configuration.

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "fullDocument.needsTriggerResponse": true
  }


Testing Match Expressions
`````````````````````````

The following procedure shows one way to test whether your match expression
works as expected:

1. Download :mdb-shell:`the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) <>` and use it to
   :ref:`connect to your cluster <connect-mongo-shell>`.

#. Replacing ``DB_NAME`` with your database name, ``COLLECTION_NAME`` with your
   collection name, and ``YOUR_MATCH_EXPRESSION`` with the match expression you
   want to test, paste the following into mongosh to open a change stream on an
   existing collection:

   .. code-block:: js

      db.getSiblingDB(DB_NAME).COLLECTION_NAME.watch([{$match: YOUR_MATCH_EXPRESSION}])
      while (!watchCursor.isClosed()) {
        if (watchCursor.hasNext()) {
          print(tojson(watchCursor.next()));
        }
      }

#. In another terminal window, use ``mongosh`` to make changes to some test
   documents in the collection.

#. Observe what the change stream filters in and out.

.. _atlas-database-triggers-project-expression:

Use Project Expressions to Reduce Input Data Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Project Expression` field,
limit the number of fields that the Trigger processes by using a
:manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` expression.

.. note:: Project is inclusive only

  When using Triggers, a projection expression is inclusive *only*.
  Project does not support mixing inclusions and exclusions.
  The project expression must be inclusive because Triggers require you
  to include ``operationType``.

  If you want to exclude a single field, the projection expression must
  include every field *except* the one you want to exclude.
  You can only explicitly exclude ``_id``, which is included by default.

A Trigger is configured with the following :guilabel:`Project Expression`:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "_id": 0,
    "operationType": 1,
    "updateDescription.updatedFields.status": 1
  }

The change event object that |service| passes to the Trigger Function
only includes the fields specified in the projection, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "operationType": "update",
    "updateDescription": {
      "updatedFields": {
        "status": "InProgress"
      }
    }
  }
