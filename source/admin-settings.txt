To access the :guilabel:`Admin Settings` page, you must be an |service|
:atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`.
If you have the ``Project Owner`` role, the :guilabel:`Admin Settings`
link appears in the top right corner of the Charts UI.

.. _admin-usage:

Usage
-----

The :guilabel:`Usage` panel of the :guilabel:`Admin Settings` shows
the data usage of your |charts| instance over the current month.

The panel displays the following metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Total Data Usage`
     - Total data usage in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance has
       consumed over the current month.

   * - :guilabel:`Free Tier Remaining`
     - Amount of data in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance can
       still use this month for free. If you exceed this amount, your
       |charts-short| instance starts
       :ref:`incurring charges <charts-billing>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Days Remaining`
     - Days remaining in the current month, after which the usage cycle
       resets.

MongoDB provides a free ``1 GB`` of data transfers per month. Nearly
all |charts-short| use cases should fall within this ``1 GB`` free
tier. For more information on |charts| pricing and sample pricing
scenarios, see :ref:`charts-billing`.

Embedding Key Generation
------------------------

Embedding keys are necessary for verified signature generation, and are
used in conjunction with :doc:`embedded charts <embedding-charts>`. To
generate a new embedding key, click the :guilabel:`Generate New Key`
button on the right side of the page.

.. warning::

   If you generate a new key, any previous keys become invalid. Ensure
   that all the existing embedded charts that use the old key are
   updated to use the new key.
