A write operation is any operation that creates or modifies data in the
MongoDB instance. In MongoDB, write operations target a single
:term:`collection`. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the
level of a single :term:`document`.

There are three classes of write operations in MongoDB: :ref:`insert
<write-op-insert>`, :ref:`update <write-op-update>`, and :ref:`remove
<write-op-remove>`. Insert operations add new data to a collection.
Update operations modify existing data, and remove operations delete
data from a collection. No insert, update, or remove can affect more
than one document atomically.

For the update and remove operations, you can specify criteria, or
conditions, that identify the documents to update or remove. These
operations use the same query syntax to specify the criteria as
:doc:`read operations </core/read-operations>`.

MongoDB allows applications to determine the acceptable level of
acknowledgement required of write operations. See
:doc:`/reference/write-concern` for more information.

.. _write-op-insert:

Insert
------

In MongoDB, the :method:`db.collection.insert()` method adds new
:term:`documents <document>` to a collection.

The following diagram highlights the components of a MongoDB insert
operation:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-mongodb-insert.rst

The following diagram shows the same query in SQL:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-sql-insert.rst

.. example::

   The following operation inserts a new document into the ``users``
   collection. The new document has four fields ``name``, ``age``, and
   ``status``, and an ``_id`` field. MongoDB always adds the ``_id``
   field to the new document if that field does not exist.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.insert(
         {
            name: "sue",
            age: 26,
            status: "A"
         }
      )

For more information and examples, see :method:`db.collection.insert()`.

Insert Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add a new document *without* the :term:`_id` field, the client
library or the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance adds an ``_id`` field and
populates the field with a unique :term:`ObjectId <objectid>`.

If you specify the ``_id`` field, the value must be unique within the
collection. For operations with :ref:`write concern <write-concern>`,
if you try to create a document with a duplicate ``_id`` value,
:binary:`~bin.mongod` returns a duplicate key exception.

Other Methods to Add Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also add new documents to a collection using methods that have
an :ref:`upsert <write-operations-upsert-behavior>` option. If the option
is set to ``true``, these methods will either modify existing documents
or add a new document when no matching documents exist for the query.
For more information, see :ref:`write-operations-upsert-behavior`.

.. _write-op-update:

Update
------

In MongoDB, the :method:`db.collection.update()` method modifies
existing :term:`documents <document>` in a :term:`collection`. The
:method:`db.collection.update()` method can accept query criteria to
determine which documents to update as well as an options document that
affects its behavior, such as the ``multi`` option to update multiple
documents.

Operations performed by an update are atomic within a single document. For
example, you can safely use the :update:`$inc` and :update:`$mul` operators to
modify frequently-changed fields in concurrent applications.

The following diagram highlights the components of a MongoDB update
operation:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-mongodb-update.rst

The following diagram shows the same query in SQL:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-sql-update.rst

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.update(
         { age: { $gt: 18 } },
         { $set: { status: "A" } },
         { multi: true }
      )

   This update operation on the ``users`` collection sets the
   ``status`` field to ``A`` for the documents that match the criteria
   of ``age`` greater than ``18``.

For more information, see :method:`db.collection.update()` and
:ref:`update() Examples <update-method-examples>`.

.. _update-multiple-documents:

Default Update Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :method:`db.collection.update()` method updates a
**single** document. However, with the ``multi`` option,
:method:`~db.collection.update()` can update all documents in a
collection that match a query.

The :method:`db.collection.update()` method either updates specific
fields in the existing document or replaces the document. See
:method:`db.collection.update()` for details as well as examples.

.. include:: /includes/fact-update-field-order.rst

.. _write-operations-upsert-behavior:

Update Behavior with the ``upsert`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :method:`~db.collection.update()` method includes :ref:`upsert:
true <upsert-parameter>` *and* no documents match the query portion of
the update operation, then the update operation creates a new document.
If there are matching documents, then the update operation with the
:ref:`upsert: true <upsert-parameter>` modifies the matching document
or documents.

By specifying :term:`upsert: true <upsert>`, applications can indicate,
in a *single* operation, that if no matching documents are found for
the update, an insert should be performed. See
:method:`~db.collection.update()` for details on performing an
:ref:`upsert <upsert-parameter>`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   In 2.6, the new :method:`Bulk()` methods and the underlying
   :dbcommand:`update` command allow you to perform many updates with
   ``upsert: true`` operations in a single call.

If you create documents using the ``upsert`` option to
:method:`~db.collection.update()` consider using a :ref:`a unique index
<update-with-unique-indexes>` to prevent duplicated operations.

.. _write-op-remove:

Remove
------

In MongoDB, the :method:`db.collection.remove()` method deletes
documents from a collection. The :method:`db.collection.remove()`
method accepts a query criteria to determine which documents to remove.

The following diagram highlights the components of a MongoDB remove
operation:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-mongodb-remove.rst

The following diagram shows the same query in SQL:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-sql-delete.rst

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.remove(
         { status: "D" }
      )

   This delete operation on the ``users`` collection removes all
   documents that match the criteria of ``status`` equal to ``D``.

For more information, see :method:`db.collection.remove()` method and
:doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`.

Remove Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, :method:`db.collection.remove()` method removes all
documents that match its query. However, the method can accept a flag
to limit the delete operation to a single document.

.. _write-operations-isolation:

Isolation of Write Operations
-----------------------------

The modification of a single document is always atomic, even if the
write operation modifies multiple embedded documents *within* that
document. No other operations are atomic. 

If a write operation modifies multiple documents, the operation as a
whole is not atomic, and other operations may interleave. You can,
however, attempt to isolate a write operation that affects multiple
documents using the :doc:`isolation operator
</reference/operator/update/isolated>`.

For more information :doc:`/core/write-operations-atomicity`.

Additional Methods
------------------

The :method:`db.collection.save()` method can either update an existing
document or insert a document if the document cannot be found by the
``_id`` field. See :method:`db.collection.save()` for more information
and examples.

MongoDB also provides methods to perform write operations in bulk. See
:method:`Bulk()` for more information.
