.. warning:: This Procedure is Irreversible

   If you enable x.509 member certificate authentication for any 
   deployment in a project, you can't disable x.509 member certificate 
   authentication for the deployment or disable 
   x.509 client authentication at the project level.

   Enabling x.509 member certificate authentication for a deployment in
   a project doesn't enable or require x.509 member certificate 
   authentication for other deployments in the project. You can
   optionally enable each other deployment in the project to use x.509 
   member certificate authentication.
