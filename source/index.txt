======================================
Welcome to MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
======================================

.. introduction::

   The |mdb-shell|, ``mongosh``, is a JavaScript and Node.js |repl| 
   environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments in 
   `Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/>`__, locally,
   or on another remote host. Use the |mdb-shell| to test queries and 
   interact with the data in your MongoDB database.

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Access MongoDB From Your Shell
------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connect to MongoDB
      :tabid: connect

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Find Your Connection String

            Find your connection string. The connection string varies 
            depending on the type of deployment you're connecting to.

            Learn how to find your connection string for
            `Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#find-your-connection-string>`__.

            Or connect to an 
            `self-hosted <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#find-your-self-hosted-deployment-s-connection-string>`__
            deployment.

         .. step:: Connect to MongoDB

            Connect to a MongoDB deployment using the
            connection string. 
            
            The following connection string connects to 
            an Atlas deployment:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username <username>

         .. step:: Interact with Your Data

            Use your chosen connection type to view your data, import 
            documents, and run queries.

            For more information, refer to :ref:`mdb-shell-crud`.

   .. tab:: Perform CRUD and Aggregation
      :tabid: crud

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Insert Documents

            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports common insert opererations, 
            including:

            - :method:`db.collection.insertOne()`
            - :method:`db.collection.insertMany()`

            For more information and examples, refer to :ref:`mongosh-insert`.

         .. step:: Read Documents

            Use the :method:`db.collection.find()` method to query documents
            in a collection. For more information and examples, refer to 
            :ref:`mongosh-read`.

         .. step:: Update Documents

            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports common update operations, 
            including:

            - :method:`db.collection.updateOne()`
            - :method:`db.collection.updateMany()`
            - :method:`db.collection.replaceOne()`

            For more information and examples, refer to :ref:`mongosh-update`.

         .. step:: Delete Documents

            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports common delete operations, 
            including:

            - :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()`
            - :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`

            For more information and examples, refer to :ref:`mongosh-delete`.

         .. step:: Run Aggregation Pipelines

            You can run aggregation pipelines in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` 
            using the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method. 
            Aggregation pipelines transform your documents into 
            aggregated results based on the stages you specify. For more 
            information and examples, refer to :ref:`mdb-shell-aggregation`.

   .. tab:: Administer and Manage
      :tabid: administer

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Manage Databases and Collections

            View information about databases, create collections or views,
            or drop databases - all from your shell. See all 
            :ref:`Database Methods <mongosh-database-methods>`.

            Perform collection operations, create or delete indexes, or 
            explain queries with :ref:`Collection Methods 
            <mongosh-collection-methods>`.

         .. step:: Administer Servers

            Manage :ref:`replication <mongosh-replication-methods>` or 
            :ref:`sharding <mongosh-sharding-methods>` conveniently in 
            your shell.

            Check server status with a variety of :ref:`Server Status Methods 
            <mongosh-server-status-methods>`.

         .. step:: Manage Users and Roles

            Create or update roles, define and update privileges, or drop 
            roles using :ref:`Role Management Methods 
            <mongosh-role-management-methods>`.

            Create and update users, authenticate users, and manage user
            roles with :ref:`User Management Methods 
            <mongosh-user-management-methods>`.

   .. tab:: Automate with Scripts
      :tabid: scripts

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Run Scripts for CRUD or Administrative Tasks

            Write scripts to run with the |mdb-shell| that perform CRUD or 
            administrative operations in MongoDB.

            For example, if you have a JS file that seeds synthetic or
            mock data into MongoDB in your development or staging 
            environment, run the file with:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh YOUR_JS_FILENAME.js

            Explore a tutorial that uses the |mdb-shell| with JavaScript to
            access MongoDB: :ref:`mdb-shell-write-scripts`.

         .. step:: Create Custom Helper Functions with .mongoshrc

            Repeatedly writing large helper functions in the Shell? Store 
            them in a :ref:`.mongoshrc config file <mongoshrc-js>`. For 
            example, if you often find yourself converting date strings to 
            ISO format for queries, create a function in ``.mongoshrc`` to 
            handle it:

            .. code-block:: JavaScript

               function toISO(dateString) { 
                  return new Date(dateString).toISOString(); 
               }

            Then, call the function in ``mongosh``:

            .. code-block:: sh

               db.clientConnections.find( { connectTime: toISO("06/07/2017") } )

            For more information, refer to :ref:`mongosh-write-scripts-config-file`.

         .. step:: Use or Publish Snippets

            :ref:`Pull existing snippets <snip-install-packages>` into 
            your codebase for convenient reuse. Or :ref:`create and share 
            snippets <snip-create>` for your custom use case.

            For example, you might have a snippet that validates the data
            you import daily as a cron job. You can publish this snippet, 
            so your development team can access it. Publish to a community
            registry or configure a private registry. 
            
            For more information, refer to :ref:`snip-reg-config`.
