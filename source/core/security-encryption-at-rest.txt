Encryption at rest, when used in conjunction with transport encryption
and good security policies that protect relevant accounts, passwords,
and encryption keys, can help ensure compliance with security and
privacy standards, including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and FERPA.

Encrypted Storage Engine
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.2

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

.. important:: Available for the WiredTiger Storage Engine only.

MongoDB Enterprise 3.2 introduces a native encryption option for the
WiredTiger storage engine. This feature allows MongoDB to encrypt data
files such that only parties with the decryption key can decode and
read the data.

Encryption Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If encryption is enabled, the default encryption mode that MongoDB
Enterprise uses is the ``AES256-CBC`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption
Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode) via OpenSSL. AES-256 uses a
symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. MongoDB
Enterprise also supports authenticated encryption ``AES256-GCM`` (or
256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode). FIPS mode
encryption is also available.

The data encryption includes:

- Generating an system key.

- Generating keys for each database.

- Encrypting data with the database keys.

- Encrypting the database keys with the system key.

The encryption occur transparently in the storage layer; i.e. all data
files are fully encrypted from a filesystem perspective, and data only
exists in an unencrypted state in memory and during transmission.

To encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic, you can use TLS/SSL
(Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer). See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`.

Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Secure management of the encryption keys is critical.

The database keys are internal to the server and are only paged to disk
in an encrypted format. MongoDB never pages the system key to disk
under any circumstances.

Only the system key is external to the server (i.e. kept separate from
the data and the database keys), and requires external management. To
manage the system key, MongoDB's encrypted storage engine supports two
key management options:

- Integration with a third party key management appliance via the Key
  Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). **Recommended**

- Local key management via a keyfile.

To configure MongoDB for encryption and use one of the two key
management options, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-encryption`.

Encryption and Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption is not a part of replication:

- System keys and database keys are not replicated, and 

- Data is not natively encrypted over the wire.

Although you could reuse the same key for the nodes, MongoDB recommends
the use of individual keys for each node as well as the use of
transport encryption.

For details, see :ref:`rotate-encryption-keys`.

.. _app-level-encryption:

Application Level Encryption
----------------------------

Application Level Encryption provides encryption on a per-field or
per-document basis within the application layer. To encrypt document or
field level data, write custom encryption and decryption routines or
use a commercial solution such as the `Vormetric Data Security
Platform
<http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/sb-MongoDB-Letter-2014-0611.pdf>`_.

.. _third-party-storage-encryption:

Third Party Storage Encryption
------------------------------

A number of third-party libraries can integrate with the operating
system to provide transparent disk-level encryption. For example:

- Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)
    LUKS is available for most Linux distributions. For configuration
    explanation, see the `LUKS documentation from Red Hat`_.

- IBM Guardium Data Encryption
    `IBM Guardium Data Encryption`_ provides support for disk-level
    encryption for Linux and Windows operating systems.

- Vormetric Data Security Platform
    The `Vormetric Data Security Platform`_ provides disk and
    file-level encryption in addition to application level encryption.

- Bitlocker Drive Encryption
    `Bitlocker Drive Encryption`_ is a feature available on Windows
    Server 2008 and 2012 that provides disk encryption.
