=====================================
Convert a Standalone to a Replica Set
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial describes the process for converting a
:term:`standalone` :program:`mongod` instance into a three-member
:term:`replica set`.  Use standalone instances for testing and
development, but always use replica sets in production. To install a
standalone instance, see the :ref:`installation tutorials
<tutorials-installation>`.

To deploy a replica set without using a pre-existing :program:`mongod`
instance, see :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.

Procedure
---------

#. Shut down the :term:`standalone` :program:`mongod` instance.

#. Restart the instance. Use the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
   option to specify the name of the new replica set.

   For example, the following command starts a standalone instance as a
   member of a new replica set named ``rs0``. The command uses the
   standalone's existing database path of ``/srv/mongodb/db0``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/db0 --replSet rs0

   .. include:: /includes/fact-unique-replica-set-names.rst

   For more information on configuration options, see
   :doc:`/reference/configuration-options` and the :program:`mongod`
   manual page.

#. Connect to the :program:`mongod` instance.

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate the new replica set:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

   The replica set is now operational.

   To view the replica set configuration, use :method:`rs.conf()`. To
   check the status of the replica set, use :method:`rs.status()`.

Expand the Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add additional replica set members by doing the following:

#. On two distinct systems, start two new standalone :program:`mongod`
   instances. For information on starting a standalone instance, see
   the :ref:`installation tutorial <tutorials-installation>` specific
   to your environment.

#. On your connection to the original :program:`mongod` instance (the
   former standalone instance), issue a command in the following form
   for each new instance to add to the replica set:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("<hostname><:port>")

   Replace ``<hostname>`` and ``<port>`` with the resolvable hostname
   and port of the :program:`mongod` instance to add to the set. For
   more information on adding a host to a replica set, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.

Sharding Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the new replica set is part of a :term:`sharded cluster`, change
the shard host information in the :term:`config database` by doing
the following:

#. Connect to one of the sharded cluster's :program:`mongos`
   instances and issue a command in the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("config").shards.save( {_id: "<name>", host: "<replica-set>/<member,><member,><...>" } )

   Replace ``<name>`` with the name of the shard. Replace
   ``<replica-set>`` with the name of the replica set. Replace
   ``<member,><member,><>`` with the list of the members of the
   replica set.

#. Restart all :program:`mongos` instances. If possible, restart all
   components of the replica sets (i.e., all :program:`mongos` and
   all shard :program:`mongod` instances).
