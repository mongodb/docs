:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling 
for large data sets and enable high-throughput operations by 
distributing the data set across a group of servers. 

To learn more about sharding, see the 
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the 
MongoDB manual.

To deploy a new sharded cluster that |service| can manage, use the
{+osb+} and |k8s|. After deployment, use |service| to add shards and
perform other maintenance operations on the cluster. 

Prerequisites
-------------

.. |deployment| replace:: sharded cluster

.. include:: /includes/prereqs-deploy-resource.rst

Considerations
--------------

Limits of the |service| API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+osb+} uses the :atlas:`Create a Cluster
<reference/api/clusters-create-one>` endpoint of the |service| |api| to
deploy sharded clusters. Any requirements or limitations of that |api|
also apply to the {+osb+}.

Procedure
