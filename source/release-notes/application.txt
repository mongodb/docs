|onprem| Server 2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-12-08*

General
```````

- Adds support to monitor, back up, and automate MongoDB 3.2 deployments.

- Single |onprem| Package: there is no longer a separate package for the
  Backup Daemon. The single |onprem| package installs both the |application|
  and the Backup Daemon. You can configure any server with |onprem| to
  handle backups through the Backup Admin interface.

- Configuration in the Database: the |onprem| application configuration
  is now stored in the application database rather than in configuration
  files. This allows for central configuration management.

  Each |onprem| instance, on each server, must be configured with
  information on how to connect to the Application Database. Local
  config files override the information in the database: as such,
  switching to configuration in the database is not required, but is
  recommended.

- Backup agent port change: |onprem| no longer requires a separate port
  for backup traffic. All HTTP traffic is now over a single port. By
  default, |onprem| uses port ``8080``.

- |onprem| 2.0 updates the admin interface to show the topology of
  |onprem| software, the application database, and any backup databases.

- Added support to convert to LDAP authentication for |onprem| users at
  any time, with no downtime.

- Upgraded to JDK8u66.

Automation
``````````

- Added support for x.509 member authentication.

- Improved handling of adding members to replica sets: to avoid
  disrupting majority writes, new members are now added to
  :term:`replica sets <replica set>` as ``priority=0``, ``votes=0`` until they
  reach secondary state, after which |mms| automatically updates the
  configuration to match the :manual:`priority
  </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].priority>` and
  :manual:`votes </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].votes>`
  value specified in the deployment.

- Added the ability to manage indexes from the |onprem| UI.

- Improved index creation: indexes are now created in a rolling fashion.

- Added Automation support for Windows MongoDB instances.

Monitoring
``````````

- Added a new profiler with Suggested Indexes.

- Added support for maintenance windows during which time |onprem| does
  not send alert notifications.

Backup
``````

- Filesystem snapshot storage: added the ability to store snapshots
  on a plain shared file system instead of a MongoDB instance. With
  filesystem storage, |onprem| stores snapshots in a directory hierarchy
  and the data files themselves are compressed using gzip.

- Backup agent port change: |onprem| no longer requires a separate port
  for backup traffic. All HTTP traffic is now over a single port. By
  default, |onprem| uses port ``8080``

  |onprem| will automatically update any Backup Agents managed by
  Automation to use the new port. You will need to manually update any
  Backup Agents set up manually after upgrading |onprem|. The upgrade
  instructions describe how to configure the ``mothership`` field in the
  configuration files of non-automated Backup Agents.

- Sync store no longer required: a dedicated sync store is no longer
  required: Backup :term:`initial syncs <initial sync>` are "streamed"
  to the Backup Daemon and only use a small amount of temporary space in
  the :term:`oplog store <Oplog Store Database>`.

- Automated restores: added a new option to automatically restore a
  backup to a running :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`.

- Added support for namespace whitelisting, which allows you to back up
  only a subset of your data.

- Added the ability to manage HTTP restore link expiration from the
  |onprem| UI and through the API for each individual restore request.

- Added support for the Backup Daemon to download required MongoDB
  binaries from the |onprem| web server when they are not available locally.

- Fixed case where an acknowledged Alert can be re-opened when Alert
  processing is behind.

- Fixed case where monitoring classified a Config Server as a
  Standalone when there were no :program:`mongos` services.

|onprem| Server 1.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-06-23*

Security
````````

- Automation now supports :doc:`SSL </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`
  and MongoDB Enterprise authentication mechanisms: :doc:`Kerberos
  </tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group>`, :doc:`LDAP
  </tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group>`, and :doc:`x.509
  </tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group>`.

  |onprem| 1.8 can start new MongoDB instances using SSL and enterprise
  authentication mechanisms and import existing instances using SSL and
  enterprise authentication for management.

- Added the ability to :doc:`specify a proxy server
  </tutorial/use-with-http-proxy>` for |onprem| to use to
  access external services.

- Added :ref:`support for self-signed CAs and client certificates
  <ldap-over-ssl>` when using SSL LDAP for |onprem| user authentication.

Alerts
``````

- :doc:`System Alerts </core/system-alerts>`: system alerts allow an |onprem| Administrator to receive
  alerts when the state of the software itself is unhealthy.

- :doc:`Global Alerts </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`: global alerts allow an |onprem| administrator to
  monitor any set of |onprem| groups without needing to configure
  the alerts on a group-by-group basis.

- Added the ability to :ref:`deliver Project, Global, and System alerts via an
  HTTP webhook <group-settings-page>`.

- Lowered the alerting check frequency from five minutes to one minute,
  allowing for more responsive alerts.

Automation
``````````

- Automation now uses distribution-specific builds for MongoDB Community
  Edition when one is available for the operating system and version in use.
  Previously, Automation used the generic MongoDB Community Edition build.

  Upgrading the Automation Agent and |onprem| to the new version will
  not automatically change your MongoDB deployments to a distribution-specific build:
  if you wish to use the distribution-specific build, you will need to
  :doc:`update the MongoDB version </tutorial/change-mongodb-version>`.

- Added support to :doc:`change the storage engine for a MongoDB
  deployment using Automation </tutorial/edit-deployment>`.

- **Beta**: Added Automation support for Windows MongoDB instances.
  This feature must be enabled for an |onprem| group for it to be available.

Monitoring
``````````

- Standby Monitoring Agents now check in with |onprem| more frequently.
  You can now configure the Monitoring Agent session timeout to allow
  for faster failover. See: :ref:`standby-monitoring-agent` for
  more information.

Backup
``````

- Added the ability to configure the Backup Database's block size.
  The :doc:`/tutorial/configure-block-size` tutorial describes
  how to configure the size of the blocks in the Backup Database's blockstore.

- Added the ability to initiate backup SCP restores through the Public API.
  See: :doc:`/reference/api/restore-jobs`.

Associated Agent Updates (v1.8)
```````````````````````````````

- :ref:`automation-2.0.9.1201`
- :ref:`monitoring-3.3.1.193`
- :ref:`backup-3.3.1.193`

Considerations for Upgrade (v1.8)
`````````````````````````````````

- |onprem| 1.8 requires that the :ref:`mms-application-database` and
  :ref:`backup-database` run MongoDB 2.6 or later.
  |onprem| will not start after upgrade if your backing databases are
  using an earlier version of MongoDB. The MongoDB Manual provides
  upgrade tutorials with each release. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to
  2.6, see: :manual:`Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6 <release-notes/2.6-upgrade/>`.

- When you upgrade to |onprem| 1.8, |onprem| disables all Automation
  Agents until they are upgraded to :ref:`automation-2.0.9.1201`.
  You can upgrade the Automation Agents by clicking the link that appears
  in the :guilabel:`Please upgrade your agents` banner that will
  appear on the :guilabel:`Deployment` page in the |onprem| interface.

- Direct upgrade is only allowed from |onprem| 1.5 and |onprem| 1.6. To
  upgrade to |onprem| 1.8 from an earlier version of MongoDB, you must
  first upgrade to |onprem| 1.6, and then to 1.8.

- In |onprem| 1.8, :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.level` replaces the
  deprecated :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.require` setting. :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.level`
  supports more values than its predecessor.

  |onprem| will not start with :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.require` in the
  properties file, but will report an error indicating that the setting
  has been deprecated, and that you must update your configuration.

- |onprem| 1.8 does not include the Backup HTTP Service: its
  functionality is now part of :doc:`System Alerts</core/system-alerts>`
  and :doc:`Global Alerts </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

- System Alerts give new insight into the health of |onprem| and may
  immediately trigger on upgrade if |onprem| is not in the expected
  state. For example, if your Application or Backup databases have
  startup warnings or if the connection strings to those databases point
  to any unreachable MongoDB instances, |onprem| will issue an alert.

- The |onprem| Deployment user interface has been streamlined such that
  the :guilabel:`View Mode` and :guilabel:`Edit Mode` dual views have
  been merged into a unified view

|onprem| Server 1.6
-------------------

|onprem| Server 1.6.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-08-17*

|onprem| Server 1.6.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-03-26*

- Upgraded Automation Agent to ``1.4.15.999``. See: the
  :ref:`Automation Agent release notes <automation-1.4.15.999>`.

- **Security Update**: resolved an issue where users removed from LDAP groups
  were not always removed from corresponding Ops Manager groups.
  This upgrade is **highly recommended** for anyone using
  LDAP authentication.

- Selecting wildcards in the Version Manager is no longer supported
  when ``automation.versions.source`` is set to ```local``.

- Adds a 1 hour timeout to kill a Backup :term:`head database` if
  it does not shutdown cleanly.
  You must perform a resync following a hard kill.

- Windows support for Backup Daemon using Windows 64-bit 2008 R2+
  MongoDB builds.

- Fix for Backups stored in :ref:`WiredTiger <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`
  format in which a single collection grows from under 8 GB to over 8 GB in size.

- The time before an unreachable :program:`mongos` process is deactivated
  is now configurable on a per group basis. See
  :ref:`admin-only-group-settings`.

- The time before a standby Monitoring Agent takes over after the
  primary Monitoring Agent stops responding is now configurable to a
  minimum of 90 seconds. See the
  ``mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis`` setting in
  :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

- For Backup HTTP pull restore, the link expiration and the number of
  allowed uses of a link are now configurable.

|onprem| Server 1.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-03-02*

New Features
````````````

- Initial release of :ref:`Automation <automation>`. Automation manages
  many basic administrative tasks for MongoDB deployments, including
  version upgrades, adding replica set members, adding shards, and
  changing oplog size. You can both :doc:`import existing deployments into
  Automation </tutorial/add-monitored-deployment-to-automation>` and :doc:`create
  new deployments on your provisioned hardware
  </tutorial/add-servers-automation>`.

- Windows support (Monitoring and Backup only). You can
  :doc:`/tutorial/install-on-prem-windows` using MSI files. |onprem|
  supports Windows Server 2008 R2 and above.

- Support for MongoDB 3.0, including support for backups that use the
  :ref:`WiredTiger <considerations-backup-storage-engine>` storage engine.

  To monitor or back up MongoDB 3.0 deployments, you must install |onprem|
  1.6 or higher. To monitor a MongoDB 3.0 deployment, you must also run
  Monitoring Agent version 2.7.0 or higher.

- Support for using the SSL and MONGODB-X509 authentication mechanisms for
  the backing MongoDB databases. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-backing-mongodb`.

- Public API endpoints to manage Automation configuration. For more
  information, see :ref:`Automation <api-automation>` in the API
  documentation.

Improvements
````````````

- The |onprem|'s :doc:`Administration </core/administration-interface>`
  interface provides more information to make it easier to monitor the
  health of the |onprem| installation.

- The |onprem| Deployment tab now displays all deployment information on
  one page, with icons for selecting view options. The new Topology View
  groups all hosts by the replica set or sharded cluster they are part of.
  The new Servers View shows information about MongoDB processes and
  |onprem| agents grouped by server.

- Fixed an isssue (`MMS-2273 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MMS-2273>`_)
  where, in certain situations, the Backup Agent was not reporting a
  cluster snapshot as potentially inconsistent.

- Improved handling of cursor timeouts by the Backup Agent. To use this
  improvement, upgrade to the latest Backup Agent, which is included with
  |onprem|. The improvement became available with Backup Agent version
  ``2.3.3.209-1``.

Considerations for Upgrade to 1.6
``````````````````````````````````

- |onprem| 1.8.0, when released, **will not** support MongoDB 2.4 for the
  :ref:`mms-application-database` and
  :ref:`backup-database`.
  |onprem| Server 1.8.0 *will* continue to support MongoDB 2.4 for your
  monitored and backed-up databases.

- |onprem| 1.6.0 supports direct upgrades only from MMS On Prem 1.3 and
  above.

- The procedure to configure |onprem| to run with HTTPS has changed and is
  greatly simplified. The previous procedure no longer works. For the new
  procedure, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-web-interface`.

- The connection string to the Backup Blockstore database is now
  configured through the Administration interface's :ref:`Blockstores page
  <blockstores-page>` and not through the ``mongo.backupdb.mongoUri``
  field in the ``conf-daemon.properties`` configuration file.

- |onprem| no longer requires you to supply the replica set name of the
  backing MongoDB instances. The ``mongo.replicaSet`` and
  ``mongo.backupdb.replicaSet`` properties have been removed from the
  configuration files. These properties had previously controlled whether
  |onprem| treated a connection to a backing instance as a standalone or
  replica set, for the purpose of setting the write concern. |onprem| now
  sets write concern based on how many hosts are supplied in the
  connection string.

- You can disable Automation for the entire |onprem| installation through
  the ``mms.featureFlag.automation`` setting in the
  ``conf-daemon.properties`` :doc:`configuration file
  </reference/configuration>`.

- Removed the :guilabel:`Dashboards` view from the |onprem| UI. You can
  view monitoring metrics from the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab.
  See: :doc:`/tutorial/view-diagnostics` for an overview
  of the available metrics and how to access them.

MMS Onprem Server 1.5
---------------------

MMS Onprem Server 1.5.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-03-26*

- **Security Update**: resolved issue where users removed from LDAP groups
  were not always removed from corresponding Ops Manager groups.
  This upgrade is **highly recommended** for anyone using
  LDAP authentication.

MMS Onprem Server 1.5.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2015-03-18*

- Fixed race condition that could cause the Backup Daemon to hang when
  the MongoDB process for a :term:`head database` fails to start.

- Fixed an issue where a rollback occurring shortly after a terminate could
  step on the terminate.

- The time before an unreachable :program:`mongos` process is
  deactivated is now configurable on a per group basis. See
  :ref:`admin-only-group-settings`.

- The time before a standby Monitoring Agent takes over after the
  primary Monitoring Agent stops responding is now configurable to a
  minimum of 90 seconds. See the
  ``mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis`` setting in
  :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

- For Backup HTTP pull restore, the link expiration and the number of
  allowed uses of a link are now configurable.

MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-12-17*

Significant improvements in performance for the processing of MMS OnPrem
Monitoring data for MMS OnPrem Projects with a large number of hosts

MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-11-18*

- Added Support for archive restores (``.tar.gz``) for databases whose
  filenames exceed 100 characters.

- API: Skip missed points in metrics data, instead of returning empty
  data.

- API: Return correct number of data points when querying metric data
  with the period option.

- Backup Agent update to ``2.3.3.209-1``

MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-09-26*

- Fix cases where replica set member alerts (e.g. no primary, number
  of healthy members) could send false positives.

- Skip ``backup-daemon`` :setting:`rootDirectory` and
  :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` overlap check when the
  :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is on a different
  host.

- ``mms-gen-key`` script handles user's effective group being
  different than the username.

- Security enhancements.

MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-09-02*

Considerations for Upgrade
``````````````````````````

- MMS OnPrem *only* supports direct upgrades from 1.3 and 1.4.

- Change in configurations and policy for 2FA:  Two-factor
  authentication must now be explicitly enabled using the
  :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.require` setting.

- The default LDAP group separator became ``;;``. Previously the
  separator was ``,``. See the :ref:`LDAP configuration
  <default-ldap-separator>` documentation for more information.

- Suppressed hosts will only remain suppressed for 30 minutes.

  Previously, if after deleting a host, from MMS OnPrem Monitoring the
  hostname and port combination would be added to a suppression list with an infinite
  lifetime. The suppression list prevented a race condition where host in a cluster would
  be auto-discovered by another member of a deployment before the host
  could was fully removed. Now, hostname and port combinations remain
  on the suppression list for only 30 minutes.

- Set the :setting:`mms.remoteIp.header` in the
  ``conf-mms.properties`` file  if clients access the MMS OnPrem Application
  via a load balancer.

- :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is no longer in
  ``conf-mms.properties``. This was previously a required field in this
  file. It remains in the backup daemons's ``conf-daemon.properties``.

- Stored MongoDB profile data is not transferred between OnPrem 1.4
  and OnPrem 1.5 during the upgrade process.

Improvements
````````````

- When an MMS OnPrem Backup job fails to bind, the system will periodically
  and automatically retry.

- All MMS OnPrem Backup jobs will retry indefinitely.

- Point in Time restores are now available with one second granularity.

New Features
````````````

- MMS OnPrem :doc:`Public API </reference/api>`.

- Explicit support for multiple MMS OnPrem Backup Blockstore databases and
  the ability to pin MMS OnPrem Projects to specific backup daemons and
  databases. See :doc:`/tutorial/assign-snapshot-stores-to-data-center` for
  more information.

- MMS OnPrem can authenticate using LDAP to both the database backing MMS OnPrem and
  the monitored and backed up MongoDB deployments. See :ref:`security-ldap`.

- Enhanced auditing. See :doc:`/reference/audit-events` for more
  information.

- Ability to acknowledge alerts with comments.

- New cluster page that shows individual, sum or average metrics for
  all shards in a cluster.


MMS OnPrem Server 1.4
---------------------

MMS OnPrem Server 1.4.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-07-22*

- Addressed issues related to Backup Job assignment for 2.6.x clusters
  that used the :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role to support MMS OnPrem
  Monitoring.

- Fixed problem importing email addresses for users for deployments
  that use LDAP integration.

- Fixed rare race condition caused high CPU usage in the MMS OnPrem HTTP
  Service if the application cannot connect to one of the backing databases.

- Additional security enhancements.

MMS OnPrem Server  ``1.4.2``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-05-29*

- Critical bug fix for backing up MongoDB 2.6 deployments that include
  user or custom role definitions:

  - The :data:`system.version` collection in the admin database will
    be included in all future snapshots.

  - The :data:`system.roles` collection in the admin database will be
    included after a new initial sync is performed.

  Users capturing backups of MongoDB 2.6 replica sets
  or clusters with MMS OnPrem that include custom role definitions should perform a
  new initial sync. Taking a new initial sync will ensure that the
  role definitions are included in the backup.

- Disable MongoDB :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` for insert-only MMS OnPrem
  Backup collections.

- Speed optimization for MMS OnPrem Backup HTTP pull restores.

- Fix for LDAP integration, MMS OnPrem now passes full ``dn`` correctly when
  authenticating the user.

MMS OnPrem Server  ``1.4.1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-04-28*

- Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters using Kerberos authentication

- Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters running specific custom
  MongoDB builds provided by MongoDB, Inc.

- Fix validation issue preventing Backup of MongoDB 2.6.0 clusters

- Reduced log noise from Monitoring Agent when monitoring MongoDB 2.0 or unreachable mongods

MMS OnPrem Server  ``1.4.0``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2014-04-08*

- Includes MMS OnPrem Backup: continuous backup with point-in-time recovery of replica
  sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters.

- Finer-grained roles and permissions.

- Improved user interface for alerts.

- Enhanced Activity Feed for auditing of all activity.
