Definition
----------

.. expression:: $let

   Binds :doc:`variables </reference/aggregation-variables>` for use in
   the specified expression, and returns the result of the expression.

   The :expression:`$let` expression has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

      {
        $let:
           {
             vars: { <var1>: <expression>, ... },
             in: <expression>
           }
      }

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20, 80

      * - Field
        - Specification

      * - ``vars``

        - Assignment block for the :doc:`variables
          </reference/aggregation-variables>` accessible in the ``in``
          expression. To assign a variable, specify a string for the
          variable name and assign a valid expression for the value.

          The variable assignments have no meaning outside the ``in``
          expression, not even within the ``vars`` block itself.

      * - ``in``

        - The :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` to evaluate.

   To access variables in aggregation expressions, prefix the variable
   name with double dollar signs (``$$``) and enclosed in quotes. For
   more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`. For information on use of
   variables in the aggregation pipeline, see
   :doc:`/reference/aggregation-variables`.

Behavior
--------

:expression:`$let` can access variables defined outside its expression
block, including :ref:`system variables <agg-system-variables>`.

If you modify the values of externally defined variables in the
``vars`` block, the new values take effect only in the ``in``
expression. Outside of the ``in`` expression, the variables retain
their previous values.

In the ``vars`` assignment block, the order of the assignment does
**not** matter, and the variable assignments only have meaning inside
the ``in`` expression. As such, accessing a variable's value in the
``vars`` assignment block refers to the value of the variable defined
outside the ``vars`` block and **not** inside the same ``vars`` block.

For example, consider the following :expression:`$let` expression:

.. code-block:: none

   {
     $let:
       {
         vars: { low: 1, high: "$$low" },
         in: { $gt: [ "$$low", "$$high" ] }
       }
   }

In the ``vars`` assignment block, ``"$$low"`` refers to the value of an
externally defined variable ``low`` and not the variable defined in the
same ``vars`` block. If ``low`` is not defined outside this
:expression:`$let` expression block, the expression is invalid.

Example
--------

A ``sales`` collection has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, price: 10, tax: 0.50, applyDiscount: true }
   { _id: 2, price: 10, tax: 0.25, applyDiscount: false }

The following aggregation uses :expression:`$let` in the
:pipeline:`$project` pipeline stage to calculate and return the
``finalTotal`` for each document:

.. code-block:: none

   db.sales.aggregate( [
      {
         $project: {
            finalTotal: {
               $let: {
                  vars: {
                     total: { $add: [ '$price', '$tax' ] },
                     discounted: { $cond: { if: '$applyDiscount', then: 0.9, else: 1 } }
                  },
                  in: { $multiply: [ "$$total", "$$discounted" ] }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

The aggregation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "finalTotal" : 9.450000000000001 }
   { "_id" : 2, "finalTotal" : 10.25 }
