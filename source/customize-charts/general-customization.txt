|charts| provides general customization options which modify the
visualization at a high level, rather than individual pieces of the
visualization.

.. note::
  
   This page illustrates the general customization options which are
   available for most :ref:`chart types <chart-type-reference>`. Some
   chart types have other customization options which are noted on their
   individual documentation pages.

To access the general customization options, expand the :guilabel:`General`
section of the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.

Color Palette Customization
---------------------------

Palette customization allows you to select custom colors for your
chart. To enable color customization, select the
:guilabel:`Customize` tab of the :guilabel:`Chart Type` column.
A toggle switch labeled :guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` appears in
the :guilabel:`General` section. 

You can also customize individual colors in your palette. Most chart types
use a custom color picker with color swatches that correspond to your data
series.

Depending on the chart type, each color swatch has a corresponding 
number or a corresponding name:

- Single-series charts have a single numbered swatch.
- Multi-series charts built by
  :ref:`mapping multiple fields <multiple-field-mappings>` 
  have color swatches with the names of your selected fields.
- Multi-series charts built with a numeric or date field in the 
  :ref:`Series channel <charts-series-encoding>` have numbered color 
  swatches.
- Multi-series charts built with a string field in the
  :ref:`Series channel <charts-series-encoding>` allow you to
  choose how you want to assign color. For numbered color swatches, select 
  the :guilabel:`By Order` option. For swatches with
  field names, select the :guilabel:`By Series` option.

To change the color of the corresponding data series, click the color swatch. 
You can select a new color with a color slider, by
entering a hex value, by entering RGB values, or by choosing a
predefined color. You can also drag and drop color swatches to
rearrange the colors in your palette.

.. note::

   For multi-series charts with numbered color swatches, 
   the custom color palette shows swatches for 10
   data series by default, and it can expand 
   to show up to 20 data series. However, you can only modify as many 
   swatches as you have data series. For example, if you have two
   data series in your chart, only the swatches numbered ``1`` and
   ``2`` have an effect on your chart. If additional series appear 
   while the chart is rendering, Charts assigns them a new color. 

Other chart types use a gradient color scale with a 
set of pre-defined gradients. The 
:ref:`heatmap <heatmap-chart-ref>` and :ref:`colored bar
and column <column-bar-chart-ref>` types use this method.

To close the color customization tool, click somewhere outside it.
To revert the entire chart to its default colors, set the
:guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` toggle switch back to :guilabel:`Off`.
