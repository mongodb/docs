Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to perform
**transactions**. :manual:`Transactions </core/transactions/>` allow
you to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the
transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction returns an
error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards all data changes
before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
:manual:`session </reference/server-sessions/>` is a grouping of related
read or write operations that you intend to run sequentially. Sessions
enable :manual:`causal consistency
</core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#causal-consistency>` for a
group of operations or allow you to execute operations in an
:website:`ACID transaction </basics/acid-transactions>`. MongoDB
guarantees that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a
``Client`` instance as a ``Session`` type. We recommend that you reuse
your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
instantiating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``Session`` only with the ``Client`` (or associated
   ``Database`` or ``Collection``) that created it. Using a
   ``Session`` with a different ``Client`` results in operation
   errors.

.. warning::
   
   Implementations of ``Session`` are not safe for concurrent use by multiple `goroutines
   <https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10>`__.

Methods
-------

After you start a session by using the ``StartSession()`` method, you can modify
the session state by using the method set provided by the ``Session`` interface. The
following table describes these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``StartTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on
         this session. Returns an error if there is already
         a transaction in progress for the session. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``TransactionOptions``
       | **Return Type**: ``error``

   * - ``AbortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or the
         transaction has been committed or ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``Context``
       | **Return Type**: ``error``

   * - ``CommitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>`  in the Server manual. 
       |
       | The ``CommitTransaction()`` method is an idempotent function, which 
         means that you can attempt to commit a transaction multiple times without changing data after the first successful commit. 
         A transaction can succeed but return an error with the 
         ``UnknownTransactionCommitResult`` label. If you rerun the
         ``CommitTransaction()`` method after receiving this error,
         your data is not changed by the repeat attempts.

       |
       | **Parameter**: ``Context``
       | **Return Type**: ``error``

   * - ``WithTransaction()``
     - | Starts a transaction on this session and runs the ``fn``
         callback.
       |
       | **Parameters**: ``Context``, ``fn func(ctx SessionContext)``, ``TransactionOptions``
       | **Return Type**: ``interface{}``, ``error``

   * - ``EndSession()``
     - | Ends any existing transactions and closes the session.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``Context``
       | **Return Type**: none

The ``Session`` interface also has methods to retrieve session
properties and modify mutable session properties. Find more information
in the :ref:`API documentation <api-docs-transaction>`.

Example
-------

The following example shows how you can create a session, create a
transaction, and commit a multi-document insert operation through the
following steps:

1. Create a session from the client using the ``StartSession()`` method.
#. Use the ``WithTransaction()`` method to start a transaction.
#. Insert multiple documents. The ``WithTransaction()`` method executes the
   insert and commits the transaction. If any operation results in
   errors, ``WithTransaction()`` handles canceling the transaction.
#. Close the transaction and session using the ``EndSession()`` method.

If you require more control over your transactions, you can find an example
showing how to manually create, commit, and end transactions in the
`full code example <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-golang/{+docs-branch+}/source/includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/transaction.go>`__.
