View Active Agents
------------------

To view your active Monitoring Agents:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst
      
   .. step:: View all agents.
      
      a. Click the :guilabel:`Agents` tab.
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`All Agents`.

Active agents are those that have pinged |mms| in the last 5 minutes.

Remove from |mms|
-----------------

To remove a Monitoring Agent from |mms|, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent>` and then wait 5 minutes.

When an agent fails to ping |mms| for 5 minutes, |mms| views the agent as
inactive and distributes the agent's assignments to other agents (if
available).

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`All Agents` page  displays an inactive agent for 24 hours
   before |mms| removes it from the page.

Delete from the Server
----------------------

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-monitoring-agent>` and then remove the
``mongodb-mms-monitoring-agent`` file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you
installed the agent using a ``tar.gz`` file, the agent will be in the 
directory you chose during installation.

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller
to remove the ``MongoDB Monitoring Agent`` program.
