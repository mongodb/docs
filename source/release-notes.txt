.. _ent-op-1.14.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.14 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.14.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.14.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2021-12-16*

|k8s-op-short|
``````````````

.. include:: /includes/facts/fact-disable-tls.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-broken-appdb.rst

Changes
+++++++

- The |k8s-op-short| now supports |hashicorp-vault| as a |secret-store|. To
  store secrets in |vault-short| instead of |k8s| |k8s-secrets|, see
  :ref:`Configure Secret Storage <k8s-secret-storage>`.

.. _ent_op-1.14.0-mdb-resource:

``MongoDB`` Resource
````````````````````

Changes
+++++++

- This release adds the :setting:`spec.backup.autoTerminateOnDeletion` setting,
  which indicates if the |k8s-op-short|
  should stop and terminate the backup when you delete the ``MongoDB`` resource.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue that caused a ``ShardedCluster`` resource to fail when disabling authentication.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````

Changes
+++++++

- This release adds the ability to configure |s3| oplog stores using the
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.name`
  setting and other related settings.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue that prevented the |k8s-op-short| from triggering a
  resource reconciliation when rotating the Application Database |tls| certificate.
- Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short| didn't mount the custom |certauth| specified in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource
  into the Backup Daemon Pod. This issue prevented backups from working
  when you configured |onprem| to run in :opsmgr:`hybrid mode </tutorial/configure-local-mode/#hybrid-mode>` and used a custom |certauth|.

.. _ent-op-1.13.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.13 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.13.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.13.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2021-10-21*

|k8s-op-short|
``````````````

.. warning:: **Breaking Changes**

   The |k8s-op-short| no longer generates |tls| certificates for
   ``MongoDB`` and ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources.

Changes
+++++++

- The |k8s-op-short| now integrates with the Gatekeeper Open Policy Agent (OPA).
  This allows you to 
  :ref:`control your deployments with policies set in the OPA Gatekeeper <OPA-gatekeeper>`.

- The |k8s-op-short| can now watch a list of namespaces. To learn more,
  see :ref:`ns-scope-different-ns`.

- When deploying resources to :ref:`more than one namespace   
  <ns-scope-different-ns>`, create ``imagePullSecrets`` only in the 
  namespace where you installed the |k8s-op-short|. The |k8s-op-short|
  synchronizes this secret across all watched namespaces.

- The :setting:`spec.credentials` secret :ref:`now accepts 
  <create-k8s-secret>` fields named
  ``publicKey`` and ``privateKey``. Use these fields instead of the 
  ``user`` and ``publicApiKey`` fields supported in previous releases.

.. important:: **Deprecation Notice**

   This release deprecates :k8sdocs:`generic type secrets 
   </concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets>` for
   |tls| certificates.

- The |k8s-op-short| now supports |tls| secrets of the
  :k8sdocs:`kubernetes.io/tls
  </concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets>` type.

  - The |k8s-op-short| reads these secrets and automatically generates
    new ``.pem`` files that contain the concatenated ``tls.crt`` and
    ``tls.key`` fields when you update these secrets.
  - This removes the need to manually concatenate these vales to create
    ``.pem`` files and enables you to natively reference secrets 
    that |k8s|-native tools, such as `cert-manager
    <https://cert-manager.io/docs/>`__, generate.

- For |tls|\-enabled resources, the operator now watches the ConfigMap
  that contains the |certauth| and the secrets that contain |tls| 
  certificates. Changes to these ConfigMaps and secrets now trigger a 
  reconciliation of the related resource.

.. _ent_op-1.13.0-mdb-resource:

``MongoDB`` Resource
````````````````````

.. warning:: **Breaking Changes**

   This release removes the :setting:`spec.project` setting from the
   :ref:`k8s-specification`.

   If your ``MongoDB`` resource specifications use the
   :setting:`spec.project` setting, update your specifications to instead
   use :setting:`spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name` or
   :setting:`spec.cloudManager.configMapRef.name` before you upgrade the
   |k8s-op-short| to 1.13.0 or later.

Changes
+++++++

- This release adds several new fields that determine the names that you
  must give the secrets that contain your |tls| and X.509 certificates 
  for MongoDB resources.

  To learn more, see :setting:`spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` and the
  :ref:`k8s-secure-resources` tutorials.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue where Sharded Cluster backups could not be correctly 
  configured using ``MongoDB`` resource specifications.
- Fixes an issue where Backup Daemon fails to start after you update an
  |onprem| deployment by updating :opsmgrkube:`spec.version`.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````

- The |k8s-op-short| now reports the status of file system snapshot 
  stores that you configure in the  ``spec.backup.fileSystemStores``
  setting in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource specification.

  You must manually configure the file system snapshot stores.

- This release adds a new field, ``spec.backup.externalServiceEnabled``,
  to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource specification.

  By default, the |k8s-op-short| creates a :k8sdocs:`LoadBalancer 
  </concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer>` service when 
  you :ref:`enable queryable backups <configure-om-queryable-backups>`.

  Set ``spec.backup.externalServiceEnabled`` to ``false`` before you
  enable queryable backups to prevent the |k8s-op-short| from creating a
  LoadBalancer service.

- The |k8s-op-short| now automatically upgrades personal API keys to
  programmatic API keys when you upgrade an |onprem| deployment to 
  version 5.0.0 or later. You no longer must change the keys manually to
  upgrade your deployment.

- This release adds the :opsmgrkube:`spec.security.certSecretPrefix` field to
  determine the name that you must give the secret that contains your
  |tls| certificate for ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources.

  To learn more, see :opsmgrkube:`spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` and 
  the **HTTPS** tab in the :ref:`deploy-om-container` tutorial.

``MongoDBUser`` Resource
````````````````````````

.. warning:: **Breaking Changes**

   This release removes the spec.project setting from the ``MongoDBUser``
   CustomResourceDefinition.

   If your ``MongoDBUser`` resource specifications use the
   spec.project setting, update your specifications to instead
   use ``spec.MongoDBResourceRef.name`` before you upgrade the
   |k8s-op-short| to 1.13.0 or later.

Miscellaneous
`````````````

- |onprem| 4.4.7, 4.4.9, 4.4.10, 4.4.11, 4.4.12 and 4.4.13 base images
  have been updated to Ubuntu 20.04.
- |onprem| versions 4.4.16 and 5.0.1 are now supported.

``MongoDB`` Resource
````````````````````

- If you set :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity` to ``false`` after it
  was set to ``true``, the |k8s-op-short| deletes the corresponding service.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes a bug where you could specify ``net.ssl.mode`` and not ``net.tls.mode``
  in :setting:`spec.additionalMongodConfig`.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````

- If you set :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity` to ``false`` after it
  was set to ``true``, the |k8s-op-short| deletes the corresponding service.
- You can specify the number of backup daemon Pods with :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.members`.
  If not set, the value defaults to ``1``.

Changes to Images and Supported Versions
````````````````````````````````````````

- The |k8s-op-short| now supports the following |onprem| versions:

  - 4.4.13, 4.4.14, 4.4.15, 4.2.25 and 5.0.0.

- Before upgrading |onprem| to version 5.0.0, check that the
  |k8s-op-short| uses a :ref:`programmatic API key <create-k8s-credentials>`.

  of Ubuntu 16.04.
- Ubuntu based MongoDB images starting from 2.0.1 are based on Ubuntu 18.04
  instead of Ubuntu 16.04.
  
  .. warning:: MongoDB 4.0. does not support Ubuntu 18.04

     MongoDB 4.0. does not support Ubuntu 18.04. If you want to use
     MongoDB 4.0. with the |k8s-op-short|, use previously released
     images.

- Ubuntu based |onprem| images after 4.4.13 are based on Ubuntu 20.04
  instead of Ubuntu 16.04.

- Newly released UBI images for the |k8s-op-short|, |onprem| and

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````
.. warning:: Breaking Changes
   
   - Beginning with this release, you can use any version of MongoDB
     for the Application Database. You must specify this version
     explicitly when you deploy the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource.
     
     .. include:: /includes/facts/fact-which-appdb-version.rst

   - To upgrade the |k8s-op-short|, you must specify the Application
     Database's version. For more information, see :ref:`migrate-to-ent-appdb-version`.

   - Each Application Database Pod consists of the following containers
     (instead of one container with a bundled MongoDB version, as in previous
     releases): 
   
     - ``mongodb``
     - ``mongodb-agent``
     - ``mongodb-agent-monitoring``
   
- The ``spec.applicationDatabase.persistent`` setting is removed. The
  |k8s-op-short| always uses persistent volumes for the Application
  Database deployed by your ``MongoDBOpsManager`` custom resources.

.. _ent-op-1.10.x:

|k8s-op-short|
``````````````

Changes
+++++++

- Updates the |k8s-crds| from the ``v1beta1`` version to the ``v1`` 
  version. Clusters on |k8s| 1.16 and higher should remain unimpacted. The |k8s-crds| cannot install in clusters on |k8s| versions lower than 1.16.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue that prevented multiple |onprem| resources from 
  having the same name in different namespaces.
- Fixes an issue that caused new MongoDB resources created with 
  :setting:`spec.backup.mode=disabled <spec.backup.mode>` to fail.
- Fixes an issue with saving changes on the :guilabel:`S3 Store` page.
- Fixes an issue that changed the replica set status to ``Fail``, 
  increased the replica set members, and disabled |tls|.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````
  
Known Issues
++++++++++++

- When you use remote or hybrid mode, and set
  ``automation.versions.download.baseUrl``, you must set the
  ``automation.versions.download.baseUrl.allowOnlyAvailableBuilds``
  property to ``false``. |onprem| 4.4.11 fixes this issue.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````

.. admonition:: Breaking Changes
   :class: warning

   This release introduces:

   - A new Application Database image,
     ``mongodb-enterprise-appdb:10.2.15.5958-1_4.2.11-ent``. The image
     includes MongoDB ``4.2.11-ent`` instead of
     ``4.2.2-ent``. You must push the new image to any private
     repositories that your |k8s-op-short| installation uses, otherwise
     the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource won't start.
   - A new required environment variable,
     ``APPDB_AGENT_VERSION``. If you don't set ``APPDB_AGENT_VERSION``,
     the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource can't fetch the {+mdbagent+}
     version for the Application Database.

Known Issues
++++++++++++

- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.

Changes
+++++++

- The |onprem| user now has :manual:`backup
  </reference/built-in-roles/#backup>`, :manual:`restore
  </reference/built-in-roles/#restore>` and :manual:`hostManager
  </reference/built-in-roles/#hostManager>` roles, allowing for backups
  and restores on the Application Database.

- If you omit :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.version`, the
  |k8s-op-short| uses ``4.2.11-ent`` as the default MongoDB version.

New Images

|k8s-op-short|
``````````````

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short| didn't close connections to
  |onprem|, causing too many open file descriptors.

``MongoDB`` Resource
````````````````````

Changes
+++++++

- You can now configure continuous backup for a MongoDB database
  resource in its |k8s-crd|.

  .. note::

     To enable continuous backup in the MongoDB |k8s-crd|, you must
     :opsmgrkube:`enable backup <spec.backup.enabled>` in an |onprem|
     instance that you deployed using the |k8s-op-short|.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` Resource
``````````````````````````````

Known Issues
++++++++++++

- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.

Changes
+++++++

- When you upgrade the |k8s-op-short| to this version, the
  |k8s-op-short| deletes and re-creates the Backup Daemon statefulset.

  This is a safe operation.

  The new |k8s| service that enables Queryable Backups requires a change
  to the ``matchLabels`` Backup Daemon |k8s-statefulset| attribute.

- The |k8s-op-short| changes the way it collects the status of
  {+mdbagent+}\s in Application Database |k8s-pods|.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2020-11-16*

Known Issues
````````````

- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.

Bug Fix
```````

Fixes an issue where the |onprem| resource would reach a ``Failing``
state when both :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity` and
:opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` were enabled.

.. _ent-op-1.8.1:

|k8s-op-full| 1.8.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2020-11-13*

Known Issues
````````````

- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.
- When both :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity` and
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` are enabled in |onprem| at the same
  time, the |onprem| resource fails to reconcile.

Bug Fixes
`````````
- Fixes a bug where
  :setting:`spec.security.authentication.ignoreUnknownUsers` could not
  be modified after creating a MongoDB resource.
- Fixes failed queryable backups. The |k8s-op-short| now creates a
  |k8s| Service that |onprem| uses to access backups.
- Fixes an issue that made it impossible to move from non-|tls| to a
  |tls|-enabled Application Database.

Improvements
````````````
- Init containers do not run as root.
- |onprem| Backup daemon runs in unprivileged mode.
- To manage Database Pod resources, use the
  :setting:`spec.podSpec.podTemplate` MongoDB Custom Resource attribute.
  For an example resource definition of each supported type, see the
  :github:`samples/mongodb/podspec </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/samples/mongodb/podspec>`

|k8s-op-full| 1.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2020-09-30*

.. admonition:: Breaking Changes
   :class: warning

   The {+mdb-ent-db+} image now requires an init container. 
   If you are using a private repository, you must set the ``INIT_DATABASE_IMAGE_REPOSITORY`` 
   environment variable in the Operator deployment, and the new 
   init container must exist inside this repository.

MongoDB Resource Changes
````````````````````````

- Introduces new configuration fields:

  - :setting:`spec.security.authentication.requireClientTLSAuthentication`
    for using the MongoDB Agent client certificate authentication in
    conjunction with any other authentication mechanism.
  - :setting:`spec.security.authentication.agents.clientCertificateSecretRef`
    for configuring the client TLS certificate used by the MongoDB
    Agent when enabling ClientTLSAuthentication.

- Changes the default permissions of volumes created from secrets from ``0644``
  to ``0640``.

Ops Manager Resource Changes
````````````````````````````

- Allows the Application Database to be configured with SCRAM-SHA-256
  authentication when using |onprem| 4.4 or newer version.
- Changes the validation of the |onprem| :setting:`spec.version` field
  to allow for tags that do not match the :github:`semver </blang/semver>`
  requirements. The :setting:`spec.version` field must start with the
  ``Major.Minor.Patch`` string that represents the |onprem| version. To
  learn more about this field, see :ref:`k8s-om-specification`.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Fixes an issue that caused the Operator to choose an incorrect project
  name when creating MongoDB users.
- Fixes an issue that caused the MongoDB |onprem| CRD to have the CA
  path in the incorrect location.
- Fixes a bug where the MongoDB Agent could not correctly recognize the
  parameters that passed through :setting:`spec.agent.startupOptions`.
- Fixes an issue that could cause potential deadlock when certain
  configuration options are modified in parallel.

Known Issues
````````````

- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.

- When you enable queryable backup, you must manually create two
  additional services for:

  - Exposing the queryable backup port (default: 25999) for the |onprem|
    pod.
  - The Backup Daemon pod, to ensure that it is resolvable from the |onprem| pod.

- If you deploy |onprem| in
  :ref:`local mode <deploy-om-container-local-mode>` and upgrade from
  v4.4.1, you must upgrade the MongoDB tools located in the
  ``automation.versions.directory``, which defaults to
  ``/mongodb-ops-manager/mongodb-releases/``.

  .. seealso:: :ref:`deploy-om-container-local-mode`.

------------------------

.. _ent-op-1.7.1:

|k8s-op-full| 1.7.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2020-09-02*

MongoDB Resource Changes
````````````````````````

- Supports setting the Distinguished Name (DN) of the LDAP group to
  which the {+mdbagent+} user belongs with the
  :setting:`spec.security.authentication.ldap.automationLdapGroupDN`
  setting.
- Requires you to provide
  :setting:`spec.security.authentication.agents.mode` if you specify
  more than one mode in :setting:`spec.security.authentication.modes`.
- Supports setting {+mdbagent+} startup parameters for MongoDB Database
  resources with the following settings:

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.startupOptions`
  - :setting:`spec.agent.startupOptions`
  - :setting:`spec.configSrv.agent.startupOptions`
  - :setting:`spec.mongos.agent.startupOptions`
  - :setting:`spec.shard.agent.startupOptions`

Bug Fixes
`````````

- |onprem| resources:

  - Fixes a bug where you could not enable ``SCRAM-SHA``
    authentication for application database resources using certain
    MongoDB versions with |onprem| 4.4.
  - Fixes a bug where application database monitoring was not correctly
    configured in |onprem| when you enabled |tls| for the application
    database.
  - Fixes a bug to move the |onprem| |certauth| configuration from
    :setting:`spec.applicationDatabase.security.tls.ca` to
    ``spec.security.tls.ca``.

- MongoDB resources:

  - Fixes a bug that prevented you from increasing or decreasing the number
    of members in a replica set or a sharded cluster by more than one
    member at a time for MongoDB 4.4 deployments.
  - Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short| could not enable agent
    authentication if you enabled ``LDAP`` authentication for a MongoDB
    resource.
  - Fixes an issue where you could not create ``SCRAM`` users and enable
    ``SCRAM`` authentication in any order for a MongoDB resource.
  - Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short| did not remove the backup
    automation configuration before starting the agent on a MongoDB
    resource |k8s-pod|.

Known Issues
````````````

- If you enable |tls| on the application database, you must not provide the
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.version` field in an |onprem|
  resource definition.
- You can't use MongoDB 4.4 as an application database for an |onprem|
  resource.
- When you upgrade to the |k8s-op-short| 1.7.1, you might have to delete
  the ``mongodb-enterprise-operator`` deployment due to deployment
  configuration changes.

  This is a safe operation. Deleting the
  ``mongodb-enterprise-operator`` pod does not affect the MongoDB
  |k8s-custom-resources|.
- If you use |tls| certificates signed by a custom |certauth|, you must:

  - Omit the :opsmgrkube:`spec.version.applicationDatabase` setting from
    your |onprem| resource definition, and
  - Deploy |onprem| in :ref:`local mode
    <deploy-om-container-local-mode>`. You must manually copy
    installation archives for all MongoDB versions you want to use to
    a |k8s-pv| for the |onprem| StatefulSet.

.. _ent-op-1.3.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.3 Series
------------------------

.. _ent-op-1.3.1:

|k8s-op-full| 1.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-11-08*

.. important::

  This release introduces significant changes that may not be
  compatible with previous deployments or resource configurations.
  :ref:`Migrate to one resource per project <migrate-single-cluster>` before
  upgrading the |k8s-op-short|.

MongoDB Resource Changes
````````````````````````

- Requires one MongoDB resource per |onprem| project. If you
  have more than one MongoDB resource in a project, all resources will
  change to a ``Pending`` status and the |k8s-op-short| won’t perform
  any changes on them. The existing MongoDB databases will still be
  accessible. You must :ref:`migrate to one resource per project
  <migrate-single-cluster>`.

- Supports ``SCRAM-SHA`` authentication mode. See :github:`the MongoDB
  Enterprise Kubernetes Operator GitHub repository
  </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/samples/mongodb/authentication/scram>`
  for examples.

- Requires that the project (:ref:`ConfigMap <create-k8s-project>`) and
  credentials (:ref:`secret <create-k8s-secret>`)
  referenced from a MongoDB resource be in the same namespace.

- Adds OpenShift installation files (|yaml| file and Helm chart
  configuration).


Ops Manager Resource Changes (Alpha Release)
````````````````````````````````````````````

- Supports highly available :ref:`Ops Manager resources
  <k8s-om-specification>` by introducing the :opsmgrkube:`spec.replicas`
  setting.

- Runs |k8s-pods| as a non-root user.

.. _ent-op-1.3.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-10-25*

.. important::

  This release introduces significant changes that may not be
  compatible with previous deployments or resource configurations.
  :ref:`Migrate to one resource per project <migrate-single-cluster>`
  before installing or upgrading the |k8s-op-short|.

Specification Schema Changes
````````````````````````````

- Moves to a :ref:`one resource per project configuration <migrate-single-cluster>`.
  This follows the warnings introduced in a :ref:`previous version of the operator <ent-op-1.2.3>`.
  The operator now requires each cluster to be contained within a new project.

- Authentication settings are now contained within the
  :ref:`security section <security-settings>` of the MongoDB resource
  specification rather than the project ConfigMap.

- Replaces the ``project`` field with the
  :setting:`spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name` or
  :setting:`spec.cloudManager.configMapRef.name` fields.

- :ref:`User resources <k8s-manage-db-users>` now refer to MongoDB
  resources rather than project ConfigMaps.

- No longer requires ``data.projectName`` in the project ConfigMap. The
  name of the project defaults to the name of the MongoDB resource in
  |k8s|.

Ops Manager Resource Changes (Alpha Release)
````````````````````````````````````````````

This release introduces significant changes to the |onprem| resource's
architecture. The |onprem| application database is now managed by
the |k8s-op-short|, not by |onprem|.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Stops unnecessary recreation of NodePorts.

- Fixes logging so it's always in JSON format.

- Sets ``USER`` in the |k8s-op-short| Docker image.

|k8s-op-full| 1.2 Series
------------------------

.. _ent-op-1.2.5:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes CVE-2020-7922: |k8s| Operator generates potentially insecure
certificates.

CVE Description
```````````````

X.509 certificates generated by the |k8s-op| may allow an attacker with
access to the |k8s| cluster improper access to MongoDB instances.
Customers who do not use X.509 authentication, and those who do not use
the |k8s-op-short| to generate their X.509 certificates are unaffected.

.. _ent-op-1.2.4:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-10-02*

- Increases stability of Sharded Cluster deployments.
- Improves internal testing infrastructure.

.. _ent-op-1.2.3:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-09-13*

- **Update:** The |k8s-op-full| will remove support for multiple
  clusters per project in a future release. If a project contains more
  than one cluster, a warning will be added to the status of the
  MongoDB Resources. Additionally, any new cluster being added to a
  non-empty project will result in a :guilabel:`Failed` state, and won't
  be processed.

- **Fix:** The overall stability of the operator has been improved. The
  operator is now more conservative in resource updates both on
  |k8s| and |com|.

.. _ent-op-1.2.2:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-08-30*

- **Security Fix:** Clusters configured by |k8s-op-short| versions
  1.0 through 1.2.1 used an insufficiently strong keyfile for internal
  cluster authentication between ``mongod`` processes. This only affects
  clusters which are using X.509 for user authentication, but are not
  using X.509 for internal cluster authentication. Users are advised to
  upgrade to version 1.2.2, which will replace all managed keyfiles.

- **Security Fix:** Clusters configured by |k8s-op-short| versions 1.0
  through 1.2.1 used an insufficiently strong password to authenticate
  the MongoDB Agent. This only affects clusters which have been manually
  configured to enable ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, which is not a supported
  configuration. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.2.2, which
  will reset these passwords.

.. _ent-op-1.2.1:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-08-23*

- **Fix:** The |k8s-op-short| no longer recreates |csrs| when X.509
  authentication is enabled and the approved |csrs| have been deleted.

- **Fix:** If the ``OPERATOR_ENV`` environment variable is set to
  something unrecognized by the |k8s-op-short|, it will no longer result
  in a ``CrashLoopBackOff`` of the pod. A default value of ``prod`` is
  used.

- The |k8s-op-short| now supports more than 100 agents in a given
  project.

.. _ent-op-1.2:
.. _ent-op-1.2.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-08-13*

GA Release
``````````

- Adds a
  :k8sdocs:`readinessprobe </tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes>`
  to the MongoDB Pods to improve the reliability of rolling upgrades.

Alpha Release
`````````````

This feature is an alpha release. It is not ready for production use.

- Can use the |k8s-op-short| to manage |onprem| 4.2. To
  :doc:`deploy an |onprem| instance </tutorial/deploy-om-container>`,
  you use a new :ref:`resource <k8s-om-specification>`: ``MongoDBOpsManager``.

.. _ent-op-1.1.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.1 Series
------------------------

.. _ent-op-1.1:

|k8s-op-full| 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-07-19*

- **Fix:** Adds sample yaml files, in particular, the attribute related
  to
  :manual:`featureCompatibilityVersion </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
- **Fix:** |tls| can be disabled in a deployment.
- **Improvement:** Adds
  :github:`script </blob/master/support/mdb_operator_diagnostic_data.sh>`
  in the
  :github:`support </tree/master/support>` directory that can gather
  information of your MongoDB resources in Kubernetes.
- **Improvement:** In a |tls| environment, the |k8s-op-short| can use a
  custom |certauth|. All the certificates must be passed as |k8s-secret|
  objects.

.. _ent-op-0.x:

|k8s-op-full| Beta Series
-------------------------

.. _ent-op-0.12:

|k8s-op-full| 0.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-06-07*

- Rolling upgrades of MongoDB resources ensure that
  :method:`rs.stepDown() <rs.stepDown>` is called for the primary
  member. Requires MongoDB patch version 4.0.8 and later or MongoDB
  patch version 4.1.10 and later.
- During a MongoDB major version upgrade, the
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` field can be set.
- Fixed a bug where replica sets with more than seven members could
  not be created.
- X.509 Authentication can be enabled at the
  :ref:`Project level <create-k8s-project>`. Requires |cloud-short|,
  |onprem| patch version 4.0.11 and later, or |onprem| patch version
  4.1.7 and later.
- Internal cluster authentication based on X.509 can be enabled at the
  :doc:`deployment </deploy>` level.
- MongoDB users with X.509 authentication can be created, using the
  new ``MongoDBUser`` custom resource.

.. _ent-op-0.11:

|k8s-op-full| 0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-04-29*

- ``NodePort`` service creation can be disabled.

- |tls| can be enabled for internal authentication between MongoDB in
  replica sets and sharded clusters. The |tls| certificates are created
  automatically by the |k8s-op-short|. Refer to the sample
  ``.yaml`` files in the
  :github:`GitHub repository </tree/master/samples>`
  for examples.

- Wide or asterisk roles have been replaced with strict listing of
  verbs in ``roles.yaml``.

- Printing ``mdb`` objects with ``kubectl`` will provide more
  information about the MongoDB object: type, state, and MongoDB server
  version.

.. _ent-op-0.10:

|k8s-op-full| 0.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-04-02*

- The |k8s-op-short| and database images are now based on ubuntu:16.04.

- The |k8s-op-short| now uses a single |k8s-crd| named ``MongoDB``
  instead of the ``MongoDbReplicaSet``, ``MongoDbShardedCluster``, and
  ``MongoDbStandalone`` CRDs.

  .. important::

     Follow the :ref:`upgrade procedure <upgrade-k8s-operator>` to
     transfer existing ``MongoDbReplicaSet``, ``MongoDbShardedCluster``,
     and ``MongoDbStandalone`` resources to the new format.

- For a list of the packages installed and any security vulnerabilities
  detected in our build process, see:

  - :qr-mdb:`MongoDB Enterprise Operator </mongodb-enterprise-operator?tab=tags>`

  - :qr-mdb:`{+mdb-ent-db+} </mongodb-enterprise-database?tab=tags>`

.. _ent-op-0.9:

|k8s-op-full| 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-03-19*

- The Operator and Database images are now based on
  ``debian:stretch-slim`` which is the latest and up-to-date Docker
  image for Debian 9.

.. _ent-op-0.8:

|k8s-op-full| 0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-02-26*

- Perform |onprem| clean-up on deletion of MongoDB resource without the
  use of finalisers.

- **Bug fix:** Race conditions when communicating with |onprem|.

- **Bug fix:** ``ImagePullSecrets`` being incorrectly initialized in
  OpenShift.

- **Bug fix:** Unintended fetching of closed projects.

- **Bug fix:** Creation of duplicate organizations.

- **Bug fix:** Reconciliation could fail for the MongoDB resource if
  some other resources in |onprem| were in error state.


.. _ent-op-0.7:

|k8s-op-full| 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2019-02-01*

- Improved detailed status field for MongoDB resources.

- The |k8s-op-short| watches changes to configuration parameters in a
  project configMap and the credentials secret then performs a rolling
  upgrade for relevant Kubernetes resources.

- Added |json| structured logging for Automation Agent pods.

- Support |dns-srv| records for MongoDB access.

- Bug fix: Avoiding unnecessary reconciliation.

- Bug fix: Improved Ops Manager/Cloud Manager state management for
  deleted resources.

.. _ent-op-0.6:

|k8s-op-full| 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-12-17*

.. _controller-runtime: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/

- Refactored code to use the controller-runtime_ library to fix issues
  where Operator could leave resources in inconsistent state. This also
  introduced a proper reconciliation process.

- Added new ``status`` field for all MongoDB Kubernetes resources.

- Can configure Operator to watch any single namespace or all
  namespaces in a cluster (requires cluster role).

- Improved database logging by adding a new configuration property
  ``logLevel``. This property is set to ``INFO`` by default.
  Automation Agent and MongoDB logs are merged in to a single log
  stream.

- Added new configuration Operator timeout. It defines waiting time
  for database pods start while updating |k8s-mdbrscs|.

- **Fix:** Fixed failure detection for ``mongos``.

.. _ent-op-0.5:

|k8s-op-full| 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-11-14*

- Image for database no longer includes the binary for the Automation
  Agent. The container downloads the Automation Agent binary from
  |mms| when it starts.

- **Fix:** Communication with |mms| failed if the project with the same
  name existed in different organization.

.. _ent-op-0.4:

|k8s-op-full| 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-10-04*

- If a backup was enabled in |onprem| for a Replica Set or Sharded
  Cluster that the |k8s-op-short| created, then the |k8s-op-short|
  disables the backup before removing a resource.

- Improved persistence support:

  - The data, journal and log directories are mounted to three
    mountpoints in one or three volumes depending upon the
    ``podSpec.persistence`` setting.

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 40 60
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Setting
         - Mount Directories to
       * - ``podSpec.persistence.single``
         - One volume
       * - ``podSpec.persistence.multiple``
         - Three volumes

    Prior to this release, only the data directory was mounted to
    persistent storage.

  - A new parameter, ``labelSelector``, allows you to specify the
    selector for volumes that |k8s-op-short| should consider mounting.

  - If |k8s-sc| is not specified in the ``persistence``
    configuration, then the default ``StorageClass`` for the cluster is
    used. In most of public cloud providers, this results in dynamic
    volume provisioning.

.. _ent-op-0.3:

|k8s-op-full| 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-08-07*

- The Operator no longer creates the CustomResourceDefinition objects.
  The user needs to create them manually. Download and apply
  :github:`this new yaml file </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/crds.yaml>`
  (``crd.yaml``) to create/configure these objects.

- ClusterRoles are no longer required. How the Operator watches
  resources has changed. Until the last release, the Operator would
  watch for any resource on any |k8s-ns|. With 0.3, the Operator
  watches for resources in the same namespace in which it was created.
  To support multiple namespaces, multiple Operators can be installed.
  This allows isolation of MongoDB deployments.

- Permissions changes were made to how PersistentVolumes are mounted.

- Added configuration to Operator to not create
  :k8sdocs:`SecurityContexts </tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/>`
  for |k8s-pods|. This solves an issue with OpenShift which does not
  allow this setting when ``SecurityContextContraints`` are used.

  If you are using Helm, set ``managedSecurityContext`` to ``true``.
  This tells the Operator to not create ``SecurityContext`` for
  |k8s-pods|, satisfying the OpenShift requirement.

- The combination of ``projectName`` and ``orgId`` replaces
  ``projectId`` alone to configure the connection to |onprem|.
  The project is created if it doesn't exist.

.. _ent-op-0.2:

|k8s-op-full| 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-08-03*

- Calculates WiredTiger memory cache.

.. _ent-op-0.1:

|k8s-op-full| 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2018-06-27*

**Initial Release**

- Can deploy standalone instances, replica sets, sharded clusters
  using |k8s| configuration files.
