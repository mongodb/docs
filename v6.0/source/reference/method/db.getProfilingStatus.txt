.. method:: db.getProfilingStatus()

   :returns: The current :dbcommand:`profile` level,
             :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs` setting,
             and :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpSampleRate`
             setting.

             You can set a ``filter`` to control which operations are logged by 
             the profiler. When set, any configured filters are also returned by
             :method:`db.getProfilingStatus()`, along with a ``note``
             explaining filter behavior.
 
             You can set the profiling filter with either:
             
             - the :method:`db.setProfilingLevel()` shell method, or

             - the :setting:`operationProfiling.filter` configuration file option.
