Description
-----------

Starts the synchronization between a source and destination cluster.

Requirements
------------

State
~~~~~

To use the ``start`` endpoint, ``mongosync`` must be in the ``IDLE``
state.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The user specified in the ``mongosync`` connection string must have the
required permissions on the source and destination clusters. Refer to
:ref:`c2c-permissions-and-roles` to ensure that the user has the correct
permissions to start the synchronization.

Multiple ``mongosync`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that you use the configured ``mongosync`` user in the connection 
strings for the :setting:`cluster0` or :setting:`cluster1` settings when
you start ``mongosync``.

   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 13 13 54

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - ``source``
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the source cluster.
    
   * - ``destination``
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the destination cluster.

   * - ``buildIndexes``
     - string
     - Optional
     - .. _mongosync-build-indexes:
       
       Configures index builds during sync.

       Supported Options:

       - ``afterDataCopy`` (the default in source clusters running MongoDB
         6.0 or later) causes ``mongosync`` to build indexes 
         on the destination cluster after :ref:`collection copy 
         <c2c-collection-copy>`. This includes indexes that exist on the 
         source cluster at the point of initialization and indexes that are 
         created during migration. This results
         in a faster migration for indexed databases.

         .. |build-index-param| replace:: ``afterDataCopy``
         .. include:: /includes/fact-build-indexes-after-copy.rst
         .. include:: /includes/fact-parameter-supported-6.0.rst
         
       - ``beforeDataCopy`` (the default in source clusters running pre-6.0)
         causes ``mongosync`` to build indexes
         on the destination cluster during initialization. This includes indexes
         that exist on the source cluster at the point of initialization and 
         indexes that are created during migration.
         
       - ``excludeHashed`` causes ``mongosync`` to skip building hashed indexes
         during sync. This can `improve performance <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/drop-a-hashed-shard-key-index/>`__
         for large collections.

       - ``excludeHashedAfterCopy`` causes ``mongosync`` to build non-hashed indexes 
         on the destination cluster after :ref:`collection copy <c2c-collection-copy>`.
         ``excludeHashedAfterCopy`` also skips building hashed indexes.
         This results in a faster migration for indexed databases, due to both
         building indexes after initial data copy and skipping building hashed indexes.

         .. |build-index-param| replace:: ``excludeHashedAfterCopy``
         .. include:: /includes/fact-build-indexes-after-copy.rst
         .. include:: /includes/fact-parameter-supported-6.0.rst

       - ``never`` causes ``mongosync`` to skip building unnecessary indexes
         during sync. This can improve migration performance, especially with
         index heavy workloads.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-verifier-buildIndexes

         :red:`WARNING:` Do **not** manually build indexes on the destination cluster
         while ``mongosync`` is performing a migration.  Wait until the migration is fully
         committed.

         For more information on the indexes it does build, see 
         :ref:`c2c-required-indexes`.

       ``/start`` returns an error when ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``
       and ``reversible`` is set to ``true``.

       If you call ``/start`` without specifying the ``buildIndexes`` option,
       ``mongosync`` builds indexes on the destination cluster.

       .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

   * - ``enableUserWriteBlocking``
     - string or boolean
     - Optional
     - .. include:: /includes/fact-parameter-supported-6.0.rst
       
       Supported options:
       
       - ``"sourceAndDestination"``: blocks writes on the destination 
         cluster while the migration is in progress, and unblocks writes right
         before the :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint reports 
         that ``canWrite`` is ``true``.  Blocks writes on the source
         cluster after ``mongosync`` calls the :ref:`/commit <c2c-api-commit>`
         endpoint.

         You can also use ``true`` for backward compatibility.

       - ``"none"``: no write blocking occurs. You can also use ``false``
         for backward compatibility.

       - ``"destinationOnly"``: blocks writes on the destination
         cluster while migration is in progress, and unblocks writes right
         before ``canWrite`` is ``true``.

       To reverse sync, the ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` field must be set
       to ``"sourceAndDestination"``. To allow the source cluster 
       to accept writes again, for example after running migration tests, 
       run the following command: 

       .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/api/start/2.sh
          :language: shell

       Default value is ``"destinationOnly"``.

   * - ``includeNamespaces``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Filters the databases or collections to include in sync. 

       .. include:: /includes/api/facts/namespace-explanation.rst

       .. versionadded:: 1.1

   * - ``excludeNamespaces``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Filters the databases or collections to exclude from sync.

       .. include:: /includes/api/facts/namespace-explanation.rst

       .. versionadded:: 1.6

   * - ``copyInNaturalOrder``
     - array of documents
     - Optional
     - .. _c2c-copy-natural-order:

       Copies a list of databases and collections in their natural order to the destination cluster.
       The natural order is the order in which you previously inserted the documents into the database.
       You must pass in an array of documents that each represent a database and its collections. 
       For a syntax example, see :ref:`Natural Scan Capability <c2c-natural-scan-capability>`.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` Only use the ``copyInNaturalOrder`` option for collections that explicitly set a 
       random ``_id`` field. Using this option for collections of size 30GB or greater significantly reduces 
       the time that the :ref:`collection copy <c2c-collection-copy>` phase takes.

       :red:`WARNING:` If you ``/resume`` a ``mongosync`` migration after a ``/pause`` or interruption that 
       has the ``copyInNaturalOrder`` option enabled for collections greather that 500GB in size, 
       the migration can take multiple hours to complete.

   * - ``preExistingDestinationData``
     - boolean
     - Optional
     - .. _c2c-pre-existing-dest-data:
     
       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` This feature is currently in Public Preview. Please
       review the behavior and limitations in this section in order to use this
       feature in production environments.
     
       Default value is ``false``.

       If set to ``true``:

       - ``mongosync`` allows pre-existing namespaces on the destination cluster.

       - You must specify a namespace filter by using one or both of the ``includeNamespaces``
         and ``excludeNamespaces`` parameters in your request.
         
       - If :ref:`embedded verification <c2c-embedded-verifier>` 
         is enabled, the namespace filter must filter
         out any pre-existing collections or indexes on the destination cluster,
         even if they don't exist on the source cluster. Otherwise, embedded
         verification fails.

       - Ensure that you follow all directions in the :ref:`cutover process
         <c2c-cutover-process>` to ensure that no unsafe writes occur on the
         source or destination cluster. ``mongosync`` does not enable write-blocking
         when you enable this feature, so you must manually ensure that these
         writes don't occur.
       
       - ``mongosync`` does not ensure that sufficient resources, such as disk space,
         compute, and oplog, exist on the destination cluster to accommodate 
         the additional load of the migration. Monitor your destination cluster to
         ensure that it has sufficient resources.
      
       - ``mongosync`` does not migrate views when you use this feature. 
         It ignores views on the source cluster during
         migration. You must migrate views separately after cutover.

       - The default :ref:`load level <mongosync-load-level>` is changed from 3 to 2.

       - You can leave the balancer enabled for a sharded destination
         cluster during migration.

       - The default :ref:`write-blocking mode <c2c-write-blocking>` 
         is changed from ``"destinationOnly"`` to ``"none"``. You cannot
         set write-blocking on individual collections on either the source or
         destination cluster, because write-blocking is only available at
         the cluster level. Additionally, namespace filtering is not compatible with
         dual write-blocking.
         
       - ``mongosync`` does not allow reverse migration.

       - ``mongosync`` outputs the following log message in the beginning of
         migration:
 
         .. code-block:: shell
            
            ATTENTION! Data migration to a non-empty cluster is allowed 
            with the preExistingDestinationData set to true in the 
            request to start migration. This feature is currently in 
            preview. Please see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/api/start/ 
            for important requirements and limitations.

       See :ref:`Filtered Sync Limitations <c2c-filtering-limitations>`.

   * - ``reversible``
     - boolean
     - Optional
     - If set to ``true``, enables the sync operation to be
       reversed.

       To reverse sync, the ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` field must be set
       to ``sourceAndDestination``.

       This option is not supported for the following configurations:

       * Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster

       * Sync sharded clusters that have different numbers of shards

       * Reversible sync when ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` Setting reversible to ``true`` is only supported 
       for source clusters running MongoDB 6.0 or later.

       For more information, see the :ref:`reverse <c2c-api-reverse>` endpoint.
       
       Default value is ``false``.

   * - ``sharding``
     - document
     - Optional
     - Configures sync between a replica set and sharded cluster.
       Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster requires this
       option.

       For more information, see :ref:`c2c-api-start-sharding`. 

       .. versionadded:: 1.1

   * - ``verification``
     - Document 
     - Optional
     - Configures the embedded verifier.

       For more information, see :ref:`c2c-start-verifier`.

       .. versionadded:: 1.9

   * - ``verification.enabled``
     - Bool
     - Optional
     - Enables the embedded verifier. The verifier performs a
       series of verification checks on supported collections on
       the destination cluster to confirm that the migration was
       successful.

       If the verifier finds no errors, ``mongosync``
       transitions to the ``COMMITTED`` state. If it does
       encounter errors, it fails the migration.

       The verifier is enabled by default.

       :red:`WARNING`: The verifier does not check all
       collections or data. For details, see
       :ref:`c2c-verify-embedded-limitations`.

       .. versionadded:: 1.9


.. _c2c-api-start-sharding:

Sharding Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.1

To sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster, set the 
``sharding`` option to shard collections on the destination cluster.

``mongosync`` throws an error if the ``sharding`` option is not set when
syncing from a replica set to a sharded cluster. ``mongosync`` also
throws an error if the ``sharding`` option is set with any other
configuration.

The ``sharding`` option has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 15 15 70

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``createSupportingIndexes``
     - boolean
     - .. _mongosync-create-supporting-indexes-param:

       Optional. Sets whether sync creates a supporting index
       for the shard key, if none exists. The default is ``false``.
       
       .. |build-index-param| replace:: ``"afterDataCopy"`` or ``"excludeHashedAfterCopy"``
       .. include:: /includes/fact-build-indexes-after-copy.rst

       If you set this parameter to ``true`` and set ``buildIndexes`` 
       to ``"excludeHashed"`` or ``"excludeHashedAfterCopy"``, 
       then ``mongosync`` does not create supporting hashed indexes 
       for hashed shard keys on the destination
       cluster. ``mongosync`` still builds non-hashed supporting
       indexes for non-hashed shard keys.

       For more information and limitations, see 
       :ref:`c2c-supporting-index-behavior`.

   * - ``shardingEntries``
     - array of documents
     - Required. Sets the namespace and key of collections to shard
       during sync.

       Collections not included in this array sync to unsharded 
       collections on the destination cluster. If set with an empty
       array, no collections are sharded.

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.collection``
     - string
     - Sets the collection to shard. 

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.database``
     - string
     - Sets the database of the collection to shard.
 
   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.shardCollection``
     - document 
     - Sets the shard key to generate on the destination cluster.

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.shardCollection``
       | ``.key``
     - array 
     - Sets the fields to use for the shard key.

.. _c2c-disabled-verifier:

Start with the Verifier Disabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.9, the embedded verifier runs by default when you
start a migration. If you need to disable it, set
``verification.enabled`` to ``false``.

Request:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/start-no-verifier.sh

Response:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

You should verify that a migration was successful before
transferring your application load to the destination cluster.
If you need to disable the verifier for any reason, use an
alternative :ref:`method <c2c-verification>` to verify sync.

Behavior
--------

.. _c2c-start-verifier:

Embedded Verifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` provides an embedded verifier to
determine whether data transfer from the source cluster to the
destination was successful.

When enabled, the verifier performs a series of verification
checks on the destination cluster. If any of these checks return
an error, the verifier fails the migration. If all checks
succeed, ``mongosync`` transitions to the ``COMMITTED`` state.

To disable the verifier, see :ref:`c2c-disabled-verifier`.

The ``/start`` endpoint returns an error if you enable
verification checks that are not supported by the source or
destination cluster or if there is insufficient memory. 

State
~~~~~

If the ``start`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``RUNNING`` state.

.. _c2c-shard-replica-sets:

Shard Replica Sets 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster requires the 
``sharding`` option. This option configures how ``mongosync`` shards
collections.

The ``sharding.shardingEntries`` array specifies the collections to shard.
Collections that are not listed in this array replicate as unsharded.

For more information, see :ref:`Sharded Cluster Behavior
<c2c-sharded-cluster-behavior>`. 

.. _c2c-supporting-index-behavior:

Supporting Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` syncs indexes from the source cluster to the destination
cluster. When syncing from a replica set to a sharded cluster,
``mongosync`` may require an additional index to support the shard key,
which may not exist on the source cluster.

``mongosync`` can create supporting indexes for sharded collections during sync.
This is done by setting the ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` option.

When ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` is ``false`` (the default): 

* Each shard key you provide for the ``sharding.shardingEntries`` option
  must have an existing index on the source cluster.

* One of the indexes used for the shard key must have simple collation if the 
  collection uses any other collation.

* To use a unique index in the shard key, you must specify its uniqueness when
  you create the index on the source cluster. 

* Unique indexes on the source cluster that are incompatible with the requested
  shard key on the destination cluster, such as a unique index on the source
  that does not contain the requested shard key as a prefix on the destination,
  can cause ``mongosync`` to fail.

* .. |build-index-param| replace:: ``"afterDataCopy"`` or ``"excludeHashedAfterCopy"``
  .. include:: /includes/fact-build-indexes-after-copy.rst

When ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` is ``true``: 

* If the supporting indexes exist on the source cluster, ``mongosync`` 
  syncs the indexes to the destination cluster and uses them 
  as shard keys. 

* If the supporting indexes don't exist, ``mongosync`` creates them on the
  destination cluster.

The ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` option affects all sharded
collections.

.. _rename-during-sync:

Rename During Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collections listed in the ``sharding.shardingEntries`` array 
when synced from a replica set to a sharded cluster 
become sharded collections on the destination cluster.

Renaming a collection (such as with the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command)
on the source cluster after calling ``start`` but before ``mongosync`` begins 
to copy the collection can block the collection from sharding on the destination.

.. note:: 

   Renaming collections to use a different database while syncing from a
   replica set to a sharded cluster is not supported.
    

To check whether it is safe to rename collections, call the 
:ref:`c2c-api-progress` endpoint and check the value of the 
``collectionCopy.estimatedCopiedBytes`` field in the return document. 

* A value of 0 indicates that ``mongosync`` has not started to copy the
  collection.

  Renaming a collection at this point may result in an unsharded collection 
  on the destination cluster, as the transition to copying can happen before
  the rename takes effect on the source.

* A value greater than 0 indicates that ``mongosync`` has started the copy.
  Renaming the collection from this point on does not block
  its sharding on the destination cluster, even in the event  of a crash.

.. _c2c-required-indexes:

Required Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you call ``/start`` with the ``buildIndexes`` option set to ``never``,
``mongosync`` skips building unnecessary indexes.

Indexes that are always built include:

* ``mongosync`` builds an index on the ``_id`` field of every
  collection it copies.

* ``mongosync`` builds dummy indexes for each sharded collection that 
  does not have an index to support the shard key on the destination 
  cluster. When ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``, ``mongosync`` 
  retains this index after commit.

Natural Scan Capability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you call ``/start`` with the ``copyInNaturalOrder`` option, you must specify the databases and collections by using documents, such as in the following example.
