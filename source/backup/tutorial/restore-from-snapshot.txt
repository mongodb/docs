==============================
Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With |backup|, you can restore from a stored snapshot or, if you are
restoring a replica set, you may
build a :doc:`custom snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>` reflecting a
different point in the last 24 hours. For all backups, restoring from
a stored snapshot is faster than restoring from a custom snapshot in the
last 24 hours.

|backup| automatically takes and stores a snapshot every 6 hours. These
snapshots are available for restores following the snapshot
retention policy. For more information about the snapshot retention policy, as 
well as setting your own retention policy, see :doc:`the MMS Backup FAQ page
</backup/faq>`.

For replica sets, you will receive one .tar.gz file containing your data; for
sharded clusters, you will receive a series of .tar.gz files.
