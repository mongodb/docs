Subset Mode
===========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can enable subset mode in |charts| to restrict the input 
collection to ``1000`` randomly selected documents. To enable subset 
mode, use the :guilabel:`Subset` toggle in the :guilabel:`Preview` 
section. The :guilabel:`Subset` toggle for a chart doesn't persist when 
the chart renders on a dashboard. So, if you enable subset mode when 
you build a chart, the data that renders in the dashboard isn't sampled.

.. note::

   When you enable subset mode and you specify a :ref:`filter 
   <charts-filter-documents>`, |charts| takes the sample of ``1000``
   documents *before* it applies the filter. So, |charts| might use 
   fewer than ``1000`` documents to plot the chart.

Use Case
--------

Consider using subset mode when you draft a chart and heavily modify 
chart options. In this situation, subset mode lets the chart render 
quickly during the building process. When you feel satisfied with your 
chart, save it as soon as possible.

.. note::

   Due to the random nature of sampling, when you have subset mode 
   enabled, your visualizations might change each time the chart loads 
   in the chart builder.
