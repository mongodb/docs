MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`sharded cluster` or a :term:`replica set`. For the deployments,
|service| uses the latest stable release of MongoDB with the
:ref:`WiredTiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

An |service| group can have multiple MongoDB clusters.

Create a Cluster
----------------

To create a cluster, go to the :guilabel:`Clusters` view and click the
:guilabel:`Add New Cluster` or :guilabel:`Build a New Cluster` button.
Configure your cluster as described in the steps below. As
you build your cluster, |service| displays the associated costs.

If you are creating the first MongoDB cluster in a group, you will also
create your first MongoDB user.

.. important::

   You must save the admin user and password or you will lose admin
   access to your MongoDB databases until you reset the password. If
   you choose to have |service| generate the admin password, save the
   password when it is displayed. |service| displays it only once.
