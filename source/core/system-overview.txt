=====================
|onprem| Architecture
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

An |onprem| installation includes hosts that run the |application| and
hosts that serve and store application data and snapshots.

.. include:: /images/opsmanager-network-diagram.rst

The |application| requires a dedicated :term:`Application Database`
and, if you enabled backups, :term:`Snapshot Stores <snapshot store>`.

.. _mms-http-service:
.. _application:
.. _mms-application-package:

|application|
-------------

The |application| provides the user interface and the |http| services
the {+mdbagent+} uses to transmit data to and from |onprem|. These are
all stateless and start automatically when the |application| starts.
Multiple instances of the |application| can run if each instance uses
the same configuration and the same application database. Users and
Agents can interact with any instance.

By default, the |application| runs on port ``8080`` and contains the
web interface for managing |onprem| users, monitoring of MongoDB hosts,
and managing host backups.

For a list of |onprem|'s default ports and health-check endpoints, see
:doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`.

.. _backup-daemon:

Backup Daemon Service
---------------------

You can configure any |onprem| instance to run the :term:`Backup
Daemon` service to back up MongoDB databases.

To learn how to start, check the status of, stop, and restart the Backup
daemon on a server, see :ref:`Start and Stop the Backup Daemon
<start-stop-backup-daemon>`.

How the Backup Daemon performs depends upon the
:manual:`MongoDB version compatibility</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of your database. This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the
current version to one version earlier. For example, with MongoDB 4.2,
the FCV can be ``4.0`` or ``4.2``. Backup functionality changed with
|fcv-link| ``4.2``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      The Backup Daemon service provides the following services for |fcv| 4.2 or later databases:

      - Performs some state updates to the backup job
      - Perform a queryable restore

      The daemon does scheduled work based on data coming
      into the |onprem| from the {+mdbagent+}s. Client applications
      can't communicate with the daemon. Its state and job queues come
      from the :ref:`mms-application-database`. |mms| creates snapshots
      from the database being backed up.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      The Backup Daemon service manages the local copies of the
      backed-up databases and snapshots for each database. The daemon
      does scheduled work based on data coming into the |onprem| from
      the {+mdbagent+}s. Client applications can't communicate with the
      daemon. Its state and job queues come from the
      :ref:`mms-application-database`.

      The local backup copy of a deployment is called the :term:`head
      database`. The :term:`Backup Daemon` stores all its head
      databases in its :term:`head directory` path. To create each head
      database, the daemon's host acts as an "invisible"
      :term:`secondary` for each :term:`replica set` designated for
      backup.

      The daemon takes scheduled snapshots and stores these snapshots
      in a :term:`snapshot store`. When the client requests a restore,
      the daemon retrieves data from the snapshot store. It then
      delivers the snapshot to the requested target.

:ref:`Multiple Backup Daemons <multiple-backup-daemons>` can scale
horizontally to increase your storage and can provide *manual*
failover.

If you run multiple Backup Daemons, |onprem| selects the Backup Daemon
to use when a user enables backup for a deployment. The
:term:`head database` resides with the daemon's host.

Dedicated Storage for Operational Data
--------------------------------------

.. _mms-application-database:

|application| Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem| uses a dedicated MongoDB database to store the |onprem|\'s
operational data. The :term:`application database` runs as a
:term:`replica set` to ensure redundancy and high availability. This
replica set hosts *only* |onprem| data. Before installing |onprem|,
you must :doc:`provision the application database </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`.
This database contains :ref:`application` metadata:

- Monitoring data collected from the {+mdbagent+}s.

- Metadata for |onprem| users, projects, hosts, monitoring data, and
  backup state.

For topology and specifications, see
:ref:`mms-application-database-specifications`.

.. _backup-database:
.. _mms-backup-blockstore-database:

Snapshot Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| creates snapshots of deployments to back up your databases.
You can have |mms| store these snapshots in
:term:`snapshot stores <snapshot store>`. Snapshot stores can be local
databases, local file systems, or cloud-based data stores. There can
be more than one snapshot store per project. |onprem| writes the
recent history of the deployment database to a separate database
regardless of where the snapshots are written.

Snapshot storage include two components:

Snapshot Stores
```````````````

Snapshots can be written to one of three target storage systems:

Oplog Store

The :term:`Oplog Store <Oplog Store Database>` retains the
:term:`oplog` entries that the :term:`Backup Daemon` applies to its
local copies of your backed-up deployments.
