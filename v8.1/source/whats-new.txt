.. important::

   To ensure that the provider major version number aligns with
   {+framework-core+} versions, the {+provider-long+} does not limit breaking
   changes to major version releases. Instead, breaking and significant changes
   are made in minor version releases.

What's New in 8.1
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   The v8.1 provider introduces the following breaking changes:

   - The {+provider-short+} runs all changes as MongoDB transactions. If your
     application uses a {+mdb-server+} version earlier than v5.0, or does not run in a
     replica set, you must reconfigure your application.
   - Changed the default GUID storage format from ``CSharpLegacy`` binary
     format to ``Standard`` format.
   - Modified the ``IMongoClientWrapper`` interface to provide service
     registration for the ``MongoClientWrapper`` class. You should not implement the
     ``IMongoClientWrapper`` interface in your application.
   - The ``CamelCaseElementNameConvention`` cases owned entities based on their
     property name instead of their class name.

   For more information about these breaking changes, see
   :ref:`entity-framework-breaking-changes-v8.1` in the Upgrade Provider Version guide.

The 8.1 provider release includes the following new features:

- Support for optimistic concurrency through the following:

  - ``IsConcurrencyToken()`` method or the ``ConcurrencyCheck()`` attribute
  - ``IsRowVersion()`` method or the ``Timestamp`` attribute

- Support for mapping ``Dictionary`` and ``ReadOnlyDictionary`` properties

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v8.1.0 release notes
<mongodb/mongo-efcore-provider/releases/tag/v8.1.0>`.
