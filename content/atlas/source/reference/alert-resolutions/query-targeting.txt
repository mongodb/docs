``Query Targeting`` alerts often indicate inefficient queries.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned Objects / Returned` alerts are 
triggered when the average number of documents scanned relative to the 
average number of documents returned server-wide across all operations 
during a sampling period exceeds a defined threshold. The default alert 
uses a 1000:1 threshold.

Ideally, the ratio of scanned documents to returned documents should be 
close to 1. A high ratio negatively impacts query performance.

:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned / Returned` occurs if the number of
index keys examined to fulfill a query relative to the actual number of
returned documents meets or exceeds a user-defined threshold. This 
alert is not enabled by default.

.. example::

   The following :ref:`mongod log <mongodb-logs>` entry shows statistics
   generated from an inefficient query:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      <Timestamp> COMMAND  <query>
      planSummary: COLLSCAN keysExamined:0 
      docsExamined: 10000 cursorExhausted:1 numYields:234 
      nreturned:4  protocol:op_query 358ms

   This query scanned 10,000 documents and returned only 4 for a ratio
   of 2500, which is highly inefficient. No index keys were examined, so
   MongoDB scanned all documents in the collection, known as a
   :term:`collection scan`.

Common Triggers
---------------

The query targeting alert typically occurs when there is no index to
support a query or queries or when an existing index only partially
supports a query or queries.

.. include:: /includes/fact-query-targeting-mongot.rst

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Add one or more indexes to better serve the inefficient queries.

The :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor>` provides the
easiest and quickest way to create an index. The Performance Advisor
monitors queries that MongoDB considers slow and recommends indexes to
improve performance. |service| dynamically adjusts your slow query
threshold based on the execution time of operations across your
cluster.

Click :guilabel:`Create Index` on a slow query for instructions on how
to create the recommended index.

.. note::
    
   It is possible to receive a Query Targeting alert for an
   inefficient query without receiving index suggestions from the
   Performance Advisor if the query exceeds the slow query threshold and
   the ratio of scanned to returned documents is greater than the
   threshold specified in the alert.

In addition, you can use the following resources to determine which 
query generated the alert:

- The :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel </real-time-performance-panel/>`
  monitors and displays current network traffic and database operations
  on machines hosting MongoDB in your |service| clusters.

- The :ref:`MongoDB logs <mongodb-logs>` maintain an account of 
  activity,
  including queries, for each ``mongod`` instance in your |service|
  clusters.

- The :manual:`cursor.explain() </reference/method/cursor.explain/>`
  command for {+mongosh+} provides performance details for
  all queries.

- :ref:`Namespace Insights <namespace-insights>` monitors 
  collection-level query latency.

- The |service| :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>` records 
  operations that |service| considers slow when compared to average 
  execution time for all operations on your cluster.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Refer to the following for more information on query performance:

- :manual:`MongoDB Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>`
- :manual:`Query Optimization </core/query-optimization>`
- :manual:`Analyze Query Plan </tutorial/analyze-query-plan/>`

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

|service| provides the following methods to visualize query targeting:

- Query Targeting
  :ref:`metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>`, which highlight high ratios
  of objects scanned to objects returned.

- :ref:`Namespace Insights <namespace-insights>`, which monitors 
  collection-level query latency.

- The :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>`, which describes specific
  inefficient queries executed on the cluster.

Query Targeting Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view historical metrics to help you visualize the query
performance of your cluster. To view :guilabel:`Query Targeting`
metrics in the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: View :guilabel:`Query Targeting` metrics.

      a. Click :guilabel:`View Monitoring` on the dashboard for the 
         {+database-deployment+}.

      #. On the :guilabel:`Metrics` page, click the 
         :guilabel:`Add Chart` dropdown menu and select 
         :guilabel:`Query Targeting`.

The :guilabel:`Query Targeting` chart displays the following metrics
for queries executed on the server:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Scanned Objects / Returned` 
     - Indicates the average number of documents examined relative to  
       the average number of returned documents.

   * - :guilabel:`Scanned / Returned`
     - Indicates the number of index keys
       examined to fulfill a query relative to the actual number of
       returned documents.

.. include:: /includes/fact-query-targeting-mongot.rst

If either of these metrics exceed the
:doc:`user-defined threshold </configure-alerts>`, |service| generates
the corresponding
:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned Objects / Returned` or
:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned / Returned` alert.

.. note::

   You can also view :guilabel:`Query Targeting` ratios of operations in
   real-time using the
   :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

Namespace Insights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Namespace Insights <namespace-insights>` monitors 
collection-level :manual:`query latency </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>`. You can view query 
latency metrics and statistics for certain hosts and operation types. 
Manage pinned namespaces and choose up to five namespaces to show in 
the corresponding query latency charts.

To access Namespace Insights:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Namespace Insights` tab.
   
      a. Click :guilabel:`View Monitoring` on the dashboard for the 
         {+database-deployment+}.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Namespace Insights` tab.

Query Profiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>` contains several metrics
you can use to pinpoint specific inefficient queries. You can
visualize up to the past 24 hours of query operations. The Query
Profiler can show the :guilabel:`Examined : Returned Ratio` (index keys 
examined to documents returned) of logged queries, which might help you 
identify the queries that triggered a 
:alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned / Returned` alert. The chart shows the 
number of index keys examined to fulfill a query relative to the actual 
number of returned documents.

.. note::

   The :ref:`default <default-alert-settings>`
   :alert:`Query Targeting: Scanned Objects / Returned` 
   alert ratio differs slightly. The ratio of the average number of 
   documents scanned to the average number of documents returned during 
   a sampling period triggers this alert.

|service| might not :ref:`log <mongodb-logs>` the individual operations 
that contribute to the Query Targeting ratios due to automatically set 
thresholds. However, you can still use the Query Profiler and 
:guilabel:`Query Targeting` metrics to analyze and optimize query 
performance.

To access the Query Profiler:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Query Profiler` tab.

      a. Click :guilabel:`View Monitoring` on the dashboard for the 
         {+database-deployment+}.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Profiler` tab.
