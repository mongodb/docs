"If the pipeline starts with an exact :pipeline:`$match` on a shard key, "

"For aggregation operations that must run on multiple shards, if the "
"operations do not require running on the database's primary shard, these "
"operations will route the results to a random shard to merge the results "
"to avoid overloading the primary shard for that database. The "
