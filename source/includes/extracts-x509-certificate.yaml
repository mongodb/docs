   The client certificate must have the following
   properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
     for both the client and the server.

   - Client certificates must contain the following fields:

     .. code-block:: none

        keyUsage = digitalSignature
        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

   - Each unique MongoDB user must have a unique certificate.

   - A client x.509 certificate's subject, which contains the
     Distinguished Name (``DN``), must **differ** from that of a
     :ref:`x509-member-certificate`.
     
     At least one of the Organization (``O``), Organizational Unit
     (``OU``), or Domain Component (``DC``) attributes in the client
     certificate must differ from those in the
     :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` and
     :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` server certificates.
     
     If the MongoDB deployment has
     :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` set (available starting
     in MongoDB 4.2), the client x.509 certificate's subject must also
     differ from that value.

     .. warning::

        If a client x.509 certificate's subject has the same ``O``,
        ``OU``, and ``DC`` combination as the
        :ref:`x509-member-certificate` (or
        :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` if set), the client
        connection is rejected. Only
        :ref:`cluster member x509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>`
        should use same ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` combinations as this
        grants full permissions.

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

ref: x509-certificate-member
content: |

   The member certificate (:setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`, if
   specified, and :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile`), used to
   verify membership to the sharded cluster or a replica set, must have
   the following properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
     certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

   - The Distinguished Name (``DN``), found in the member certificate's
     ``subject``, must specify a non-empty value for *at least one* of the
     following attributes: Organization (``O``), the Organizational Unit
     (``OU``) or the Domain Component (``DC``).
 
   - The Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit
     attributes (``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) must
     match those from both the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` and
     :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` certificates for the other
     cluster members (or the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`
     value, if set).
     
     To match, the certificate must match all specifications of these
     attributes, or even the non-specification of these attributes. The
     order of the attributes does not matter.

     In the following example, the two ``DN``\'s contain matching
     specifications for ``O``, ``OU`` as well as the non-specification of
     the ``DC`` attribute.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        C=US, ST=CA, O=MongoDB, OU=Dept1, CN=host2

     However, the following two ``DN``\'s contain a mismatch for the
     ``OU`` attribute since one contains two ``OU`` specifications and
     the other, only one specification.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,OU=Sales,O=MongoDB
        CN=host2,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB

   - Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
     Name (``SAN``) entries must match the hostname of the server, used
     by the other members of the cluster. Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when
     performing comparison of SAN, MongoDB supports comparison of DNS
     names or IP addresses. In previous versions, MongoDB only supports
     comparisons of DNS names.

     For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the following
     subjects:

     .. code-block:: sh

        subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US

   - *If* the certificate includes the Extended Key Usage (``extendedKeyUsage``)
     setting, the value must include ``clientAuth`` ("TLS Web Client
     Authentication").

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
   
     You can also use a certificate that does not include the Extended
     Key Usage (EKU).

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

ref: x509-member-auth-configuration
content: |

   In addition to any TLS/SSL configurations as appropriate for your
   deployment, include the following to specify x.509 for internal
   authentication for each member of your replica set (i.e. the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances) or sharded cluster (i.e. the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances):

   - :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode` or :option:`--clusterAuthMode
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` set to ``x509``

   - :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` or :option:`--tlsClusterFile
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` (*both new in MongoDB 4.2*)

   However, if no cluster file is specified, members can use their
   certificate key file specified in
   :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` or
   :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`
   (*both new in MongoDB 4.2*) for membership authentication. This
   :setting:`certificate key file <net.tls.certificateKeyFile>` is used
   by :binary:`~bin.mongod` (and :option:`mongos 
   <mongos --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`) instances to prove their identity
   to clients, but can also be used for membership authentication. To
   use for both client authentication and membership authentication,
   the certificate must either:

   - Omit ``extendedKeyUsage`` or

   - Specify ``extendedKeyUsage`` values

   .. note::
      
      Athough still available, :setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` (and the
      correponding :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod
      --sslClusterFile>`) and :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` (and the
      corresponding :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongod --sslPEMKeyFile>`)
      are :ref:`deprecated as of MongoDB 4.2 <4.2-tls>`.
      
      For deployments using MongoDB version 4.0 and earlier, use
      :setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` (or the corresponding
      :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>`) and
      :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` (or the corresponding
      :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongod --sslPEMKeyFile>`).
