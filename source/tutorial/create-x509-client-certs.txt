The |k8s-op-full| can deploy MongoDB instances with 
:manual:`X.509 authentication </core/security-x.509/>`
enabled. If X.509 authentication has been enabled for the deployment,
you must generate and use an X.509 certificate to connect to the
deployment. This new client certificate must be signed by the
same |certauth| that signs the server certificates for the MongoDB
deployment to accept it.

Use the procedure outlined in this document to use an X.509 certificate
to connect to your X.509-enabled MongoDB deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note::

   A full description of Transport Layer Security (TLS), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   certificates, and Certificate Authorities is beyond the scope of this
   document. This page assumes prior knowledge of |tls| and
   X.509 authentication.

- To complete this tutorial, you must have the |k8s-op|
  installed. For instructions on installing the |k8s-op-short|, 
  see :ref:`install-k8s`.

- This tutorial assumes you have a MongoDB deployment which
  requires X.509 authentication. For instructions on deploying
  MongoDB resources, see :ref:`k8s-deploy-mdb-resources`.

Procedure
---------

First create the client certificate. Then create a MongoDB user
and connect to the X.509-enabled deployment.
