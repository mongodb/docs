  An equality match on the shard key that specifies the shard-key value
  of the chunk to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the
  ``find`` field but not both. Do **not** use the ``find`` field to

  The bounds of a specific chunk to move. The array must consist of two
  documents that specify the lower and upper shard key values of a chunk
  to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the ``find`` field but

  :term:`hashed shard key`.

   Starting in MongoDB 3.4, for :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`,
   defaults to ``false``. For :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>`, the
   default value remains ``true``.
      
   - If ``true``, then by default, each document move during chunk
     migration propagates to at least one secondary before the balancer
     proceeds with the next document. This is equivalent to a write
     concern of :writeconcern:`{ w: 2 } <\<number\>>`. See also the
     ``writeConcern`` parameter.

   - If ``false``, the balancer does not wait for replication to a
     secondary and instead continues with the next document.

   For more information, see
   :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.
