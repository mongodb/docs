Overview
--------

This page describes errors you might encounter when
using the {+driver-long+} to perform MongoDB operations. Once you
understand the types of operation errors that the driver raises, you can take
appropriate actions to either handle them or correct the error-causing code.

.. note::

   This page addresses only operation error handling. If you encounter
   any other issues with MongoDB or the driver, visit the following
   resources:

   - The :ref:`Issues & Help <rust-issues-and-help>` page, which has
     information about reporting bugs, contributing to the driver, and 
     finding more resources
   - The `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`__ for
     questions, discussions, or general technical support

   ..
     - The :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <golang-faq>` for the
       {+driver-short+}

Error Type
----------

If the driver encounters an error while performing an operation, it
returns an error of the `Error <{+api+}/error/struct.Error.html>`__ type.

The ``Error`` type contains the ``kind`` field, which describes the type of
error that occurred. The ``kind`` field has a value of enum `ErrorKind
<{+api+}/error/enum.ErrorKind.html>`__. The ``ErrorKind`` enum has
variants for different kinds of errors, including the following:

- ``InvalidArgument``: you provided an invalid argument to a method
- ``Authentication``: the driver encountered an error during authentication
- ``ServerSelection``: the client couldn't select a server for the operation
- ``Write``: an error occurred during a write operation
- ``Transaction``: an error occurred during a transaction

For example, if you attempt to perform an insert operation that
duplicates an ``_id`` field value that is already in the collection,
the driver returns an ``Error`` instance and prints the following error
message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   Error: Error { kind: Write(WriteError(WriteError { code: 11000,
   code_name: None, message: "E11000 duplicate key error collection:
   db.test_coll index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }", details: None })), labels:
   {}, wire_version: None, source: None }

In the preceding error message, the value of the ``kind`` field is
``Write``. To learn more about this type of error, see the :ref:`Write
Error Types <rust-error-write-errors>` section of this guide.

Connection Errors
-----------------

A concurrent operation error might clear the connection pool,
interrupting your connection to the server. In this
situation, the driver raises an ``Error`` type where the value of the
``kind`` field is ``ConnectionPoolCleared``. The error message describes
the reason that the concurrent operation failed.

To learn how to adjust your connection pool to address this error, see
:manual:`Tuning Your Connection Pool Settings
</tutorial/connection-pool-performance-tuning/>` in the Server manual.

Depending on the circumstances that produce the error, the driver may
add a ``RetryableWriteError`` label to the error, as shown in the
following error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   
   Error { kind: ConnectionPoolCleared { message: "Connection pool for
   localhost:27017 cleared because another operation failed with: Kind:
   I/O error: timed out, labels: {}" }, labels: {"RetryableWriteError"},
   wire_version: None, source: None }

This label indicates that the error is write-retryable, which means that
the driver makes one retry attempt.

.. _rust-error-write-errors:

Write Error Types
-----------------

When the driver experiences an error while performing a write operation,
it raises an ``Error`` instance with a ``kind`` field value of ``Write``.
The body of the ``Write`` variant is the enum `WriteFailure
<{+api+}/error/enum.WriteFailure.html>`__, which
takes a value of type `WriteError <{+api+}/error/struct.WriteError.html>`__ or
`WriteConcernError <{+api+}/error/struct.WriteConcernError.html>`__.

Write Concern Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver raises a ``WriteConcernError`` error when you perform a write
operation and the driver cannot satisfy the specified write concern. For
example, if you specify a write concern of ``majority`` for
operations on a replica set with three nodes, the driver returns
this error if the write operation propagates only to one node.

To learn more about write concerns, see :manual:`Write Concern
</reference/write-concern/>` in the Server manual.

Write Error
~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver raises a ``WriteError`` error for any errors that it
encounters when performing a write operation that are not related to
satisfying the write concern. Because there are many causes for this
error, the ``WriteError`` type contains fields that describe the type of
write error and reason for the error.

For example, the driver raises a ``WriteError`` error if you attempt to
insert a document into a collection that violates the collection's
schema validation rules. Suppose the collection has a rule where the
value of the ``quantity`` field must be an ``int`` type. If you
attempt to insert a document where the value of ``quantity`` is
``"three"``, the driver prints the following error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3

   Error: Error { kind: Write(WriteError(WriteError { code: 121, code_name:
   None, message: "Document failed validation", details:
   Some(Document({"failingDocumentId": Int32(1), "details":
   Document({"operatorName": String("$jsonSchema"), "title":
   String("Numerical Validation"), "schemaRulesNotSatisfied":
   Array(...)})})) })), labels: {},
   wire_version: None, source: None }

In the preceding error message, the ``message`` field describes the
reason for the error, and the ``details`` field provides specific
details about the failing operation. To address this error, you must
either revise the document to adhere to the schema validation rules or
bypass validation.
