Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $skip

   Skips over the specified number of :term:`documents <document>` that
   pass into the stage and passes the remaining documents to the next
   stage in the :term:`pipeline`.

   The :pipeline:`$skip` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $skip: <positive integer> }

   :pipeline:`$skip` takes a positive integer that specifies the
   maximum number of documents to skip.

Example
-------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.article.aggregate([
       { $skip : 5 }
   ]);

This operation skips the first 5 documents passed to it by the
pipeline. :pipeline:`$skip` has no effect on the content of the
documents it passes along the pipeline.
