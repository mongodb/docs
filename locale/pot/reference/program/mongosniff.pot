msgid ":program:`mongosniff` provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view into database activity in real time. Think of :program:`mongosniff` as a MongoDB-specific analogue of ``tcpdump`` for TCP/IP network traffic. Typically, :program:`mongosniff` is most frequently used in driver development."

msgid ":program:`mongosniff` requires ``libpcap`` and is only available for Unix-like systems. Furthermore, the version distributed with the MongoDB binaries is dynamically linked against aversion 0.9 of ``libpcap``. If your system has a different version of ``libpcap``, you will need to compile :program:`mongosniff` yourself or create a symbolic link pointing to ``libpcap.so.0.9`` to your local version of ``libpcap``. Use an operation that resembles the following:"
