:group:`$rank` and :group:`$denseRank` differ in how they rank duplicate
:ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field values. For example, with
:ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field values of 7, 9, 9, and 10:

- :group:`$denseRank` ranks the values as 1, 2, 2, and 3. The
  duplicate 9 values have a rank of 2, and 10 has a rank of 3. There is
  no gap in the ranks.

- :group:`$rank` ranks the values as 1, 2, 2, and 4. The duplicate 9
  values have a rank of 2, and 10 has a rank of 4. There is a gap in the
  ranks for 3.

Documents with a ``null`` value for a :ref:`sortBy
<setWindowFields-sortBy>` field or documents missing the :ref:`sortBy
<setWindowFields-sortBy>` field are assigned a rank based on the
:ref:`BSON comparison order <bson-types-comparison-order>`.
