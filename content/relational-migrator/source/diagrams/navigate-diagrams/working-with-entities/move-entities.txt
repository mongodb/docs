You can select one or more entities and move them to a different diagram. You 
can move the entities to a newly created diagram or to a different existing 
diagram. Moving entities lets you customize diagrams to help you visualize 
the different ways your data can be represented in MongoDB. 

Steps
-----

#. :ref:`Select the entities <rm-select-entities>` you want to move.

#. To view commands for your entities, click the ellipsis menu in the right pane.

      :alt: Entity Pane

   .. note::

      You can also right-click the entities to view commands.

#. Click :guilabel:`Move entities to`.

#. Choose how to move the entities.

   You can choose to move your entities to an existing diagram *or* you can 
   choose to create a new diagram to move your entities to. 

#. Move the entities to the selected diagram.

   The selected entities are hidden in the original diagram and are displayed 
   in the diagram they are moved to. 

   - If you selected an existing diagram, the moved entities are displayed 
     with the other pre-existing entities in the diagram.

   - If you selected :guilabel:`Create new diagram`, only the moved entities are displayed.
