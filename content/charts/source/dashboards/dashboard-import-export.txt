You can export a dashboard to a file, which you can then import. Use 
this feature to:

- Import exported charts into the same or a different project
- Store your dashboard outside of |charts|

Import a Dashboard From a File 
------------------------------

You can import a dashboard from a file on the :ref:`Dashboards page 
<dashboards-tab>`. 

The file to import: 

- Can't be larger than 16 MBs
- Must be a valid ``.charts`` file that you downloaded from a 
  dashboard

To import a dashboard from a file: 

.. procedure:: Import a Dashboard From a File
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

      For instructions, see :doc:`Dashboards </dashboards>`.

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, 
      expand the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dropdown menu and select :guilabel:`Import Dashboard`. 

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` modal, drag and drop the file to import 
      or click :guilabel:`Choose File` and select the file to import.

   .. step:: Click 
      :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. step:: Click the pencil icon :icon-fa4:`pencil` 
      under :guilabel:`Data source at destination`.

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Data source at destination` 
      for each :guilabel:`Data source in file`.
   
      The :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` modal displays a list of all of the data
      sources you are importing under the :guilabel:`Data source in
      file` column.

      To connect each data source from your imported dashboard to a data source in your destination project, 
      choose one of the following options under the :guilabel:`Data Source at Destination` column: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 15 40  

         * - Option 
           - Description 
       
         * - :guilabel:`Connect later`
           - Option to choose the data source to use later. |charts| 
             imports all charts using the :guilabel:`Data source in file`, 
             but no data source is selected. The charts don't render until 
             you edit each chart and choose a new data source. 

         * - :guilabel:`Connect now`
           - Option to select any data source in your project. The data 
             source you select is used instead of the :guilabel:`Data 
             source in file` for charts imported in to the dashboard.

             If |charts| detects that a data source in your imported dashboard is the same 
             as the data source in your destination project, that data source is selected by 
             default. Otherwise, :guilabel:`Connect later` is selected by default.

             To select a data source:

             1. Select a deployment from the first dropdown.
             #. Select a database from the second dropdown.
             #. Select a data source from the third dropdown.
             #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 

         * - :guilabel:`Exclude charts using this data source`
           - Option to exclude charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source 
             in file`. Charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source in 
             file` won't be imported.

   .. important::

      Imported charts may not render properly if mapped to a data 
      source that the chart wasn't built to use.

   .. step:: Click one of the following buttons: 

      - :guilabel:`Save` to import the dashboard. 
      - :guilabel:`Save and Import Another` to import this dashboard and 
        import another dashboard from a file.
      - :guilabel:`Cancel` to exit the modal without importing the 
        dashboard.

.. _export-dashboard:

Export a Dashboard to a File 
----------------------------

You can export a dashboard to a single file named 
``<Dashboard-Title>.charts``. 
You can export a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page or from 
the dashboard itself. 

.. note::

   If a dashboard export query surpasses 5 minutes, the query times out. The timeout impacts you if you want to 
   download a PDF of your dashboard. 

To export a dashboard:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

      For instructions, see :doc:`Dashboards </dashboards>`.
   
   .. step:: Click the ellipsis (``...``) for the dashboard you want to export. If you are already viewing a specific dashboard, click the ellipsis (``...``) in the top right corner.

   .. step:: Click 
      :guilabel:`Export as .charts`. 

The ``<Dashboard-Title>.charts`` file contains the metadata for the 
dashboard, including:

- Dashboard name and description
- Dashboard layout including location of the charts in the dashboard 
- Chart definitions
- Dashboard filter definitions
- Details of the data sources used on the charts including:

  - Cluster name
  - Database name
  - Collection name 

- Embedding settings for each chart including:

  - Whether each embedding type is enabled or disabled
  - Filter allow list
  - Injected filter code 

The ``<Dashboard-Title>.charts`` file does **not** include: 

- Dashboard :ref:`permissions <dashboard-permissions>`
- External sharing settings for the data sources used
- Data source pipelines
- Chart embedding IDs

You must have ``Viewer`` or higher :ref:`permissions 
<dashboard-permissions>` to export a dashboard.
