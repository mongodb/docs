Overview
--------

If you installed PyMongo without the C extensions (i.e. on a system without a C
compiler, or not using the Windows installer), PyMongo should be re-installed
with C extensions.

While the C extensions are not required for MMS Monitoring, they significantly
improve performance. You must have a C compiler (e.g. gcc) and Python header
files installed on your system.
