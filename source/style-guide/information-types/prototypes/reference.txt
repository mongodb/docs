A reference page provides quick information to experienced users of a
product. Reference pages may describe the use of a method, operator, or
database command. Release notes are another example of reference page.

Usually, the title of a reference page is the name of the command, operator, or 
method it describes.

Definition
----------

A reference page begins with a brief introduction summarizing its
contents, often called a short description. The short description
explains a little about how the reference material is used, and may link
to a concept or task page.

Compatibility 
-------------

Optional. 

A list of MongoDB deployment types that support the referenced method, operator, 
or database command: 

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`_: The fully managed service 
  for MongoDB deployments in the cloud

.. note:: 

   If the command is supported on Atlas, be sure to specify whether it's 
   available in all clusters, has limited support for some clusters, or 
   is not available in specific clusters. If there are limitations to which 
   clusters the command is supported in, direct users to the 
   :atlas:`Unsupported Commands </unsupported-commands>` page.

- `MongoDB Community <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>`_: The 
  source-available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDB

- `MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`_: 
  The subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDB

     - Description

   * - Parameter

     - String

     - Required

     - String

Behaviors
---------

Optional. 

Behaviors should apply only to the operator described on this page. 

Examples
--------

Optional.

This section could contain examples of the most common use cases. Use
includes for Reference and Task page examples, so we write the examples
once, present them consistently throughout the documentation, and can
update them easily.

If an example is shared between task and reference, you should write it
as an include.
