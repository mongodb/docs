Single-region {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} nodes within
a single region of one cloud provider. Single-region {+service+}
deployments are supported on all {+cluster+} tiers. They provide 
the least expensive option for applications and are a good choice when 
cost is a factor, and the low risk of a regional failure is acceptable.

All Atlas providers have regions that support availability zones within 
a region, which adds protection in the case of a single zone outage. 
The cloud provider automatically reroutes traffic to a node in another 
availability zone within the region to ensure availability. This is 
similar to multi-regional deployments but on a smaller scale.

The following diagram shows a single-region {+service+}
deployment for a region that has 3 availability zones:

To learn how to configure a single-region deployment, see 
:atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>` in the
{+service+} documentation.

Use Cases for Single-Region Deployments
---------------------------------------

A single-region deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use one cloud provider.
- You don't need to deploy to more than one region.
- Your application requires low latency *and* has a majority of users
  in one geographic location.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| with
users primarily located in the western US, you can deploy a 
single-region deployment to ``us-west-2`` (a region that supports availability 
zones). This ensures low latency since all nodes are within the western US, while
offering availability if there's a zonal outage that affects the
primary node.

If your application requires low latency and cross-region or cross-provider high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region` or 
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`, respectively.

Considerations for Single-Region Deployments
--------------------------------------------

Single-region deployments ensure a minimum level of availability. High 
availability depends on the deployment of nodes across
regions as well as the number, distribution, and priority order of
nodes. To learn more about recommended
{+cluster+} topologies for high availability, see
:ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.

For more considerations, see 
:atlas:`Considerations 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#considerations>` in the
{+service+} documentation.
