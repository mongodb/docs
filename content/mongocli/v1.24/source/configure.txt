You can define the settings that the {+mcli+} uses to interact with
MongoDB services like |service|, |cloud-short|, and |onprem| by using
the :ref:`mongocli-auth-login` or :ref:`mongocli-config` command. The 
first time you run one of these commands, the {+mcli+} creates a 
:ref:`configuration file <mcli-config-file>` called ``config.toml`` 
to store your settings. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To configure the {+mcli+}:

- Add your |ipaddr| or |cidr| block to the |api| access list for your
  MongoDB service.
- Generate a |svc-api-key| if you don't already have one.
  
  .. note::

     |svc-api-key|\s are role-based. Different roles have different
     privileges and capabilities, and some {+mcli+} commands are available
     to some roles but not others. Be sure that the roles assigned to
     your |svc-api-key| are appropriate for the commands you intend to
     use.

  To learn more about generating a |svc-api-key| for
  your MongoDB service, see the following documentation:

  - :atlas:`Atlas API Access </configure-api-access>`
  - :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager API Access </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`
  - :opsmgr:`Ops Manager API Acess </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`

- Set up the ``HTTP_PROXY`` or ``HTTPS_PROXY`` :ref:`environment 
  variable <mcli-env-var>` if your {+mcli+} installation is behind a 
  firewall and you want to use a proxy |url|. {+mcli+} supports 
  ``http``, ``https``, and ``socks5`` schemes. In addition, specify 
  ``cloud.mongodb.com/`` as the main target URL in the proxy service's 
  access list. You must specify the username and password also if your 
  proxy configuration enables authentication. 
  
  To learn more, see `Proxy server 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server>`__.
