  rename, resize and reposition dashboards, remove a chart from the dashboard,
  or move a chart to a different dashboard.

To begin modifying a dashboard:

#. Select the :guilabel:`dashboard view`.

Viewer Actions
--------------

The following action can be performed by any user with at least
``Viewer`` :ref:`permissions <dashboard-permissions>` on the target
dashboard, meaning any level of dashboard access is sufficient.

Duplicate a Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can duplicate any dashboard in your Dashboards page,
even if you do not have editing permissions.

You can duplicate a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page or 
from the dashboard itself. 

To duplicate a dashboard:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: If you are on the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, click the ellipsis 
      (:icon-mms:`ellipsis`) for the dashboard you want to duplicate.

      If you are on a dashboard, click the ellipsis 
      (:icon-mms:`ellipsis`) in the top right corner.
      
   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Duplicate` 
      from the pop-up menu.

      :guilabel:`Title` and :guilabel:`Description` fields.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save` to save 
      the duplicated dashboard.

.. note::

   The user who duplicates a dashboard becomes the owner and only
   user of the newly duplicated dashboard. To grant other users access,
   update the dashboard's :ref:`permissions <dashboard-permissions>`.

Refresh Dashboard Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time. To learn more, see :ref:`refresh-dashboard`.

.. _fullscreen-charts-view:

Enter Fullscreen Charts View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for charts. In this view, |charts| 
hides the main navigation bar and expands the selected chart in
the entire space of the screen.

   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from 
      the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

      at the top-right of the chart.

following tasks:
