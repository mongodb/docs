      Language Compatibility
      ----------------------

      PyMongo supports both CPython and PyPy.

      When a version of Python is marked end-of-life (EOL), the next minor release of
      PyMongo drops support for that version. The driver offers the
      following ongoing support for EOL Python versions:

      - **CPython**: The last minor PyMongo version compatible with the EOL CPython
        version receives critical bug fixes for one year.

      - **PyPy**: PyMongo doesn't support PyPy versions past their EOL date.
