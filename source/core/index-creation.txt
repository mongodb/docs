MongoDB provides several options that *only* affect the creation of
the index. Specify these options in a document as the second argument
to the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method. This section
describes the uses of these creation options and their behavior.

.. related::

   Some options that you can specify to
   :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` options control the
   :doc:`properties of the index </core/index-properties>`, which are
   *not* index creation options. For example, the :doc:`unique
   </core/index-unique>` option affects the behavior of the index
   after creation.

   For a detailed description of MongoDB's index types, see
   :doc:`/core/index-types` and :doc:`/core/index-properties` for
   related documentation.

.. index:: index; background creation
.. _index-creation-background:

Background Construction
-----------------------

By default, creating an index blocks all other operations on a
database. When building an index on a collection, the database that
holds the collection is unavailable for read or write operations until
the index build completes. Any operation that requires a read or write
lock on all databases (e.g. :command:`listDatabases`) will wait for the
foreground index build to complete.

For potentially long running index building operations, consider the
``background`` operation so that the MongoDB database remains available
during the index building operation. For example, to create an index in
the background of the ``zipcode`` field of the ``people`` collection,
issue the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.createIndex( { zipcode: 1 }, { background: true } )

By default, ``background`` is ``false`` for building MongoDB indexes.

You can combine the background option with other options, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.createIndex( { zipcode: 1 }, { background: true, sparse: true } )

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

As of MongoDB version 2.4, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance can build more
than one index in the background concurrently.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4
   Before 2.4, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance could only build one
   background index per database at a time.

Background indexing operations run in the background so that other database
operations can run while creating the index. However, the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell session or connection where you are creating
the index *will* block until the index build is complete. To continue
issuing commands to the database, open another
connection or :binary:`~bin.mongo` instance.

Queries will not use partially-built indexes: the index will only be
usable once the index build is complete.

.. note::

   If MongoDB is building an index in the background, you cannot
   perform other administrative operations involving that collection,
   including running :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, dropping the
   collection (i.e. :method:`db.collection.drop()`), and running
   :dbcommand:`compact`. These operations will return an error during
   background index builds.


Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

The background index operation uses an incremental approach that is
slower than the normal "foreground" index builds. If the index is
larger than the available RAM, then the incremental process can take
*much* longer than the foreground build.

If your application
includes :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
operations, and an index *doesn't* exist for other operational
concerns, building the index can have a severe impact on the
performance of the database.

To avoid performance issues, make sure that your application checks
for the indexes at start up using the
:method:`~db.collection.getIndexes()` method or the :api:`equivalent
method for your driver <>` and terminates if the proper indexes do not
exist. Always build indexes in production instances using separate
application code, during designated maintenance windows.

Interrupted Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a background index build is in progress when the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
process terminates, when the instance restarts the index build will
restart as foreground index build. If the index build encounters any
errors, such as a duplicate key error, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will exit
with an error.

To start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` after a failed index build, use the
:setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` or :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry
<mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` to skip the index build on start up.
.. _index-creation-building-indexes-on-secondaries:

Building Indexes on Secondaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   Secondary members can now build indexes in the
   background. Previously all index builds on secondaries were in the
   foreground.

Background index operations on a :term:`replica set`
:term:`secondaries <secondary>` begin after the :term:`primary`
completes building the index. If MongoDB builds an index in the
background on the primary, the secondaries will then build that index
in the background.

To build large indexes on secondaries the best approach is to
restart one secondary at a time in :term:`standalone` mode and build
the index. After building the index, restart as a member of the
replica set, allow it to catch up with the other members of the set,
and then build the index on the next secondary. When all the
secondaries have the new index, step down the primary, restart it as a
standalone, and build the index on the former primary.

The amount of time required to build the index on a secondary must be
within the window of the :term:`oplog`, so that the secondary can
catch up with the primary.

Indexes on secondary members in "recovering" mode are always built in
the foreground to allow them to catch up as soon as possible.

See :ref:`index-building-replica-sets` for a complete procedure for
building indexes on secondaries.

Index Names
-----------

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys
and each key's direction in the index, 1 or -1.

.. example:: Issue the following command to create an index on ``item``
   and ``quantity``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.createIndex( { item: 1, quantity: -1 } )

   The resulting index is named: ``item_1_quantity_-1``.

Optionally, you can specify a name for an index instead of using the
default name.

.. example:: Issue the following command to create an index on ``item``
   and ``quantity`` and specify ``inventory`` as the index name:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.createIndex( { item: 1, quantity: -1 } , { name: "inventory" } )

   The resulting index has the name ``inventory``.

To view the name of an index, use the :method:`getIndexes()
<db.collection.getIndexes()>` method.
