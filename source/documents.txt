Documents Tab
-------------

From the :guilabel:`Documents` tab, you can view, insert, clone,
modify, and delete documents in your selected collection or view.

Query Bar
---------

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-results.rst

From the :doc:`query bar </query-bar>`, you can specify the query, and
if you click the :guilabel:`Options`, you can also specify query
options.

.. _compass-view-documents:

View Documents
--------------

Use the Documents tab to view the documents inside of a collection.
Two different views are available to access documents:
:ref:`List View <documents-list-view>` and
:ref:`Table View <documents-table-view>`.

.. _documents-list-view:

List View
~~~~~~~~~

When the Documents tab loads, Compass displays the List View, which
shows all documents that match your query criteria
(or all documents within the sample if no query criteria was
specified). The documents are shown as individual members in a list format,
as shown in the following example:

.. figure:: /images/compass/doc-view.png

To toggle the expansion of nested objects and array elements in a
document, hover over the target document and click the arrow in the
top-left corner.

.. _documents-table-view:

Table View
~~~~~~~~~~

Compass also provides the ability to view your documents in a table,
rather than as individual items in a list.

Click the :guilabel:`Table` button to the right of the
:guilabel:`List` button to access the document Table View.

.. figure:: /images/compass/doc-table-view.png
      :figwidth: 805px

You can reorder the table columns by clicking and dragging the column
headings. Reordering the columns is a strictly cosmetic change and does
not change the underlying data itself.

To view nested object fields and array elements, hover your cursor over
a field with a value type of ``Object`` or ``Array`` and click the
button with outward-pointing arrows which appears on the right side of
the field.

This opens a new tab in the Table View corresponding to the nested
element.

.. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-expand-nested-elem.png

The following example displays the ``delays``
object nested within the ``flightStats`` collection documents. The
new tab displays the two properties of the ``delay`` object:
``arrivalRunwayDelayMinutes`` and ``departureRunwayDelayMinutes``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/doc-table-view-nested.png

To return to the original table display, click on the first tab
in the Table View which displays the name of your collection.

.. _insert-documents:

Insert Documents
----------------

Click the :guilabel:`Insert Document` button to insert a new document:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-button.png
  :figwidth: 816px

The insert dialog appears:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document.png
  :figwidth: 598px

For each field in the document, select field type and fill in the
field name and value.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document2.png
  :figwidth: 627px

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.

   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]

   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Add New Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document-new-field.svg
  :figwidth: 621px

You can also add a new field at the end by hitting the Tab from the
value of the last field.

.. tip::

   To add a new field after an array or a document field, hover over
   the row number in the dialog (the row number is not part of the
   document but the dialog display) and click on the plus sign add a
   new field after the field.

Change Field Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the data type of a field by using the data type
selectors on the right of the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document3.png
  :figwidth: 644px

To change the ``_id`` field to use a custom value, change
the data type from ``ObjectID`` to ``string`` and then overwrite the
``_id`` value:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document4.png
  :figwidth: 626px

.. _clone-documents:

Clone Documents
---------------

It is also possible to insert new documents by cloning
the schema and values of an existing document in a collection.

To clone a document, hover over the desired document
and click the :guilabel:`Clone` button.

.. figure:: /images/compass/clone-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Cloning a document works the same way in the
:ref:`Table View <documents-table-view>` as it does in the
:ref:`List View <documents-list-view>`:

.. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-clone.png

Clicking the :guilabel:`Clone` button creates a new insert dialog with
the same schema and values. You can edit any of these fields and values
before you insert the new document.

.. figure:: /images/compass/clone-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 702px

.. _compass-modify-documents:

Modify Documents
----------------

To edit a document, hover over the document and select the pencil icon:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc.png
  :figwidth: 765px

Modifying a document works the same way in the
:ref:`Table View <documents-table-view>` as it does in the
:ref:`List View <documents-list-view>`:

.. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-modify.png

After you click the pencil icon, the document enters edit mode:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
of values.

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.

   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]

   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Delete Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete fields by selecting the ``x`` icon to the
left of the field:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc3.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Once selected, the field is marked for removal and appears
highlighted in red:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc4.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Add New Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To insert a new field, click or tab to the end of the document and
fill in the field/value. New fields appear highlighted in green:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc5.png
  :figwidth: 740px

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

You can also add a new field at the end by hitting the Tab from the
value of the last field.

.. tip::

   To add a new field after an array or a document field, hover over
   the row number in the dialog (the row number is not part of the
   document but the dialog display) and click on the plus sign add a
   new field after the field.

Modify Existing Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify documents by clicking on existing field names or
values and making changes. In this example, the flight status was
changed from ``L`` to ``M``. Changed fields appear highlighted in
yellow:

.. figure:: /images/compass/update-field.png
  :figwidth: 740px

When you are finished editing the document, click the ``Update`` button
to commit your changes. Compass performs a ``findAndModify`` operation
to update the document.

Reverting a Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While modifying a document, you have the option to revert changes made to a
field prior to saving the modified document.

To revert changes to a document in the
:ref:`List View <documents-list-view>`, hover over the edited field
and click the :guilabel:`revert icon` which appears to the left of the
field's line number.

.. figure:: /images/compass/revert-doc-list-view.png

To revert changes to a document in the
:ref:`Table View <documents-list-view>`, click the
:guilabel:`revert icon` which appears on the right side of the edited
table element.

.. figure:: /images/compass/revert-doc-table-view.png

Cancel Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To exit the edit mode and cancel all pending changes to the document,
click the ``Cancel`` button.

Delete Documents
----------------

From the :guilabel:`Documents` view, you can delete documents by
hovering over the document and selecting the trash icon:

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Deleting a document works the same way in the
:ref:`Table View <documents-table-view>` as it does in the
:ref:`List View <documents-list-view>`:

.. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-delete.png

After clicking the delete button, the document is flagged for deletion
and Compass asks for confirmation that you want to remove the document:

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

After you confirm, Compass deletes the document
from the collection.
