Create a data model that uses :ref:`embedded
<data-modeling-embedding>` documents to describe a many-to-many relationship 
between connected data. Embedding connected data in a single document can 
reduce the number of read operations required to obtain data. In general, 
structure your schema so your application receives all of its required 
information in a single read operation. For example, you can use the embedded 
many-to-many model to describe the following relationships:

- Students to classes
- Actors to movies
- Doctors to patients 

About this Task
---------------

The following example schema contains information regarding ``book one`` 
and ``book two`` and their authors. You can represent the relationship 
differently based on whether you anticipate application users querying by 
book or by author. 

If you expect more users to query by book than by author, the example schema 
is an effective choice. However, if you expect more queries by author, make 
the author the top-level information and place the author's books in an embedded 
field.

Example
-------

You can use a many-to-many relationship to describe books and authors. A book 
can have multiple authors, and an author can write multiple books. 

Embedded Document Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application needs to display information for the book and author 
objects on a single page. To allow your application to retrieve all 
necessary information with a single query, embed author information 
inside of the corresponding book document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: "book001",
      title: "Cell Biology",
      authors: [
        {
           author_id: "author124",
           name: "Ellie Smith"
        },
        {
           author_id: "author381",
           name: "John Palmer"
        }
      ] 
   }

   {
      _id: "book002",
      title: "Organic Chemistry",
      authors: [
        {
           author_id: "author290",
           name: "Jane James"
        },
        {
           author_id: "author381",
           name: "John Palmer"
        }
      ] 
   }
