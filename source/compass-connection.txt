To connect `MongoDB Compass
<https://www.mongodb.com/downloads#compass>`_ to |service|,
you need:

- The hostname of primary for a replica set or the hostname for the
  :program:`mongos <bin.mongos>` for a sharded cluster.

- The port of the primary for a replica set or the port for the
  :program:`mongos <bin.mongos>` for a sharded cluster.

- MongoDB User and Password. The connection details use the MongoDB
  administration user and password set up for the group. To connect
  with a different MongoDB user, replace the user name and password in
  the connection details.

The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog for a cluster provides connection string
details. Use the displayed connection details to retrieve these details.
