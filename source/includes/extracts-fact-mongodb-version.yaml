   with the following tiers and MongoDB versions:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - MongoDB Version
        - Supported on ``M10+``
        - Supported on Free and Shared Tiers (``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5``)

      * - MongoDB 4.2
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

      * - MongoDB 4.4
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

      * - MongoDB 5.0
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - :icon:`check-square`

      * - MongoDB 6.0 Release Candidate
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

      * - Latest Release (auto-upgrades)
        - :icon:`check-square`
        -   

   .. important::
    
      MongoDB 6.0 is a release candidate, made available for early
      testing. To learn more, see :v6.0:`MongoDB v6.0 Release Notes
      </release-notes/6.0/>`. |service| will upgrade the cluster
      to the stable release version when it is generally available.

   To use a :manual:`rapid release </reference/versioning/>` 
   MongoDB version, you must select :guilabel:`Latest Release` for 
   auto-upgrades. You can't select a specific rapid release version.

   As new patch releases become available, |service| upgrades to
   these releases via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   To learn more about how |service| handles end of life of major
   MongoDB versions, see :ref:`atlas-eol-upgrade`.

   |service| always upgrades the cluster to the latest stable release
   of the specified version via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   You cannot downgrade the cluster to an earlier MongoDB version.

   You can switch from using the :guilabel:`Latest Release` to using a
   specific release only if the latest MongoDB version is a major
   release.
