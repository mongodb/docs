MongoDB supports X.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:ref:`TLS/SSL connection <configure-mongod-mongos-for-tls-ssl>`. Sharded cluster
members and replica set members can use X.509 certificates to verify
their membership to the cluster or the replica set instead of using
:ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>`. The membership authentication is
an internal process.

.. |binary| replace:: MongoDB

Enabling internal authentication also enables 
:doc:`/core/authorization`. Clients must authenticate as a user in order to 
connect and perform operations in the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles` tutorial for 
  instructions on adding users to the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` tutorial 
  for instructions on using X.509 certificates for user authentication.

Member X.509 Certificate
------------------------

.. note::

   You must have valid X.509 certificates.

Configure Replica Set/Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------------

Outside of rolling upgrade procedures, every component of a :term:`replica
set` or :term:`sharded cluster` should use the same
``--clusterAuthMode`` setting to ensure it can securely connect to all
other components in the deployment.

For :term:`replica set` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
members of the replica set.

For :term:`sharded cluster` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Use Command-line Options (``tls``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The procedures in this section use the ``tls`` settings/option. For
   procedures using the deprecated ``ssl`` aliases, see
   :ref:`configure-member-ssl`.
   
   The ``tls`` settings/options provide **identical** functionality
   as the ``ssl`` options since MongoDB has always supported TLS 1.0
   and later.

            authentication, append the additional TLS/SSL options
            ``--clusterAuthMode`` and ``--sslClusterFile``, as in the
            following example for a member of a replica set:

Additional Information
----------------------

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to X.509 internal
authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509`.

To perform a rolling update of the certificates to new certificates
with different ``DN``, see
:doc:`/tutorial/rotate-x509-membership-certificates`.
