Install or Upgrade the On-Prem MMS Monitoring with ``deb`` Packages
===================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| is a service to monitor and back up a MongoDB infrastructure. This
tutorial describes the basic process to install or upgrade the MMS Application Package.

At a high level, a basic installation will look like the following.
The estimated setup time is less than an hour.

#. Configure an MMS Application Server that meets the :doc:`hardware
   requirements </core/requirements>`.

#. Install a single MongoDB replica set to be used for the MMS
   Application database, as described in
   :doc:`/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.
   You **cannot** use a replica set that is being used to store other data.

#. Install an SMTP email server as appropriate for your environment.

#. Install the MMS Application Package.

#. Configure the MMS server's URL, email addresses, and Mongo URI connection strings.
   See :doc:`/reference/configuration` for more information.

#. Start up the MMS Application. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/start-and-stop-application` for more information.

#. Optionally install the MMS Backup Service.

Prerequisites
-------------

Configure an MMS Application Server that meets the :doc:`hardware
requirements and software requirements </core/requirements>`.

Ensure that you have :doc:`deployed the backing MongoDB instances
</tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` that MMS uses to store
application data. For additional information on installing MongoDB,
see the :manual:`MongoDB Installation tutorials </installation>`.

Upgrade |mms| from 1.2 and Earlier
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. COMMENT: This procedure is intentionally left in the old steps format for now.

Due to the `company name change
<http://www.mongodb.com/press/10gen-announces-company-name-change-mongodb-inc>`_,
the name of the MMS package changed between versions 1.2 and 1.3.
Therefore, to upgrade the |mms| server from *any* version before 1.3,
use the following procedure:

#. *Recommended.* Take a full backup of the MMS database before
   beginning the upgrade procedure.

#. Shut down MMS, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/10gen-mms stop

#. Download the latest package from
   `the downloads page <http://www.mongodb.com/commercialsupport/downloads>`_
   and proceed with the instructions
   for a fresh install. Do not attempt to use your package manager
   to do an upgrade.

   When complete, |mms| is installed in the ``/opt/mongodb/mms``
   directory.

#. Follow all procedures for a new install, including configuring the
   options in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties``. If you
   used encrypted authentication credentials you will need to
   regenerate these manually.  *Do not copy the credentials from
   your old properties file. Old credentials will not work.*

#. Start MMS using the new package name:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

#. Update any Monitoring Agent. See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-monitoring-agent` for
   more information.
