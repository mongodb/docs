Overview
--------
In some circumstances, such as a :ref:`client reset scenario <client-resets>`, you might need to delete
a realm file and its auxiliary files. This is often useful during development to 
quickly reset your environment. However, doing so when you are running your app 
and realm instances are still open can cause data corruption or disrupt :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>`.

To avoid losing data and disrupting Device Sync, you can delete these files when 
all instances of a realm are closed. Before you delete a realm file, 
**be sure that you back up any important objects, as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm**.

To safely delete a realm file while the app is running, you can use the
`Realm.deleteRealm()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/delete-realm.html>`__
method. The following code demonstrates this:

   :language: kotlin

Delete a Realm File to Avoid Migration
--------------------------------------

If you iterate rapidly as you develop your app, you may want to delete a realm
file instead of migrating it when you make schema changes. The Realm
configuration provides a `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm-configuration/index.html#-910115110%2FProperties%2F-1651551339>`__
parameter to help with this case. 

When you use ``deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded``, Realm deletes the realm
file if a migration is required. Then, you can create objects that match the new
schema instead of writing migration blocks for development or test data.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/OpenARealmTest.snippet.delete-realm-if-migration-needed.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. important:: Do Not Use ``deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded`` in Production

   Never release an app to production with this flag set to ``true``.
