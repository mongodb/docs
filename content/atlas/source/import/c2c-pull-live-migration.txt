|service| can pull a source {+cluster+} to an |service| 
{+cluster+} using the procedure described in this section.

This process uses |mongosync| as the underlying data migration tool,
enabling faster live migrations with less downtime:

- |service| syncs data from the source to the destination {+cluster+} until
  you cut your applications over to the destination |service| {+cluster+}.

- Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure:
  
  - Stop writes to the source {+cluster+}.
  - Stop your application instances, point them to the |service| {+cluster+},
    and restart them.

.. _c2c-pull-limitations:

Restrictions
------------

All the Mongosync limitations apply to this live 
migration. To learn more about these limitations, see |mongosync-limitations|.

Additionally, live migration (pull) doesn't support:

- Rapid releases as the source or destination {+cluster+} version.
- :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` or :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>`
  for either the source or destination {+cluster+}.

Supported Source and Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration Pairs
------------------------------------------------------------------

For this type of live migration, |service| supports the following source
and destination {+cluster+} configuration pairs:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/c2c-live-migration-supported-cluster-configurations.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

- If the {+cluster+} runs with authentication, meet the following prerequisites:

  - For replica sets, grant the :authrole:`backup`, :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`, 
    :authrole:`clusterMonitor` roles and the :authaction:`bypassWriteBlockingMode`
    action on the admin database to the user that 
    will run the migration process. 
    
    - :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role is not required only if you choose to disable 
      embedded verification and the source {+cluster+} version is 6.0 or above.

  - For sharded {+clusters+}, in addition to the required :authrole:`Project Owner` 
    and :authrole:`clusterMonitor` roles, grant the :authrole:`backup`, 
    :authrole:`readAnyDatabase` roles and the :authaction:`bypassWriteBlockingMode` 
    action on the admin database to the user
    that will run the migration process. Ensure the specified user exists
    on every shard and the config server replica set.
    The user must have permissions that allow the following actions:

    - Stop or start the sharded {+cluster+} balancer.
    - Read all databases and collections on the host.
    - Read the oplog on the host.

  - Ensure that this user is authenticated using
    :manual:`both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

Network Access

.. _live-import-c2c-migration-validation:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the following live migration procedure, |service| runs
validation checks on the source and destination {+clusters+} and verifies that:

- The source {+cluster+}\'s database user has the correct permissions as
  described in :ref:`live-import-c2c-security`.
- The source {+cluster+} does not contain the
  ``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use`` metadata database. You must
  manually drop that database before starting the migration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-no-data-destination-cluster.rst

.. note:: 
   
   If you are migrating from a sharded source {+cluster+} running MongoDB version 5.0, 
   you must first run the following :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command 
   on the primary replica set member of each shard in the source {+cluster+}.
   This command ensures all orphaned documents are correctly purged before the migration.
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      db.runCommand({cleanupOrphaned: "<database>.<collection>"})

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-network-encryption-pull-migration.rst

Database Users and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| doesn't migrate any user or role data to the destination {+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-create-atlas-user.rst

If the source {+cluster+} enforces authentication, you must recreate the
credentials that your applications use on the destination |service| {+cluster+}.
|service| uses :ref:`SCRAM <authentication-scram>` for user authentication.
To learn more, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users`.

.. _oplog-reqs-live-migration:

Oplog Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source {+cluster+} requirements:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-oplog-source-cluster.rst

Destination {+cluster+} requirements:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-oplog-destination-cluster.rst

.. _lm-pull-load-balancers:

Source and Destination {+Cluster+} Balancers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-source-destination-balancers.rst

.. _destination-cluster-configuration:

Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure the destination {+cluster+}, consider the following:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-no-data-destination-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-destination-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-perf-target-cluster.rst

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or a {+Flex-cluster+} as
  the destination {+cluster+} for live migration.

- Don't change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Avoid Workloads on the Destination {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writes are blocked during the live migration:

- When a live migration starts, writes to the destination {+cluster+}
  are blocked. Attempts to perform writes to the destination {+cluster+}
  fail.
- Before proceeding with the cutover, you must manually stop writes to
  your source {+cluster+}. |service| enforces this by enabling write blocking
  on the source {+cluster+} during the cutover process. 

  .. important::

     Source and destination {+cluster+} write blocking during cutover occurs if
     you are migrating source {+cluster+} running MongoDB version 6.0 and later.

- After a live migration completes successfully or fails, writes to the
  destination {+cluster+} may continue.

  .. note::

     |service| automatically attempts to remove the write blocks when the 
     migration is complete.
     
     If you need to manually remove the write block on your {+cluster+}, use 
     the :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode` command with the ``global`` field 
     set to ``false``:

     .. code-block:: sh
  
        db.adminCommand( {
          setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
          global: false
        } )

     To run the ``setUserWriteBlockMode`` command, the user must
     have the :authaction:`setUserWriteBlockMode` privilege.

Don't run multiple migrations to the same destination {+cluster+} at the
same time.

Don't start the cutover process for your applications to the destination
{+cluster+} while the live migration process is syncing.

Migrate Your {+Cluster+}
------------------------

.. note:: Staging and Production Migrations

   Consider running this procedure twice. Run a partial migration
   that stops at the :guilabel:`Perform the Cutover` step *first*. This
   creates an up-to-date |service|-backed staging {+cluster+} to test
   application behavior and performance using the latest
   :driver:`driver version </driver-compatibility-reference>` that
   supports the MongoDB version of the |service| {+cluster+}.

   After you test your application, run the full migration
   procedure using a separate |service| {+cluster+} to create your
   |service|-backed production environment.
