applyOps (internal)
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: applyOps

   :param array operations: an array of operations to perform.

   :param array preCondition: Optional. Defines one or more conditions that the destination must meet
                              applying the entries from the ``<operations>`` array.
                              Use ``ns`` to
                              specify a :term:`namespace`, ``q`` to specify a :term:`query` and
                              ``res`` to specify the result that the query should match. You may
                              specify zero, one, or many ``preCondition`` documents.

   :dbcommand:`applyOps` provides a way to apply entries from an
   :term:`oplog` created by :term:`replica set` members and
   :term:`master` instances in a master/:term:`slave`
   deployment. :dbcommand:`applyOps` is primarily an internal command
   to support sharding functionality, and has the following prototype
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { applyOps: [ <operations> ], preCondition: [ { ns: <namespace>, q: <query>, res: <result> } ] } )

   :dbcommand:`applyOps` applies oplog entries from the
   ``<operations>`` array, to the :program:`mongod` instance. The
   ``preCondition`` array provides the ability to specify conditions
   that must be true in order to apply the oplog entry.

   You can specify as many ``preCondition`` sets as needed. If you
   specify the ``ns`` option, :dbcommand:`applyOps` will only apply
   oplog entries for the :term:`collection` described by that
   namespace. You may also specify a query in the ``q`` field with a
   corresponding expected result in the ``res`` field that must match
   in order to apply the oplog entry.
