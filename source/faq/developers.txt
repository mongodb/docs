.. _faq-dev-namespace:

What is a namespace in MongoDB?
-------------------------------

A "namespace" is the concatenation of the :term:`database` name and
the :term:`collection` names [#indexes-are-namespaces]_ with a period
character in between.

Collections are containers for documents that share one or more
indexes. Databases are groups of collections stored on disk using a
single set of data files. [#ns-limit]_

For an example ``acme.users`` namespace, ``acme`` is the database
name and ``users`` is the collection name. Period characters **can**
occur in collection names, so that ``acme.user.history`` is a
valid namespace, with ``acme`` as the database name, and
``user.history`` as the collection name.

While data models like this appear to support nested collections, the
collection namespace is flat, and there is no difference from the
perspective of MongoDB between ``acme``, ``acme.users``, and
``acme.records``.

.. [#indexes-are-namespaces] Each index also has its own namespace.

.. [#ns-limit] MongoDB database have an configurable limit on the
   :limit:`number of namespaces <Number of Namespaces>` in a database.

How do you copy all objects from one collection to another?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can use the following operation to
duplicate the entire collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.source.copyTo(newCollection)

.. include:: /includes/warning-copyto-loss-of-type-fidelity.rst

Also consider the :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` :term:`command
<database command>` that may provide some of this functionality.

If you remove a document, does MongoDB remove it from disk?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

When you use :method:`db.collection.remove()`, the object will no longer
exist in MongoDB's on-disk data storage.

When does MongoDB write updates to disk?
----------------------------------------

MongoDB flushes writes to disk on a regular interval. In the default
configuration, MongoDB writes data to the main data files on disk
every 60 seconds and commits the :term:`journal` roughly every 100
milliseconds. These values are configurable with the
:setting:`journalCommitInterval` and :setting:`syncdelay`.

These values represent the *maximum* amount of time between the
completion of a write operation and the point when the write is
durable in the journal, if enabled, and when MongoDB flushes data to
the disk. In many cases MongoDB and the operating system flush data to
disk more frequently, so that the above values represents a
theoretical maximum.

However, by default, MongoDB uses a "lazy" strategy to write to
disk. This is advantageous in situations where the database receives a
thousand increments to an object within one second, MongoDB only needs
to flush this data to disk once. In addition to the aforementioned
configuration options, you can also use :dbcommand:`fsync` and
:dbcommand:`getLastError` to modify this strategy.

How do I do transactions and locking in MongoDB?
------------------------------------------------

MongoDB does not have support for traditional locking or complex
transactions with rollback. MongoDB aims to be lightweight, fast, and
predictable in its performance. This is similar to the MySQL MyISAM
autocommit model. By keeping transaction support extremely simple,
MongoDB can provide greater performance especially for
:term:`partitioned <partition>` or :term:`replicated <replication>`
systems with a number of database server processes.

MongoDB *does* have support for atomic operations *within* a single
document. Given the possibilities provided by nested documents, this
feature provides support for a large number of use-cases.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations` page.

How do you aggregate data with MongoDB?
---------------------------------------

In version 2.1 and later, you can use the new ":doc:`aggregation
framework </applications/aggregation>`," with the
:dbcommand:`aggregate` command.

MongoDB also supports :term:`map-reduce` with the
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` command, as well as basic aggregation with the
:dbcommand:`group`, :dbcommand:`count`, and
:dbcommand:`distinct`. commands.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/aggregation` page.

Why does MongoDB log so many "Connection Accepted" events?
----------------------------------------------------------

If you see a very large number connection and re-connection messages
in your MongoDB log, then clients are frequently connecting and
disconnecting to the MongoDB server. This is normal behavior for
applications that do not use request pooling, such as CGI. Consider
using FastCGI, an Apache Module, or some other kind of persistent
application server to decrease the connection overhead.

If these connections do not impact your performance you can use the
run-time :setting:`quiet` option or the command-line option
:option:`--quiet <mongod --quiet>` to suppress these messages from the
log.

Does MongoDB run on Amazon EBS?
-------------------------------

Yes.

MongoDB users of all sizes have had a great deal of success using
MongoDB on the EC2 platform using EBS disks.

.. seealso:: :ecosystem:`Amazon EC2 </platforms/amazon-ec2>`

Why are MongoDB's data files so large?
--------------------------------------

MongoDB aggressively preallocates data files to reserve space and
avoid file system fragmentation. You can use the :setting:`smallfiles`
setting to modify the file preallocation strategy.

.. seealso:: :ref:`faq-disk-size`

.. _faq-small-documents:

How do I optimize storage use for small documents?
--------------------------------------------------

Each MongoDB document contains a certain amount of overhead. This
overhead is normally insignificant but becomes significant if all
documents are just a few bytes, as might be the case if the documents
in your collection only have one or two fields.

Consider the following suggestions and strategies for optimizing
storage utilization for these collections:

- Use the ``_id`` field explicitly.

  MongoDB clients automatically add an ``_id`` field to each document
  and generate a unique 12-byte :term:`ObjectId` for the ``_id``
  field. Furthermore, MongoDB always indexes the ``_id`` field. For
  smaller documents this may account for a significant amount of
  space.

  To optimize storage use, users can specify a value for the ``_id`` field
  explicitly when inserting documents into the collection. This
  strategy allows applications to store a value in the ``_id`` field
  that would have occupied space in another portion of the document.

  You can store any value in the ``_id`` field, but because this value
  serves as a primary key for documents in the collection, it must
  uniquely identify them. If the field's value is not unique, then it
  cannot serve as a primary key as there would be collisions in the
  collection.

- Use shorter field names.

  MongoDB stores all field names in every document. For most
  documents, this represents a small fraction of the space used by a
  document; however, for small documents the field names may represent
  a proportionally large amount of space. Consider a collection of
  documents that resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { last_name : "Smith", best_score: 3.9 }

  If you shorten the filed named ``last_name`` to ``lname`` and the
  field name ``best_score`` to ``score``, as follows, you could save 9
  bytes per document.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { lname : "Smith", score : 3.9 }

  Shortening field names reduces expressiveness and does not provide
  considerable benefit on for larger documents and where document
  overhead is not significant concern. Shorter field names do not
  reduce the size of indexes, because indexes have a predefined
  structure.

  In general it is not necessary to use short field names.

- Embed documents.

  In some cases you may want to embed documents in other documents
  and save on the per-document overhead.

.. _faq-developers-when-to-use-gridfs:

When should I use GridFS?
-------------------------

For documents in a MongoDB collection, you should always use
:term:`GridFS` for storing files larger than 16 MB.

In some situations, storing large files may be more efficient in a
MongoDB database than on a system-level filesystem.

- If your filesystem limits the number of files in a directory, you can
  use GridFS to store as many files as needed.

- When you want to keep your files and metadata automatically synced
  and deployed across a number of systems and facilities.  When using
  :ref:`geographically distributed replica sets
  <replica-set-geographical-distribution>` MongoDB can distribute
  files and their metadata automatically to a number of
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and facilities.

- When you want to access information from portions of large
  files without having to load whole files into memory, you can use
  GridFS to recall sections of files without reading the entire file
  into memory.

Do not use GridFS if you need to update the content of the entire file
atomically. As an alternative you can store multiple versions of each
file and specify the current version of the file in the metadata. You
can update the metadata field that indicates "latest" status in an
atomic update after uploading the new version of the file, and later
remove previous versions if needed.

Furthermore, if your files are all smaller the 16 MB
:limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, consider storing the file manually
within a single document. You may use the BinData data type to store
the binary data. See your :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
documentation for details on using BinData.

For more information on GridFS, see :doc:`/applications/gridfs`.

How does MongoDB address SQL or Query injection?
------------------------------------------------

BSON
~~~~

As a client program assembles a query in MongoDB, it builds a BSON
object, not a string. Thus traditional SQL injection attacks are not a
problem. More details and some nuances are covered below.

MongoDB represents queries as :term:`BSON` objects. Typically
:doc:`client libraries </applications/drivers>` provide a convenient,
injection free, process to build these objects. Consider the following
C++ example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   BSONObj my_query = BSON( "name" << a_name );
   auto_ptr<DBClientCursor> cursor = c.query("tutorial.persons", my_query);

Here, ``my_query`` then will have a value such as ``{ name : "Joe"
}``. If ``my_query`` contained special characters, for example
``,``, ``:``, and ``{``, the query simply wouldn't match any
documents. For example, users cannot hijack a query and convert it to
a delete.

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-javascript-with-noscript.rst

All of the following MongoDB operations permit you to run arbitrary JavaScript
expressions directly on the server:

- :query:`$where`
- :method:`db.eval()`
- :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
- :dbcommand:`group`

You must exercise care in these cases to prevent users from
submitting malicious JavaScript.

Fortunately, you can express most queries in MongoDB without
JavaScript and for queries that require JavaScript, you can mix
JavaScript and non-JavaScript in a single query. Place all the
user-supplied fields directly in a :term:`BSON` field and pass
JavaScript code to the :query:`$where` field.

- If you need to pass user-supplied values in a :query:`$where`
  clause, you may escape these values with the ``CodeWScope``
  mechanism. When you set user-submitted values as variables in the
  scope document,  you can avoid evaluating them on the database
  server.

- If you need to use :method:`db.eval()` with user supplied values, you can
  either use a ``CodeWScope`` or you can supply extra arguments to your
  function. For instance:

  .. code-block:: sh

     db.eval(function(userVal){...},
             user_value);

  This will ensure that your application sends ``user_value`` to the
  database server as data rather than code.

.. _faq-dollar-sign-escaping:

Dollar Sign Operator Escaping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field names in MongoDB's query language have semantic meaning. The
dollar sign (i.e ``$``) is a reserved character used to represent
:doc:`operators </reference/operators>` (i.e. :update:`$inc`.) Thus,
you should ensure that your application's users cannot inject operators
into their inputs.

In some cases, you may wish to build a BSON object with a
user-provided key.  In these situations, keys will need to substitute
the reserved ``$`` and ``.`` characters. Any character is sufficient,
but consider using the Unicode full width equivalents: ``U+FF04``
(i.e. "＄") and ``U+FF0E`` (i.e. "．").

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   BSONObj my_object = BSON( a_key << a_name );

The user may have supplied a ``$`` value in the ``a_key`` value. At
the same time, ``my_object`` might be ``{ $where : "things"
}``. Consider the following cases:

- **Insert**. Inserting this into the database does no harm. The
  insert process does not evaluate the object as a query.

  .. note::

     MongoDB client drivers, if properly implemented, check for
     reserved characters in keys on inserts.

- **Update**.  The :method:`db.collection.update()` operation permits ``$`` operators
  in the update argument but does not support the
  :query:`$where` operator. Still, some users
  may be able to inject operators that can manipulate a single
  document only. Therefore your application should escape keys, as
  mentioned above, if reserved characters are possible.

- **Query** Generally this is not a problem for queries that
  resemble ``{ x : user_obj }``: dollar signs are not top level and
  have no effect. Theoretically it may be possible for the user to
  build a query themselves. But checking the user-submitted content for
  ``$`` characters in key names may help protect against this kind
  of injection.

Driver-Specific Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the "`PHP MongoDB Driver Security Notes
<http://us.php.net/manual/en/mongo.security.php>`_" page in the PHP
driver documentation for more information

.. _faq-dev-concurrency:

How does MongoDB provide concurrency?
-------------------------------------

MongoDB implements a readers-writer lock. This means that
at any one time, only one client may be writing or any number
of clients may be reading, but that reading and writing cannot
occur simultaneously.

In standalone and :term:`replica sets <replica set>` the lock's scope
applies to a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance or :term:`primary`
instance. In a sharded cluster, locks apply to each individual shard,
not to the whole cluster.

For more information, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

.. _faq-dev-compare-order-for-BSON-types:

What is the compare order for BSON types?
-----------------------------------------

MongoDB permits documents within a single collection to
have fields with different :term:`BSON` types. For instance,
the following documents may exist within a single collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x: "string" }
   { x: 42 }

.. include:: /includes/fact-sort-order.rst

Consider the following :binary:`~bin.mongo` example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.test.insert( {x : 3 } );
   db.test.insert( {x : 2.9 } );
   db.test.insert( {x : new Date() } );
   db.test.insert( {x : true } );

   db.test.find().sort({x:1});
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03155dce8de6586fb002c7"), "x" : 2.9 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03154cce8de6586fb002c6"), "x" : 3 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031566ce8de6586fb002c9"), "x" : true }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031563ce8de6586fb002c8"), "x" : "Tue Nov 17 2009 16:28:03 GMT-0500 (EST)" }

The :query:`$type` operator provides access to :term:`BSON type
<BSON types>` comparison in the MongoDB query syntax. See the
documentation on :term:`BSON types` and the :query:`$type` operator
for additional information.

.. include:: /includes/warning-mixing-types.rst

.. seealso::

   - The :doc:`Tailable Cursors </tutorial/create-tailable-cursor>`
     page for an example of a C++ use of ``MinKey``.

.. commenting out: per scott, we shouldn't be referencing source code;
   *and* this header file actually doesn't contain anything other than
   include statements
   The :source:`jsobj.h <src/mongo/db/jsobj.h>` source
   file for the definition of ``MinKey`` and ``MaxKey``.

.. _faq-developers-query-for-nulls:

How do I query for fields that have null values?
------------------------------------------------

Fields in a document may store ``null`` values, as in a notional
collection, ``test``, with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, cancelDate: null }
   { _id: 2 }

Different query operators treat ``null`` values differently:

- The ``{ cancelDate : null }`` query matches documents that either
  contains the ``cancelDate`` field whose value is ``null`` *or* that
  do not contain the ``cancelDate`` field:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.test.find( { cancelDate: null } )

  The query returns both documents:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "_id" : 1, "cancelDate" : null }
     { "_id" : 2 }

- The ``{ cancelDate : { $type: 10 } }`` query matches documents that
  contains the ``cancelDate`` field whose value is ``null`` *only*;
  i.e. the value of the ``cancelDate`` field is of BSON Type ``Null``
  (i.e. ``10``) :

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.test.find( { cancelDate : { $type: 10 } } )

  The query returns only the document that contains the ``null`` value:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "_id" : 1, "cancelDate" : null }

- The ``{ cancelDate : { $exists: false } }`` query matches documents
  that do not contain the ``cancelDate`` field:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.test.find( { cancelDate : { $exists: false } } )

  The query returns only the document that does *not* contain the
  ``cancelDate`` field:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "_id" : 2 }

.. seealso:: The reference documentation for the :query:`$type` and
   :query:`$exists` operators.

.. _faq-restrictions-on-collection-names:

Are there any restrictions on the names of Collections?
-------------------------------------------------------

Collection names can be any UTF-8 string with the following
exceptions:

- A collection name should begin with a letter or an underscore.

- The empty string (``""``) is not a valid collection name.

- Collection names cannot contain the ``$`` character. (version 2.2 only)

- Collection names cannot contain the null character: ``\0``

- Do not name a collection using the ``system.`` prefix. MongoDB
  reserves ``system.``
  for system collections, such as the
  ``system.indexes`` collection.

- The maximum size of a collection name is 128 characters, including
  the name of the database. However, for maximum flexibility,
  collections should have names less than 80 characters.

If your collection name includes special characters, such as the
underscore character, then to access the collection use the
:method:`db.getCollection()` method or a :api:`similar method for your
driver <>`.

.. example:: To create a collection ``_foo`` and insert the
   ``{ a : 1 }`` document, use the following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getCollection("_foo").insert( { a : 1 } )

   To perform a query, use the :method:`~db.collection.find()`
   method, in as the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getCollection("_foo").find()

.. _faq-developers-isolate-cursors:

How do I isolate cursors from intervening write operations?
-----------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB cursors can return the same document more than once in some
situations. [#duplicate-document-in-result-set]_ You can use the
:method:`snapshot() <cursor.snapshot()>` method on a cursor to isolate
the operation for a very specific case.

:method:`snapshot() <cursor.snapshot()>` traverses the
index on the ``_id`` field and guarantees that the query will return
each document (with respect to the value of the ``_id`` field) no more
than once. [#id-is-immutable]_

The :method:`snapshot() <cursor.snapshot()>` does not guarantee that
the data returned by the query will reflect a single moment in time
*nor* does it provide isolation from insert or delete operations.

.. warning::

   - You **cannot** use :method:`snapshot() <cursor.snapshot()>` with
     :term:`sharded collections <sharding>`.

   - You **cannot** use :method:`snapshot() <cursor.snapshot()>` with
     :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` or :method:`hint()
     <cursor.hint()>` cursor methods.


As an alternative, if your collection has a field or fields that are
never modified, you can use a *unique* index on this field or these
fields to achieve a similar result as the :method:`snapshot()
<cursor.snapshot()>`. Query with :method:`hint() <cursor.hint()>` to
explicitly force the query to use that index.

.. [#duplicate-document-in-result-set] As a cursor returns documents other
   operations may interleave with the query: if some of these
   operations are :doc:`updates </applications/update>` that cause the
   document to move (in the case of a table scan, caused by document
   growth,) or that change the indexed field on the index used by the
   query; then the cursor will return the same document more than
   once.

.. [#id-is-immutable] MongoDB does not permit changes to the value of the
   ``_id`` field; it is not possible for a cursor that transverses
   this index to pass the same document more than once.

.. _faq-developers-embed-documents:

When should I embed documents within other documents?
-----------------------------------------------------

When :doc:`modeling data in MongoDB </core/data-modeling>`, embedding
is frequently the choice for:

- "contains" relationships between entities.

- one-to-many relationships when the "many" objects *always* appear
  with or are viewed in the context of their parents.

You should also consider embedding for performance reasons if you have
a collection with a large number of small documents. Nevertheless, if
small, separate documents represent the natural model for the data,
then you should maintain that model.

If, however, you can group these small documents by some logical
relationship *and* you frequently retrieve the documents by this
grouping, you might consider "rolling-up" the small documents into
larger documents that contain an array of subdocuments. Keep in mind
that if you often only need to retrieve a subset of the documents
within the group, then "rolling-up" the documents may not provide
better performance.

"Rolling up" these small documents into logical groupings means that queries to
retrieve a group of documents involve sequential reads and fewer random disk
accesses.

.. Will probably need to break up the following sentence:

Additionally, "rolling up" documents and moving common fields to the
larger document benefit the index on these fields. There would be fewer
copies of the common fields *and* there would be fewer associated key
entries in the corresponding index. See :doc:`/core/indexes` for more
information on indexes.

.. Commenting out.. If the data is too large to fit entirely in RAM,
   embedding provides better RAM cache utilization.

.. Commenting out.. If your small documents are approximately the page
   cache unit size, there is no benefit for ram cache efficiency, although
   embedding will provide some benefit regarding random disk I/O.

.. _faq-developers-manual-padding:

Can I manually pad documents to prevent moves during updates?
-------------------------------------------------------------

An update can cause a document to move on disk if the document grows in
size. To *minimize* document movements, MongoDB uses
:ref:`padding <write-operations-padding-factor>`.

You should not have to pad manually because MongoDB adds
:ref:`padding automatically <write-operations-padding-factor>` and can
adaptively adjust the amount of padding added to documents to prevent
document relocations following updates.

You can change the default :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor`
calculation by using the the :dbcommand:`collMod` command with the
:collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag. The :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`
flag ensures that MongoDB allocates document space in sizes that are
powers of 2, which helps ensure that MongoDB can efficiently reuse
free space created by document deletion or relocation.

However, in those exceptions where you must pad manually, you can use
the strategy of first adding a temporary field to a document and then
:update:`$unset` the field, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myTempPadding = [ "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
                         "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
                         "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
                         "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"];

   db.myCollection.insert( { _id: 5, paddingField: myTempPadding } );

   db.myCollection.update( { _id: 5 },
                           { $unset: { paddingField: "" } }
                         )

   db.myCollection.update( { _id: 5 },
                           { $set: { realField: "Some text that I might have needed padding for" } }
                         )

.. seealso::

   :ref:`write-operations-padding-factor`
