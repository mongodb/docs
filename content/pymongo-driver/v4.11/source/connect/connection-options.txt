Overview
--------

This section describes the MongoDB connection and authentication options
available in {+driver-short+}. You can configure your connection by using either
the connection URI or arguments to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

.. _pymongo-connection-uri:

Using the Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you pass a connection URI to the ``MongoClient`` constructor, you can include
connection options in the string as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. In the following example,
the connection URI contains the ``connectTimeoutMS`` option with a value of ``60000``
and the ``tls`` option with a value of ``true``:

.. code-block:: python

   uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?connectTimeoutMS=60000&tls=true"
   client = pymongo.MongoClient(uri)

.. _pymongo-mongo-client-settings:

Using a ``MongoClient``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass connection options as arguments to the ``MongoClient`` constructor
instead of including them in your connection URI.
Configuring the connection this way makes it easier to
change settings at runtime and helps you catch errors during compilation.
The following example shows how to use the ``MongoClient`` constructor to set
connection options:

.. code-block:: python

   uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>"
   client = pymongo.MongoClient(uri, connectTimeoutMS=60000, tls=True)
