Monitoring Agent Installation
-----------------------------

Consider the following issues if you encounter difficulty installing
the Monitoring agent.

- Make sure that the system running the agent has ``pymongo``
  installed. If your system runs a 2.4.x series Python, verify the
  installation of other :ref:`requirements <mms-requirements>`.

- Ensure that the system running the agent can resolve and connect to the
  MongoDB instances. To confirm, log into the system where the agent
  is running and issue a command in the following form:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo [hostname]:[port]

  Replace ``[hostname]`` with the hostname and ``[port]`` with the
  port that the database is listening on.

- Verify that the Monitoring agent can connect on TCP port 443
  (outbound) to the MMS server (i.e. "``mms.mongodb.com``".)

- Allow the agent to run for 5-10 minutes to allow host discovery
  and initial data collection.

- If your MongoDB instances run with authentication enabled, ensure
  that MMS has these credentials. You can supply these credentials when
  adding a host by specifying credentials in the "Add Host Interface," for
  every host that has authentication enabled. You
  may also click on the "Edit" host button (i.e. the pencil) on the
  Hosts page in the MMS console to provide credentials.

- If you continue to encounter problems, check the agent's output or
  logs for errors.

``hmac`` Installation
---------------------

.. note::

   This section addresses a potential issue for users running a
   version of Python in the 2.4-series. Users of later Python
   versions do not require hmac.

If ``easy_install`` produces an error, or you see the following error
in your agent logs, you will need to install the ``hmac`` package
manually:

.. code-block:: none

   AttributeError:'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'new'

To install the ``hmac`` package, begin by downloading the latest
source package. The following example uses version ``20101005``.
Issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   curl http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/h/hmac/hmac-20101005.tar.gz > hmac-20101005.tar.gz

Always download the latest version of ``hmac``, which
you can find at the `hmac page on PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hmac>`_.

Extract the files from the archive with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   tar -zxf hmac-20101005.tar.gz

Change directories, build and install the package with the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd hmac-20101005/
   python setup.py install

You may need root (i.e. ``sudo``) privileges to run the final
``install`` step.
