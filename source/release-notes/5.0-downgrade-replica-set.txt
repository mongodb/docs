Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control
--------------

If your replica set has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required
privileges.

Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings.

.. |target| replace:: primary

.. _5.0-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   - Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an
     initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

   - Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
     :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your replica set:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/5.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

#. To ensure that all members of the replica set reflect the updated
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member and
   check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.4" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of |newfcv|,
   wait for the member to reflect version |oldfcv| before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove fCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

- No persisted features currently.

.. |binary| replace:: any replica set member

3. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- No persisted features currently.

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect
   the prerequisite changes. That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
