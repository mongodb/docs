msgid "For MongoDB ``2.4.1``, ``2.4`` refers to the release series and ``.1`` refers to the revision. The second component of the release series (e.g. ``4`` in ``2.4.1``) describes the type of release series. Release series ending with even numbers (e.g. ``4`` above) are *stable* and ready for production, while odd numbers are for *development* and testing only."
