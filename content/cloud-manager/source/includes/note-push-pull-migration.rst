You can live migrate source deployments monitored by |cloud-short| running
MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+ to |service-short|. To learn
more, see :atlas:`Live Migrate Your MongoDB Cluster Monitored by Cloud Manager to Atlas </import/c2c-push-live-migration/>`.
For source deployments running MongoDB earlier than {+c2c-version+}, you
can use these :ref:`legacy migration options <mongomirror-based-live-migration-choices>`.
