The values of the indexed field must be either:

- :ref:`GeoJSON objects <geospatial-geojson>`

- :ref:`Legacy coordinate pairs <geospatial-legacy>`

  For legacy coordinate pairs, the 2dsphere index converts the data to
  :ref:`GeoJSON points <geojson-point>`.

To create a 2dsphere index, specify the string ``2dsphere`` as the index
type:

.. include:: /includes/indexes/code-examples/create-2dsphere-index.rst

.. note::

   When :ref:`creating a a 2dsphere index <2dsphere-index-create>`, the first 
   value, or longitude, must be between -180 and 180, inclusive. The second value, 
   or latitude, must be between -90 and 90, inclusive. These coordinates "wrap" 
   around the sphere. For example, -179.9 and +179.9 are near neighbors.

Use Cases
---------

Use 2dsphere indexes to query and perform calculations on location data
where the data points appear on Earth, or another spherical surface. For
example:

- A food delivery application uses 2dsphere indexes to support
  searches for nearby restaurants.

- A route planning application uses 2dsphere indexes to calculate
  the shortest distance between rest stops.

- A city planner uses 2dsphere indexes to find parks that exist within
  city limits.

Details
-------

2dsphere indexes are always :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` and have
special behaviors when created as part of a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>`.

``sparse`` Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2dsphere indexes are always :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`. When
you create a 2dsphere index, MongoDB ignores the ``sparse`` option.

If an existing or newly inserted document does not contain a 2dsphere
index field (or the field is ``null`` or an empty array), MongoDB does
not add an entry for the document to the index.

Compound 2dsphere Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For a compound index that includes a 2dsphere index key along with
  keys of other types, only the 2dsphere index field determines
  whether the index references a document.

- A compound 2dsphere index can reference multiple location and
  non-location fields. In contrast, a compound :ref:`2d <2d-index>`
  index can only reference one location field and one other field.
