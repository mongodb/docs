===============
Use Struct Tags
===============

You can specify the way that the Go Driver converts Go
structs to :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types/>` by using struct tags.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

The following code declares a struct of type ``BlogPost``. This struct
contains a struct tag that maps the ``WordCount`` field to the BSON
field name ``word_count``. By default, the driver marshals the other
fields as the lowercase of the struct field name:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin struct
   :end-before: end struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

The following example creates a ``BlogPost`` instance and inserts it
into the ``posts`` collection. During the insert operation, the driver
interprets the struct tag to marshal the ``WordCount``
struct field as ``word_count``:

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin create and insert
   :end-before: end create and insert
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the full example, you can find the following document
in the ``posts`` collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
       "title" : "Annuals vs. Perennials?",
       "author" : "Sam Lee",
       "word_count" : 682,
       "lastupdated": ...,
       "tags" : ["seasons", "gardening", "flower"]
   }

For an example on how to find a document, see :ref:`golang-find-one`.
