.. note:: Aggregation Pipeline as Alternative to Map-Reduce

   An :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` provides
   better performance and usability than a :doc:`map-reduce
   </core/map-reduce>` operation.

   Map-reduce operations can be rewritten using :ref:`aggregation
   pipeline stages <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` such
   as :pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$merge`. 

   For map-reduce operations that require custom functionality, MongoDB
   provides the :group:`$accumulator` and :expression:`$function`
   aggregation operators. Use these operators to define custom aggregation 
   expressions in JavaScript.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`
method is a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command. The
following examples use the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` method.
