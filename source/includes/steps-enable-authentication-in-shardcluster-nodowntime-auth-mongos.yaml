  tutorial. Leave the :setting:`security.keyFile` setting added in the
  tutorial.

   .. note::

      If your cluster has only one :binary:`~bin.mongos`, this step results
      in downtime while the :binary:`~bin.mongos` is offline.

   Follow the procedure to restart :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, one
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` at a time:

   #. Connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to shutdown.

   #. Use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()`
      method against the ``admin`` database to safely shut down the
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer()

   #. Restart :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the updated configuration file, 
      specifying the path to the config file using
      :option:`--config <mongos --config>`. For example, if the updated configuration file
      were named ``mongos-secure.conf``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongos --config <path>/mongos-secure.conf
