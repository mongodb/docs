Overview
--------

You can use read operations to retrieve data from your MongoDB database.
There are multiple types of read operations that access the data in
different ways. If you want to request results based on a set of criteria
from the existing set of data, you can use a find operation such as the 
``find()`` or ``findOne()`` methods.

You can also further specify the information you are requesting by
including additional parameters or by chaining other methods such as:

- :doc:`Sort Results </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>`
- :doc:`Skip Returned Results </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/skip>`
- :doc:`Limit the Number of Returned Results </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/limit>`
- :doc:`Specify Which Fields to Return </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/project>`

You can also use an aggregation operation to retrieve data. This type of 
operation allows you to apply an ordered pipeline of transformations to the 
matched data.

If you want to monitor the database for incoming data that matches a set of
criteria, you can use the watch operation to be notified in real-time when 
matching data is inserted.

Find
----

The ``find()`` method is called on the ``Collection`` object that
references the collection you want to query. The method accepts a query
document that describes the documents you want to retrieve. For more
information on how to specify your query document, see our guide on
how to :doc:`Specify a Query </fundamentals/crud/query-document>`.

To access the results, you can optionally pass a callback in the method
call or resolve the returned ``Promise`` object. See our guide on
:doc:`Promises and Callbacks </fundamentals/promises>` for more
information.

If you resolve the ``Promise`` returned by ``find()``, you receive
a reference to a ``Cursor`` with which you can navigate matched documents.
If you resolve the ``Promise`` returned by ``findOne()``, you receive the
matching document or ``null`` if there are no matches.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to find all pizzas ordered by Lemony Snicket
   yesterday. They run the following ``find()`` query on the
   ``orders`` collection:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start find crud example
      :end-before: end find crud example


   Once the operation returns, the ``findResult`` variable references a 
   ``Cursor``. You can print the documents retrieved using the ``forEach()``
   method as shown below:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      await cursor.forEach(console.dir);


   The output might resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      [
        { name: "Lemony Snicket", type: "horseradish pizza", qty: 1, status: "delivered", date: ... },
        { name: "Lemony Snicket", type: "coal-fired oven pizza", qty: 3, status: "canceled", date: ...},
        ...
      ]

See the :doc:`find() </usage-examples/find>` and :doc:`findOne()
</usage-examples/findOne>` for fully-runnable examples.

Aggregate
---------

If you want to run a custom processing pipeline to retrieve data from your
database, you can use the ``aggregate()`` method. This method accepts
aggregation expressions to run in sequence. These expressions let you filter,
group, and arrange the result data from a collection.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to run a status report on-demand to
   summarize pizza orders over the past week. They run the following
   ``aggregate()`` query on the ``orders`` collection to fetch the
   totals for each distinct "status" field:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start aggregate crud example
      :end-before: end aggregate crud example


   Once the operation returns, the ``aggregateResult`` variable references a 
   ``Cursor``. You can print the documents retrieved using the ``forEach()``
   method as shown below:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      await cursor.forEach(console.dir);


   The output might resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      [
        { _id: 'delivering', count: 5 },
        { _id: 'delivered', count: 37 },
        { _id: 'created', count: 9 },
      ]

See the MongoDB server manual pages on :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`
for more information on how to construct an aggregation pipeline.

Watch / Subscribe
-----------------

You can use the ``watch()`` method to monitor a collection for changes to
a collection that match certain criteria. These changes include inserted,
updated, replaced, and deleted documents. You can pass this method
a pipeline of aggregation comands that sequentially runs on the changed
data whenever write operations are executed on the collection.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to receive a notification whenever a new pizza
   order comes in. To accomplish this, they create an aggregation pipeline
   to filter on insert operations and return specific fields. They pass
   this pipeline to the ``watch()`` method called on the ``orders``
   collection as shown below:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start watch crud example
      :end-before: end watch crud example


For a runnable example of the ``watch()`` method using the NodeJS driver, see
the :doc:`change streams </usage-examples/changeStream>` usage example.
