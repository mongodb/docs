Overview
--------

If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the Backup
Agent to use SSL to connect to your deployment's :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances.

Configuring the agent to use SSL involves specifying which certificate to
use to sign MongoDB certificates and turning on the SSL option for the
MongoDB instances in |mms|.

Prerequisite
------------

To configure the agent to use SSL, you must have a trusted CA
certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's certificate.

Procedures
----------

Connections between Agents and MongoDB Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use SSL for the Backup Agent's connection to a MongoDB host, specify
the host's SSL settings when :doc:`adding the host
</tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>` or by :doc:`editing the host's settings
</tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`.
