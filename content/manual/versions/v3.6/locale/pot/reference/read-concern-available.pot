However, a query with :readconcern:`\"available\"` read concern may return orphan documents if the shard is undergoing chunk migrations since the :readconcern:`\"available\"` read concern, unlike :readconcern:`\"local\"` read concern, does not contact the shard's primary nor the config servers for updated :doc:`metadata </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`."
