Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the driver to configure **logging**
for your application. The purpose of logging is to record driver events.

A logger logs messages at a severity, or verbosity, level that you
can specify. By enabling a logger in your application, you can receive
information about your application's activities at a high level, a
detailed level, or somewhere in between.

.. tip::

   To learn more about logging severity levels, see the Wikipedia entry on
   the :wikipedia:`Syslog standard for message logging <Syslog#Severity_level>`.

Enable Logging
--------------

To configure a logger on your ``Client`` instance, call the
``SetLoggerOptions()`` method when creating your ``ClientOptions``
object. The ``SetLoggerOptions()`` method takes a ``LoggerOptions`` type 
as a parameter. Set this ``LoggerOptions`` type to configure the
logger for your application.

The following code shows how to create a client with logging enabled:

.. code-block:: go
   :emphasize-lines: 8
   
   loggerOptions := options.
   	Logger().
   	SetComponentLevel(options.LogComponentCommand, options.LogLevelDebug)

   clientOptions := options.
   	Client().
   	ApplyURI(uri).
   	SetLoggerOptions(loggerOptions)

   client, err := mongo.Connect(clientOptions)

Configure a Logger
------------------

To create a ``LoggerOptions`` object, call the ``options.Logger()``
method. The following table describes how to set properties on
a ``LoggerOptions`` type to configure your logger. The first column lists
the ``LoggerOptions`` properties, the second column describes the
properties, and the third column lists the corresponding setter method and
parameters for each property:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 31 38 31
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description
     - Setter Method

   * - | ``ComponentLevels``
       |
       | **Type**: ``map[LogComponent]LogLevel``
     - | A mapping of components to log severity levels. The driver uses the
         ``LogLevel`` for each ``LogComponent`` to determine if the log
         message is generated.
       |
       | To learn more about the ``LogComponent`` and ``LogLevel`` types, see
         the :ref:`Log Components and Severity Levels <golang-logging-component-severity>`
         section of this guide.
     - | ``SetComponentLevel()``
       |
       | **Parameters**: ``LogComponent``, ``LogLevel``

   * - | ``Sink``
       |
       | **Type**: ``LogSink``
     - | The logging interface that the driver uses to log messages.
         The ``LogSink`` type is an interface that you can implement to
         provide a custom sink or integrate a third-party
         logger for the driver's logs. If you don't set this
         property, the driver uses the standard logging library.
       |
       | To learn more, see the :ref:`Use a Custom Logger
         <golang-logging-custom>` and :ref:`Integrate Third-Party
         Loggers <golang-logging-thirdparty>` sections of this guide.
     - | ``SetSink()``
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``LogSink``

   * - | ``MaxDocumentLength``
       |
       | **Type**: ``uint``
       | **Default**: ``1000``
     - | The maximum length in bytes of each log message that the driver emits. If the
         message is larger than this value, the driver
         truncates it and appends ellipses to the partial log message.
     - | ``SetMaxDocumentLength()``
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``uint``

.. tip:: Write Logs to a Specific File
   
   By default, the standard logger logs messages to your console (``stderr``). You can
   specify a logging destination by setting the ``MONGODB_LOG_PATH``
   environment variable to ``stdout`` or a filepath.

.. _golang-logging-component-severity:

Log Components and Severity Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the components that the driver logs against, set the
``LogComponent`` type. The following table describes built-in
specifications for ``LogComponent``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 40 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
     - Enumeration Value

   * - ``LogComponentAll``
     - Enables logging for all components
     - ``0``

   * - ``LogComponentCommand``
     - Enables command monitor logging
     - ``1``

   * - ``LogComponentTopology``
     - Enables topology logging
     - ``2``

   * - ``LogComponentServerSelection``
     - Enables server selection logging
     - ``3``

   * - ``LogComponentConnection``
     - Enables connection services logging
     - ``4``

You can specify the log component by using either the setting name
or its enumeration value. The following code shows equivalent ways
of enabling command monitoring:

.. code-block:: go
   :copyable: false

   // Using named value
   comp := options.LogComponentCommand

   // Using enumeration
   comp := options.LogComponent(1)

To specify the log severity level, set the ``LogLevel``
type. The following code shows how to enable logging at the
``LevelDebug`` level:

.. code-block:: go
   :copyable: false

   lvl := options.LogLevelDebug

.. important::

   The {+driver-short+} currently emits only ``LevelDebug`` level
   messages, but it supports other specifications for ``LogLevel``. To
   learn more, see the `LogLevel <{+api+}/mongo/options#LogLevel>`__ API
   documentation.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example shows how to configure the standard logger with the
following specifications:

- The maximum document length is ``25`` bytes.
- The log component is ``LogComponentCommand``.
- The logging severity level is ``LevelDebug``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :emphasize-lines: 1-4, 10
   :start-after: start-standard-logger
   :end-before: end-standard-logger

The following code performs an insert operation, which generates log
messages:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: false

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
      :language: go
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-insert
      :end-before: end-insert

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      {"command":"{\"insert\": \"testColl\",\"or...","commandName":"insert","databaseName":"db","driverConnectionId":1,"message":"Command started","operationId":0,"requestId":13,"serverConnectionId":97377,"serverHost":"...","serverPort":27017,"timestamp":...}
      {"commandName":"insert","driverConnectionId":1,"durationMS":19,"message":"Command succeeded","operationId":0,"reply":"{\"n\": {\"$numberInt\":\"1\"},...","requestId":13,"serverConnectionId":97377,"serverHost":"...","serverPort":27017,"timestamp":...}

.. _golang-logging-custom:

Use a Custom Logger
-------------------

If the standard logging library does not meet your needs, you can
implement a custom logger. By customizing your logging configuration,
you have more control over the content, format, and frequency of log messages.

To use a custom logger, define a logger struct and implement the
``Info()`` and ``Error()`` methods for the struct. Next, set the logger as
the ``LogSink`` for your ``Client`` by calling the ``SetSink()`` method on
your ``LoggerOptions`` instance.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to define and implement a custom logger.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define the ``CustomLogger`` struct.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-customlogger-struct
         :end-before: end-customlogger-struct
      
      .. note::

         The preceding code example uses a ``Mutex`` type in the
         ``CustomLogger`` struct to ensure atomic writes and prevent
         race conditions. Setting a ``Mutex`` makes your logger safe for
         concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

   .. step:: Implement the ``Info()`` and ``Error()`` methods with custom log message formatting.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-customlogger-funcs
         :end-before: end-customlogger-funcs

   .. step:: Assign a ``Writer`` to your logger and set it as the ``Sink`` for your ``Client``.

      In this example, the logger logs commands and connection
      events at the ``LevelDebug`` level:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-set-customlogger
         :end-before: end-set-customlogger

   .. step:: Perform an operation.

      The following code performs an insert operation, which generates log
      messages:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: false

         .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
            :language: go
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-insert
            :end-before: end-insert

         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false

            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool created
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool ready
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool created
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool ready
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool created
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection pool ready
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection checkout started
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection created
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection ready
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection checked out
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Command started
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Command succeeded
            level: 1 DEBUG, message: Connection checked in

.. _golang-logging-thirdparty:

Integrate Third-Party Loggers
-----------------------------

There are many third-party logging packages available in Go. To use
a third-party logger in your application, create a logger and assign it
as the sink in your ``LoggerOptions`` instance.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to integrate ``logrus``,
a third-party logging package, into your application.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install the necessary packages.

      Run the following ``go get`` commands in your terminal to download
      the ``logrus`` packages required for this example:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
      
         go get github.com/bombsimon/logrusr/v4
         go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus

   .. step:: Define the ``logrus`` logger.

      The following code creates a ``logrus`` logger with these
      specifications:
      
      - The logger logs messages to the console.
      - The logger logs messages at the ``DebugLevel`` level.
      - The logger formats messages using the ``JSONFormatter``
        formatter.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-make-logrus
         :end-before: end-make-logrus

   .. step:: Set the logger as the ``Sink`` for your ``Client``.

      In the following code example, the logger is configured to log
      commands at the ``LevelDebug`` level.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-set-thirdparty-logger
         :end-before: end-set-thirdparty-logger

   .. step:: Perform operations.

      The following code performs some CRUD operations, which generate log
      messages:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: false

         .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.go
            :language: go
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-log-operations
            :end-before: end-log-operations

         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false

            {
              "command": "{\"insert\": \"testColl\", ...}",
              "commandName": "insert",
              "databaseName": "db",
              ...
              "level": "debug",
              "message": "Command started",
              "msg": "Command started",
              ...
              "time": "2023-07-06 10:23:42"
            }
            {
              "commandName": "insert",
              ...
              "level": "debug",
              "message": "Command succeeded",
              "msg": "Command succeeded",
              ...
              "time": "2023-07-06 10:23:42"
            }
            {
              "command": "{\"delete\": \"testColl\", ...}",
              "commandName": "delete",
              "databaseName": "db",
              ...
              "level": "debug",
              "message": "Command started",
              "msg": "Command started",
              ...
              "time": "2023-07-06 10:23:42"
            }
            {
              "commandName": "delete",
              ...
              "level": "debug",
              "message": "Command succeeded",
              "msg": "Command succeeded",
              ...
              "time": "2023-07-06 10:23:42"
            }
