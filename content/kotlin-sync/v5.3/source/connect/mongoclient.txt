Overview
--------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment, you need two things:

- A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, which tells the {+driver-short+}
  which MongoDB deployment to connect to.
- A **MongoClient** object, which creates the connection to and performs 
  operations on the MongoDB deployment.

You can also use ``MongoClientSettings`` to customize the way the {+driver-short+} behaves
while connected to MongoDB.

This guide shows you how to create a connection string and use a ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to MongoDB.

.. _kotlin-sync-connection-uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A standard connection string includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client
       authenticates the user against the database specified in ``authSource``.
       For more information about the ``authSource`` connection option, 
       see :ref:`kotlin-sync-auth`. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't
       include the port number, the driver uses the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this component, the client authenticates the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`kotlin-sync-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

For more information about creating a connection string, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string>` in the
MongoDB Server documentation.

Atlas Connection Example
------------------------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, you must first create a client. 

You can pass a connection URI as a string to the ``MongoClient.create()`` method 
to connect to a MongoDB instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/mongoclient2.kt
   :start-after: start-connect-to-atlas-w-uri
   :end-before: end-connect-to-atlas-w-uri
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

You can also create a client with your desired configurations by passing a 
``MongoClientSettings`` object to the ``MongoClient.create()`` method.

To instantiate a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, use the builder method to 
specify your connection string, using the ``applyConnectionString()`` method, 
and any other client options. Once you have your desired configuration, 
call the ``build()`` method.

You can set the Stable API version client option to avoid breaking changes when 
you upgrade to a new server version. To learn more about the Stable API feature, 
see the :ref:`Stable API page <kotlin-sync-stable-api>`. 

The following code shows how you can specify the connection string and the 
Stable API client option when connecting to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas 
and verify that the connection is successful:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/mongoclient.kt
   :start-after: start-connect-to-atlas
   :end-before: end-connect-to-atlas
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

API Documentation

{+driver-short+}, see the following API documentation:
