MongoDB CRUD Introduction

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides methods to create, read, update, and delete records.
These read and write operations are similar to the operations in
relational databases. For distributed MongoDB deployments, MongoDB also
provides ways to define the behavior of read and write operations in
distributed deployments.

To interact with MongoDB, applications use a :term:`driver`. These
drivers provide an idiomatic interface to MongoDB for a particular
programming language or environment. In addition to the drivers, the
:program:`mongo` shell, which is part of the MongoDB distribution,
provides a complete interface. The examples in the MongoDB Manual use
the :program:`mongo` shell.

Data Structure
--------------

MongoDB stores data in the form of *documents*, which are JSON-like
field and value pairs. Documents are analogous to structures in
programming languages that associate keys with values, where keys may
nest other pairs of keys and values (e.g. dictionaries, hashes, maps,
and associative arrays). Formally, MongoDB documents are :term:`BSON`
documents, which is a binary representation of :term:`JSON` with
additional type information. For more information, see
:doc:`/core/document`.

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-document.rst

MongoDB stores all documents in :term:`collections <collection>`. A
collection is a group of related documents that have a set of shared
common indexes. Collections are analogous to a table in relational
databases.

Database Operations
-------------------

Query
~~~~~

In MongoDB a query targets a specific collection of documents. Queries
specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents that
MongoDB returns to the clients. A query may include a *projection* that
specifies the fields from the matching documents to return. You can
optionally modify queries to impose limits, skips, and sort orders.

In the following diagram, the query process specifies a query criteria
and a sort modifier:

Data Modification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data modification refers to operations that create, update, or delete
data. In MongoDB, these operations modify the data of a single
:term:`collection`. For the update and delete operations, you can
specify the criteria to select the documents to update or remove.

In the following diagram, the insert operation adds a new document to
the ``users`` collection.

Related Features
----------------

:doc:`/indexes`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enhance the performance of common queries and updates, MongoDB
has full support for secondary indexes. These indexes allow
applications to store a *view* of a portion of the collection in an
efficient data structure. Most indexes store an ordered
representation of all values of a field or a group of
fields. Indexes may also :ref:`enforce uniqueness
<index-type-unique>`, store objects in a :doc:`geospatial
representation </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, and facilitate
:doc:`text search </core/text-search>`.

:doc:`/core/read-preference`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For replica sets and sharded clusters with replica set components,
applications specify :ref:`read preferences
<replica-set-read-preference>`. A read preference determines how
the client direct read operations to the set.

:doc:`/core/write-concern`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications can also control the behavior of write operations using
:ref:`write concern <write-concern>`. Particularly useful for
deployments with replica sets, the write concern semantics allow
clients to specify the assurance that MongoDB provides when reporting
on the success of a write operation.

:doc:`/aggregation`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the basic queries, MongoDB provides several data
aggregation features. For example, MongoDB can return counts of the
number of documents that match a query, or return the number of
distinct values for a field, or process a collection of documents using
a versatile stage-based data processing pipeline or map-reduce
operations.
