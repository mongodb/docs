Considerations
--------------

Use Command Interpreter, not Powershell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every time this tutorial refers to the command line, you should use 
the `Windows command interpreter <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) 
with Administrative privileges. Not all commands work in Powershell.

To start ``cmd.exe`` with Administrative privileges: 

1. `Open the Start menu <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028294/windows-open-the-start-menu>`__.

   - Press the :iconb:`windows` key.

   - Click on the :guilabel:`Start` :iconb:`windows` icon at the left
     end of the taskbar. 

#. Type ``cmd.exe`` in the search box.
#. Press **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Enter**.

   This starts the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` as the 
   **Administrator** user.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries. 

Remember the directory where you installed MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the default |mdb-edition| location of
``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\``.

If you have installed in an alternative directory, you must
adjust the paths as appropriate.

Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installation process installs both the MongoDB binaries as well as the
default :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
:file:`<install directory>/bin/mongod.cfg`.


Install |mdb-edition|
---------------------

You can install using the Windows Installer wizard or from the command
line.

.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on Azure using Atlas, our fully-managed
   database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything from a free
   sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster. `Set up a free
   cluster now

You can also manage the service from the command line. To start the
MongoDB service from the command line, invoke the following command:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-manually-windows-service-for-mongodb.rst

Stop |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, you can use the Services Manager.

You can also manage the service from the command line. To stop the
MongoDB service from the command line, invoke the following command:
  
.. code-block:: bat

   net stop MongoDB

Remove |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
------------------------------------------

To remove the MongoDB service, first stop the service and then
run the following command:
