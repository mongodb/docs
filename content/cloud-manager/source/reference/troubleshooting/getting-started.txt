   :description: Troubleshoot common issues in Cloud Manager by checking authentication, agent logs, and connectivity between agents and monitored hosts.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To begin troubleshooting, complete these tasks to check for common, 
easily fixed problems:

.. _troubleshooting-auth-creds:

Authentication Errors
---------------------

If your MongoDB instances run with authentication enabled, ensure |mms|
has the MongoDB credentials. To learn more, see
:doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`.

.. _troubleshooting-check-logs:

Check Agent Output or Log
-------------------------

If you continue to encounter problems, check the agent's output for 
errors. To learn more, see
:ref:`Agent Logs <agent-logs>` for more information.

.. _troubleshooting-host-connectivity:

Ensure Connectivity Between Agent and Monitored Hosts
-----------------------------------------------------

Ensure the system running the agent can resolve and connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes. If you install multiple {+magent+}s, ensure that **each** {+magent+} can reach every
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process in the deployment.

To confirm, log into the system where the agent is running and issue a
command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongosh <hostname>:<port>

Replace ``<hostname>`` with the hostname and ``<port>`` with the
port that the database is listening on.

.. include:: /includes/fact-port-forwarding-unsupported.rst

.. _troubleshooting-mms-connectivity:

Ensure Connectivity Between Agent and |mms| Server
--------------------------------------------------

Verify that the {+magent+} can connect on TCP port 443
(outbound) to the |mms| server (i.e. ``api-agents.mongodb.com``.)

.. _troubleshooting-discover-hosts:

Allow Agent to Discover Hosts and Collect Initial Data
------------------------------------------------------

Allow the agent to run for 5 to 10 minutes to allow host discovery and
initial data collection.
