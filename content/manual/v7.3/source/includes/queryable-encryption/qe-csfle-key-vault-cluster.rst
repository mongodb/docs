By default, MongoDB stores the {+key-vault-long+} on the connected
cluster. MongoDB also supports hosting the {+key-vault-long+}
on a different MongoDB deployment than the connected cluster.
Applications must have access to both the cluster that hosts your
{+key-vault-long+} and the connection cluster to perform {+qe+} operations.
