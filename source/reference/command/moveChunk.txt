.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal command that supports the
   sharding functionality. Use the
   :method:`sh.moveChunk()` function in the :program:`mongo` shell if
   you must move a chunk manually.

   :option _secondaryThrottle: The default setting is ``false``. If
                               ``true`` this will specify that
                               :term:`primary` :term:`shard` members
                               should wait for its :term:`secondary`
                               shard members to replicate :term:`chunk` data
                               updates before allowing new chunk
                               migrations to occur.
