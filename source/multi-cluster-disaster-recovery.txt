The |k8s-op-short| can orchestrate the recovery of MongoDB replica set
members to a healthy |k8s| cluster when the |k8s-op-short| identifies
that the original |k8s| cluster is down.

.. _disaster-recovery-modes:

Disaster Recovery Modes
-----------------------

The |k8s-op-short| can orchestrate either an automatic or manual remediation
of the ``MongoDBMulti`` resources in a disaster recovery scenario, using
one of the following modes:

- **Auto Failover Mode** allows the |k8s-op-short| to shift the affected
  MongoDB replica set members from an unhealthy |k8s| cluster to healthy
  |k8s| clusters. When the |k8s-op-short| performs this auto remediation,
  it evenly distributes replica set members across the healthy |k8s| clusters.
  
  To enable this mode, use ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=true`` in
  the MongoDB Helm Charts for |k8s|. In the ``values.yaml`` file in the
  :mdb-github:`MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes </helm-charts>` directory,
  the environment's variable default value is ``true``.

  Alternatively, you can set the |multi-cluster| environment variable
  ``PERFORM_FAILOVER`` to ``true``, as in the following abbreviated example:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     spec:
       template:
         ...
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: mongodb-enterprise-operator
             ...
             env:
             ...   
             - name: PERFORM_FAILOVER
               value: "true"
             ...
  

- **Manual(CLI-based) Failover Mode** allows you to use the
  :ref:`multi-cluster CLI <multi-cluster-cli-reference-ref>` to
  reconfigure the |k8s-op-short| to use new healthy |k8s| clusters.
  In this mode, you distribute replica set members across the new healthy
  clusters by configuring the ``MongoDBMulti`` custom resource based on
  your configuration.

  To enable this mode, use ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=true``
  in the :mdb-github:`MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes </helm-charts>`,
  or set the |multi-cluster| environment variable ``PERFORM_FAILOVER``
  to ``false``, as in the following abbreviated example:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     spec:
       template:
         ...
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: mongodb-enterprise-operator
             ...
             env:
             ...   
             - name: PERFORM_FAILOVER
               value: "false"
             ...

.. note::
   
   You can't rely on the :ref:`auto or manual failover modes <disaster-recovery-modes>`
   when a |k8s| cluster hosting one or more |k8s-op-short| instances goes
   down, or the replica set member resides on the same failed |k8s|
   cluster as the |k8s| that manages it.

   In such cases, to restore replica set members from lost |k8s| clusters
   to the remaining healthy |k8s| clusters, you must first restore the
   |k8s-op-short| instance that manages your |multi-clusters|, or
   redeploy the |k8s-op-short| to one of the remaining |k8s| clusters,
   and rerun the |mc-cli|.
   To learn more, see :ref:`disaster-recovery-manual`.

.. _disaster-recovery-manual:

Manually Recover from a Failure Using the Multi-Cluster CLI
-----------------------------------------------------------

When a |k8s| cluster hosting one or more |k8s-op-short| instances goes down,
or the replica set member resides on the same failed |k8s| cluster as the
|k8s| that manages it, you can't rely on the
:ref:`auto or manual failover modes <disaster-recovery-modes>`
and must use the following procedure to manually recover from a failed
|k8s| cluster.

The following procedure uses the :ref:`multi-cluster CLI <multi-cluster-cli-reference-ref>`
to:

- Configure new healthy |k8s| clusters.
- Re-balance nodes hosting ``MongoDBMulti`` resources on the nodes in
  the healthy |k8s| clusters.

Before you start the following procedure, ensure that you:

- Deployed one central cluster and three member clusters, following the
  :ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-procedure`. In this case, the
  |k8s-op-short| is installed with the automated failover disabled with
  ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=false``.

- Deployed a ``MongoDBMulti`` resource as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl apply -n mongodb -f - <<EOF
     apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
     kind: MongoDBMulti
     metadata:
      name: multi-replica-set
     spec:
      version: 5.0.5-ent
      type: ReplicaSet
      persistent: false
      duplicateServiceObjects: true
      credentials: my-credentials
      opsManager:
        configMapRef:
          name: my-project
      security:
        tls:
          ca: custom-ca
      clusterSpecList:
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}
          members: 3
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}
          members: 2
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_3_FULL_NAME}
          members: 3
     EOF


The |k8s-op-short| periodically checks for connectivity to the clusters
in the |multi-cluster| by pinging the ``/healthz`` endpoints of the
corresponding servers. To learn more about ``/healthz``, see |k8s-healthchecks|.

In the case that ``CLUSTER_3`` in our example becomes unavailable, the
|k8s-op-short| detects the failed connections to the cluster and marks
the ``MongoDBMulti`` resources with the ``failedClusters`` annotation for
subsequent reconciliations.

The resources with data nodes deployed on this cluster fail reconciliation
until you run the manual recovery steps as in the following procedure.

To re-balance the MongoDB data nodes so that all the workloads run on
``CLUSTER_1`` and ``CLUSTER_2``:

1. Recover the |multi-cluster| using the :ref:`multi-cluster-CLI <multi-cluster-cli-reference-ref>` as follows:

   .. code-block:: sh

      go run main.go recover \
      -central-cluster="MDB_CENTRAL_CLUSTER_FULL_NAME" \
      -member-clusters="${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME},${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}" \
      -member-cluster-namespace="mongodb" \
      -central-cluster-namespace="mongodb" \
      -operator-name=mongodb-enterprise-operator-multi-cluster \
      -source-cluster="${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}"

   This command:
   
   - Reconfigures the |k8s-op-short| to manage workloads on
     the two healthy clusters. (This list could also include new clusters).
   
   - Marks ``CLUSTER_1`` as the source of configuration for the member node
     configuration for new healthy |k8s| clusters. This means that Roles
     and Service Account configuration is replicated to match the configuration
     in ``CLUSTER_1``.

2. Re-configure the `MongoDBMulti` resource to re-balance the data nodes
   on the healthy |k8s| clusters by editing the MongoDB resources affected by
   the change:

   .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply -n mongodb -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
      kind: MongoDBMulti
      metadata:
       name: multi-replica-set
      spec:
       version: 5.0.5-ent
       type: ReplicaSet
       persistent: false
       duplicateServiceObjects: true
       credentials: my-credentials
       opsManager:
         configMapRef:
          name: my-project
       security:
         tls:
          ca: custom-ca
       clusterSpecList:
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}
           members: 4
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}
           members: 3
       EOF
