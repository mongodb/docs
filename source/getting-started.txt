Configure Billing
-----------------

Blah blah blah .. Enter billing information. ... 

.. note:: Question: The wireframes made it look like I could enter in
   payment info as I create clusters. Like in amazon, can I enter in
   multiple billing info and choose which to use?

For details on billing and cost, see :doc:`/billing`.

Create a Cluster
----------------

Follow the instructions on the UI screens to create your cluster
(either a replica set or a sharded cluster). For more information on
creating a cluster, see :doc:`/create-new-cluster` in the the
:doc:`/use-service` section of this manaul.
