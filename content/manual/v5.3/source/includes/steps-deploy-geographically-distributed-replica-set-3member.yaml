title: Optional. Configure the member eligibility for becoming primary.

  In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
  elected primary before the members in the other data centers. You can
  modify the :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of the members such that the
  members in the one data center has higher
  :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` than the members in the other data
  centers.

  Some members of the replica set, such as members that have networking
  restraint or limited resources, should not be able to become primary
  in a :term:`failover`. Configure members that should not become
  primary to have :ref:`priority 0
  <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.
 
  For example, to lower the relative eligibility of the member
  located in one of the sites (in this example,
  ``mongodb2.example.net``), set the member's priority to ``0.5``.

  After these commands return, you have a geographically redundant
  three-member replica set.
