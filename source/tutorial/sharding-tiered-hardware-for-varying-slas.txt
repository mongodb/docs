MongoDB Tag Aware Sharding allows administrators to define ranges of the
:term:`shard key` and tag them to one or more shards. Using this feature, data
can be routed to one or more shards based on the tag. This gives administrators
control over data distribution in a sharded cluster.

This tutorial uses :ref:`tag-aware-sharding` to route documents based on
creation date either to shards tagged for supporting recent documents, or
those tagged for supporting archived documents.

The following are some example use cases for segmenting data based on Service
Level Agreement (SLA) or Service Level Objective (SLO):

* An application requires providing low-latency access to recently inserted /
  updated documents

* An application requires prioritizing low-latency access to a range
  or subset of documents

* An application that benefits from ensuring specific ranges or subsets of data
  are stored on servers with hardware that suits the SLA's for accessing
  that data

The following diagram illustrates a sharded cluster that uses hardware based
shard tags to satisfy data access SLAs or SLOs.

Scenario
--------

A photo sharing application requires fast access to photos uploaded within the
last 6 months. The application stores the location of each photo along with
its metadata in the ``photoshare`` database under the ``data`` collection.

The following documents represent photos uploaded by a single user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : 10003010,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2012-12-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_1.jpg"
   }
   {
     "_id" : 10003011,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2013-12-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_2.jpg"
   }
   {
     "_id" : 10003012,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2016-01-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_3.jpg"
   }

Note that only the document with ``_id : 10003012`` was uploaded within
the past year (as of June 2016).

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The photo collection uses the ``{ creation_date : 1 }`` index as the shard key.

The ``creation_date`` field in each document allows for creating a tag range
on the creation date.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharded cluster deployment currently consists of three :term:`shards
<shard>`.

.. include:: /images/sharding-tiered-slas-architecture.rst


Tags
~~~~

The application requires tagging each shard in the cluster based on its
hardware tier. Each hardware tier represents a specific hardware configuration
designed to satisfy a given SLA or SLO.

.. include:: /images/sharding-tiered-slas-tags.rst

Fast Tier ("recent")
   These are the fastest performing machines, with large
   amounts of RAM, fast SSD disks, and powerful CPUs.

   The tag requires a range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ creation_date : ISODate(YYYY-mm-dd)}``,
     where the Year, Month, and Date specified by ``YYYY-mm-dd`` is within the
     last 6 months.

   * an upper bound of ``{ creation_date : MaxKey }``.

Archival Tier ("archive")
   These machines use less RAM, slower disks, and more basic CPUs. However,
   they have a greater amount of storage per server.

   The tag requires a range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ creation_date : MinKey }``.

   * an upper bound of ``{ creation_date : ISODate(YYYY-mm-dd)}``,
     where the Year, Month, and Date match the values used for the ``recent``
     tier's lower bound.

.. note::

   The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
   values for comparisons.

As performance needs increase, adding additional shards and tagging them
based on their hardware tier allows for the cluster to scale horizontally.

When defining tag ranges based on time spans, weigh the benefits of
infrequent updates to the tag ranges against the amount of data that
must be migrated on an update. For example, setting a limit of 1 year for
data to be considered 'recent' likely covers more data than setting a limit
of 1 month. While there are more migrations required when rotating on a
1 month scale, the amount of documents that must be migrated is lower than
rotating on a 1 year scale.

Write Operations
----------------

With tag-aware sharding, if an inserted or updated document matches a
configured tag range, it can only be written to a shard with the related tag.

MongoDB can write documents that do not match a configured tag range to any
shard in the cluster.

.. note:: 

   The behavior described above requires the cluster to be in a steady state
   with no chunks violating a configured tag range. See the following section
   on the :ref:`balancer <sharding-tiered-hardware-balancing>` for more
   information.

Read Operations
---------------

MongoDB can route queries to a specific shard if the query includes the 
shard key. 

For example, MongoDB can attempt a :ref:`targeted read operation
<sharding-mongos-targeted>` on the following query because it includes
``creation_date`` in the query document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   photoDB = db.getSiblingDB("photoshare")
   photoDB.data.find( { "creation_date" : ISODate("2015-01-01") } )
   
If the requested document falls within the tag range assigned to the
``recent`` storage tier, MongoDB would route this query to the tagged shards,
ensuring a faster read compared to a cluster-wide :ref:`broadcast read
operation <sharding-mongos-broadcast>`

.. _sharding-tiered-hardware-balancing:

Balancer
--------

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` the tagged chunks to the appropriate shard. Until
the migration completes, shards may contain chunks that violate configured tag
ranges and tags. Once balancing completes, shards should only contain chunks
whose ranges do not violate its assigned tags and tag ranges.

Adding or removing tags can result in chunk migrations. Depending on the size
of your data set and the chunks a tag affects, these migrations may impact
cluster performance. Run your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` in specific
scheduled windows. See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial
on how to set a scheduling window.

Security
--------

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authorization`, authenticate as a user
with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager` role on the ``admin`` database.

Procedure
---------

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to create tags and tag ranges.
You cannot create tags by connecting directly to a :term:`shard`.

Updating Tag Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the shard ranges, perform the following operations as a part of
a cron job or other scheduled procedure:
