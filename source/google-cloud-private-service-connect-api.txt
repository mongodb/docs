You can create and manage private endpoints for |gcp| using
:gcp:`{+google-psc+} </vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`. |service|
currently supports the use of {+google-psc+} via the |service|
API. Full UI support for |gcp| {+google-psc+} is coming soon.

Connecting to |service| clusters with private endpoints helps to ensure your
perceived network trust boundary is not extended. These one-way connections
prevent |service| |vpc|\s from initiating connections back to
your |gcp| |vpc|\s.

Overview
--------

|service| uses internal load balancers and :gcp:`service
attachments </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>` to
connect your clusters to your |vpc|. {+google-psc+} uses one load balancer per
node. To ensure the availability of resources for both current and future clusters,
|service| creates all the service attachments and internal load balancers for a
region when you activate {+google-psc+} for that region.

Connection Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. :oas-atlas-op:`Create the endpoint service for a region
   </createOnePrivateEndpointServiceForOneProvider>` in |service| to enable the
   feature. After you enable {+google-psc+}, |service| does the following actions:

   .. include:: /includes/gcp-psc-connection-workflow.rst
   
#. :oas-atlas-op:`Get the endpoint service for the region
   </createOnePrivateEndpointServiceForOneProvider>` in |service| to retrieve
   the service attachment names. 

   .. note::
   
     You can't retrieve the service attachment names or complete the next steps
     until |service| finishes creating the endpoint service. Wait for the
     ``Status`` value to become ``AVAILABLE`` when you :oas-atlas-op:`get the endpoint service for the region
     </createOnePrivateEndpointServiceForOneProvider>` before proceeding.

#. Follow |gcp|'s steps for :gcp:`configuring {+google-psc+} to access
   services </vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services>`, including
   the following steps: 

   - Create private endpoints. Each private endpoint reserves an IP address
     within your |gcp| |vpc| and forwards traffic from the endpoints' IP
     addresses to the service attachments. You must create an equal number of
     private endpoints to the number of service attachments. The default number
     of service attachments is 50.

#. :oas-atlas-op:`Create a private endpoint group 
   </createOnePrivateEndpointForOneProvider>` in |service|, which
   represents the collection of 50 forwarding rules. You must specify the
   following items: 
  
   - Static IP addresses you reserved.
   - Names of the forwarding rules you created.

   When creating private endpoint groups, you can: 
   
   - Create multiple endpoint groups in a region. This allows you to create
     multiple connection strings for a cluster.
   - Create one endpoint group per region for a single multi-region cluster.

   .. note::

      You can't use multiple endpoint groups per region and multi-region
      clusters with {+google-psc+} at the same time.

#. |service| uses the forwarding rules to provide a secure one-way connection
   from your |gcp| |vpc| to the network load balancers in the |service| |vpc|.
   You can find the connection string in the response body when you 
   :oas-atlas-op:`get one cluster </returnOneCluster>` or 
   :oas-atlas-op:`get all clusters </listClusters>` from the 
   region.

Considerations
--------------

The following considerations apply to |gcp| private endpoints:

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- |gcp| {+google-psc+} supports up to 1024 outgoing connections per
  virtual machine. As a result, you can't have more than 1024 connections from a
  single |gcp| virtual machine to an |service| cluster. To learn more, see the
  |gcp| :gcp:`cloud NAT documentation </nat/docs/ports-and-addresses>`.
- |gcp| {+google-psc+} is region-specific. You cannot use |vpc| peering to
  access private endpoints from a different region. 
  
  When using {+google-psc+} to connect to multi-region {+clusters+}, you can
  connect only to {+cluster+} nodes that are in the same region as the private
  endpoint. If the endpoint and the primary node are in different regions, you must:
  
  1. Set your application's :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`
     to allow connections from a secondary node. For example, you can set your
     application's read preference to :manual:`secondaryPreferred </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondaryPreferred>`.

  2. Ensure at least one secondary node is in the same region as the endpoint. 

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You don't need to take additional actions to ensure that |gcp| private endpoint
connections to |service| can withstand an availability zone outage.

IP Access Lists and Network Peering Connections with Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable private endpoints, you can still enable access to your
|service| clusters using other methods, such as adding public IPs to
:doc:`IP access lists </security/ip-access-list>` and
:doc:`network peering </security-vpc-peering>`.

Procedures
----------

To enable connections through {+google-psc+}, complete the 
prerequisites and :oas-atlas-op:`create the endpoint group
</createOnePrivateEndpointForOneProvider>` using the
{+atlas-admin-api+}.
