Overview
--------
 
|service| users manage |service| groups. Creating a new user in a group
grants access to that group. Users can belong to any number of |service|
groups.

Roles
-----

When you create a user, you assign the user a role in the group. A role 
determines the actions the user can perform and the data the user can 
access. 

The roles available in |service| are :guilabel:`Owner` and 
:guilabel:`Read Only`. The :ref:`Add/Invite User <atlas_add_users>` 
page provides details on the roles available and their access levels.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB users. MongoDB users can
   access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access the
   |service| application itself.

to this |service| group. |service| provides the following information 
for each user:
  - Username
  - Role 
  - Date created 
  - Last login
  - Timezone
  - Available actions (Edit and Delete)

|service| lists all invitations to join your group and any requests to 
join your group. A user can request to join a group when first 
registering for |service|.

View Invitations
----------------

When you invite a user to join a group, |service| sends an email to the
prospective user. To view invitations any unaccepted invitations, click 
:guilabel:`Users`. 

The page lists any users with pending invitations after the group's 
members. The invitee's role appears as :guilabel:`--invite sent--`. To 
cancel an invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove Users
------------

.. important::

   You cannot delete the last user in a group. You must instead 
   **close the group**. To close your group:
   
   1. Click :guilabel:`Settings`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Close Group` at the bottom of the page.
    
   You cannot delete the last user with an :guilabel:`Owner` role from a
   group. You must first assign the role to at least one other user 
   before deleting the original user.
