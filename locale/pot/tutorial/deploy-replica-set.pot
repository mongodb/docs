These sets also have sufficient capacity for many distributed read operations. Replica sets should always have an odd number of members. This ensures that :doc:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>` will proceed smoothly. For more about designing replica sets, see :doc:`the Replication overview </core/replication-introduction>`."
