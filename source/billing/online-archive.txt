You incur {+adf+} costs for the following items: 

- Amount of data stored and accessed for {+Online-Archive+}.
- Amount of archived data processed, transferred, and returned when you
  query your {+Online-Archive+}. Note that |service| charges $5.00 per
  TB of processed data, with a 10 MB minimum processed data per query.
  You can optionally configure :ref:`query limits
  <adf-manage-query-limits>` to control data processing charges for your
  {+Online-Archive+}. 

To learn more about the consumption-based pricing for {+Online-Archive+}\s, 
see the `pricing page <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing>`__.

.. important:: 

   Before querying the archived data, we recommend using the 
   :manual:`explain </reference/method/cursor.explain/>` method to 
   optimize your queries. To calculate the monthly spend and approximate
   cost based on usage, consider the typical amount of data processed in 
   the :manual:`explain results </reference/explain-results/>` and
   multiply it by the typical number of queries per month.

   To stay abreast of your {+Online-Archive+} costs, we recommend the
   following: 

   - :ref:`Configure billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to avoid
     unexpected usage and charges. 
   - Monitor the :ref:`cost visualization <billing-visualizations>` and 
     :ref:`invoices <examine-invoices>` on your |service| billing page. 

     The {+fdi+} page for {+Online-Archive+} displays the amount of data
     that your {+fdi+} has processed and returned, and the number of queries run against it. However, it
     doesn't reflect the cost of your {+Online-Archive+}\s, which is 
     available in the |service| :ref:`billing page <atlas-billing>`
     only.
