In the event that the |k8s| cluster on which your |k8s-op-short| is deployed fails, 
you first need to recover the |k8s-op-short|. To do so, deploy and configure the 
|k8s-op-short| on a separate, healthy |k8s| cluster as described in the 
steps below. Then, once you've redeployed the |k8s-op-short| to a healthy |k8s| 
cluster, you can follow :ref:`these recovery steps <recover-mcsc-yes-k8sop-cluster>`. 

If your Ops Manager instance is also deployed to your operator |k8s| cluster, 
follow :ref:`these steps <recover-om-no-k8sop-cluster>` to redeploy to a healthy 
|k8s| cluster.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Redeploy the |k8s-op-short|.
      
      You can follow :ref:`this guide <install-k8s>` to install the 
      |k8s-op-short| on a separate, healthy |k8s| cluster as you did originally. 
        

   .. step:: Configure the |k8s-op-short| and the |k8s| cluster for multi-cluster deployments.

      Use the ``kubectl mongodb multicluster setup`` command to set up credentials, roles 
      and permissions and create mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list config 
      map for the operator. 
      
      See :ref:`Understand Kubernetes Roles and Role Bindings <multi-cluster-rbac-manual>` to learn more.

   .. step:: Restore the |k8s-op-short| deployment state.

      MongoDB resources: apply yaml files from backup or Git repository if 
      following GitOps. 
      
      1. Restore the following config maps and secrets referenced by 
         the MongoDB resource: 
      
         - ``spec.credentials`` (secret)
         - ``spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name``

      2. Restore the deployment state config map named ``<resource-name>-state``. 
      
         This config map is required for the |k8s-op-short| to 
         correctly reconcile your MongoDB database. It is created 
         dynamically at runtime by the |k8s-op-short|. In order to restore it, 
         you must have previously set up a separate process that periodically 
         backs this config map up.
         
         If this config map cannot be restored from backup, please contact 
         MongoDB Support before proceeding with the recovery steps.
         
      3. Recreate TLS certificates, and related TLS secrets. You can either 
         create them manually or with Cert-Manager. Note that if the restored 
         TLS certificates are changed (re-issued) then the replicaset automation 
         might perform the TLS certificate rotation procedure. 

   .. step:: Continue the restoration process with a working |k8s-op-short| deployment.

      After performing the above steps, continue the restoration process
      by following :ref:`the steps in this guide <recover-mcsc-yes-k8sop-cluster>`.
