       **Preferred Region**. The lowest possible priority is **0**,
       which identifies a read-only region.

       You can have any number of priority **0** read only regions.
       Priorities **1** through **7** are exclusive: only one region
       per cluster can be assigned a given priority.

   * - replicationSpec.<region>.readOnlyNodes

       never become the :term:`primary` member, but can facilitate
       local reads.

   * - replicationSpecs
     - array
     - Configuration for each zone in a
       :doc:`Global Cluster </global-clusters>`. Each object in this
       array represents a zone where |service| deploys nodes for your
       Global Cluster.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].id
     - string
     - Unique identifier of the replication object.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].zoneName
     - string
     - Name for the zone.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].numShards
     - number
     - Number of shards to deploy in the specified zone.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig
     - object
     - Physical location of the region. Each **regionsConfig** object
       describes the region's priority in elections and the number and
       type of MongoDB nodes that |service| deploys to the region.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig.analyticsNodes
     - number
     - .. include:: /includes/fact-api-analytics-nodes-description.rst

   * - replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig.<regionName>.electableNodes
     - number
     - Number of electable nodes for |service| to deploy to the region.
       Electable nodes can become the :term:`primary` and can
       facilitate local reads.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig.<regionName>.readOnlyNodes
     - number
     - Number of read-only nodes for |service| to deploy to the region.
       Read-only nodes can never become the :term:`primary`, but can
       facilitate local-reads.

       Specify **0** if you do not want any read-only nodes in the
       region.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig.<regionName>.priority
     - number
     - Election priority of the region. If you have regions with only
       read-only nodes, set this value to **0**.

   * - replicationSpecs[n].zoneName
     - string
     - Name for the zone in a |global-write-cluster|. Do not provide
       this value if **clusterType** is not **GEOSHARDED**.

   * - srvAddress
     - string
     - :manual:`Connection string </reference/connection-string>` for
       connecting to the |service| cluster. The **+srv** modifier
       forces the connection to use |tls|. The **mongoURI** parameter
       lists additional options.

   * - stateName
     - string
     - Current state of the cluster. The possible states are:

       - **IDLE**
       - **CREATING**
       - **UPDATING**
       - **DELETING**
       - **DELETED**
       - **REPAIRING**
