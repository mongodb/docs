$group (aggregation)
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. pipeline:: $group

   Groups documents together for the purpose of calculating aggregate
   values based on a collection of documents. Practically, group often
   supports tasks such as average page views for each page in a
   website on a daily basis.

   The output of :pipeline:`$group` depends on how you define
   groups. Begin by specifying an identifier (i.e. a ``_id`` field)
   for the group you're creating with this pipeline. You can specify a
   single field from the documents in the pipeline, a previously
   computed value, or an aggregate key made up from several incoming
   fields. Aggregate keys may resemble the following document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id : { author: '$author', pageViews: '$pageViews', posted: '$posted' } }

   With the exception of the ``_id`` field, :pipeline:`$group` cannot
   output nested documents.

   .. important:: The output of :pipeline:`$group` is not ordered.

   Every group expression must specify an ``_id`` field.
   You may specify the ``_id`` field as a dotted
   field path reference, a document with multiple fields enclosed in
   braces (i.e. ``{`` and ``}``), or a constant value.

   .. note::

      Use :pipeline:`$project` as needed to rename the grouped field
      after an :pipeline:`$group` operation, if necessary.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $group : {
              _id : "$author",
              docsPerAuthor : { $sum : 1 },
              viewsPerAuthor : { $sum : "$pageViews" }
          }}
      );

   This groups by the ``author`` field and computes two fields, the
   first ``docsPerAuthor`` is a counter field that adds one for
   each document with a given author field using the :group:`$sum`
   function. The ``viewsPerAuthor`` field is the sum of
   all of the ``pageViews`` fields in the documents for each group.

   Each field defined for the :pipeline:`$group` must use one of the group
   aggregation function listed below to generate its composite value:

   - :group:`$addToSet`
   - :group:`$first`
   - :group:`$last`
   - :group:`$max`
   - :group:`$min`
   - :group:`$avg`
   - :group:`$push`
   - :group:`$sum`

   .. warning::

      The aggregation system currently stores :pipeline:`$group` operations in
      memory, which may cause problems when processing a larger number
      of groups.
