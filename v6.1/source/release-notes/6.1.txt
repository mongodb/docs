Regular Expressions
-------------------

The following sections describe changes to regular expressions in
MongoDB 6.1.

PCRE Library Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+pcre+} ({+pcre-abbr+}) is the library used by MongoDB to implement
regular expression pattern matching. Starting in version 6.1, MongoDB
upgrades the {+pcre-abbr+} library to PCRE2. PCRE2 is the current
{+pcre-abbr+} library and is actively maintained and updated.

To learn how to perform regex matches in MongoDB, see the following
pages:

- :query:`$regex` (query operator)
- :expression:`$regexFind` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexFindAll` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexMatch` (aggregation operator)

``*UCP`` Regex Option to Match Non-ASCII Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, you can use the ``*UCP`` option for regex
queries. The ``*UCP`` option matches non-ASCII characters (specifically,
the option can match UTF-8 characters). However, the ``*UCP`` option
results in a slower query than one without the option specified.

For an example that uses the ``*UCP`` option, see
:ref:`regex-example-pcre2-ucp`.

Replication

.. _release-notes-6.1-retry-writes-errors:

Retryable Writes Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/6.1-retry-writes-error-handling.rst

General Changes
---------------

.. _release-notes-6.1-balancing-policy-changes:

Balancing Policy Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, data in sharded clusters is distributed based on data 
size rather than number of chunks. As a result, you should be aware of the
following significant changes in sharded cluster data distribution behavior:

- The balancer distributes ranges of data rather than chunks. The balancing 
  policy looks for evenness of data distribution rather than chunk distribution.

- Chunks are not subject to auto-splitting. Instead, chunks are split only when
  moved across shards. 

- A chunk is now referred to as a range. 

- ``moveRange`` has replaced ``moveChunk``. 

Changes to Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/journal-option-removed.rst

Improved Efficiency for Multiple Document Deletions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/multi-deletes.rst

.. _6.1-rel-notes-reshard:

Resharding
~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, there are new metrics available 
:ref:`resharding <sharding-resharding>`. The output of the following
commands has changed:

- :dbcommand:`currentOp`
- :method:`db.currentOp()`
- :dbcommand:`serverStatus`
- :method:`db.serverStatus()`

For details, see the release notes for :ref:`currentOp
<6.1-rel-notes-currentOp>` and :ref:`serverStatus
<6.1-rel-notes-serverStatus>`.

.. _6.1-rel-notes-currentOp:

``currentOp`` Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, the :dbcommand:`currentOp` command and the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method have expanded output for resharding.

Resharding operations can involve multiple MongoDB instances, and
MongoDB instances can play different roles in the resharding operation.
The particular operation and the role the host instance plays in the 
:ref:`resharding <sharding-resharding>` process determine when each
metric updates. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 20 50

   * - Metric
     - Role Tracked
     - Description

   * - ``opStatus``
     -  
     -  Removed.

   * - ``desc`` 
     - All
     - Describes the action taken. The value is one of:

       - ReshardingDonorService<operationUUID>
       - ReshardingRecipientService<operationUUID>
       - ReshardingCoordinatorService<operationUUID>
        
       For ``$currentOp``, the command UUID is added to each role's
       state document.

   * - ``op``
     - All
     - This metric has a constant value: "command".

   * - ``ns``
     - All
     - The namespace for the resharded index. The value is a string in
       the form: ``<database>.<collection>``.

   * - ``originatingCommand``
     - All
     - A document that lists the command options for the operation.

   * - ``donorState``
     - Donor
     - The current state of the role's state machine.

   * - ``coordinatorState``
     - Coordinator
     - The current state of the role's state machine.

   * - ``recipientState``
     - Recipient
     - The current state of the role's state machine.

   * - approxDocumentsToCopy
     - Recipient
     - The number of documents in the source collection.

   * - documentsCopied
     - Recipient
     - The number of documents already copied.

   * - approxBytesToCopy
     - Recipient
     - The total size, in bytes, of the documents in the source
       collection.

   * - bytesCopied
     - Recipient
     - The number of bytes copied. When resharding completes, this value
       is similar to the value of ``approxBytesToCopy``. 

   * - oplogEntriesFetched
     - Recipient
     - The number of oplog entries written to the oplog buffer
       collection.

   * - oplogEntriesApplied
     - Recipient
     - The number of oplog entries applied from the oplog buffer
       collection.

   * - insertsApplied
     - Recipient
     - The number of inserts applied to the temporary resharding
       collection. Each oplog entry that involves an insert increments
       the counter by 1.

   * - updatesApplied
     - Recipient
     - The number of updates applied to the temporary resharding
       collection. Each oplog entry that involves an update increments
       the counter by 1.

   * - deletesApplied
     - Recipient
     - The number of deletes applied to the temporary resharding
       collection. Each oplog entry that involves a delete increments the
       counter by 1.

   * - totalOperationTimeElapsedSecs
     - All
     - The number of seconds since the operation began.

   * - totalCopyTimeElapsedSecs
     - Recipient
     - The number of seconds spent cloning.

     - The number of seconds spent applying changes.

   * - totalApplyTimeElapsedSecs
     - Coordinator
     - The approximate maximum number of seconds a Recipient could have
       spent applying changes.

   * - totalCriticalSectionTimeElapsedSecs
     - Recipient
     - The number of seconds spent in the critical section.

       seconds remaining. 

   * - allShardsHighestRemainingOperationTimeEstimatedSecs

     - Calculated across all shards, the highest estimate of the number
       of seconds remaining.

     - Recipient
     - The number of writes to the recipient stash collections.

   * - countWritesDuringCriticalSection
     - Donor

$addFields and $set Allow Empty Objects as Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, the aggregation stages :pipeline:`$addFields` and 
:pipeline:`$set` allow you to set paths to empty objects without using the 
:expression:`$literal` expression.


Auditing
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 6.1 adds the following cluster audit events:

- :ref:`getClusterParameter <audit-message-getClusterParameter>`
- :ref:`setClusterParameter <audit-message-setClusterParameter>`
- :ref:`updateCachedClusterServerParameter 
  <audit-message-updateCachedClusterServerParameter>`

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, the :ref:`startup <audit-message-startup>` 
audit event has this structure:

.. include:: /includes/fact-audit-message-setClusterParameter-form.rst 

For additional details, see :ref:`audit-action-details-results`.  

Server Parameters
-----------------

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, MongoDB adds the following new parameters:
