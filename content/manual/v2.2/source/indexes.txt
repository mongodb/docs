Indexes provide high performance read operations for frequently used
queries. Indexes are particularly useful where the total size of the
documents exceeds the amount of available RAM.

For basic concepts and options, see :doc:`/core/indexes`. For procedures
and operational concerns, see :doc:`/administration/indexes`. For
information on how applications might use indexes, see
:doc:`/applications/indexes`.
