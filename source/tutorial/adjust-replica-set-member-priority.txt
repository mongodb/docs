To change the value of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` in the replica set
configuration, use the following sequence of commands in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[1].priority = 2
   cfg.members[2].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

The first operation uses :method:`rs.conf()` to set the local variable
``cfg`` to the contents of the current replica set configuration, which
is a :term:`document`. The next three operations change the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value in the ``cfg``
document for the first three members configured in the :data:`members
<local.system.replset.members>` array. The final operation calls
:method:`rs.reconfig()` with the argument of ``cfg`` to initialize the
new configuration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-rs-conf-array-index.rst

If a member has :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` set
to ``0``, it is ineligible to become :term:`primary` and will not seek
election. :ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>`, and
:ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>` all have
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` set to ``0``.

All members have a :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority`
equal to ``1`` by default.

The value of :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` can be
any floating point (i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``.
Priorities are only used to determine the preference in election. The
priority value is used only in relation to other members. With the
exception of members with a priority of ``0``, the absolute value of
the :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value is
irrelevant.

Replica sets will preferentially elect and maintain the primary status
of the member with the highest
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` setting.

.. warning::

   Replica set reconfiguration can force the current primary to step
   down, leading to an election for primary in the replica
   set. Elections cause the current primary to close all open
   :term:`client` connections.

   Perform routine replica set reconfiguration during scheduled
   maintenance windows.

.. seealso:: The :ref:`Replica Reconfiguration Usage
   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>` example revolves around
   changing the priorities of the :data:`~local.system.replset.members`
   of a replica set.
