   :description: Explore the supported aggregation pipeline stages and operators in Atlas Data Federation, including syntax variations and limitations.

This page describes the MongoDB :manual:`aggregation </aggregation/>` 
pipeline :manual:`stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` 
and :manual:`operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>` that {+adf+} 
supports.

.. _supported-stages:

Supported and Unsupported Aggregation Pipeline Stages 
-----------------------------------------------------

{+adf+} supports all the aggregation pipeline stages except the 
following: 

- :pipeline:`$indexStats`	
- :pipeline:`$listSessions`	
- :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`
- :pipeline:`$planCacheStats`

For the following stages in {+adf+} queries, {+adf+} introduces an 
alternate syntax, includes a caveat, or deviates from :manual:`server 
</reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>`. See the *Description* 
column for details.

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Pipeline Stage 
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$group` 
     - Groups input documents by the specified ``_id`` expression and 
       for each distinct grouping, outputs a document. {+adf+} doesn't 
       support empty string keys for the accumulator fields. 

       For example, the following is **not** supported: 

       .. code-block:: json 
          :copyable: false 
          :emphasize-lines: 4

          {
            "$group" : {
              "_id" : "$representationType",
              "" : {
                "$sum" : NumberInt(1)
              }
            }
          }

   * - :pipeline:`$lookup`
     - Performs a left outer join to a collection in the same database. 
       {+adf+} provides syntax for joining collections from different 
       databases also. See :ref:`adf-lookup-stage` for more information.

   * - :pipeline:`$match` 
     - Filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the 
       specified conditions to the next pipeline stage. {+adf+} 
       supports :pipeline:`$match`. Note that the :ref:`partition 
       attributes <adf-path-attribute-types>` for selecting 
       specific files on |s3| are only optimized for the following 
       :manual:`aggregation pipeline operators 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/>`: :manual:`$eq 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/eq/>`, :manual:`$gt 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/gt/>`, :manual:`$lt 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/lt/>`, :manual:`$gte 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/gte/>`, :manual:`$lte 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/lte/>`, :manual:`$ne 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/ne/>`, :manual:`$and 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/and/>`, :manual:`$or 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/or/>`, :manual:`$in 
       </reference/operator/aggregation/in/>`.

   * - :pipeline:`$merge` 
     - Writes the results of the :manual:`aggregation pipeline 
       </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to a specified collection. 
       {+adf+} provides alternate syntax for the required ``into`` 
       field to allow writes to an |service| cluster. To learn more, 
       see :ref:`adf-merge-stage`.

   * - :pipeline:`$out`
     - Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and 
       writes them to a specified collection. {+adf+} provides 
       alternate syntax for writing to |s3| and |service| cluster. 

       .. include:: /includes/data-federation/fact-out-stage-limitation.rst
       
       See :ref:`adf-out-stage` for more information.

   * - :pipeline:`$sample` 
     - Randomly selects the specified number of documents from its 
       input. {+adf+} supports ``$sample``, but does not provide a 
       truly random sample and returns the first set of documents that 
       it finds. 

   * - :pipeline:`$skip` 
     - Skips over the specified number of documents that pass into the 
       stage and passes the remaining documents to the next stage in 
       the pipeline. {+adf+} supports ``$skip``, but this does not 
       reduce data scan because {+df+} accesses all partitions that 
       correspond to your query. 

.. _supported-operators:

Supported Aggregation Pipeline Operators
----------------------------------------

{+adf+} supports all the aggregation pipeline operators.
However, some operators are only available in queries on collections that are mapped to an |service| cluster data store.
The :manual:`geospatial query operators </reference/operator/query-geospatial/>` are only available in such queries.
The following :manual:`evaluation query operators </reference/operator/query-evaluation/>` are also restriced to
queries on collections mapped to an |service| cluster data store:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Pipeline Stage 
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear` 
     - Outputs documents in order of nearest to farthest from a 
       specified point. {+adf+} supports :pipeline:`$geoNear` in 
       queries on virtual collections that are mapped to one or more 
       |service| collections. {+adf+} doesn't support 
       :pipeline:`$geoNear` for |s3| or |http| {+fdi+} stores.
       
       See :ref:`query-atlas` for more information. 

   * - :pipeline:`$graphLookup` 
     - Performs a recursive search on a collection. {+adf+} supports 
       :pipeline:`$graphLookup` in queries on virtual collections 
       that are mapped to one |service| collection only. {+adf+} 
       doesn't support :pipeline:`$graphLookup` for:

       - |s3| or |http| stores.
       - Queries on virtual collections that are mapped to multiple 
         |service| collections.
       
       See :ref:`query-atlas` for more information. 

   * - :pipeline:`$search`
     - Performs a full-text search on the content of the fields covered
       by an |fts| index.

   * - :manual:`$text </reference/operator/query/text/>`
     - Performs a text search on the content of the fields indexed with 
       a text index.

   * - :manual:`$where </reference/operator/query/where/>`
     - Passes either a string containing a JavaScript expression or a 
       full JavaScript function to the query system. 

.. note:: 

   {+adf+} doesn't include a server-side JavaScript engine. So, {+adf+} 
   doesn't support operators such as :manual:`$where 
   </reference/operator/query/where/>`, :manual:`$function 
   </reference/operator/aggregation/function/>`, and 
   :manual:`$accumulator 
   </reference/operator/aggregation/accumulator/>` that require 
   server-side scripting :manual:`enabled 
   </reference/operator/query/where/#javascript-enablement>`.
