Build Old Style Indexes
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. important::

   Use this procedure *only* if you **must** have indexes that are compatible
   with a version of MongoDB earlier than 2.0.

MongoDB version 2.0 introduced the ``{v:1}`` index format. MongoDB
versions 2.0 and later support both the ``{v:1}`` format and the
earlier ``{v:0}`` format.

MongoDB versions prior to 2.0, however, support only the ``{v:0}``
format. If you need to roll back MongoDB to a version prior to 2.0,
you must *drop* and *re-create* your indexes.

To build pre-2.0 indexes, use the :method:`dropIndexes()
<db.collection.dropIndexes()>` and :method:`createIndex()
<db.collection.createIndex()>` methods. You *cannot* simply reindex
the collection. When you reindex on versions that only support
``{v:0}`` indexes, the ``v`` fields in the index definition still hold
values of ``1``, even though the indexes would now use the ``{v:0}``
format. If you were to upgrade again to version 2.0 or later, these
indexes would not work.

.. For reference only, the source material:

   Versions >= 1.8.3 are aware of the index version field, but version
   <= 1.8.2 are not. So if you rollback a [v:1} index to 1.8.2 and
   re-index it its version will still be marked {v: 1} although it
   actual version is {v: 0}. Then if you upgrade again to 2.0 this
   index won't work even though they are marked as {v: 1} in
   db.system.indexes. So if you have to rollback to a version <=
   1.8.2, you must delete the index then create it again (instead of
   simply re-indexing).

.. example::

   Suppose you rolled back from MongoDB 2.0 to MongoDB 1.8, and suppose
   you had the following index on the ``items`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "v" : 1, "key" : { "name" : 1 }, "ns" : "mydb.items", "name" : "name_1" }

   The ``v`` field tells you the index is a ``{v:1}`` index, which
   is incompatible with version 1.8.

   To drop the index, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.items.dropIndex( { name : 1 } )

   To recreate the index as a ``{v:0}`` index, issue the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.createIndex( { name : 1 } , { v : 0 } )
