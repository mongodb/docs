   :description: Understand the limitations of using AWS S3 with Atlas Data Federation, including supported storage classes and account restrictions.

{+adf+} supports the following Amazon |s3| storage classes only: 

- `Standard 
  <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/?nc=sn&loc=3#General_purpose>`__

- `Intelligent Tiering 
  <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Unknown_or_changing_access>`__

- `Standard-Infrequent Access 
  <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Infrequent_access>`__

{+df+} supports files in the `Standard 
<https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#General_purpose>`__ storage
class by default. To enable support for files in the 
`Intelligent Tiering 
<https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Unknown_or_changing_access>`__ and `Standard-Infrequent Access 
<https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Infrequent_access>`__
storage classes, see 
:datalakeconf-aws:`stores.[n].additionalStorageClasses`.

{+df+} does not support creating a {+fdi+} with |s3| buckets from more 
than one |aws| account.
