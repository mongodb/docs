The examples on this page use data from the :ref:`sample_mflix sample dataset
<sample-mflix>`. For details on how to load this dataset into your self-managed
MongoDB deployment, see :ref:`Load the sample dataset <sample-dataset-local>`.
If you made any modifications to the sample databases, you may need to drop and
recreate the databases to run the examples on this page.
