Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for official MongoDB TypeScript support.
Since TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, you can use the
`{+node-driver-long+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/>`__
to create TypeScript applications that communicate with MongoDB.

You must use version 4.0 or later of the {+node-driver-short+} to use
TypeScript types with MongoDB.

To learn more about the features and limitations of using TypeScript with the
{+node-driver-short+}, see
`TypeScript Fundamentals <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/typescript/>`__
in the {+node-driver-short+} documentation.
