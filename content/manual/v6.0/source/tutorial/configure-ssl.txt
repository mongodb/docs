Overview
--------

This document helps you to configure a new MongoDB instance to support
TLS/SSL. For instructions on upgrading a cluster currently not using
TLS/SSL to using TLS/SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl`
instead.

.. include:: /includes/fact-tls-libraries.rst

.. note::

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-tls-1.0.rst

   - MongoDB's TLS/SSL encryption only allows the use of strong TLS/SSL
     ciphers with a minimum of 128-bit key length for all connections.

   - The *Linux 64-bit legacy x64* builds of MongoDB do **not** include
     support for TLS/SSL.

Certificate Authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-certificate-authorities.rst

``mongod`` and ``mongos`` Certificate Key File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When establishing a TLS/SSL connection, the
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` presents a certificate key
file to its clients to establish its identity. [#FIPS]_ The certificate
key file contains a public key certificate and its associated private
key, but only the public component is revealed to the client.

MongoDB can use any valid TLS/SSL certificate issued by a certificate
authority, or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed
certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted to
prevent eavesdropping on the connection, there will be *no* validation
of server identity. This leaves you vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
attack. Using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority
will permit MongoDB drivers to verify the server's identity.

In general, avoid using self-signed certificates unless the network is
trusted.

With regards to certificates for replica set and sharded cluster
members, it is advisable to use different certificates on different
servers. This minimizes exposure of the private key and allows for
hostname validation.

.. note::

   If a MongoDB deployment is not configured to use a CA file, it bypasses client 
   certificate validation.

.. [#FIPS]

   For FIPS mode, ensure that the certificate is FIPS-compliant (i.e
   uses a FIPS-compliant algorithm) and the private key meets the
   PKCS#8 standard. If you need to convert a private key to PKCS#8
   format, various conversion tools exist, such as ``openssl pkcs8``
   and others.

Procedures (Using ``net.tls`` Settings)
---------------------------------------

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with TLS/SSL Certificate and Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section configures
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` to use TLS/SSL connections.
With these TLS/SSL settings,
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` presents its certificate
key file to the client. However, the
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` does not require a
certificate key file from the client to verify the client's identity.
To require client's certificate key file, see
:ref:`ssl-mongod-ca-signed-ssl-cert-key` instead.

.. note::

   The procedure uses the ``net.tls`` settings. For procedures that use the 
   ``net.ssl`` settings, see :ref:`configure-ssl`.

To use TLS/SSL connections, include the following :ref:`TLS/SSL

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with Client Certificate Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section configures
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` to use TLS/SSL connections
and perform client certificate validation. With these TLS/SSL settings:

- :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` presents its certificate
  key file to the client for verification.

- :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` requires a certificate
  key file from the client to verify the client's identity.

.. note::

   The procedure uses the ``net.tls`` settings For procedures that use the 
   ``net.ssl`` settings, see :ref:`configure-ssl`.

To use TLS/SSL connections and perform client certificate validation,
include the following :ref:`TLS/SSL settings <net-tls-conf-options>` in
your :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's
:ref:`configuration file <conf-file>`:

.. note::

   You can use system SSL certificate stores for Windows and macOS. To use the

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that uses the above configuration can
only accept TLS/SSL connections and requires a valid certificate from
its clients:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --config <path/to/configuration/file>

Clients must specify TLS/SSL connections and present their certificate
key file to the instance. See
:ref:`mongo-connect-require-client-certificates-tls` for more
information on connecting with TLS/SSL.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` using command-line options instead of the
   configuration file:
   
   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see :option:`--tlsMode <mongod --tlsMode>`,
     :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`, and
     :option:`--tlsCAFile <mongod --tlsCAFile>`.

   The procedure uses the ``net.tls`` settings. For procedures that use the 
   ``net.ssl`` settings, see :ref:`configure-ssl`.

.. include:: /includes/security/block-revoked-certificates-intro.rst

To specify a :abbr:`CRL (Certificate Revocation List)` file, include
:setting:`net.tls.CRLFile` set to a file that contains revoked
certificates.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:

         CRLFile: /etc/ssl/revokedCertificates.pem

Clients that present certificates that are listed in the
:file:`/etc/ssl/revokedCertificates.pem` file are not able to connect.

   You can also configure the revoked certificate list using the
   command-line option.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see :option:`--tlsCRLFile <mongod
     --tlsCRLFile>`.

.. _ssl-mongod-weak-certification:

Validate Only if a Client Presents a Certificate
````````````````````````````````````````````````

In most cases, it is important to ensure that clients present valid
certificates. However, if you have clients that cannot present a client
certificate or are transitioning to using a certificate, you may only
want to validate certificates from clients that present a certificate.

.. note::

   The procedure uses the ``net.tls`` settings. For procedures using the 
   ``net.ssl`` settings, see :ref:`configure-ssl`.

To bypass client certificate validation for clients that do not present
a certificate, include
:setting:`net.tls.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates` set to ``true``.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:
     tls:
       mode: requireTLS
       certificateKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
       CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
       allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates: true

A :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` running with these
settings allows connection from:

- Clients that do not present a certificate.

- Clients that present a valid certificate.

.. note::

   If the client presents a certificate, the certificate must be a
   valid certificate.

   All connections, including those that have not presented
   certificates, are encrypted using TLS/SSL.

See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on TLS/SSL connections for
clients.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see
     :option:`--tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates <mongod
     --tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates>`.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see
     :option:`--tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates <mongos
     --tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates>`.


.. _ssl-disallow-protocols:

Disallow Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The procedure uses the ``net.tls`` settings. For procedures using the 
   ``net.ssl`` settings, see :ref:`configure-ssl`.

To prevent MongoDB servers from accepting incoming connections that use
specific protocols, include :setting:`net.tls.disabledProtocols` set to
the disallowed protocols.

For example, the following configuration prevents
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` from accepting incoming
connections that use either ``TLS1_0`` or ``TLS1_1``

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:
     tls:
       mode: requireTLS
       certificateKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
       CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
       disabledProtocols: TLS1_0,TLS1_1

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see :option:`--tlsDisabledProtocols
     <mongod --tlsDisabledProtocols>`.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see :option:`--tlsDisabledProtocols
     <mongos --tlsDisabledProtocols>`.

.. _ssl-certificate-password:

TLS/SSL Certificate Passphrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the certificate key files for
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` are encrypted, include
:setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFilePassword` set to the passphrase.

.. tip::

   To avoid specifying the passphrase in cleartext, you can use an 
   :ref:`expansion value <externally-sourced-values>` in the configuration file.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword
     <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword>`.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword
     <mongos --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword>`.

.. _certificate-rotation:

Online Certificate Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can rotate the following certificate key
files on-demand:

- :setting:`TLS Certificates <net.tls.certificateKeyFile>`
- :setting:`CRL (Certificate Revocation List) files <net.tls.CRLFile>`
  (on Linux and Windows platforms)
- :setting:`CA (Certificate Authority) files <net.tls.CAFile>`

To rotate one or more of these certificates:

#. Replace the certificate or certificates you wish to rotate on the
   filesystem, noting the following constraints:
   
   - Each new certificate must have the *same filename* and
     *same filepath* as the certificate it is replacing.

   - If rotating an encrypted :setting:`TLS Certificate
     <net.tls.certificateKeyFile>`, its password must be the same as
     the password for the old certificate (as specified to the
     :setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFilePassword` configuration file
     setting). Certificate rotation does not support the interactive
     password prompt.

#. Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance that you wish to perform certificate
   rotation on.

#. Run the :dbcommand:`rotateCertificates` command or the
   :method:`db.rotateCertificates()` shell method to rotate the
   certificates used by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

When certificate rotation takes place:

- Existing connections to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance are not terminated, and will continue
  to use the old certificates.

- Any new connections will use the new certificates.

Incorrect, expired, revoked, or missing certificate files will cause the
certificate rotation to fail, but will not invalidate the existing
TLS configuration or terminate the running :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` process.

Previous to MongoDB 5.0, certificate rotation required downtime, and was
typically performed during maintenance windows.

See :dbcommand:`rotateCertificates` or :method:`db.rotateCertificates()`
for additional considerations and full usage instructions.

         You can use system SSL certificate stores for Windows and macOS. To 
         use the system SSL certificate store, specify
         ``net.ssl.certificateSelector`` instead of specifying the
         certificate key file.

              - Set to ``requireSSL``.

                This setting restricts each server to use only TLS/SSL encrypted
                connections. You can also specify ``allowSSL`` or ``preferSSL``
                to use mixed TLS/SSL modes. See
                ``net.ssl.mode`` for details.

            * - ``net.ssl.certificateSelector`` 

              - Set to the property (either ``subject`` or
                ``thumbprint``) and value.

                This setting is used to select the certificate. See
                ``net.ssl.certificateSelector`` for details.

         For example, consider the following :ref:`configuration file
         <conf-file>` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

         .. code-block:: yaml
            :emphasize-lines: 1-4

            net:
               ssl:
                  mode: requireSSL
                  certificateSelector: subject="<CertificateCommonName>"
            systemLog:
               destination: file
               path: "/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log"
               logAppend: true
            storage:
               dbPath: "/var/lib/mongodb"

               bindIp: localhost,mongodb0.example.net
               port: 27017

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that uses the above configuration can
only accept TLS/SSL connections:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --config <path/to/configuration/file>

See :ref:`tls-client-connection-only` for more information on connecting
with TLS/SSL.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   using command-line options instead of the configuration file:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``--sslMode``, ``--sslPEMKeyFile``,
     and ``--sslCertificateSelector``.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see: ``--sslMode``,
     ``--sslPEMKeyFile`` and ``--sslCertificateSelector``.

.. _client-cert-validation-ssl:

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with Client Certificate Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section configures
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` to use TLS/SSL connections
and perform client certificate validation. With these TLS/SSL settings:

- :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` presents its certificate
  key file to the client for verification.

- :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` requires a certificate
  key file from the client to verify the client's identity.

To use TLS/SSL connections, include the following TLS/SSL settings in
your :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's
:ref:`configuration file <conf-file>`:

.. note::

   You can use system SSL certificate stores for Windows and macOS. To use the 
   system SSL certificate store, specify ``net.ssl.certificateSelector`` instead 
   of specifying the certificate key file.

   * - Setting
     - Notes

   * - ``net.ssl.mode``

     - Set to ``requireSSL``.

       This setting restricts each server to use only TLS/SSL encrypted
       connections. You can also specify ``allowSSL`` or ``preferSSL``
       to use mixed TLS/SSL modes. See
       ``net.ssl.mode`` for details.

   * - ``net.ssl.PEMKeyFile`` 

     - Set to the :file:`.pem` file that contains the TLS/SSL
       certificate and key.

       The :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance
       presents this file to its clients to establish the instance's
       identity.
       
       If the key is encrypted, specify the passphrase
       (``net.ssl.PEMKeyPassword``).

   * - ``net.ssl.CAFile``
   
     - Set to the path of the file that contains the
       certificate chain for verifying client certificates.

       The :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos`
       instance use this file to verify certificates presented
       by its clients. The certificate chain includes the
       certificate of the root Certificate Authority.

For example, consider the following :ref:`configuration file
<conf-file>` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 1-5

   net:
      ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
         CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
   systemLog:
      destination: file
      path: "/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log"
      logAppend: true
   storage:
      dbPath: "/var/lib/mongodb"
   processManagement:
      fork: true
   net:
      bindIp: localhost,mongodb0.example.net
      port: 27017

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that uses the above configuration can
only accept TLS/SSL connections and requires a valid certificate from
its clients:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --config <path/to/configuration/file>

Clients must specify TLS/SSL connections and present their certificate
key file to the instance. See
:ref:`mongo-connect-require-client-certificates-tls` for more
information on connecting with TLS/SSL.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` using command-line options instead of the
   configuration file:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``--sslMode``, ``--sslPEMKeyFile``, and 
     ``--sslCAFile``.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see ``--sslMode``, ``--sslPEMKeyFile``, and 
     ``--sslCAFile``.

.. _block-revoked-certs-ssl:

Block Revoked Certificates for Clients
``````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/security/block-revoked-certificates-intro.rst

To specify a :abbr:`CRL (Certificate Revocation List)` file, include
``net.ssl.CRLFile`` set to a file that contains revoked
certificates.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:
      ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
         CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
         CRLFile: /etc/ssl/revokedCertificates.pem

Clients that present certificates that are listed in the
:file:`/etc/ssl/revokedCertificates.pem` file are not able to connect.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure the revoked certificate list using the command-line option.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``--sslCRLFile``.
   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see ``--sslCRLFile``.

Validate Only if a Client Presents a Certificate
````````````````````````````````````````````````

In most cases, it is important to ensure that clients present valid
certificates. However, if you have clients that cannot present a client
certificate or are transitioning to using a certificate, you may only
want to validate certificates from clients that present a certificate.

To bypass client certificate validation for clients that do not present
a certificate, include
``net.ssl.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates`` set to ``true``.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:
     ssl:
       mode: requireSSL
       PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
       CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
       allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates: true
   
A :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` running with these
settings allows connection from:

- Clients that do not present a certificate.

- Clients that present a valid certificate.

.. note::

   If the client presents a certificate, the certificate must be a
   valid certificate.

   All connections, including those that have not presented
   certificates, are encrypted using TLS/SSL.

See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on TLS/SSL connections for
clients.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``--sslAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates``.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see ``--sslAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates``.

Disallow Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent MongoDB servers from accepting incoming connections that use
specific protocols, include ``net.ssl.disabledProtocols`` set to
the disallowed protocols.

For example, the following configuration prevents
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` from accepting incoming
connections that use either ``TLS1_0`` or ``TLS1_1``

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   net:
     ssl:
       mode: requireSSL
       PEMKeyFile: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
       CAFile: /etc/ssl/caToValidateClientCertificates.pem
       disabledProtocols: TLS1_0,TLS1_1

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``--sslDisabledProtocols``.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see ``--sslDisabledProtocols``.

TLS/SSL Certificate Passphrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the certificate key files for
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` are encrypted, include
``net.ssl.PEMKeyPassword`` set to the passphrase.

.. seealso::

   You can also configure using the command-line options:

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongod`, see ``sslPEMKeyPassword``.

   - For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, see ``--sslPEMKeyPassword``.
