*New in version 1.14.0*

The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in |compass| lets you create
:manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to process
documents from a collection or view and return computed results. For
example, you can use aggregation pipelines to:

- Group values from multiple documents together.

- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

- Analyze data changes over time.

To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click the
:guilabel:`Aggregations` tab. |compass-short| displays a blank
aggregation pipeline. The :guilabel:`Preview of Documents in the
Collection` section shows 20 documents randomly sampled from the chosen
collection.

.. note:: Atlas Search Stages

   When you connect |compass-short| to a MongoDB deployment hosted on 
   `Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_compass>`_,
   additional Atlas-only stages 
   :atlas:`$search </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-search>` and
   :atlas:`$searchMeta </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta>`
   are available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. Use these stages 
   to perform 
   :atlas:`full-text search</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview>` 
   on Atlas collections.

.. _create-agg-pipeline:

Create an Aggregation Pipeline
------------------------------

Aggregation pipelines can be created in two seperate modes:

- Stage View Mode, a visual click-based pipeline editor that 
  preloads pipeline syntax based on your selected stages.

- Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw
  pipeline syntax.

.. _save-agg-pipeline:

Save a Pipeline
---------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-save-pipeline.rst

.. _open-saved-pipeline:

Open a Saved Pipeline
---------------------

1. Click the :guilabel:`Folder` icon at the top left of the
   pipeline builder. 

   .. figure:: /images/compass/saved-pipeline-icon.png
         :alt: Saved Pipeline Icon

#. Hover over the pipeline you want to open and click :guilabel:`Open`.

   .. figure:: /images/compass/saved-pipelines.png
         :alt: Saved Pipelines List 

#. In the modal, click :guilabel:`Open Pipeline`.

.. note::

   Starting in |compass| 1.31, you can view your saved queries
   and aggregation pipelines on the :guilabel:`My Queries` view 
   once connected to your cluster.

   To learn more, see 
   :ref:`viewing saved aggregations<saved-query-view>` for details.

.. _set-maxtime-ms-agg:

Set ``maxTimeMS`` for Aggregation Queries
-----------------------------------------

Use the ``maxTimeMS`` parameter on the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab to 
specify an upper time limit in milliseconds on the aggregation pipelines
that run in |compass-short|.

To enable ``maxTimeMS`` for aggregation operations:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: On the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab, click 
      :guilabel:`More Options`.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-click-more-options.png
         :alt: Toggle more options

   .. step:: Enter a value next to :guilabel:`Max Time MS` to set a 
      maximum amount of time in milliseconds that an aggregation 
      pipeline can run. For a ``5`` second limit, enter ``5000``.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-enter-maxtime-ms.png
         :alt: Enter a maximum timeout value 

      If your aggregation operation goes over the time limit, 
      |compass-short| raises the following error:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-operation-time-limit-error.png
         :alt: Operation timeout error

.. _use-sample-mode-or-auto-preview:

Set the Documents Limit or Auto Preview Documents
-------------------------------------------------

Use the toggles at the top of the pipeline builder to set the
limit on the number of sampled documents or to enable auto preview.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - .. data:: Sample Mode
     - (*Recommended*) When enabled, limits input documents passed to
       :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$bucket`, and
       :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stages. Set the document limit with the
       :data:`Limit` setting.

   * - .. data:: Auto Preview
     - When enabled, |compass-short| automatically updates the
       preview documents pane to reflect the results of each active
       stage as the pipeline progresses.

        - Number of documents to show in the preview.
        - 20
      * - .. data:: Limit
        - When :guilabel:`Sample Mode` is enabled, specifies the number of
          documents passed to :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$bucket`, and
          :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stages. Lower limits improve pipeline
          running time, but may miss documents.
        - 100000

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to save changes and close the
   :guilabel:`Settings` panel.

.. _explain-plan-pipeline:

Explain Plan for Pipelines
--------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Explain` button to view the explain plan that helps you 
understand the performance of your pipelines. You can view the explain plan 
at any point while creating or editing your pipeline. 

To view your pipeline explain plan, click :guilabel:`Explain` in the 
right corner of your pipeline toolbar.

    :alt: Aggregation Pipeline Builder Explain Results

.. _pipeline-custom-collation:

Specify Custom Collation
------------------------

Use :manual:`custom collation </reference/collation/>` to specify
language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for
letter case and accent marks.

To specify a custom collation:

#. Click :guilabel:`More Options` in the top right corner of the pipeline 
   builder. 

   .. figure:: /images/compass/options-collation.png
        :alt: Collation Option

#. Enter your collation document.

.. _export-agg-builder-results:

Export Aggregation Results
--------------------------

To export results from your aggregation pipeline:

#. Connect to the deployment containing the
   :doc:`collection </collections>` you wish to export data from.

   To learn how to connect to a deployment, see
   :ref:`connect-run-compass`.

#. Navigate to your target collection.

   You can either select the collection from the
   :doc:`Collections </collections>` tab or click the collection 
   in the left-hand pane. 

#. Create an aggregation pipeline and run for results.

   To learn how to create an aggregation pipeline, see :ref:`Create an 
   Aggregation Pipeline <create-agg-pipeline>`. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Export`.

#. Choose the appropriate file type.

   Under :guilabel:`Select Export File Type`, select either 
   :guilabel:`JSON` or :guilabel:`CSV`. If you select :guilabel:`JSON`,
   your data is exported to the target file as an array of JSON objects.

#. Under :guilabel:`Output`, choose where to export the file to.

      :width: 70%

#. Click :guilabel:`Export`. 


.. _create-a-view:

Create a View from Pipeline Results
-----------------------------------
   
.. note::

   Creating a view from pipeline results does not save the pipeline
   itself.

To create a view from your pipeline results:

.. include:: /includes/fact-create-view-from-pipeline.rst

.. _refresh-document-counts:

Refresh Document Counts
-----------------------

When you delete or add a document, the :guilabel:`count results` value 
on the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab does not automatically update to 
reflect the new document count.

To update the :guilabel:`count results`:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: **(Optional)** If the results have not been counted, click 
      the :guilabel:`count results` link.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-click-count-results.png
         :alt: Click the count results link

   .. step:: Click the refresh button. 

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-click-refresh-button.png
         :alt: Click the refresh button

      |compass-short| updates the :guilabel:`count results` and displays 
      the updated number of documents in the collection.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-show-document-count.png
         :alt: Show current document counts

Example
-------

In this example, you create and run a pipeline
for a collection with airline data. You can download this
dataset from the following link:
`air_airlines.json <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/compass/air_airlines.json>`__.

For instructions on importing JSON data into your cluster, see :ref:`Import Data 
into a Collection <import-data>`. This example assumes you have the data in the
``example.air_airlines`` namespace.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect to a database deployment. For information on how to connect to a 
   database deployment, see :atlas:`Connect via Compass </compass-connection/>`.

#. Select the ``example`` database where the ``air_airlines`` collection 
   exists. 

#. Create the Pipeline

   |

   The following pipeline has two aggregation stages:
   :pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$match`.

   - The ``$group`` stage groups documents by their
     ``active`` status and ``country``. The stage also adds
     a new ``flightCount`` field containing the number
     of documents in each group.

   - The ``$match`` stage filters documents to return documents
     with a ``flightCount`` value greater than or equal to ``5``.

     .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-full-example.png
        :alt: Aggregation Builder Full Example

#. Run the Pipeline.

   Click :guilabel:`Run` at the top right of the pipeline builder.

The pipeline returns documents, as shown in the following abbreviated example:
