Atlas Stream Processing enables you to read, write, and transform streams of 
complex data using the same :ref:`aggregation operations <aggregation>` 
used in {+service+} databases. {+atlas-sp+} allows you to:

- Build :ref:`aggregation pipelines <atlas-sp-aggregation>` to 
  continuously operate on streaming data.
- Perform continuous :ref:`validation
  <atlas-sp-agg-validate>` to check that messages are properly
  formed, detect message corruption, and detect late-arriving data.
- Transform fields as documents flow through your pipelines and route
  those documents to distinct databases, Kafka topics, or other
  external sinks using fields or expressions in each document as keys.
- Continuously publish results to 
  {+service+} collections or {+kafka+} clusters, ensuring up-to-date 
  views and analysis of data.

{+atlas-sp+} components belong directly to |service| projects and
operate independent of |service| {+clusters+}.

.. note::

   {+atlas-sp+} provides extended functionality beyond MongoDB :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`,
   including managing multiple data event types and processing streams of complex data 
   from various sources like Kafka, external APIs, and cloud storage. Unlike change streams
   which are restricted to database events, {+atlas-sp+} enables comprehensive stream 
   processing workflows with the same query API used in |service| databases. 

Configure a {+SPW+}
---------------------------------------------------------

To get started with {+atlas-sp+}, you must first :ref:`configure a {+SPW+} <atlas-sp-manage-spi>`.
This involves learning how to create, modify, and delete an {+atlas-sp+} Workspace to begin processing 
your streaming data.

.. _atlas-sp-data:
.. _atlas-sp-stream:

Streaming Data
--------------

A stream is a continuous flow of immutable data originating from one
or more sources. Examples of data streams include temperature or
pressure readings from sensors, records of financial transactions, or
change data capture events.

Data streams originate from **sources** such as {+kafka-topics+} or
MongoDB :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`. You can then write
processed data to **sinks** including {+kafka-topics+}, |service|
collections, external functions, or cloud data stores.

{+atlas-sp+} provides native stream processing capabilities to operate
on continuous data without the time and computational constraints of
an at-rest database.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure:

Structure of a Stream Processor
-------------------------------

:ref:`Stream processors <atlas-sp-manage-processor>` take the form of a pipeline which can be
conceptually divided into three phases. Once you understand this structure, you can create and manage stream processors 
to continuously process your streaming data.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure-source:

Sources
~~~~~~~

Stream processors begin by ingesting documents from sources of
streaming data to which {+atlas-sp+} is connected. These can be
broker systems like {+kafka+}, or database change streams such as
those generated by {+service+} read/write operations. These inputs
must be valid ``json`` or ``ejson`` documents. Once the
:pipeline:`$source` stage ingests a document, you can apply
:manual:`MongoDB aggregation </aggregation>` to that document
to transform it as needed.

In addition to ingesting data from a streaming source, {+atlas-sp+}
also supports enriching your documents with data from :ref:`HTTPS
<atlas-sp-agg-https>` requests and :ref:`$lookup
<atlas-sp-agg-lookup>` operations to join data from connected
{+service+} clusters.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure-pipeline:

Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~

A stream processor leverages :ref:`Aggregation pipeline stages
<atlas-sp-aggregation>` and :ref:`Aggregation operators
<atlas-sp-aggregation-operators>` in addition to the standard MongoDB
suite of :manual:`aggregation operators and stages
</aggregation-operations>` to transform ingested data and extract
valuable insights. To learn how to define {+atlas-sp+} :ref:`aggregation pipelines <atlas-sp-agg-source>`, 
see the aggregation pipeline documentation. {+atlas-sp+} can write documents it can't process
to a :ref:`Dead Letter Queue <atlas-sp-dlq>`.

You can enrich documents by restructuring them, adding or removing
fields, looking up information from your collections, and
more. {+atlas-sp+} also enables you to collect events using
:ref:`windows <atlas-sp-processor-structure-window>` and execute
arbitrary :ref:`functions <atlas-sp-processor-structure-function>`.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure-window:

Windows
```````

:ref:`Windows <atlas-sp-windows>` are pipeline stages that aggregate
streaming data within a set time period. This enables you to group the
data, take averages, find minima and maxima, and perform various other
operations that are otherwise inapplicable to streaming data. Each
stream processor can only have one window stage.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure-function:

Functions
`````````

{+atlas-sp+} supports calls to either custom JavaScript
:ref:`functions <atlas-sp-agg-function>` or {+aws+} Lambda
:ref:`functions <atlas-sp-agg-external-function>` that run against
each document that the stream processes passes to them.

.. _atlas-sp-processor-structure-sink:

Sinks
~~~~~

After processing the ingested data, the stream processor persits it be
writing it to a sink. {+atlas-sp+} offers the :ref:`$emit
<atlas-sp-agg-emit>` and :ref:`$merge <atlas-sp-agg-merge>` stages for
writing to different sink types. These stages are mutually exclusive
with each other, and each stream processor can have only one sink
stage. Your pipeline can include logic to write processed documents to
different Kafka topics or |service| collections within the same sink
connections.

.. _atlas-sp-regions:

{+atlas-sp+} Regions 
---------------------------------------

{+atlas-sp+} supports creating {+spw+}s on |aws|, |azure|, and |gcp|. For a
list of available regions, see the Stream Processing Worspaces
sections of the:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services <aws-stream-processing-regions>`
  feature reference.
- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <azure-stream-processing-regions>`
  feature reference.
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <gcp-stream-processing-regions>`
  feature reference.

Stream processors can read from and write to {+clusters+} hosted on
different cloud providers, or in different regions.
