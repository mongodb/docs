:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` automate most administrative tasks
associated with database replication.  Nevertheless, several
operations related to deployment and systems management require
administrator intervention remain. This document provides an overview
of those tasks, in addition to a collection of troubleshooting
suggestions for administers of replica sets.

Procedures
----------

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-add-member:

Adding Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before adding a new member to an existing :term:`replica set`, do one of
the following to prepare the new member's :term:`data directory <dbpath>`:

- Make sure the new member's data directory *does not* contain data. The
  new member will copy the data directory from an existing member.

  If the new member is in a ":term:`recovering`" state, it must exit
  become a :term:`secondary` before MongoDB
  can copy all data as part of the replication process. This process
  takes time but does not require administrator intervention.

- Manually copy the data directory from an existing member. The new
  member becomes a secondary member and will catch up to the current
  state of the replica set after a short interval. Copying the data over
  manually shortens the amount of time for the new member to become
  current.

  Ensure that you can copy the data directory to the new member and
  begin replication within the :ref:`window allowed by the oplog <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`. If the
  difference in the amount of time between the most recent operation and
  the most recent operation to the database exceeds the length of the
  :term:`oplog` on the existing members, then the new instance will have
  to completely re-synchronize.

   Use :func:`db.printReplicationInfo()` to check the current state of
   replica set members with regards to the oplog.

To add a member to an existing replica set, deploy a new
:program:`mongod` instance, specifying the name of the replica set
(i.e. :data:`setname <rs.conf._id>`) on the command line with the
:option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option or in the configuration
file with the :setting:`replSet`. Take note of the host name and port
information for the new :program:`mongod` instance.

Then log in to the current :term:`primary` using the :program:`mongo`
shell. Issue the :func:`db.isMaster()` command when connected to *any*
member of the set to determine the current primary. Issue the
following command to add the new member to the set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("mongo2.example.net:27017")

Alternately, specify an entire configuration document with some or all
of the fields in a :data:`members <rs.conf.members>` document. For
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add({_id: 1, host: "mongo2.example.net:27017", priority: 0, hidden: true})

This configures a :term:`hidden member` that is accessible at
``mongo2.example.net:27017``. See ":data:`host <members[n].host>`,"
":data:`priority <members[n].priority>`," and ":data:`hidden
<members[n].hidden>`" for more information about these settings. When
you specify a full configuration object with :func:`rs.add()`, you must
declare the ``_id`` field, which is not automatically populated in
this case.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-remove-members:

Removing Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may remove a member of a replica at any time. Use the
:func:`rs.remove()` function in the :program:`mongo` shell while
connected to the current :term:`primary`. Issue the
:func:`db.isMaster()` command when connected to *any* member of the
set to determine the current primary. Use a command in either
of the following forms to remove the member:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27017")
   rs.remove("mongo3.example.net")

This operation disconnects the shell briefly and forces a
re-connection as the :term:`replica set` renegotiates which member
will be primary. The shell displays an error even if this
command succeeds.

You can re-add a removed member to a replica set at any time using the
:ref:`procedure for adding replica set members <replica-set-admin-procedure-add-member>`.
Additionally, consider using the :ref:`replica set reconfiguration procedure
<replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>` to change the
:data:`members[n].host` value to rename a member in a replica set
directly.

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-replace-member:

Replacing a Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two processes for replacing a member of a :term:`replica set`:

#. Remove and then re-add a member using the following procedure in
   the :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27018")
      rs.add({host: "mongo2.example.net:27019", priority: 0, hidden: true})

   .. note::

      The set member tracks its own replica set member ``_id``,
      which can cause conflicts when trying to re-add a previous member.

      To resolve this issue, you can either restart the
      :program:`mongod` process on the member that you're re-adding, or
      you can make sure that you specify an ``_id`` in the :func:`rs.add()`
      document.

#. Use :func:`rs.reconfig()` to change the value of the
   :data:`members[n].host` field to reflect the new hostname or port
   number. In this case, the :data:`members[n]._id` field is not
   reused by the new member.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[0].host = "mongo2.example.net:27019"
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

   The second method may be useful if you have an existing configuration
   and only want to change the hostname of a member rather than
   completely remove all configurations related to the existing/previous
   set member. The :data:`members[n]._id` field does not change as a
   result of this operation.

.. warning::

   Any replica set configuration change can trigger the current
   :term:`primary` to step down, which forces an :term:`election`. This
   causes the current shell session, and clients connected to this replica set,
   to produce an error even when the operation succeeds.

.. _replica-set-node-priority-configuration:
.. _replica-set-member-priority-configuration:

Adjusting Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the value of the :data:`members[n].priority` value in the
replica set configuration, use the following sequence of commands in
the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[1].priority = 2
   cfg.members[2].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

The first operation uses :func:`rs.conf()` to set the local variable
``cfg`` to the contents of the current replica set configuration, which
is a :term:`document`. The next three operations change the
:data:`members[n].priority` value in the ``cfg`` document for
:data:`members[n]._id` of ``0``, ``1``, or ``2``. The final operation
calls :func:`rs.reconfig()` with the argument of ``cfg`` to initialize
the new configuration.

If a member has :data:`members[n].priority` set to ``0``, it is
ineligible to become :term:`primary` and will not seek
elections. :ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>`, and
:ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>` all have :data:`members[n].priority`
set to ``0``.

All members have a :data:`members[n].priority` equal to ``1`` by default.

The value of :data:`members[n].priority` can be any floating point
(i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``. Priorities
are only used to determine the preference in election. The priority
value is used only in relation to other members. With the exception of
members with a priority of ``0``, the absolute value of the
:data:`members[n].priority` value is irrelevant.

Replica sets will preferentially elect and maintain the primary status
of the member with the highest :data:`members[n].priority` setting.

.. warning::

   Replica set reconfiguration can force the current primary to step
   down, leading to an election for primary in the replica
   set. Elections cause the current primary to close all open
   :term:`client` connections.

   Perform routine replica set reconfiguration during scheduled
   maintenance windows.

.. seealso:: The ":ref:`Replica Reconfiguration Usage
   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`" example revolves around
   changing the priorities of the :data:`members` of a replica set.

.. _replica-set-procedure-change-oplog-size:

Changing Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`oplog` exists internally as a :term:`capped collection`, so
you cannot modify its size in the course of normal operations. In most
cases the :ref:`default oplog size <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` is an
acceptable size; however, in some situations you may need a larger or
smaller oplog. To resize the oplog, follow these steps:

#. Restart the current :term:`primary` instance in the :term:`replica set` in
   "standalone" mode, running on a different port.

#. Save the last entry from the old (current) oplog and create a
   backup of the oplog.

#. Drop the existing oplog and create a new oplog of a different size.

#. Insert the previously saved last entry from the old oplog into the
   new oplog.

#. Restart the server as a member of the replica set on its usual
   port.

#. Apply this procedure to any other member of the replica set that
   *could become* primary.

.. seealso:: The ":doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`" tutorial.

.. _replica-set-node-configurations:
.. _replica-set-member-configurations:

Member Configurations
---------------------

All :term:`replica sets <replica set>` have a single :term:`primary` and one or more
:term:`secondaries <secondary>`. Replica sets sets allow you to configure
secondary members in a variety of ways. This section describes these
configurations.

.. note::

   A replica set can have up to 12 members, but only 7 members can have
   votes. See ":ref:`non-voting members <replica-set-non-voting-members>`"
   for configuration information regarding non-voting members.

.. warning::

   The :func:`rs.reconfig()` shell command can force the current
   primary to step down, which causes an election. When the primary
   steps down, the :program:`mongod` closes all client
   connections. While, this typically takes 10-20 seconds, attempt to
   make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods.

.. _replica-set-secondary-only-configuration:

Secondary-Only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a four-member :term:`replica set`, with member ``_id`` values of:
``0``, ``1``, ``2``, and ``3``, use the following sequence of
operations in the :program:`mongo` shell to modify member priorities:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[1].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[2].priority = 1
   cfg.members[3].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This operation sets the following:

- Member ``0`` to a priority of ``0`` so that it can never become :term:`primary`.

- Member ``1`` to a priority of ``0.5``, which makes it less likely to
  become primary than other members but doesn't prohibit the
  possibility.

- Member ``2`` to a priority of ``1``, which is the default value.
  Member ``2`` becomes primary if no member with a *higher* priority is
  eligible.

- Member ``3`` to a priority of ``2``. Member ``3`` becomes primary, if
  eligible, under most circumstances.

.. note::

   If your replica set has an even number of members, add an
   :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` to ensure that
   members can quickly obtain a majority of votes in an
   :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>` for primary.

.. seealso:: ":data:`members[n].priority`" and ":ref:`Replica Set
   Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-hidden-configuration:

Hidden
~~~~~~

To configure a :term:`hidden member`, use the following sequence of
operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].hidden = true
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After re-configuring the set, the member with the ``_id`` of ``0``
has a priority of ``0`` so that it cannot become primary. The
other members in the set will not advertise the hidden member in the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` or :func:`db.isMaster()` output.

.. note::

   You must send the :func:`rs.reconfig()` command to a set member
   that *can* become :term:`primary`. In the above example, if you issue
   the :func:`rs.reconfig()` operation to the member with the ``_id``
   of ``0``, the operation fails.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Replica Set Read Preference <replica-set-read-preference>`."
   ":data:`members[n].hidden`," ":data:`members[n].priority`,"
   and ":ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-delayed-configuration:

Delayed
~~~~~~~

To configure a :term:`replica set` member with a one hour delay, use the
following sequence of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].slaveDelay = 3600
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After the replica set reconfigures, the set member with the ``_id`` of
``0`` has a priority of ``0`` and cannot become :term:`primary`. The :data:`slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>` value
delays both replication and the member's :term:`oplog` by 3600 seconds (1
hour). Setting :data:`slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>` to a
non-zero value also sets :data:`hidden <members[n].hidden>` to
``true`` for this replica set so that it does not receive application
queries in normal operations.

.. warning::

   The length of the secondary :data:`slaveDelay
   <members[n].slaveDelay>` must fit within the window of the
   oplog. If the oplog is shorter than the :data:`slaveDelay
   <members[n].slaveDelay>` window, the delayed member cannot
   successfully replicate operations.

.. related:: For more information about delayed members, see the
   section on ":ref:`Delayed Replication <replica-set-delayed-members>`."
   Additionally consider the following resources:
  ":data:`members[n].slaveDelay`," ":ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration
  <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`," ":ref:`Oplog Sizing
  <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`," and ":doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`."

.. _replica-set-arbiter-configuration:

Arbiters
~~~~~~~~

Use the following command to start an arbiter:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --replSet [setname]

Replace ``[setname]`` with the name of the :term:`replica set` that the
arbiter will join. Then in the :program:`mongo` shell, while connected
to the *current* :term:`primary`, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.addArb("[hostname]:[port]")

Replace the ``[hostname]:[port]`` string with the arbiter's
hostname and the port.

.. seealso:: ":setting:`replSet`," ":option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
   and ":func:`rs.addArb()`."

.. _replica-set-non-voting-configuration:

Non-Voting
~~~~~~~~~~

To disable a member's ability to vote in :ref:`elections
<replica-set-elections>` use the following command sequence in the
:program:`mongo` shell.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[3].votes = 0
   cfg.members[4].votes = 0
   cfg.members[5].votes = 0
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This sequence gives ``0`` votes to set members with the ``_id``
values of ``3``, ``4``, and ``5``. This setting allows the set to
elect these members as :term:`primary` but does not allow them to
vote in elections. If you have three non-voting members, you can add
three additional voting members to your set. Place voting members so that
your designated primary or primaries can reach a majority of votes in
the event of a network partition.

.. note::

   In general and when possible, all members should have only 1 vote. This
   prevents intermittent ties, deadlocks, or the wrong members from
   becoming primary. Use ":ref:`Replica Set Priorities
   <replica-set-node-priority>`" to control which members are more
   likely to become primary.

.. seealso:: ":data:`members[n].votes`" and ":ref:`Replica Set
   Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-security:

Security
--------

In most cases, the most effective ways to control access and to secure
the connection between members of a :term:`replica set` depend on
network-level access control. Use your environment's firewall and
network routing to ensure that traffic *only* from clients and other
replica set members can reach your :program:`mongod` instances. If needed,
use virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure secure connections
over wide area networks (WANs.)

Additionally, MongoDB provides an authentication mechanism for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances connecting to
replica sets. These instances enable authentication but specify a
shared key file that serves as a shared password.

.. versionadded:: 1.8 for replica sets (1.9.1 for sharded replica sets) added support for authentication.

To enable authentication add the following option to your configuration file:

.. code-block:: cfg

   keyFile = /srv/mongodb/keyfile

.. note::

   You may chose to set these run-time configuration options using the
   :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>` (or :option:`mongos --keyFile`)
   options on the command line.

Setting :setting:`keyFile` enables authentication and specifies a key
file for the replica set members to use when authenticating to each
other. The content of the key file is arbitrary but must be the same
on all members of the replica set and on all :program:`mongos`
instances that connect to the set.

The key file must be less one kilobyte in size and may only contain
characters in the base64 set. The key file must not have group or "world"
permissions on UNIX systems. Use the following command to use the
OpenSSL package to generate "random" content for use in a key file:

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl rand -base64 753

.. note::

   Key file permissions are not checked on Windows systems.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section defines reasonable troubleshooting processes for common
operational challenges. While there is no single causes or guaranteed
response strategies for any of these symptoms, the following sections
provide good places to start a troubleshooting investigation with
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/administration/monitoring`."

.. _replica-set-replication-lag:

Replication Lag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replication lag is a delay between an operation on the :term:`primary`
and the application of that operation from :term:`oplog` to the
:term:`secondary`. Such lag can be a significant issue and can
seriously affect MongoDB :term:`replica set` deployments. Excessive
replication lag makes "lagged" members ineligible to quickly become
primary and increases the possibility that distributed
read operations will be inconsistent.

Identify replication lag by checking the values of
:data:`members[n].optimeDate` for each member of the replica set
using the :func:`rs.status()` function in the :program:`mongo`
shell.

Possible causes of replication lag include:

- **Network Latency.**

  Check the network routes between the members of your set to ensure
  that there is no packet loss or network routing issue.

  Use tools including ``ping`` to test latency between set
  members and ``traceroute`` to expose the routing of packets
  network endpoints.

- **Disk Throughput.**

  If the file system and disk device on the secondary is
  unable to flush data to disk as quickly as the primary, then
  the secondary will have difficulty keeping state. Disk-related
  issues are incredibly prevalent on multi-tenant systems, including
  vitalized instances, and can be transient if the system accesses
  disk devices over an IP network (as is the case with Amazon's
  EBS system.)

  Use system-level tools to assess disk status, including
  ``iostat`` or ``vmstat``.

- **Concurrency.**

  In some cases, long-running operations on the primary can block
  replication on secondaries. You can use
  :term:`write concern` to prevent write operations from returning
  if replication cannot keep up with the write load.

  Use the :term:`database profiler` to see if there are slow queries
  or long-running operations that correspond to the incidences of lag.

Failover and Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, failover occurs without administrator intervention
seconds after the :term:`primary` either steps down, becomes inaccessible,
or becomes otherwise ineligible to act as primary. If your MongoDB deployment
does not failover according to expectations, consider the following
operational errors:

- No remaining member is able to form a majority. This can happen as a
  result of network partitions that render some members
  inaccessible. Design your deployment to ensure that a majority of
  set members can elect a primary in the same facility as core
  application systems.

- No member is eligible to become primary. Members must have a
  :data:`members[n].priority` setting greater than ``0``, have a state
  that is less than ten seconds behind the last operation to the
  :term:`replica set`, and generally be *more* up to date than the
  voting members.

In many senses, :ref:`rollbacks <replica-set-rollbacks>` represent a
graceful recovery from an impossible failover and recovery situation.

Rollbacks occur when a primary accepts writes that other members of
the set do not successfully replicate before the primary steps
down. When the former primary begins replicating again it performs a
"rollback." Rollbacks remove those operations from the instance that
were never replicated to the set so that the data set is in a
consistent state. The :program:`mongod` program writes rolled back
data to a :term:`BSON` file that you can view using
:program:`bsondump`, applied manually using :program:`mongorestore`.

You can prevent rollbacks by ensuring safe writes by using
the appropriate :term:`write concern`.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Replica Set Elections <replica-set-elections>`"
