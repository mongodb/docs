.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().setWriteConcern( { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> } )

The fields are: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``w``
     - The number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongod`
       instances that must acknowledge a write. Possible values are:

       - "majority". A majority of the target instances must
         acknowledge the write.
       - <number>. The specified number of target instances must
         acknowledge the write.
       - <custom write concern name>. A user defined write concern, the
         tagged instances must acknowledge the write.

       See :ref:`write concern specification <wc-w>` for details.

   * -  ``j``
     - A boolean value. ``j: true`` requests acknowledgment that the
       write operation has been written to the :ref:`on-disk journal
       <journaling-internals>`.
     
   * - ``wtimeout``
     - The number of milliseconds to wait for acknowledgment of the
       write concern. ``wtimeout`` is only applicable when ``w`` has a
       value greater than ``1``.

Example
-------

In the following example:

- Two :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances must
  acknowledge writes.
- There is a ``1`` second timeout to wait for write acknowledgments.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().setWriteConcern( { w: 2, wtimeout: 1000 } )
