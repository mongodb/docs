Where do I find a breakdown of costs?
-------------------------------------

A breakdown of costs for all MongoDB Cloud product usage can be found 
on your monthly cloud invoices, viewable in |service| through your 
organization’s :guilabel:`Billing` page.

Why does my invoice include usage from last month?
--------------------------------------------------

Cloud usage at the very end of a billing period may appear 
as a line item on your invoice for the next billing period instead. For 
example, usage on October 31st may be processed in November.

Atlas data transfer, private endpoint, and backup costs depend on your 
Cloud Service Provider. Due to reporting lag from Cloud Service 
Providers, usage of these services may be processed the in following 
days.

How can I reduce my data transfer costs?
----------------------------------------

There are a number of ways to optimize data transference depending on
the configuration of your project. For a list of common options, see
:ref:`How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs <reducing-data-transfer-costs>`
on the :guilabel:`Billing` page.

Why did my |service| payment fail?
----------------------------------

Payments will fail if there is an issue with your
:guilabel:`Payment Method`. To learn how to verify your
:guilabel:`Payment Method` and retry your payment, see
:ref:`retry-failed-payment`.

How can I pay for an |service| subscription with a credit card?
---------------------------------------------------------------

To pay for an :ref:`Atlas subscription <atlas-subscriptions>` with a 
credit card:

1. Contact :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>` to purchase a 
   subscription.

2. Email a request to ar@mongodb.com to pay for your active 
   subscription with a credit card. Please include your Organization ID 
   in your request.

You can find your Organization ID in the {+atlas-ui+}, under your 
organization's :guilabel:`General Settings`.

How can I pay for |service-fullname| without a credit card?
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can pay with `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/us/home>`__ 
through the |service| console.

For alternative payment methods, or to purchase an |service| 
subscription, please contact :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`.

What happens when I exhaust my |service| credits and move to elastic billing?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you exhaust your |service| credits and you have an 
:ref:`elastic billing subscription <atlas-subscriptions>`, you can 
continue to use |service| without interruption. You're billed for 
usage beyond your credits with monthly invoices.

Your organization activity feed produces an event notifying you that 
MongoDB will invoice your organization for your monthly usage. The 
:ref:`payment method <payment-method>` section of your organization's 
billing overview reflects the change.

Has MongoDB received my invoice payment?
----------------------------------------

With a MongoDB subscription, you can check if MongoDB has 
received a payment for an invoice in the |service| console:

1. Navigate to your organization's :guilabel:`Billing` page.

#. Click on the invoice for which you want to check your payment status.

#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Payments` section of the invoice. The 
   :guilabel:`Status` column lists your payment status.

If MongoDB has received a payment, the payment status is 
``SUCCESSFUL``.

To learn more, see :ref:`Payments <payment-statuses>` statuses.

Where can I find MongoDB's bank details?
----------------------------------------

With a MongoDB subscription, MongoDB’s bank details are listed 
on the tax invoice emailed to your billing contact.

To learn more, see :ref:`<pay-subscription-charges>`.
