Sync jobs transfer data from your relational database to MongoDB. Sync 
jobs use project-level :ref:`rm-mapping-rules` to distribute data to 
your MongoDB database.

Types of Sync Jobs
------------------

Relational Migrator offers two different sync job types:

**Snapshot**: Snapshot sync jobs run once, typically for a point in time 
migration strategy.

**Continuous**: Continuous sync jobs cover new incoming data for a zero-downtime 
Change Data Capture (CDC) migration strategy. Continuous jobs run a snapshot stage first,
followed by a CDC stage that captures database updates in near-real time. 
When you run a continuous sync job, your source and destination database 
data remain in sync.

.. note:: Kafka Deployment Model

   The Kafka deployment model of Relational Migrator allows you to run 
   longer-running snapshot or continuous sync jobs with improved resiliency. 
   For more details about the Kafka deployment model, see 
   :ref:`kafka-intro`.
