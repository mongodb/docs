msgid "In MongoDB, write operations, e.g. :method:`db.collection.update()`, :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`, :method:`db.collection.remove()`, are atomic on the level of a single document. For fields that must be updated together, embedding the fields within the same document ensures that the fields can be updated atomically."

msgid "For example, consider a situation where you need to maintain information on books, including the number of copies available for checkout as well as the current checkout information."

msgid "The available copies of the book and the checkout information should be in sync. As such, embedding the ``available`` field and the ``checkout`` field within the same document ensures that you can update the two fields atomically."

msgid "Then to update with new checkout information, you can use the :method:`db.collection.update()` method to atomically update both the ``available`` field and the ``checkout`` field:"

msgid "If no document matched the update condition, then :data:`~WriteResult.nMatched` and :data:`~WriteResult.nModified` would be ``0`` and would indicate that you could not check out the book."
