msgid "The :doc:`command line </reference/program/mongod>` and :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>` interfaces provide MongoDB administrators with a large number of options and settings for controlling the operation of the database system. This document provides an overview of common configurations and examples of best-practice configurations for common use cases."

msgid "While both interfaces provide access to the same collection of options and settings, this document primarily uses the configuration file interface. If you run MongoDB using a :term:`init script` or if you installed from a package for your operating system, you likely already have a configuration file located at ``/etc/mongod.conf``. Confirm this by checking the contents of the ``/etc/init.d/mongod`` or ``/etc/rc.d/mongod`` script to ensure that the init scripts start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the appropriate configuration file."

msgid ":setting:`~processManagement.fork` is ``true``, which enables a :term:`daemon` mode for :binary:`~bin.mongod`, which detaches (i.e. \"forks\") the MongoDB from the current session and allows you to run the database as a conventional server."

msgid ":setting:`~net.bindIp` is ``127.0.0.1``, which forces the server to only listen for requests on the localhost IP. Only bind to secure interfaces that the application-level systems can access with access control provided by system network filtering (i.e. \":term:`firewall`\")."
