Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how {+driver-short+} uses connection pools to manage
connections to a MongoDB deployment and how you can configure connection pool settings
in your application.

A connection pool is a cache of open database connections maintained by {+driver-short+}.
When your application requests a connection to MongoDB, {+driver-short+} seamlessly
gets a connection from the pool, performs operations, and returns the connection
to the pool for reuse.

Connection pools help reduce application latency and the number of times new connections
are created by {+driver-short+}.

Configuring Connection Pools
----------------------------

You can specify the following connection pool settings in your ``MongoClient`` object or in
your connection URI:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``connectTimeoutMS``
     - | The time that {+driver-short+} waits when establishing a new
         connection before timing out.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``20000``
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``connectTimeoutMS = 40000``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``connectTimeoutMS=40000``

   * - ``maxConnecting``
     - | The maximum number of connections that each pool can establish concurrently.
         If this limit is reached, further requests wait until a connection is established
         or another in-use connection is checked back into the pool.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``2``
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``maxConnecting = 3``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``maxConnecting=3``

   * - ``maxIdleTimeMS``
     - | The maximum time that a connection can remain idle in the pool. When a connection
         exceeds this limit, {+driver-short+} closes the connection and removes it from
         the pool.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``None`` (no limit)
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``maxIdleTimeMS = 60000``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``maxIdleTimeMS=60000``

   * - ``maxPoolSize``
     - | The maximum number of concurrent connections that the pool maintains.
         If the maximum pool size is reached, further requests wait until a connection
         becomes available.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``100``
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``maxPoolSize = 150``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``maxPoolSize=150``

   * - ``minPoolSize``
     - | The minimum number of concurrent connections that the pool maintains. If
         the number of open connections falls below this value due to network errors,
         {+driver-short+} attempts to create new connections to maintain this minimum.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``0``
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``minPoolSize = 3``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``minPoolSize=3``

   * - ``socketTimeoutMS``
     - | The length of time that {+driver-short+} waits for a response from the server
         before timing out.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``None`` (no timeout)
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``socketTimeoutMS = 100000``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``socketTimeoutMS=100000``

   * - ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``
     - | How long a thread waits for a connection to become available in the connection pool
         before timing out.
       |
       | **Data Type**: ``int``
       | **Default**: ``None`` (no timeout)
       | **MongoClient Example**: ``waitQueueTimeoutMS = 100000``
       | **Connection URI Example**: ``waitQueueTimeoutMS=100000``

The following code creates a client with a maximum connection pool size of ``50`` by using the
``maxPoolSize`` parameter. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous`
tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Synchronous
     :tabid: sync

     .. code-block:: python

        client = MongoClient(host, port, maxPoolSize=50)
    
  .. tab:: Asynchronous
     :tabid: async

     .. code-block:: python

        client = AsyncMongoClient(host, port, maxPoolSize=50)

The following code creates a client with the same configuration as the preceding example,
but uses a connection URI:

.. tabs::
  
  .. tab:: Synchronous
     :tabid: sync

     .. code-block:: python

        client = MongoClient(host, port, maxPoolSize=50)
    
  .. tab:: Asynchronous
     :tabid: async

     .. code-block:: python

        client = AsyncMongoClient(host, port, maxPoolSize=50)
