The multi-cluster reference architecture includes multiple deployment strategies, 
each with the common foundation of MongoDB custom resources being deployed across 
multiple |k8s| clusters without a service mesh.

Standard multi-cluster deployments consist of one or more elements from each of 
the following categories, including but not limited to |k8s| clusters and a 
means of securely networking between them. 

You can access all of the code examples included in the following guides from 
the ``architectures`` directory of the |k8s-op-short| `official GitHub repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/tree/master>`__, 
or you can simply copy and paste the same examples directly from the guides 
included in this reference architecture.

Follow the procedures within the following categories to deploy a tested, 
working multiple-|k8s| cluster implementation of the |k8s-op|. 

.. note:: 

   The examples included in this reference architecture are opinionated and 
   include specific, third-party tools and platforms for illustration's sake. 
   You can substitute any equivalent tool or platform. MongoDB does not support 
   third-party tooling.

Kubernetes Infrastruture
------------------------

To deploy any variety of Multi-Cluster MongoDB implementation, you must have 
multiple |k8s| clusters. You can deploy your |k8s| clusters in any way you like. 
To deploy them on |gke|, you can follow the steps in this guide:

- :ref:`Deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters on GKE <reference-architectures-gke-clusters-no-mesh>`.

Cluster-to-Cluster Networking
-----------------------------

All implementations of multiple |k8s| cluster |k8s-op-short| deployments require 
each cluster to expose |fqdn|. To achieve this without deploying a service mesh 
you can follow the guides within this section of the reference architectures.

- :ref:`Configure External DNS. <reference-architectures-external-dns-no-mesh>`

MongoDB Kubernetes Operator
---------------------------

The |k8s-op-full| handles the deployment of MongoDB custom resources, 
such as the Ops Manager and MongoDB database intances in |k8s|.
For general information about the |k8s-op-short| for multi-cluster deployments, 
see :ref:`Multi-Cluster Replics Sets <multi-cluster-overview-ref>`. 
To deploy the |k8s-op-short| to your |k8s| cluster, see:

- :ref:`Deploy the Operator <reference-architectures-deploy-operator-no-mesh>`.

Ops Manager
-----------

|k8s-op| deployments require either a Cloud Manager or an Ops Manager instance. 
These required resources facilitate workloads such as backing up data and 
monitoring database performance. To deploy Ops Manager across multiple |k8s| 
clusters, see:

- :ref:`Deploy multi-cluster Ops Manager. <reference-architectures-multi-cluster-ops-manager-no-mesh>`


MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

|k8s-op| facilitates the deployment of MongoDB and related resources in one or 
more |k8s| clusters. To learn more, see :ref:`Multi Cluster Replicasets <reference-architectures-multi-cluster-replica-set-no-mesh>`
and see :ref:`Multi-Cluster Sharded Clusters <reference-architectures-multi-cluster-sharded-cluster-no-mesh>`.
