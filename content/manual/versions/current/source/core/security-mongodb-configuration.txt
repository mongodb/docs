Overview
--------

MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod` and :binary:`mongos`, bind to
localhost by default. If the :setting:`net.ipv6` configuration file
setting or the ``--ipv6`` command line option is set for the binary,
the binary additionally binds to the localhost IPv6 address.

Considerations
--------------

.. warning::

   Make sure that your :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instances are only accessible on trusted networks. If your system
   has more than one network interface, bind MongoDB programs to the
   private or internal network interface.

If the :setting:`net.ipv6` configuration file setting or the ``--ipv6``
command line option is set for the binary, the binary additionally
binds to the localhost IPv6 address.
