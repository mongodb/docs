   :description: How does Ops Manager download binaries with partial or no Internet access?
   :keywords: remote mode, local mode, hybrid mode

.. |company| replace:: MongoDB, Inc.

By default, |onprem|, {+mdbagent+}, and Backup Daemon hosts download
MongoDB installation binaries over the public internet from |company|

If your environment restricts which hosts can access the public
internet, |onprem|, {+mdbagent+}, and Backup Daemon hosts can download
MongoDB installation binaries from other locations. You can configure 
the following download modes:

.. _om-use-remote-mode:

Remote Mode
-----------

This is the default configuration when you deploy |onprem|. 
If your |onprem|, MongoDB deployment, and Backup Daemon
hosts can access the public internet, no additional configuration is
necessary.

Choose **Remote Mode** when the |onprem|, MongoDB deployment, and
Backup Daemon hosts can access the public internet or can access an internal
or external |http| or |https| endpoint that hosts the MongoDB installation
binaries.

.. note::

   If your MongoDB deployments run |fcv-link| 4.2 or later, your MongoDB
   deployments require access to the public internet or an |http| or
   |https| endpoint that hosts the MongoDB installation binaries to run
   |onprem| in Remote Mode.

If you want your |onprem|, {+mdbagent+}, and Backup Daemon hosts to
download the MongoDB installation binaries from an |http| or |https|
endpoint, specify the endpoint using the :setting:`Base URL` |onprem|
configuration setting. To learn more, see the **Remote Mode** instructions in
:ref:`Configure MongoDB Agent to Use Remote Downloads <config-remote-mode>`.

.. _om-use-hybrid-mode:

Hybrid Mode
-----------

Choose **Hybrid Mode** when only the |onprem| hosts in your deployment
can access the public internet. |onprem| hosts download MongoDB
installer binaries from the internet. MongoDB hosts with {+mdbagent+}s
download these installers from the |onprem| hosts and then install or
upgrade MongoDB deployments.

To manage MongoDB hosts without internet access, you must
specify that the 
:guilabel:`Source for agents to download MongoDB binaries` is
:guilabel:`hybrid`. To learn more, see the **Hybrid Mode** instructions in
:ref:`Configure MongoDB Agent to Use Hybrid Downloads <config-hybrid-mode>`.

.. _om-use-local-mode:

Local Mode
----------

Choose **Local Mode** when none of the hosts in your deployment can
access the public internet or an internal or external HTTP or HTTPS 
endpoint that hosts the MongoDB installation binaries. Instead, the 
required MongoDB binaries must be loaded onto each Ops Manager host
and then downloaded using MongoDB Backup Daemons and MongoDB Agents.
 

To manage MongoDB hosts and run |onprem| without internet access, you must
specify that the :guilabel:`Source for agents to download MongoDB binaries`
is :guilabel:`local`. To learn more, see the **Local Mode** instructions in
:ref:`Configure MongoDB Agent to Use Local Downloads <config-local-mode>`.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Community for Windows with |tls| Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem| supports MongoDB Community Edition for Microsoft Windows with
|tls| in the following versions:

- MongoDB versions 3.2.12 or later
- MongoDB versions 3.4.1 or later
- MongoDB release series 3.6, 4.0, and 4.2

To use earlier versions, you must download them from
:dl:`MongoDB <community>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you :ref:`configure an HTTP proxy <use-with-http-proxy>` for |onprem|,
the Backup Daemon, and the MongoDB Agents:

- Consider :ref:`adding sites from which to download the version
  manifest to the firewall allow list
  <allow-list-sites-for-version-manifest>`.

- :ref:`Exclude internal hosts from the proxy <non-proxy-hosts-ops-manager>`.

Install MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan on running
:product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>` on Linux
hosts, then you must manually install a set of dependencies to each
host *before installing MongoDB*. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. To install the
dependencies, see the instructions for the appropriate host platform:

.. include:: /includes/list-links-per-os-for-enterprise-dependencies.rst

Required User Role to Change Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure internet access for |onprem| and {+mdbagent+}s,
you must have :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to
|onprem|.

      .. _om-determine-binaries:

      Determine the Binaries to Store Locally and Download
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Use this section to create a list of the binaries that you need 
      to store locally and download.

      MongoDB Server
      ++++++++++++++

      Determine the version of MongoDB Server required for 
      deployments, including the desired operating system, 
      architecture, and Community or Enterprise editions.

      For all MongoDB versions on all :ref:`platforms 
      <ops-manager-operating-system>` that |onprem| supports, MongoDB 
      provides :dl:`Community <community>` and :dl:`Enterprise 
      <enterprise>` installation binaries that it stores as compressed 
      ``.tgz`` archives for all platforms, except Windows, and as 
      ``.zip`` archives for Windows.
      
      For local mode, you must download the ``.tgz`` or ``.zip`` binaries 
      for:

      - Each platform and version that your current and planned
        MongoDB deployments run.

      - Each platform and version along the
        :doc:`upgrade path </tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager>` of
        any existing MongoDB deployments you want to upgrade.

        .. note::

           If you download a binary archive using Microsoft Edge, the
           archive downloads with a ``.gz`` extension instead of a 
           ``.tgz`` extension. Change this file's extension to ``.tgz`` 
           before you continue.

      - If you are running backups, you need the MongoDB binary for
        the platform on which the |onprem| :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon 
        </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>`
        runs.

        .. example::

           If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
           on a set of Ubuntu hosts and running |onprem| on Windows,
           you must download and store archived binaries of MongoDB 
           3.6.8 for Ubuntu (``.tgz``) and for Windows (``.zip``).

      - If you are running :doc:`queryable backups 
        </tutorial/query-backup>`, you need the Enterprise edition of 
        the MongoDB version that your deployment runs.

        .. example::

           If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
           on a set of Ubuntu hosts and want to query backups from
           an |onprem| install on Windows, you must download and store
           archived binaries of MongoDB Community 3.6.8 for Ubuntu 
           (``.tgz``) and MongoDB Enterprise 3.6.8 Windows (``.zip``).

      MongoDB Database Tools
      ++++++++++++++++++++++

      Determine the version of MongoDB Tools that your |onprem| version
      requires. Check the :ref:`mms-changelog` to see what MongoDB 
      Tools version your |onprem| version requires. During |onprem| 
      upgrades, ensure you have the latest version that your new 
      version of |onprem| requires.

      For each platform and version that you need to support, 
      you must download the :dl:`MongoDB Database Tools 
      <database-tools>` in the ``.tgz`` format into the 
      :setting:`Versions Directory`. These tools include 
      :dbtools:`mongodump </mongodump>` and :dbtools:`mongorestore 
      </mongorestore>`.

      .. note::

         .. include:: /includes/install/db-tools-separate-from-server.rst

         .. include:: /includes/install/use-agent-install-binaries.rst

      MongoDB Shell
      +++++++++++++

      If you have |onprem| 7.0.5 or later, you can optionally download 
      {+mongosh+}. Determine the {+mongosh+} version that your |onprem| 
      version uses. Check the :ref:`mms-changelog` to see what 
      {+mongosh+} version your |onprem| version uses. During 
      |onprem| upgrades, ensure you have the latest version that your 
      new version of |onprem| uses.
