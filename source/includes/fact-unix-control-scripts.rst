The packages include various :term:`control scripts <control script>`,
including the init script ``/etc/rc.d/init.d/mongodb``. These packages
configure MongoDB using the ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` file in conjunction
with the control scripts.

As of version |release|, there are no control scripts for
:program:`mongos`. :program:`mongos` is only used in :doc:`sharding
deployments </core/sharding>`. You can use the ``mongod`` init script
to derive your own :program:`mongos` control script.
