.. method:: cursor.close()


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongo-shell-method.rst


   Instructs the server to close a :ref:`cursor <read-operations-cursors>`
   and free associated server resources. The server will automatically close
   cursors that have no remaining results, as well as cursors that have been
   idle for a period of time and lack the :method:`cursor.noCursorTimeout()`
   option.

   The :method:`~cursor.close()` method has the following
   prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find(<query>).close()
