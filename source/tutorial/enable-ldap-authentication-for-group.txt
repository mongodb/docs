`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_
supports proxying authentication requests to a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-ldap.rst

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Enterprise supports simple and SASL binding to Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers via ``saslauthd`` and operating system
libraries:

- MongoDB Enterprise for Linux can bind to an LDAP server either via
  ``saslauthd`` or starting in MongoDB 3.4, via the operating system
  libraries.

- Starting in MongoDB version 3.4, MongoDB Enterprise for Windows can
  bind to an LDAP server via the operating system libraries.

The :manual:`LDAP Proxy Authentication </core/security-ldap>` and
:manual:`LDAP Authorization <core/security-ldap-external>` sections in
the MongoDB manual provide more information about LDAP and MongoDB.
Setting up LDAP and SASL is beyond the scope of this document.

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable LDAP
authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or Backup
agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure them to
use LDAP. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap` for instructions.
