You can configure :ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` instances at startup 
by using :ref:`command line options <c2c-cli-options>` or a configuration file.
The configuration file specifies values for settings that are
the equivalent of ``mongosync`` command line options.

During a migration, you can reconfigure certain ``mongosync`` settings by following the 
steps in  :ref:`c2c-reconfigure-mid-migration`. 

.. _c2c-configuration-file: 

Configuration File
------------------

You can write most ``mongosync`` 
:ref:`command line options <c2c-cli-options>` to a YAML file. The 
configuration file specifies values for each setting using YAML format. 

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster0: "mongodb://192.0.2.10:27017"
   cluster1: "mongodb://192.0.2.20:27017"
   logPath: "/var/log/mongosync"
   verbosity: "WARN"

To use a configuration file, start ``mongosync`` with the
:option:`--config` option to set the path to the file:

.. code-block:: console

   mongosync --config <configPath>

Settings
~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following ``mongosync`` settings using a configuration file. 

To configure ``mongosync`` from the command line, see :ref:`c2c-cli-options`. 

.. note::

   The ``start`` command provides additional options for features like
   ``reversibility`` and ``user write blocking``. For more details, see
   the :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` API documentation.

.. _c2c-reconfigure-mid-migration: 

Reconfigure ``mongosync`` During Synchronization
------------------------------------------------

.. important:: 

   Only the following settings can be adjusted during a migration. 
   Other settings **must** remain unchanged between ``mongosync`` restarts.

While ``mongosync`` is syncing, you can reconfigure the :option:`--config`, :option:`--disableTelemetry`,
:option:`--loadLevel`, :option:`--logPath`, :option:`--port`, and :option:`--verbosity` options 
by performing the following steps: 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: (Optional) Pause the ``mongosync`` processes
   
      Run :ref:`c2c-api-pause` on each running ``mongosync`` process.
      
      You can resume the ``mongosync`` processes later from the paused
      state, as shown in the final step.
      
      .. tip::

         If you don't want to immediately resume data synchronization
         operations after reconfiguration, consider pausing the
         ``mongosync`` processes. This is useful if you're coordinating
         operations from multiple ``mongosync`` processes.
      
   .. step:: Stop the ``mongosync`` processes 

      Use your operating system to stop each running ``mongosync`` process. 
      For the specific steps, see your operating system documentation.
   
   .. step:: (Optional) Update your configuration file

      If you used the :option:`--config` option to set the path to a configuration file 
      when you first initialized ``mongosync``, update this configuration file with the new value for each setting.

   .. step:: Initialize the ``mongosync`` processes

      If you updated a configuration file in the last step, initialize 
      the ``mongosync`` processes with the :option:`--config` option 
      set to the path of the updated configuration file:
      
      .. code-block:: console

         mongosync --config <configPath>

      If you did  *not*  use the :option:`--config` option when you first initialized ``mongosync``, 
      initialize the ``mongosync`` processes with the command line options set to their updated values:

      .. code-block:: console

         mongosync \
               --cluster0 "<cluster0_connection_string>" \
               --cluster1 "<cluster1_connection_string>" \
               --loadLevel <newLevel> 

      For more information, see :ref:`Initialize mongosync <c2c-initialize>`.

   .. step:: Start or Resume the ``mongosync`` processes 

      If you paused any ``mongosync`` processes earlier in the optional first step, 
      run :ref:`c2c-api-resume` on the paused ``mongosync`` processes.

      If you stopped any ``mongosync`` processes without using :ref:`c2c-api-pause`, 
      run :ref:`c2c-api-start` on the stopped ``mongosync`` processes. 
      For more detailed instructions, see :ref:`c2c-quickstart-synchronize`. 

      ``mongosync`` resumes the sync roughly where it was before you stopped the earlier proceses.
      Any partitions that were in progress at the time of termination will restart from the beginning.
