You can view and customize |service| policies for regularly scheduled,
automated backups.

To take backup snapshots outside your schedule, see 
:ref:`Take On Demand Snapshots <on-demand-snapshots>`

Required Access
---------------

To view backup policies, you must have :authrole:`Project Read Only` 
access to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner`` 
to the project before they can view backup policies.

To modify or delete backup policies, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` 
access to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner`` 
to the project before they can modify or delete backup policies.

      Use the Backup Policy Editor to configure a backup policy for 
      {+Cloud-Backup+}s.

      1. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of 
         |service|.
   
      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Backup Policy`.

A backup policy has the following sections:

- A time of day, in |utc|, at which to create snapshots.

- A frequency interval and duration of retention.

- If |pit| Restores are enabled, a |pit| window that allows you
  to restore to any point in time in the last X days where X is the window.

.. example::

   The default backup policy specifies a snapshot time of ``18:00``
   |utc| and the following four policy items:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 15 15 20 30 20
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Policy Type
        - Tier
        - {+PIT-Restore+}
        - Snapshot Taken
        - Snapshot Retained

      * - Hourly
        - |nvme|
        - Enabled
        - Every 12 hours
        - 2 days

      * - Hourly
        - non-|nvme|
        - Enabled
        - Every 6 hours
        - 2 days

      * - Daily
        - All
        - Either
        - Every day
        - 7 days

      * - Weekly

        - Either
        - Every Saturday
        - 4 weeks

      * - Monthly
        - All
        - Either
        - Last day of the month
        - 12 months

      * - Yearly
        - All
        - Either
        - Every 1st of December
        - 1 year

To learn more about {+Cloud-Backup+} billing, see
:ref:`billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots`.

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, you 
   can't modify the :ref:`backup policy <configure-backup-policy>` for 
   an individual {+cluster+} below the minimum requirements set in the 
   {+bcp+}. You can modify the {+cluster+}-level backup policy at any 
   time. |service| augments any preexisting {+cluster+}-level policies 
   to meet the minimum requirements of the {+bcp+}. All new 
   {+clusters+} use the {+bcp+}. If you reduce the frequency of a 
   backup schedule, the change applies only to future backups. Any 
   existing :term:`oplog` remains for the original window. The minimum 
   requirements of the {+bcp+} apply. You can 
   :ref:`configure extra snapshot retention 
   <config-extra-snapshot-retention>`. You can also view backup details 
   for all ``M10+`` {+dedicated-clusters+} including deleted 
   {+clusters+} with retained snapshots. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`backup-retained-snapshots`.

Change the Backup Policy Time
-----------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-backups-schedule-delete-and-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To modify the backup policy time:

      1. In the :guilabel:`Backup Policy Editor`, select the hour 
         which |service| takes a snapshot each day from :guilabel:`hr`
         beneath :guilabel:`Snapshot Time (UTC)`.

      2. Select the number of minutes after :guilabel:`hr` at which 
         |service| takes a snapshot from :guilabel:`min` beneath
         :guilabel:`Snapshot Time (UTC)`.

      3. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. _creating-backup-policy:

Configure Your Backup Policy
----------------------------

Each row in the :guilabel:`Backup Policy Frequency and Retention` table
represents a backup policy item. Configure the policy items and,
optionally, add new policy items to configure a new backup policy. See 
the :ref:`retention considerations <snapshot-retention>` before 
finalizing your backup policy.

.. tip::

   |service| displays the estimated number of snapshots
   associated with your changes below the
   :guilabel:`Backup Policy Frequency and Retention` table.

To specify a backup policy item using the {+atlas-ui+}:

1. Select the frequency unit from :guilabel:`Frequency Unit` for a
   policy item.

   Alternatively, click :guilabel:`Add Frequency Unit` to add a new
   policy item to your backup policy. You can't specify multiple 
   :guilabel:`Hourly` or :guilabel:`Daily` backup policy items.

   .. note::

      If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`,
      only MongoDB support can delete :ref:`policy items 
      <creating-backup-policy>` specified in the 
      {+bcp+}. To delete policy items specified in the {+bcp+}, you 
      must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an 
      extensive verification process.

2. Select the frequency for the frequency unit from :guilabel:`Every`.

3. Specify the retention time for the policy item in
   :guilabel:`Retention Time` and the units for the retention time from
   the list to the right. To learn more, see :ref:`snapshot-retention`.

4. (Optional) To apply the retention changes in the updated backup
   policy to snapshots that |service| took previously, check
   :guilabel:`Apply policy retention changes to existing snapshots`.

   .. note::

      This option affects only snapshots created by the updated policy
      items and whose retention has not been updated individually with
      the
      :oas-atlas-op:`Update Cloud Backup Schedule for One Cluster 
      </updateBackupSchedule>` API call.

5. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. _create-pit-policy:

Configure the Restore Window
----------------------------

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, only 
   MongoDB support can reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window 
   <create-pit-policy>`. To reduce the {+PIT-Restore+} 
   :guilabel:`Restore Window`, the security or legal representative specified for the 
   {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete 
   an extensive verification process.

You can replay the :term:`oplog` to restore a cluster from any point in 
time within a specified restore window.

To specify the restore window duration, select how long you want
|service| to retain the oplog for point-in-time restores from
the :guilabel:`Restore Window` list.

You can't configure a restore window that is longer than the 
:ref:`Hourly Snapshot Retention Time <creating-backup-policy>`.

.. important::

   If you disable {+Cloud-Backup+}s for a cluster or terminate a
   cluster that had snapshots enabled, |service| immediately
   deletes the backup snapshots for that {+cluster+} unless the
   :guilabel:`Keep existing snapshots after termination` option is 
   enabled. To learn more, see :ref:`terminate-cluster`. For 
   {+clusters+} not using :ref:`security-kms-encryption` you can 
   :ref:`download the latest snapshot 
   <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>` to preserve any data
   stored in the {+cluster+}.

.. _config-extra-snapshot-retention:

Configure Extra Snapshot Retention
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-bcp-extra-snapshot-retention.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`backup-compliance-policy`.

To specify extra snapshot retention using the {+atlas-ui+}:

1. In the :guilabel:`Extra Snapshot Retention` section, select the 
   frequency unit from the :guilabel:`Frequency Unit` dropdown.

   Alternatively, click :guilabel:`Add Frequency Unit` to add extra 
   snapshot retention for another frequency unit.

#. Specify the extra snapshot retention time for each frequency unit.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. _snapshot-retention:

Snapshot Retention Considerations
---------------------------------

In addition to the :guilabel:`Retention Time` you define for each 
{+Cloud-Backup+} frequency unit, be aware of the following:

- If you delete an existing backup frequency unit, the snapshots for
  which you specified that frequency remain intact until they expire or
  you delete them.
- |service| requires the following: 

  - The retention time must be equal to or longer than the frequency
    unit. For example, the retention time for weekly snapshot must be
    one week or greater.
  - The value specified for :guilabel:`Retention Time` for items that
    are less frequent must be equal to or larger than the value
    specified for items that are more frequent. For example, if the
    hourly policy item specifies a retention of two weeks, the retention
    for the weekly snapshot must be two weeks or  greater. 
 
- If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, 
  you can't decrease the retention time for a snapshot after 
  it's taken.
