Manage Namespace Metadata Catalog for Wildcard Collections
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The {+data-lake+} namespace catalog contains namespace metadata 
(such as databases, collections, and partitions) for each wildcard (``*``) 
collection in each {+data-lake-store+} in the {+data-lake-short+} storage 
configuration. For commands and queries on wildcard collections, 
{+data-lake+} returns the data from the catalog or returns an error if the 
{+data-lake-store+} does not exist. 

When objects that are included in a wildcard collection specification are 
modified in your |s3| bucket, the catalog must be updated for you to see 
the changes when you run ``list`` commands against wildcard collections.
By default, the catalog is refreshed every hour for all active 
{+data-lake-short+}\s. In addition, the namespace metadata catalog is 
refreshed in the background when you: 

- :ref:`Update the storage configuration <datalake-setstorageconfig>`. 
- Run the ``show collections`` command.
- Query a collection.
- Run the :ref:`updateCatalog-cmd` command.

You can determine when the catalog was last updated by using the 
:ref:`catalogInfo-cmd` command and can manually update the catalog 
by using the :ref:`updateCatalog-cmd` command. You must have the 
:atlas:`atlasAdmin <security-add-mongodb-users/#atlasAdmin>` role 
to update the catalog.
