The following tutorial guides you through launching |charts-short| on
MongoDB Cloud.

Prerequisites
-------------

|charts| is accessible through MongoDB |service|. You will need a
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas user account </tutorial/manage-users/>`
to complete this procedure. To learn more about creating an |service|
user, see the |service| :atlas:`Getting Started </getting-started/>` documentation.

You will also need an |service| cluster to visualize data using
|charts-short|. The steps on this page guide you through creating an
|service| cluster.

.. note::

   Each instance of the |charts| application is tied to a single
   |service| :atlas:`project </tutorial/manage-projects/>`,
   and can only visualize data from |service| clusters within the same
   project.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access |charts|, your :atlas:`Atlas user </tutorial/manage-users/>`
must have appropriate permissions to read data from the clusters
in your |service| project. This means that your |service| user
can have any
:atlas:`Project Role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`
except ``Project Read Only``, which does not grant the appropriate
permissions.

When you first register an |service| account, you are granted
the ``Project Owner`` role on your initial project. For information
on configuring additional users and roles, see
:atlas:`Atlas Access </tutorial/manage-users/>` in the
|service| documentation.

Procedure

Moving Forward
--------------

Now that you have configured a data source, you are ready to begin
visualizing your data. The next steps are to
:doc:`create a dashboard </dashboards>`, and then
:doc:`build charts </build-charts>` to populate your dashboard.

For complete walkthroughs of |charts| and its features, including
downloadable data sets to visualize, see the following
:doc:`Tutorials </tutorials>`.

Delete Your MongoDB Charts Instance
-----------------------------------

.. important::

   Deleting a |charts| instance deletes all data associated with
   that instance including dashboards, data sources, and metadata. Once
   the |charts| instance is deleted, this data cannot be recovered.

If you are an |service| :authrole:`Project Owner`, you can deactivate
and delete a |charts| instance linked to your |service| project from
your |service|
:atlas:`Project Settings </tutorial/manage-project-settings>`.

If you delete your linked |charts| instance, you can create a new
|charts| instance for your project at any time. The newly created
instance does not retain any data from previously deleted instances.
