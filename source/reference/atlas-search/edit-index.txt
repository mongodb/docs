==========================
Edit an Atlas Search Index
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/atlas-search-api-note.rst

You can change the :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`
of an existing |fts| index. You cannot rename an index; if you need to
change an index's name, you must create a new index and delete the old
one.

.. note::

   When you change the index definition of an |fts| index, the index
   must rebuild. You should avoid running queries against an |fts|
   index while it is building, as they may return incomplete results.

   To rebuild an index without downtime:
   
   1. Create a copy of the index with a new name and the desired
      configuration.
   #. Update your queries to use the new index.
   #. Delete the old index.
