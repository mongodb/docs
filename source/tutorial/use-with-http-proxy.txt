In restricted network environments, you can configure |onprem| to use a
proxy to make outbound network requests. You would use a proxy to fetch
files from MongoDB, including agents, MongoDB server binaries and  the
|onprem| :term:`version manifest` or to contact any third-party
integrated services you have enabled.

.. topic:: Add Whitelist of Sites for Internet-based Version Manifest Source

   Include the following :abbr:`URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)` in
   your proxy whitelist when your :guilabel:`Version Manifest Source` is
   set to :guilabel:`Internet`. |onprem| needs access to these
   :abbr:`URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)` over :abbr:`HTTPS (Secure
   HyperText Transfer Protocol)` to download agents and MongoDB
   versions:

   .. include:: /includes/list-table-needed-mongodb-sites-over-internet.rst

   .. note::

      The Automation Agent and Backup Daemon need direct access to these
      URLs to download MongoDB server binaries.
