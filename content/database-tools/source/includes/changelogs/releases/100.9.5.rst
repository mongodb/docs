100.9.5 Changelog
-----------------

*Released 2024-06-18*

For this release, we have updated many of our third-party dependencies, 
as well as adding third-party dependency vulnerability scanning, static 
analysis, and other tooling to comply with MongoDB's Software Security 
Development Lifecycle initiative. Notably, all releases now ship with 
a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Look for a file ending with 
``.cdx.json`` in the archive. For OS packages, this file should be 
installed in an appropriate location for each package, such as 
``/usr/share/docs`` for deb packages.
