For  MongoDB 4.0.9+ Enterprise binaries linked against ``libldap`` (such
as when running on RHEL), access to the ``libldap`` is synchronized,
incurring some performance/latency costs.

For MongoDB 4.0.9+ Enterprise binaries linked against
``libldap_r``, there is no change in behavior from earlier MongoDB
versions.
