"The default chunk size for a sharded cluster is 64 megabytes. This "
"default chunk size works well for most deployments; however, if you "
"notice that automatic migrations have more I/O than your hardware can "
"handle, you may want to reduce the chunk size. For automatic splits and "
"migrations, a small chunk size leads to more rapid and frequent "
"migrations. The allowed range of the chunk size is between 1 and 1024 "
