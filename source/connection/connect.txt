In this guide, you can learn how to connect to a 
`MongoDB Atlas deployment <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas>`__, 
a MongoDB instance, or a replica set using the {+driver-short+}.

You can view sample code to :ref:`connect to an Atlas cluster <connect-atlas-java-driver>`
or continue reading to learn more about the ``MongoClient`` class and
connection URIs.

.. _mongoclient:

MongoClient
-----------

You can connect to and communicate with MongoDB using the ``MongoClient``
class.

Use the ``MongoClients.create()`` method to construct a ``MongoClient``.

.. important:: Reuse Your Client
 
   As each ``MongoClient`` represents a thread-safe pool of connections to the
   database, most applications only require a single instance of a
   ``MongoClient``, even across multiple threads. 
   All resource usage limits, such as max connections, apply to individual
   ``MongoClient`` instances.

To learn about the different settings you can use to control the
behavior of your ``MongoClient``, see the guide on
:ref:`MongoClient Settings <specify-mongoclient-settings>`.

.. tip::

   Always call ``MongoClient.close()`` to clean up resources when an
   instance is no longer needed.

.. _connection-uri:

Connection URI
--------------

The **connection URI** provides a set of instructions that the driver uses to
connect to a MongoDB deployment. It instructs the driver on how it should
connect to MongoDB and how it should behave while connected. The following
figure explains each part of a sample connection URI:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/dns_seedlist_connection_string_parts.png
   :alt: An example of a connection string that demonstrates the protocol, credentials, hostname or IP, port, and connection options

In this example, you connect to an Atlas MongoDB deployment that has a
DNS SRV record. For more details, see the :manual:`DNS Seed List
Connection Format
</reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`
documentation. This format offers flexibility in deployment and the
ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients.

.. note::

   If your deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, see the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection?jmp=docs_driver_java>`
   and select Java from the language dropdown to retrieve your connection
   string.

If you are connecting to an instance or replica set that does not have a 
DNS SRV address, you must use ``mongodb`` for the protocol, which specifies 
the :manual:`Standard Connection String Format 
</reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-standard-connection-string-format>`.

After the protocol, the connection string contains your
credentials if you are using a password-based authentication mechanism.
Replace the value of ``user`` with your username and ``pass`` with your
password. If your authentication mechanism does not require credentials,
omit this part of the connection URI.

The next part of the connection URI specifies the hostname or IP
address, followed by the port of your MongoDB instance. In the example,
``sample.host`` represents the hostname and ``27017`` is the port number.
Replace these values to refer to your MongoDB instance.

The last part of the connection URI contains connection options as parameters.
In the example, you set two connection options: ``maxPoolSize=20`` and
``w=majority``. For more information about connection options, skip to the
:ref:`connection-options` section of this guide.

Atlas Connection Example
------------------------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, create a client. You can
create a client that uses your connection string and other 
client options by passing a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to the
``MongoClients.create()`` method.

To instantiate a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, use the builder method to specify
your connection string and any other client options, and then call the ``build()``
method. Chain the ``applyConnectionString()`` method to the builder to specify your
connection URI.

You can set the {+stable-api+} version client option to avoid
breaking changes when you upgrade to a new version of {+mdb-server+}. To 
learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`{+stable-api+} page
<stable-api-java>`.

The following code shows how you can specify the connection string and
the {+stable-api+} client option when connecting to a MongoDB
deployment on Atlas and verify that the connection is successful:

Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB
--------------------------------

If you are connecting to a single MongoDB deployment or replica set
that is not hosted on Atlas, see the following sections to find out how to
connect.

.. _connect-local-java-driver:

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment on Your Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your deployment, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-java-driver>` code
example and run it.

.. _connect-replica-set:

Connect to a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that
store the same set of data. This configuration of instances provides data
redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostnames (or IP
addresses) and port numbers of the members of the replica set. 

If you are not able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set,
you can specify a single or subset of the hosts in the replica and
instruct the driver to perform automatic discovery in one of the following
ways:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet``
  parameter
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter
- Specify more than one host in the replica set

.. tip::

   Although you can specify a subset of the hosts in a replica set,
   include all the hosts in the replica set to ensure the driver is able to 
   establish the connection if one of the hosts are unreachable.
   
.. _mongo-client-settings-multiple-hosts:

The following examples show how to specify multiple hosts to a ``MongoClient``
instance using either the ``ConnectionString`` or ``MongoClientSettings`` 
class. Select the tab that corresponds to your preferred class.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ConnectionString
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. code-block:: java

         ConnectionString connectionString = new ConnectionString("mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017");
         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString);

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      .. code-block:: java

         ServerAddress seed1 = new ServerAddress("host1", 27017);
         ServerAddress seed2 = new ServerAddress("host2", 27017);
         ServerAddress seed3 = new ServerAddress("host3", 27017);
         MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
                 .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->
                        builder.hosts(Arrays.asList(seed1, seed2, seed3)))
                 .build();
         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(settings);

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This section answers questions that may arise when
connecting to MongoDB.

Why are there two types of ``MongoClient`` in the Java driver?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of ``MongoClient`` because we wanted a cleaner API
for new users that didn't have the confusion of including multiple CRUD
Frequently AsAPIs. We wanted to ensure that the new CRUD API was available in a Java
package structure that would work well with Java module support
introduced in Java 9.

Which type of ``MongoClient`` should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New applications generally use the ``com.mongodb.client.MongoClient`` interface,
which supports the following features:

- Configuration with ``MongoClientSettings`` and ``ConnectionString``.  You can create
  instances of this interface by using factory methods defined in the ``com.mongodb.client.MongoClients``
  class.
- Access to the CRUD API by using ``MongoDatabase``, and from there, ``MongoCollection``.

Use the ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` class if you require support for the legacy API, which supports
the following features:

- Configuration by using ``MongoClientOptions`` and ``MongoClientURI``.
- Access to the CRUD API by using ``DB``, and from there, ``DBCollection``.  You can access this API
  by using the ``getDB()`` method.

For applications that require a mix of the new and legacy APIs, ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` also supports
the following features:

- Configuration by using ``MongoClientSettings`` and ``ConnectionString``, the only difference
  being that you create instances via constructors instead of a factory class.
- Access to the CRUD API using ``MongoDatabase``, and from there, ``MongoCollection``.  You can access this
  API by using the ``getDatabase()`` method.

How do I prevent the "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/mongodb/MongoClient" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might encounter a ``java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`` exception when your
Java runtime environment cannot locate a class file at runtime. When you
attempt to run application code that uses the {+driver-long+}, you must include
the appropriate driver JAR files on the classpath.

If you receive this error after adding the {+driver-short+} JAR files to
your classpath, check the following items in your environment:

- The JAR files exist in the locations specified by the classpath.
- The classpath syntax is correct.
- If you define the classpath in an environment variable, the Java runtime
  environment uses that variable.
- If you use a dependency manager, it does not report any unresolvable conflicts.

.. tip::

   This error contains the package and class name, which can help you identify
   which driver JAR might be missing from your classpath. To locate the
   driver JAR that the error refers to, check each of the entries in the
   :ref:`API documentation <java-api-landing>`.

How do I prevent the "com.mongodb.MongoSecurityException" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might throw this exception if you specify invalid or
incorrectly formatted credentials when connecting to a MongoDB deployment.

If you receive this error when you attempt to connect to a MongoDB deployment,
check the following items in your code:

- The connection URI corresponds to the correct MongoDB deployment.
  To learn more about setting your connection URI, see :ref:`connection-uri`.

- The credentials for the authentication mechanism that you specified are
  correct. To learn how to specify your credentials, see the
  :ref:`authentication-mechanisms` and :ref:`enterprise-authentication-mechanisms`
  guides.

- The name of the authentication database that you specified is correct. To
  learn how to set up the users and roles for your MongoDB deployment, see
  `Manage Users and Roles <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles/>`__
  in the Server documentation.

How do I prevent the "IllegalStateException: state should be: open" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might encounter this exception if you call an operation on a ``MongoClient``
instance that closed its connections to MongoDB. Once the ``close()`` method
is called on the ``MongoClient``, any further operation calls on that instance
throw this exception.

To avoid this exception, do not call operations on ``MongoClient`` instance
after any code that calls ``close()`` on it.

.. tip::

   The code that closes the ``MongoClient`` instance might be difficult to
   locate in certain cases. To locate potential sources of this exception,
   search for the following cases:

   - Calls to ``close()`` on a ``MongoClient`` instance
   - Operation calls on a ``MongoClient`` instance that are outside the scope
     of the try-with-resources statement in which the ``MongoClient`` is
     declared

   If your application uses a framework to manage the ``MongoClient``
   such as Spring Boot, check the documentation of the framework to locate the
   best practices for managing the connection behavior.

   To learn more about accessing MongoDB from Spring Boot, see
   `Spring Boot and MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/spring-boot>`__.
