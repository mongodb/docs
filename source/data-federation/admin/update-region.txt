Update a {+FDI+} Region
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. meta::
   :keywords: {+df+} Region

You can change the |aws| region through which your {+fdi+} requests are 
routed. By default, {+df+} requests are routed through the region that 
is closest to your client application. The region that is closest to 
your application may be different from the regions that house your data 
stores.

.. note::

   If you change the |aws| region through which your {+fdi+} requests 
   are routed, you must update your {+fdi+} connection string with the 
   new hostname. This change ensures that your requests are routed 
   through the new region.

Procedure
---------

To change the |aws| region through which your {+fdi+} requests are 
routed, do the following in the |service| UI:
