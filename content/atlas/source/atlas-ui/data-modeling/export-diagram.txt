You can share your refactored data model with other teams to receive feedback 
and align on final schema design decisions. To share your refactored schema, you 
can export your |erd| from |service|. 

You can export your |erd| as a: 

- :guilabel:`Diagram File`.
- :guilabel:`PNG` image.
- :guilabel:`JSON` file. 

When you export your |erd| as a :guilabel:`Diagram File`, |service| 
exports it as a ``.mdm`` file. This file format allows you to 
import the |erd| into |service| and share it with collaborators in the 
:ref:`Compass <compass-data-modeling>` or |service| data modeling experience.

When you export your |erd| as a PNG image, |service| 
exports the collections and their relationships as they appear in the 
:guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab. This format helps you share a visual 
representation of your schema in documentation or presentations.

When you export your |erd| as a JSON file, it includes: 

- A ``collections`` array with the collection namespaces and their 
  :query:`jsonSchema <$jsonSchema>`. 

- A ``relationships`` array with the namespaces of the related 
  collections and their linked fields.
