Capitalize Proper Nouns and Adjectives
--------------------------------------

Proper nouns and adjectives include the names of people, places,
companies, organizations, products, languages, protocols, and some
technologies, as well as trademarks.

Be aware that some of these names might have nonstandard or no
capitalization. Always follow the capitalization that's used by the
company, shown in a `dictionary 
<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/>`__, or accepted as 
standard in the industry.

   - Boolean
   - Cloud Servers
   - Ethernet
   - Hong Kong
   - Internet
   - lighttpd
   - Linux
   - Microsoft Windows
   - MongoDB
   - OpenStack

  :website:`MongoDB corporate website </>`.

- Some commonly used third-party names, see
  :ref:`third-party-names-and-trademarks`.

Capitalize Most Abbreviations
-----------------------------

Most abbreviated forms of terms use all capitals, although exceptions
exist. Also, be aware that the corresponding spelled-out terms of
abbreviations are often not capitalized. When in doubt about the
capitalization of an abbreviation or its spelled-out term, consult a
dictionary, industry style guide, reputable website, or editor.
Following are some examples.

Capitalize Job Titles when Used as Titles
-----------------------------------------

Within MongoDB technical documentation, use the following rules for
capitalization in job titles:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1


   * - Use case
     - Examples

   * - If you’re referring to a job role in general, don’t use initial
       capitals.
     - All support technicians will be allocated an account manager and
       a career coach.

   * - Don’t use initial capitals where the title is being used as a
       description.
     -
       - The chief executive is Jane Brown and the associate director
         is Paul Woods.

       - We have a new information developer.

       - I’ll need to ask our sales director.

       - I work as a software architect.

   * - Use initial capitals where the term is serving as an actual
       title with the name of a person: just as you would on a
       business card or email signature.
     -
       - Chief Executive Jane Brown and Paul Woods, Associate Director,
         were both late.

       - Attendee list:

         - Anna Collins, Editorial Director;
         - Shazeen Iqbal, Chief Financial Officer;
         - Pope Francis

Watch for Capitonyms
--------------------

Some words have a different meaning depending on how they are
capitalized. Make sure that you don't change the meaning of a word with
an incorrect capitalization:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - FTP
         File Transfer Protocol
     - ftp
         Command-line FTP client
   * - KBps
         Kilobytes per second
     - Kbps
         Kilobits per second
   * - May
         Fifth month of the year
     - may
         Modal verb
   * - REST
         Representational State Transfer
     - rest
         State of motionlessness or inactivity

Capitalize Team Names
---------------------

When you use team names in technical documents, use initial capitals as
shown in the following table:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Examples of initial capitals in team names

   * - The Support team handles making the change for you.

   * - Contact your Account Management team can tell you what the
       charge will be.

   * - The Documentation team is amazing!

   * - Contact Information Development <add email link> for
       instructions.

Capitalize UI Labels as shown on the UI
---------------------------------------

When you're documenting part of the interface within a procedure or
other type of article or topic, match the capitalization used on the
interface.

When you use terms from the interface as common nouns, don't capitalize
the terms.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use

   * - Click the action cog to the left of the cluster name and select
       **Edit Cluster**.

   * - From the Atlas console, you can rename a cluster.

.. important::

   As an exception, any UI element that appears in all capitals should
   be initial capitalized in the documentation. It reads as shouting at
   the user otherwise.

Capitalize the Names of Product Components as Appropriate
---------------------------------------------------------

Follow the capitalization of major component names that Marketing,
Legal, and the product teams have established.

Be wary of overcapitalization of product terms as not every feature or
object in a product is a proper noun.

.. example::

   - Atlas enables users to create a *cluster*, not a *Cluster*.

   - When the user creates a cluster, the user specifies a *cloud
     provider*, *tier*, and *region*, not a *Cloud Provider*, *Tier*,
     and *Region*.

   - A user can create a *load balancer*, not a *Load Balancer*.

Many terms that might be capitalized in the UI aren't
capitalized when used as common nouns. When in doubt, consult an
existing style sheet, an editor, or the product team.

.. note:: Product teams sometimes tend to overcapitalize terms.

Follow these tips to help you determine whether a noun should be
capitalized:

-  Generally, if you can have more than one of something, it's a common
   noun and therefore not capitalized.
-  When a common noun follows the name of a product or component,
   generally that noun isn't capitalized.
-  When you refer generally to a component, you can use lowercase (as
   in the utility or the agent).

.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Examples

   * - Zipit Backup Utility

   * - Rate Limiting component

   * - Identity service

   * - servers

   * - backups

   * - containers

   * - authentication

Don't Capitalize Common Nouns
-----------------------------

Most of the time, you can determine whether a noun is proper or common.
Sometimes you might capitalize product-specific terms even when they're
really just being used as common nouns. A common noun denotes a whole
class of something (*servers*) or a random member of a class (*a
server*). As a general rule, if you can have more than one of
something, it's a common noun and therefore not capitalized.

.. list-table::

     - Don't use

   * - You can submit up to 10 messages in a single request, but you

       and groups.
     - Repose Authentication provides caching for User Tokens, Roles,
       and Groups.

Don't Use All Capitals for Emphasis
-----------------------------------

To emphasize a term, show it in italics. To emphasize an important
piece of information, consider setting it apart structurally, perhaps
as a note.
