Time Series Collection Limitations

:ref:`Time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>` generally
behave like regular collections with several limitations.

Unsupported Features
---------------------

MongoDB does not support the following features with time series collections:

* :atlas:`{+fts+} </atlas-search>`
* :ref:`Change streams <changeStreams>`
* :ref:`{+csfle+} <manual-csfle-feature>`
* :atlas:`Database Triggers </atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers>`
* :ref:`Schema validation rules <schema-validation-overview>`
* :dbcommand:`reIndex`
* :dbcommand:`renameCollection`

.. sharedinclude:: cet/atlas/asp-limitations.rst

Aggregation $merge
------------------

You cannot use the :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation stage to add data from
another collection to a time series collection. Use the :pipeline:`$out`
aggregation stage to write documents to a time series collection. 

You can use :pipeline:`$merge` to move data from a time series
collection to another collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-doc-size:

Document Size
-------------

The maximum size for documents within a time series collection is 4 MB.


Extended Date Range
-------------------

If your time series collection contains  documents with ``timeField``
timestamps before ``1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`` or after
``2038-01-19T03:14:07.000Z``, create an index on the ``timeField`` to
optimize queries.  

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates:

Updates
-------

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-update-limitations.rst

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

Indexes
-------

Default Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB does not create an index on the ``_id`` field when you create a time
series collection. This differs from regular collections which have an index on
the ``_id`` field by default. Commands that specify a hint on the ``_id`` field
on time series collections return an error unless you manually create an index
on the ``_id`` field. 

Hint on "_id_" Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.3, creating an index with the name of ``"_id_"`` or
specifying a hint of ``"_id_"`` on time series collections returns an error. 

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Time Series Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB partially supports the following indexes on time series collections:

- You can only create :ref:`multikey indexes <index-type-multikey>` on the ``metaField``.
- You can only create :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>` on the ``metaField``. 
- You can only create :ref:`sparse indexes <index-type-sparse>` on the ``metaField``.

MongoDB doesn't support the following index types on time series collections:

- :ref:`Text indexes <index-type-text>`
- :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>`

.. include:: /includes/time-series-secondary-indexes-downgrade-FCV.rst

Capped Collections
------------------

You cannot create a time series collection as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
-------------------------------

You can only set the collection type when you create a collection:

- You cannot convert an existing collection into a time series collection.
- You cannot convert a time series collection into a different collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
-----------------------------------------------

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when you create the collection. You cannot modify these
parameters later.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Granularity
-----------

Bucket Size
~~~~~~~~~~~
For any configuration of granularity parameters, the maximum
size of a bucket is 1000 measurements or 125KB of data,
whichever is lower. MongoDB may also enforce a lower maximum size for 
high cardinality data with many unique values, so that the working set 
of buckets fits within the :ref:`WiredTiger cache <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Modifying Bucket Parameters
```````````````````````````

Once you set a collection's ``granularity`` or the custom bucketing
parameters ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds``, you
can increase the time span covered by a bucket, but not decrease it.
Use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to modify the parameters.

For more information on modifying time series intervals, see 
:ref:`Change Time Series Granularity <change-granularity>`.

.. note::

   ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` must be
   equal. If you modify one parameter, you must also set the other to
   the same value.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
--------

Time series collections are subject to several sharding limitations. 

Sharding Administration Commands 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot run sharding administration commands on sharded time series 
collections. 

Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-shard-key-limitations.rst

.. include:: /includes/time-series/timeseries-timeField-deprecated.rst

Resharding
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/time-series/reshard-timeseries.rst

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-resharding`. 

Zone Sharding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-zone-timeseries-support

Transactions
------------

You cannot write to time series collections in :ref:`transactions
<transactions>`.

.. note::

MongoDB supports reads from time series collections in transactions.

Views
-----

Time series collections are writable non-materialized :ref:`views
<views-landing-page>`. Limitations for views apply to time series
collections.

Snapshot Isolation
------------------

Read operations on time series collections with read concern
``"snapshot"`` guarantee snapshot isolation only in the absence of
concurrent drop or rename operations on collections in the read
operation. Re-creating a time series collection on the same namespace
with different granularity setting does not yield full snapshot
isolation.
