When you create a :ref:`time series collection
<manual-timeseries-collection>`, you can set up automatic removal of
documents older than a specified number of seconds by using the
``expireAfterSeconds`` parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
       "weather24h",
       {
          timeseries: {
             timeField: "timestamp",
             metaField: "metadata",
             granularity: "hours"
          },
          expireAfterSeconds: 86400
       }
   )

The expiration threshold is the ``timeField`` field value plus the
specified number of seconds. Consider the following document in the
``weather24h`` collection:

.. code-block::

   {
      "metadata": {"sensorId": 5578, "type": "temperature"},
      "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T10:00:00.000Z"),
      "temp": 12
   }


The document would expire from the database at
``"2021-05-19T10:00:00.000Z"``. Once all documents in a bucket are
expired, the background task that removes expired buckets removes the
bucket during the next run. See
:ref:`timeseries-collection-delete-operations-timing` for more
information.

Enable Automatic Removal on a Collection
----------------------------------------

To enable automatic removal of documents for an existing :ref:`time
series collection <manual-timeseries-collection>`, issue the following
:dbcommand:`collMod` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      collMod: "weather24h",
      expireAfterSeconds: 604801
   })

Change the ``expireAfterSeconds`` Parameter
-------------------------------------------

To change the ``expireAfterSeconds`` parameter value, issue the following
:dbcommand:`collMod` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      collMod: "weather24h",
      expireAfterSeconds: 604801
   })

Retrieve the Current Value of ``expireAfterSeconds``
----------------------------------------------------

To retrieve the current value of ``expireAfterSeconds``, use the
:dbcommand:`listCollections` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1 } )

The result document contains a document for the time series collection
which contains the ``options.expireAfterSeconds`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
      cursor: {
         id: <number>,
         ns: 'test.$cmd.listCollections',
         firstBatch: [
           {
              name: <string>,
              type: 'timeseries',
              options: {
                 expireAfterSeconds: <number>,
                 timeseries: { ... }
              },
              ...
           },
           ...
         ]
      }
   }

Disable Automatic Removal
-------------------------

To disable automatic removal, use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to
set ``expireAfterSeconds`` to ``off``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
       collMod: "weather24h",
       expireAfterSeconds: "off"
   })

Behavior
--------

.. _timeseries-collection-delete-operations-timing:

Timing of Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB doesn't guarantee that expired data will be deleted immediately
upon expiration. Once all documents in a bucket are expired, the
background task that removes expired buckets removes the bucket during
the next run. The maximum span of time that a single bucket is allowed
to cover is controlled by the ``granularity`` of the time series
collection:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 40 60

  * - ``granularity``

    - Covered Time Span

  * - ``"seconds"`` (default)

    - one hour

  * - ``"minutes"``

    - 24 hours

  * - ``"hours"``

    - 30 days


The background task that removes expired buckets runs every 60 seconds.
Therefore, documents may remain in a collection during the period
between the expiration of the document, the expiration of all other
documents in the bucket and the running of the background task.

Because the duration of the removal operation depends on the workload of
your mongod instance, expired data may exist for some time beyond the 60
second period between runs of the background task.
