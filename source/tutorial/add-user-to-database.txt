========================
Add a User to a Database
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To add a user to a database you must authenticate to that database as a
user with the :authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`
role. If you have not first created a user with one of those roles, do
so as described in :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator`.

When adding a user to multiple databases, you must define the user
*for each database*. See :ref:`password-hashing-security` for
important security information.

To add a user, pass the :method:`db.addUser()` method a well formed
:doc:`privilege document </reference/user-privileges>` that contains the
user's credentials and privileges. The :method:`db.addUser()` method
adds the document to the database's :data:`system.users
<<database>.system.users>` collection.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4 
   .. include:: /includes/fact-change-password.rst
   
   To change a user's password in version
   2.4 or newer, see :doc:`Change a User's Password
   </tutorial/change-user-password>`.

For the structure of a privilege document, see :data:`system.users
<<database>.system.users>`. For descriptions of user roles, see
:doc:`/reference/user-privileges`.

.. example:: The following creates a user named ``Alice`` in the
   ``products`` database and gives her ``readWrite`` and
   ``dbAdmin`` privileges.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use products
      db.addUser( { user: "Alice",
                    pwd: "Moon1234",
                    roles: [ "readWrite", "dbAdmin" ]
                  } )

.. example:: The following creates a user named ``Bob`` in the
   ``admin`` database. The :data:`privilege document
   <<database>.system.users>` uses Bob's credentials from the
   ``products`` database and assigns him ``userAdmin`` privileges.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.addUser( { user: "Bob",
                    userSource: "products",
                    roles: [ "userAdmin" ]
                  } )

.. example:: The following creates a user named ``Carlos`` in the
   ``admin`` database and gives him ``readWrite`` access to the
   ``config`` database, which lets him change certain settings for
   sharded clusters, such as to disable the balancer.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db = db.getSiblingDB('admin')
      db.addUser( { user: "Carlos",
                    pwd: "Moon1234",
                    roles: [ "clusterAdmin" ],
                    otherDBRoles: { config: [ "readWrite" ]
                  } } )

   Only the ``admin`` database supports the
   :data:`~admin.system.users.otherDBRoles` field.
