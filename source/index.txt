|servicegov| is a fully-managed cloud database for the U.S. government 
(federal agencies and state, local, and education (SLED) entities),
developed by the same people that build MongoDB.

|servicegov|, or |servicegov-short|, supports a subset of the commercial
`MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`__ features. To learn 
more, see :ref:`<supported-features>`.

.. important::
   
   |servicegov| is only available for preview by invitation.

Using the |servicegov-short| Documentation
------------------------------------------

This documentation provides tutorials for common tasks, broad 
comparisons between |servicegov-short| features and their commercial 
|service| equivalents, and reference material for features unique to 
|servicegov-short|.

Many procedures and reference materials are identical across 
|servicegov-short| and commercial |service|. In those cases, this 
documentation provides links to the |service| documentation 
for a feature.
**We recommend opening Atlas links in a new browser tab to save your place in the MongoDB CloudGov documentation.**

Links to |service| documentation pages are presented as either:

- Sections titled **See the Atlas Documentation** for important 
  procedures and information, or
- :guilabel:`Tips` for optional, further reading on a topic.
