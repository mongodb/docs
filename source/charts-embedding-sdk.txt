You can embed a chart into a web application with the :ref:`Embedding
SDK <embedding-charts-sdk>`, which allows you to make more flexible 
adjustments to chart settings and rendering.

You can use the embedding SDK to do the following tasks:

- Add pre-filters before building charts
- Add filters dynamically
- Change the size, style, and axes of the chart
- Change the legend position and legend angle
- Change the chart elements, table options and general customization options
- Refresh on demand
- Save a chart as an image
- View chart channels
- Override the number formatting options
- Retrieve the values of your options prior to an override

To embed a chart with the SDK, you need to:

1. Enable embedding for the chart.
#. Allow :ref:`embedded chart filtering <embed-options-filter>` on 
   certain fields by :ref:`specifying filterable fields 
   <specify-filter-fields>`. Don't include fields that may reveal 
   sensitive data.
#. Have the chart ID and base URL strings.
