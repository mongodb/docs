Considerations
--------------

If you use AWS and attempt to provision larger-sized AWS instances, be aware that
Amazon often has a limited number of larger instances in any given region,
which may prevent provisioning.

AWS accounts have restrictions that limit the number of instances you can
deploy. If you reach this limit, you must contact AWS support to raise
this limit.
