This section describes the options that you can use with the
:pipeline:`$search` stage: 

- :ref:`Sort the results <sort-ref>` in ascending or descending order by
  date, number (integer, float, and double), and string values.
- :ref:`Parallelize query execution across segments <concurrent-ref>`
  to improve each individual query latency.
- :ref:`Highlight search terms <highlight-ref>` as they appear in the
  returned documents, along with the adjacent text content (if any).
- :ref:`Retrieve a count<count-ref>` of the |fts| results for your
  query. 
- :ref:`Paginate results sequentially <fts-paginate-results>` to build
  functionality similar to "Next Page" and "Previous Page" in your
  application. 
- :ref:`Track the search terms <fts-tracking-ref>` to view analytics
  information about the search terms in your queries.
- :ref:`Return fields stored<fts-return-stored-source-option>` on 
  ``mongot``.
