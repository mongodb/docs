You can add servers to |mms| in the following ways:

.. only:: cloud

   - Provision them on Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the |mms|
     interface. |mms| provides integration with AWS and lets you deploy
     new EC2 instances directly from |mms| To use EC2 instances for your
     deployments, you must:

     - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`

     - :doc:`/tutorial/provision-aws-servers`

- Provision existing systems and infrastructure. |mms| can deploy and
  manage MongoDB on your existing servers. To use your existing hardware,
  you must deploy the Automation Agent to each server on which |mms| will
  deploy MongoDB. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-hardware`.

- Use your local system for testing. |mms| can deploy MongoDB to your
  laptop or desktop system. Do not use local systems for production
  deployments. To use your local system, you must deploy the Automation
  Agent.

Automation
----------

Automation uses the Automation Agent to maintain your deployments. The
Automation Agent also maintains the Monitoring and Backup agents and
starts, restarts, and upgrades the agents as needed.

Automation allows only one agent of each type per machine and
will remove additional agents. For example, when maintaining Backup
Agents, automation will remove one of the Backup
Agents from a machine that has two Backup Agents.
