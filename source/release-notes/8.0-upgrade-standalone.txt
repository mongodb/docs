Familiarize yourself with the content of this document, including
thoroughly reviewing the prerequisites, prior to upgrading to MongoDB
8.0.

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version |oldversion| to |newversion|.

.. include:: /includes/upgrade-guidance-checklists.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to |oldfcv|. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "7.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "7.0" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Consider Converting to Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to upgrading, consider
:ref:`converting your standalone deployment to a replica set
<server-replica-set-deploy-convert>`. Replica sets are the
recommended deployment configuration for MongoDB.

Remove Invalid system.buckets Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-system-buckets-collection-8.0.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Procedure
-----------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

      To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use 
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the instance and run the 
      following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

   .. step:: Replace the |oldversion| binaries with the |newversion| binaries.

      Ensure that the |newseries| binaries are in your System PATH. To 
      confirm your binary version, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongod --version

      The command output should indicate a |newseries| release.

   .. step:: Enable backwards-incompatible |newversion| features.

      .. include:: /includes/upgrade-enable-features.rst

      .. tip::

         .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

      Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command 
      against the ``admin`` database:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( 
            { 
              setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "8.0", 
              confirm: true
            }
         ) 
      
      Setting the ``confirm`` value to ``true`` allows the operation to proceed. If you
      omit the ``confirm`` parameter or set ``confirm`` to a value other than ``true``, the command
      fails and returns a warning about modifying the feature compatibility version. The
      warning states that after you upgrade or downgrade your cluster's FCV, you cannot
      downgrade the binary version without support assistance. 

      This command must perform writes to an internal system 
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete          
      successfully, you can safely retry the command as the operation
      is idempotent.

Additional Upgrade Procedures
-----------------------------

- To upgrade a replica set, see :ref:`8.0-upgrade-replica-set`.
- To upgrade a sharded cluster, see :ref:`8.0-upgrade-sharded-cluster`.
