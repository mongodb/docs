You can install {+rel-mig+} on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS server. 
This installation method allows {+rel-mig+} to run on an unattended server. 
When running on an unattended server, {+rel-mig+} binds to any IP and port 
on the server and exposes it as a web application.

About this Task
---------------

{+rel-mig+} uses the following file locations on RHEL/CentOS:

.. include:: /includes/fact-file-location-linux.rst


Steps
-----

.. _install-rhel-server:

Install {+rel-mig+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest ``.rpm`` binary from the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Install {+rel-mig+}.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo yum install mongodb-relational-migrator-<version_number>-1.x86_64.rpm

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers 
   into your {+rel-mig+} directory. 

   a. To download and install MySQL or Oracle drivers, see the following:

      - `MySQL: latest 8.3.x version, Platform Independent Version <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`_

      - `Oracle: 21.6.0.0 of ojdbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html>`_

   b. Copy the driver files to ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib``.

      To copy the driver, use the following example:

      .. code-block:: bash
        
         curl https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/jdbc/216/ojdbc11.jar -O -L -b -o

   For more information, see :ref:`Install on a Local Machine <local-machine-install>`.

#. Change the directory to the {+rel-mig+} ``/bin`` location and start the application.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin
      
      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. Enable {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended standalone server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration 
   properties.

   It is recommended that you configure TLS/SSL for {+rel-mig+} on your 
   unattended server. You can bind {+rel-mig+} to any IP and port on the 
   server. For additional information, see `SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that {+rel-mig+} runs on.

   By default, {+rel-mig+} is configured to run on port ``8278``.
   To change the port {+rel-mig+} runs on, update the ``server.port`` line 
   in your ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port.

#. Run {+rel-mig+} using the binary.

   The path to the ``bin`` directory is ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin``.

   To run {+rel-mig+} using the binary, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin

      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``~/Migrator/Logs/migrator.log``.

   - When running {+rel-mig+} as a system service, the path is under 
     the service userâ€™s home directory.


.. _rhel-system-service:

Run as a System Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install {+rel-mig+} on a RHEL/CentOS server, you can also 
set up {+rel-mig+} to run as a system service. When running {+rel-mig+} as 
a system service, {+rel-mig+} automatically starts when the server starts.

1. Create a ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 

   Copy the text below into the ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 
   Replace the binary path as needed. 

   .. code-block::

      [Unit]
      Description=MongoDB {+rel-mig+}

      [Service]
      ExecStart="/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin/MongoDB {+rel-mig+}"

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

#. Reload ``systemd`` to read the newly-created service:

   .. code-block::
      
      systemctl daemon-reload

#. Enable the {+rel-mig+} service to run on startup and start for the current session.

   You can manage the service with ``systemctl`` commands. To run on startup and 
   start the current session, run the following:

   .. code-block::

      systemctl enable migrator.service

      systemctl start migrator.service
