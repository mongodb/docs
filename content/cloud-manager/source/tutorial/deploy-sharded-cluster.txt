   :description: Deploy a sharded cluster using Cloud Manager for horizontal scaling and high throughput, with options for configuring shards, replica sets, and `mongos` processes.

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling
for large data sets and enable high throughput operations by
distributing the data set across a group of servers.

To learn more about sharding, see
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster that |mms| manages.
Later, you can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance
operations on the cluster.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use unique names for the new cluster and its shards.

Configuration Server Deployment Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you select MongoDB 3.4 or later for your configuration server
|mongod| processes, |mms| deploys your configuration servers as a
replica set.

To learn more about |csrs| and mirrored configuration servers (|sccc|),
see :manual:`Config Servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`.
