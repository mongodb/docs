.. note:: **Availability**

   - |service| provides |fts| metrics for {+database-deployments+} with 
     at least one active |fts| index. To set up an |fts| index, see
     :ref:`fts-top-ref`.
     
   - ``M0`` (Free Tier) {+clusters+} don't support these metrics.

Required Access
---------------

To view |fts| indexes, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only` or higher access to the project.

View |fts| Metrics
-------------------------

To view |fts| metrics for a {+database-deployment+}:

#. Click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for that
   {+database-deployment+}.

#. If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, click the
   :guilabel:`Search Nodes` tab to view |fts| metrics and the hardware
   metrics for the Search Nodes. 

   The :guilabel:`Replica Set` tab displays the MongoDB and the
   replica set's hardware :ref:`metrics <review-replica-set-metrics>`. 

#. Select one or more of the search charts.

Alternatively:

#. Click on the name of the {+database-deployment+} to open the 
   {+database-deployment+} overview.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

#. If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, click the
   :guilabel:`Search Nodes` tab to view |fts| metrics and the
   hardware metrics for the Search Nodes.

   The :guilabel:`Replica Set` tab displays the MongoDB and the
   replica set's hardware :ref:`metrics <review-replica-set-metrics>`. 
 
#. Select one or more of the search charts.

If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, you can also view
|fts| metrics and the hardware metrics for your Search Nodes by clicking
the :guilabel:`View Search Metrics` tab in your :guilabel:`Search` page
after you create an |fts| index. 

If you didn't deploy Search Nodes separately, to view |fts| metrics for
a specific process: 

#. Click the link for the process.
 
#. Click the :guilabel:`Search Metrics` tab.

The following |fts| metrics are available to evaluate and optimize your 
|fts| indexes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80 
   :header-rows: 1
        
   * - Chart
        
     - Data

   * - :guilabel:`Search Disk Space Used`
   
     - Total bytes of disk space used by search indexes, diagnostic data, and logs.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Fields Indexed`

     -  Total number of unique fields present in the |fts| 
        index.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Index Size`

     - Total size of all indexes on disk in bytes.

   * - :guilabel:`Search JVM Heap Memory`

     - Amount of memory that the JVM heap is currently 
       using.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Number of Lucene Docs`

     - Upper bound on the number of Lucene docs used to store |fts| 
       indexes in this replica set or shard. This metric indicates the 
       largest count of Lucene documents in a single search index 
       within a replica set or shard. For example, if the metric 
       displays "1.5 billion", among all your search indexes, the index 
       with the highest number of Lucene documents contains about 1.5 
       billion documents.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Replication Lag`
    
     - Approximate number of milliseconds that |fts| is behind in 
       replicating changes from the :term:`oplog` of |mongod|.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Normalized Process CPU`
   
     - CPU usage of search processes on the node scaled to a 
       range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU cores.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Opcounters`

     - Total number of |fts| operations.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Page Fault`
   
     - Average rate of page faults on this process per second over the
       selected sample period.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process CPU`
   
     - Percentage of time that the CPU spent servicing 
       search processes. For servers with more than 1 CPU core, this value can exceed 100%.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process Memory` 
   
     - Total bytes of memory that search processes occupy.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Query Status`

     - Total number of |fts| queries with each status.

Chart Controls
--------------
 
|service| provides the following controls for the metrics charts.
Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under 
the selected view:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/monitor-view-chart-controls.rst
 
Chart Display
-------------
 
When viewing charts, you can do the following:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/monitor-chart-controls.rst
 
Chart Selection
---------------
 
|service| displays the available metrics to chart for the
selected {+database-deployment+} under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` 
header. 
 
Charts marked with the ``+`` symbol are inactive, 
while charts marked with the ``-`` symbol are active. Click
on any chart to toggle the chart state.
