Read Concern ``"majority"``

For read operations not associated with :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"``
guarantees that the data read has been acknowledged by a majority of
the replica set members (i.e. the documents read are durable and
guaranteed not to roll back).

However, for operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.

Storage Engine Support
----------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for the
WiredTiger storage engine.

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`majority` is available for use with causally
consistent sessions.

.. _readconcern-majority-txn:

Read Concern ``"majority"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-concern-tip.rst

.. note:: 

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level. To set the read concern for
   transactions, see :ref:`transaction-options`.

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.


Read Your Own Writes

Disable Read Concern Majority
-----------------------------

*For 3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture*

For MongoDB 4.0.3+ (and 3.6.1+ [#]_), you can disable read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"` if you have a three-member replica set with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded cluster with
a three-member PSA shards.

With a three-member PSA architecture, the cache pressure will increase
if any data bearing node is down. To prevent the storage cache pressure
from immobilizing a deployment with a PSA architecture, you can disable
read concern by setting either:

- :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern <mongod
  --enableMajorityReadConcern>` command line option to ``false``.

- :setting:`replication.enableMajorityReadConcern` configuration file
  setting to ``false``.

.. important::

   In general, avoid disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern
   unless necessary. However, if you have a three-member replica set
   with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded
   cluster with a three-member PSA shards, disable to prevent the
   storage cache pressure from immobilizing the deployment.

   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern disables support
   for :doc:`/changeStreams`.

   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` does not affect
   :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`; i.e. you
   can specify read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` for transactions
   even if read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is disabled.
