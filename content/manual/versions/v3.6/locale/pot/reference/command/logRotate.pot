#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:18
msgid "The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that allows you to rotate the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too much disk space."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:23
msgid "You must issue the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:"

msgid "Your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance needs to be running with the :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:36
msgid "You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to send the signal on Linux:"

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:50
msgid "The :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` setting or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` option specify :dbcommand:`logRotate`'s behavior."

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:53
msgid "When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to ``rename``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by appending the current timestamp to the filename. The appended timestamp has the following form:"

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:62
msgid "Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same name as originally specified by the :setting:`systemLog.path` setting to :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:66
msgid "When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to ``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` follows the typical Linux/Unix behavior, and simply closes the log file, and then reopens a log file with the same name. With ``reopen``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` expects that another process renames the file prior to the rotation, and that the reopen results in the creation of a new file."
