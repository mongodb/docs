===================================
Remove Monitoring Agents from |MMS|
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS displays active Monitoring Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to MMS for more than 24
hours, MMS removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To remove a Monitoring Agent **from MMS**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-monitoring-agent>` and then remove the
``mongodb-mms-monitoring-agent`` file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you
installed the agent using a ``tar.gz`` file, the agent will be in the 
directory you chose during installation.

To delete the Monitoring Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-monitoring-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller
to remove the ``MMS Monitoring Agent`` program.
