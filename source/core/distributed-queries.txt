Read Operations to Sharded Clusters
-----------------------------------

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` allow you to partition a data
set among a cluster of :program:`mongod` instances in a way that is
nearly transparent to the application. For an overview of sharded
clusters, see the :doc:`/sharding` section of this manual.

For a sharded cluster, applications issue operations to one of the
:program:`mongos` instances associated with the cluster.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster.rst

Read operations on sharded clusters are most efficient when directed to
a specific shard. Queries to sharded collections should include the
collection's :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`. When a query
includes a shard key, the :program:`mongos` can use cluster metadata
from the :ref:`config database <sharding-config-server>` to route the
queries to shards.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-targeted-query.rst

If a query does not include the shard key, the :program:`mongos` must
direct the query to *all* shards in the cluster. These *scatter
gather* queries can be inefficient. On larger clusters, scatter gather
queries are unfeasible for routine operations.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-scatter-gather-query.rst

For replica set shards, read operations from secondary members of
replica sets may not reflect the current state of the primary. Read
preferences that direct read operations to different servers may result
in non-monotonic reads.

For more information on read operations in sharded clusters, see the
:doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router` and :ref:`sharding-shard-key`
sections.

Read Operations to Replica Sets
-------------------------------

By default, clients reads from a replica set's :term:`primary`;
however, clients can specify a :doc:`read preference
</core/read-preference>` to direct read operations to other members.
For example, clients can configure read preferences to read from
secondaries or from nearest member to:

- reduce latency in multi-data-center deployments,

- improve read throughput by distributing high read-volumes (relative
  to write volume),

- perform backup operations, and/or

- allow reads until a :ref:`new primary is elected
  <replica-set-failover>`.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-read-preference.rst

Read operations from secondary members of replica sets may not reflect
the current state of the primary. Read preferences that direct read
operations to different servers may result in non-monotonic reads.

You can configure the read preferece on a per-connection or
per-operation basis. For more information on read preference or on the
read preference modes, see :doc:`/core/read-preference` and
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.
