msgid "Starting in MongoDB Enterprise version 3.2.6, the in-memory storage engine is part of general availability (GA) in the 64-bit builds. Other than some metadata and diagnostic data, the in-memory storage engine does not maintain any on-disk data, including configuration data, indexes, user credentials, etc."
