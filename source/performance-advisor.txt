.. _pa-slow-queries:

The Performance Advisor monitors queries that MongoDB considers slow
and suggests new indexes to improve query performance. The Performance
Advisor recognizes a query as slow if it takes longer than ``100``
milliseconds to execute.

.. COMMENT  (may want to flip the wording to -- 100 milliseconds (i.e. value of the slowOp...)

Recommended indexes are accompanied by sample queries, grouped by
:term:`query shape`, that were run against a collection that would
benefit from the suggested index. The Performance Advisor does not
negatively affect the performance of your |service| clusters.

.. note::

   To view field values in a sample query in the :guilabel:`Performance
   Advisor`, you must be a user with at least one of the following
   access levels:

   - :authrole:`Project Owner` access

   - :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` access

   Users without the aforementioned access cannot see the field values.

Considerations
--------------

Indexes improve read performance, but a large number of indexes can
negatively impact write performance since indexes must be updated during
writes. It is important to consider this tradeoff when deciding whether
to create new indexes for a collection that already has several. Examine
whether a query for such a collection can be modified to take advantage
of existing indexes, as well as whether a query occurs often enough to
justify the cost of a new index.

Index Suggestions
-----------------

The indexes suggested by the Performance Advisor are ordered by their
respective :guilabel:`Impact` scores. :guilabel:`Impact` indicates the
estimated performance improvement that the suggested index would bring.
For more information on how the Performance Advisor ranks indexes, see
:ref:`pa-index-ranking`.

The |pa| displays a warning icon next to any index with an
:guilabel:`Impact` score of 5% or greater, indicating indexes with the
most potential to improve cluster performance.

Each index suggested by the Performance Advisor contains the following
metrics. These metrics apply specifically to queries which would be
improved by the index:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which would be
       improved.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Current average execution time in milliseconds for affected
       queries.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read per document returned by
       affected queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

   * - :guilabel:`In Memory Sort`
     - Current number of affected queries per hour that needed to be
       sorted in memory.

Sample Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each suggested index, the Performance Advisor shows the most
commonly executed query shapes which would be improved by index. For
each query shape, the Performance Advisor displays the following
metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which match the query
       shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Average execution time in milliseconds for queries
       which match the query shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read for
       every document returned by matching queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

The Performance Advisor also shows individual sample queries executed
which match the query shape, with specific metrics for that query.

.. _query-targeting:

Query Targeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each index suggestion includes an :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
score indicating how many documents were read for every document
returned for the index's corresponding query shapes. A score of 1
represents very efficient query shapes because every document read
matched the query and was returned with the query results. All suggested
indexes represent an opportunity to improve query performance.

Filter Index Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Performance Advisor suggests indexes for all clusters
in the deployment. To only show suggested indexes from a specific
collection, use the :guilabel:`Collection` dropdown at the top of
the Performance Advisor.

You can also adjust the time range the Performance Advisor takes into
account when suggesting indexes by using the :guilabel:`Time Range`
dropdown at the top of the Performance Advisor.

Limitations
-----------

Timestamp Format for Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Performance Advisor cannot suggest indexes for MongoDB databases
configured to use the :manual:`ctime timestamp format
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>`. As a
workaround, set the timestamp format for such databases to either
:manual:`iso8601-utc
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>` or
:manual:`iso8601-local
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>`.

Log Size
~~~~~~~~

The Performance Advisor analyzes up to the first of the following limits:

* the most recent 20,000 slow queries OR
* the most recent 10MB of logs
