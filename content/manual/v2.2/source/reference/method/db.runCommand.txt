.. method:: db.runCommand(command)

   :param document command: Specifies a :term:`database command` in the
                            form of a :term:`document`.

   :param string command: When specifying a :doc:`command
                          </reference/commands>` as a string,
                          :method:`db.runCommand()` transforms the
                          command into the form ``{ command: 1 }``.

   Provides a helper to run specified :doc:`database commands
   </reference/commands>`. This is the preferred method to issue
   database commands, as it provides a consistent interface between
   the shell and drivers.
