This section covers enabling |global-write| on an |service| {+cluster+}.

Required Access
---------------

To create to a |global-write-cluster|, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
the project.

Considerations
--------------

- Before creating a |global-write-cluster|, review
  :doc:`Global Clusters Overview </global-clusters>` and
  :ref:`Global Clusters Sharding Reference <global-cluster-sharding>`.

- You can enable |global-write| in |service| when you create an ``M30``
  or greater sharded {+cluster+}.

- After you deploy the cluster, you can't convert a |global-write-cluster|
  to a standard sharded {+cluster+}. 

- Due to :ref:`sharding requirements <global-writes-collections>`, 
  you can't load sample data onto a |global-write-cluster|.
