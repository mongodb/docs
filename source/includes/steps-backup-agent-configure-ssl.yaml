  Configure the agent with the trusted CA certificate that signed the
  MongoDB instance's certificate.
post: |
  Edit the agent configuration file to set
  the ``sslTrustedServerCertificates`` field to the path of a file
  containing one or more certificates in PEM format.
  The agent configuration file is located in either the agent install
  directory or the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` directory, depending on your
  operating system.

  By default, the agent connects to MongoDB instances using a trusted
  certificate. For testing purposes, you can set the
  :bsetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` setting to ``False`` to bypass
  this check. This configuration is **not** recommended for production use as
  it makes the connection insecure.

  For additional information on these settings, see
  :ref:`backup-mongodb-ssl-settings`.
