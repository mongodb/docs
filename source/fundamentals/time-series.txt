Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to create
and interact with **time series collections**. Time series collections
efficiently store chronological sequences of measurements over a period
of time. Each document in a time series collection contains the
following pieces of information:

- Quantity that is being measured over time
- Metadata that describes the measurement
- Timestamp for the measurement

The following table describes some sample situations for which data could be
stored in a time series collection. Each row describes the situation,
the measured quantity, and the metadata in each document:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40, 30, 30
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Situation
     - Measured Quantity
     - Metadata

   * - Recording monthly sales by industry
     - Revenue in USD
     - Company, country

   * - Tracking weather changes
     - Precipitation level
     - Location, sensor type

   * - Recording fluctuations in housing prices
     - Monthly rent price
     - Location, currency

- :ref:`Create a Time Series Collection <rust-tseries-create>` describes
  the syntax for creating a time series collection and provides example code

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

.. important:: Server Version for Time Series Collections

   To create and interact with time series collections, you must be
   connected to a deployment running MongoDB 5.0 or later.
   
To create a time series collection, perform the following actions:

1. Create a ``TimeseriesOptions`` instance that specifies properties of
   your time series collection.

#. Call the ``create_collection()`` method and pass the collection
   name as a parameter.

#. Chain the ``timeseries()`` method to the ``create_collection()`` method.
   Pass your ``TimeseriesOptions`` instance as a parameter to ``timeseries()``.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example creates the ``sept2023`` time series collection in the
``precipitation`` database with the following configuration:

- ``time_field`` is set to ``"precipitation_mm"``
- ``meta_field`` is set to ``"location"``
- ``granularity`` is set to minutes

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/tseries.rs
   :start-after: begin-create-ts
   :end-before: end-create-ts
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

To verify that you successfully created the time series collection, run
the ``list_collections()`` method on the database and print the results:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/tseries.rs
      :start-after: begin-list-colls
      :end-before: end-list-colls
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      CollectionSpecification {
          name: "sept2023",
          collection_type: Timeseries,
          options: CreateCollectionOptions {
              ...
              timeseries: Some(
                  TimeseriesOptions {
                      time_field: "precipitation_mm",
                      meta_field: Some(
                          "location",
                      ),
                      granularity: Some(
                          Minutes,
                      ),
                  },
              ),
              ...
          },
          ...
      }

.. _rust-tseries-query:

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

You can use the same syntax and conventions to query a time series
collection as you use when performing read or aggregation operations on
other collections. To find more information about these operations, see
the :ref:`Additional Information <rust-tseries-addtl-info>` section.

- :manual:`Create and Query a Time Series Collection </core/timeseries/timeseries-procedures/>`
- :manual:`Set Granularity for Time Series Data </core/timeseries/timeseries-granularity/>`

To learn more about creating collections, see the guide on
:ref:`rust-db-coll`.
