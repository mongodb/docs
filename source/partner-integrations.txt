While |service-fullname| integrates with other technologies through
their standard APIs, MongoDB and partners built specific product
integrations to enable |service-fullname| and partner products to
interoperate directly and ensure a seamless experience.

This document lists examples of integrations that MongoDB and 
partners developed to enhance |service| and partner service 
capabilities.

You can explore a collection of the existing integrations and partner 
services in the {+ecosystem+}. Each integration has its own 
page with details about the integration and links to set up the 
integration. To learn more, see :ref:`explore-ecosystem`.

.. _application-platforms:

Application Platforms
---------------------

Vercel
~~~~~~

`Vercel <https://vercel.com/>`__ is a cloud platform for static frontends
and serverless functions. It enables developers to host websites and web
applications that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no
supervision. Vercel integrates with the Next.js framework.

You can easily use Vercel with |service|:

- To connect to |service| {+clusters+} from Vercel,
  see :ref:`<vercel>`.

Netlify
~~~~~~~

`Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`__ is a serverless application platform
based on `Jamstack <https://jamstack.org/>`__. Netlify hosts tools for
deploying and managing static content and enables you to write serverless
functions that run atop AWS Lambda and that can integrate with an
application's database.

Netlify is JavaScript-centric (although it supports other languages) and
is easy to use with |service|. Applications deployed in Netlify can connect
to |service| clusters using serverless functions that use the
:driver:`MongoDB Node.js driver </node/current/>` or the
`Mongoose ODM library <https://mongoosejs.com/>`__.

Best Practices
``````````````

Since Netlify functions run on AWS Lambda, use
:doc:`best practices for connecting from AWS Lambda 
</manage-connections-aws-lambda>`
when building applications that use serverless Netlify
functions that connect to |service|.

Render
~~~~~~

`Render <https://render.com/>`__ is a modern cloud platform designed 
for developers to host applications, websites, databases, and more with 
minimal configuration. It offers seamless integration for developers 
using MongoDB, enabling easy hosting of MongoDB-backed applications. 
With its fully managed services and support for popular frameworks, 
Render simplifies the deployment of full-stack apps, ensuring robust 
and scalable MongoDB database connections.

You can connect Render-hosted applications to 
a database hosted on |service|. To learn more, see :ref:`render`.

You can also host a containerized instance of MongoDB on Render. To 
learn more, see
`the Render documentation <https://docs.render.com/deploy-mongodb>`__.

.. _cloud-providers:

Cloud Providers
---------------

|service-fullname| provides multi-cloud clusters on |aws|, |gcp|,
and |azure| to support a flexible, global deployment strategy.

Integrations with these cloud providers allow applications built on
MongoDB to take advantage of each cloud provider's regions and
capabilities.

Amazon Web Services (AWS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`AWS regions supported on Atlas <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`List of integrations between Atlas and AWS <aws-integrations>`

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`GCP regions supported on Atlas <google-gcp>`
- :ref:`List of integrations between Atlas and GCP <gcp-integrations>`

- :ref:`List of integrations between Atlas and Azure <azure-integrations>`


Data Access Frameworks
----------------------

.. _data-access-frameworks:

Prisma
~~~~~~

`Prisma <https://www.prisma.io/>`__ is a next-generation Node.js
and TypeScript Object Relational Mapper (ORM) with a declarative
schema and type-safe database client supporting a number of
databases, including MongoDB.

Prisma provides a server-side library that enables you to build
applications that read and write data to the database in an
intuitive and safe way.

Integration:

- `MongoDB Database Connector 
  <https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb>`__


.. _identity-providers:

Identity Providers
------------------

SAML SSO Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports federated authentication to allow any company
with an |idp| that supports the |saml| standard to federate access
for its employees into all MongoDB web portals, including the |service|
web interface. As a result, employees can use their corporate |sso|
provider to access |service|.

Notable integrations include:

- AWS Single Sign-On (SSO): `How to integrate AWS Single Sign-On
  with MongoDB Atlas <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/how-to-integrate-aws-single-sign-on-with-mongodb-atlas/>`__
- |azure-ad|: :doc:`Configure Federated Authentication from Microsoft Entra ID </security/federated-auth-azure-ad/>`
- Okta: :doc:`Configure Federated Authentication from Okta </security/federated-auth-okta/>`
- `OneLogin <https://www.onelogin.com/>`__
- `PingOne for Enterprise <https://www.pingidentity.com/en/cloud/pingone-enterprise.html>`__


LDAP Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can manage database user authentication and authorization
from all MongoDB clients using a MongoDB |ldap| over |tls|.

Notable integrations include:

- |azure-ad|: :doc:`/security-ldaps-azure/`
- Okta LDAP Interface: :doc:`security-ldaps-okta/`
- OneLogin: :doc:`/security-ldaps-onelogin/`

.. _monitoring-services:
