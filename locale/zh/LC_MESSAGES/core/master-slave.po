"In addition to providing all the functionality of master-slave "
"deployments, replica sets are also more robust for production use. "
"Master-slave replication preceded replica sets and made it possible to "
"have a large number of non-master (i.e. slave) nodes, as well as to "
"restrict replicated operations to only a single database; however, "
"master-slave replication provides less redundancy and does not automate "
"failover. See :ref:`replica-set-equivalent` for a replica set "
"configuration that is equivalent to master-slave replication.  If you "
"wish to convert an existing master-slave deployment to a replica set, see"
