Mongoid Tutorial (5.0.0)
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial discusses using the object document mapper Mongoid.


Installation
------------

Installing The Gem
``````````````````

Mongoid is bundled as a gem, and is hosted on `Rubygems <http://rubygems.org>`_.
It can be installed manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install mongoid

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your Gemfile:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'mongoid', '~> 5.0'

Compatibility

Configuration
`````````````

Mongoid configuration can be done through a ``mongoid.yml`` that specifies your
options and clients. The simplest configuration is as follows, which sets the default
client to "localhost:27017" and provides a single database in that client named "mongoid".

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

Rails Applications
******************

You can generate a config file by executing the generator and then editing
``myapp/config/mongoid.yml`` to your heart's desire. Mongoid will then handle
everything else from there.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rails g mongoid:config

When Mongoid loads its configuration, it chooses the environment to used based
on the following order:

- ``Rails.env`` if using Rails.
- ``Sinatra::Base.environment`` if using Sinatra.
- ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable.
- ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

If you are not using any rack based application and want to override the
environment programatically, you can pass a second paramter to ``load!`` and
Mongoid will use that.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)

Anatomy of a Mongoid Config
***************************

Let's have a look at a full-blown ``mongoid.yml`` and explain the full power
of what Mongoid can do. The following configuration has its explanation in the
comments above each key.

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    # Configure available database clients. (required)
    clients:
      # Defines the default client. (required)
      default:
        # Defines the name of the default database that Mongoid can connect to.
        # (required).
        database: my_db
        # Provides the hosts the default client can connect to. Must be an array
        # of host:port pairs. (required)
        hosts:
          - myhost1.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost2.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost3.mydomain.com:27017

          # The user's database roles.
          roles:
            - 'dbOwner'

          # Change the default authentication mechanism. Valid options are: :scram,
          # :mongodb_cr, :mongodb_x509, and :plain. (default on 3.0 is :scram, default

          ssl: true

          # The certificate file used to identify the connection against MongoDB.
          ssl_cert: /path/to/my.cert

          # The private keyfile used to identify the connection against MongoDB.

      # existing method. (default: false)
      scope_overwrite_exception: false

      # Use Active Support's time zone in conversions. (default: true)
      use_activesupport_time_zone: true

      # Ensure all times are UTC in the app side. (default: false)
      use_utc: false

Logging
*******

Changing logging options is done simply by telling Mongoid or the driver's logger to have
a different level. Logging level is ``DEBUG`` by default.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  Mongo.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG


Documents
---------

Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be persisted to the
database must include ``Mongoid::Document``. The representation of a Document in MongoDB
is a BSON object that is very similar to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored
in their own collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels deep.

Storage
```````

Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized form of the class name.
For the following ``Person`` class, the collection the document would get stored in would be named ``people``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

Model class names cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as the pluralized form of
the word. For example "Status" would be considered as the plural form of "Statu",
which will cause a few known problems.

This is a limitation of the ``ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify`` which Mongoid uses to convert
from filenames and collection names to class names. You can overcome this by specifying a custom
inflection rule for your model class. For example, the following code will take care of the model
named ``Status``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
    inflect.singular("status", "status")
  end

The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level if you would like
them persisted elsewhere. You can also change the database and session the model gets persisted
in from the defaults.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in collection: "citizens", database: "other", client: "secondary"
  end

The ``store_in`` macro can also take lambdas - a common case for this is multi-tenant applications.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
  end

When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get serialized into BSON
and have a structure like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "title" : "Sir",
    "name" : {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
      "first_name" : "Durran"
    },
    "addresses" : [
      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
        "city" : "Berlin",
        "country" : "Deutschland"
      }
    ]
  }

Fields
``````

Even though MongoDB is a schemaless database, most uses will be with web applications where
form parameters always come to the server as strings. Mongoid provides an easy mechanism for
transforming these strings into their appropriate types through the definition of fields
in a ``Mongoid::Document``.

Consider a simple class for modeling a person in an application. A person may have a first name,
last name, and middle name. We can define these attributes on a person by using the fields macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :first_name, type: String
    field :middle_name, type: String
    field :last_name, type: String
  end

Below is a list of valid types for fields.

- ``Array``
- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Float``
- ``Hash``
- ``Integer``
- ``BSON::ObjectId``
- ``BSON::Binary``
- ``Range``
- ``Regexp``
- ``String``
- ``Symbol``
- ``Time``
- ``TimeWithZone``

If you decide not to specify the type of field with the definition, Mongoid will treat
it as an object and not try to typecast it when sending the values to the database.
This can be advantageous in 2 places, since the lack of attempted conversion will yield
a slight performance gain. However some fields are not supported if not defined as fields.
A note of thumb for what fields you can use are:

- You're not using a web front end and values are already properly cast.
- All of your fields are strings.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :first_name
    field :middle_name
    field :last_name
  end

Types that are not supported as dynamic attributes since they cannot be cast are:

- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Range``

Accessing Field Values
**********************

When a field is defined, Mongoid provides several different ways of accessing the field.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Get the value of the first_name field
  person.first_name
  person[:first_name]
  person.read_attribute(:first_name)


  # Set the value for the first_name field
  person.first_name = "Jean"
  person[:first_name] = "Jean"
  person.write_attribute(:first_name, "Jean")

If you have defined custom getter/setter, those will be used when using the dot notation.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :first_name

    # custom getter
    def first_name
      "My name is Johnny"
    end

    # custom setter
    def first_name=(value)
      p 'Setting.. '
      self.first_name = value
      p '.. done!'
    end
  end

  # Like this:
  person.first_name = 'John'
  # Setting..
  # .. done!

  person.first_name                  # My name is Johnny
  person[:first_name]                # John
  person.read_attribute(:first_name) # John

In cases where you want to set multiple field values at once, there are a few different ways
of handling this as well.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Get the field values as a hash.
  person.attributes

  # Set the field values in the document.
  Person.new(first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel")
  person.attributes = { first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel" }
  person.write_attributes(
    first_name: "Jean-Baptiste",
    middle_name: "Emmanuel"
  )

Hash Fields
***********

When using a field of type Hash, be wary of adhering to the
`legal key names for mongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions>`_,
or else the values will not store properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :first_name
    field :url, type: Hash

    # will update the fields properly and save the values
    def set_vals
      self.first_name = 'Daniel'
      self.url = {'home_page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
      save
    end

    # all data will fail to save due to the illegal hashkey
    def set_vals_fail
      self.first_name = 'Daniel'
      self.url = {'home.page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
      save
    end
  end

Defaults
********

You can tell a field in Mongoid to always have a default value if nothing has been provided.
Defaults are either static values or lambdas.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :blood_alcohol_level, type: Float, default: 0.40
    field :last_drink, type: Time, default: ->{ 10.minutes.ago }
  end

Be wary that default values that are not defined as lambdas or procs are evaluated
at class load time, so the following 2 definitions are not equivalent.
(One would probably prefer the second, which is at document creation time.)

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :dob, type: Time, default: Time.now
  field :dob, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now }

If you want to set a default with a dependency on the document's state, self inside a lambda
or proc evaluates to the document instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :intoxicated_at, type: Time, default: ->{ new_record? ? 2.hours.ago : Time.now }

When defining a default value as a proc, Mongoid will apply the default after all other
attributes are set. If you want this to happen before the other attributes, set ``pre_processed: true``.

Aliasing Fields
***************

One of the drawbacks of having a schemaless database is that MongoDB must store all field
information along with every document, meaning that it takes up a lot of storage space in RAM
and on disk. A common pattern to limit this is to alias fields to a small number of characters,
while keeping the domain in the application expressive. Mongoid allows you to do this and
reference the fields in the domain via their long names in getters, setters, and criteria while
performing the conversion for you.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :n, as: :name, type: String
  end

  band = Band.new(name: "Placebo")
  band.attributes #=> { "n" => "Placebo" }

  criteria = Band.where(name: "Placebo")
  criteria.selector #=> { "n" => "Placebo" }
