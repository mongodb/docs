   .. important::

      Once you automate sharding, the Automation Agent reverts
      any configuration changes not made through the |mms| interface.

      The Automation Agent does not change anything in sharded
      collections that are not managed through |mms|.

title: "For each shard key, enter the minimum and maximum values and select the associated zone."
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: set-data-range
content: |

   Compound shard keys have one range per component shard key but
   together are associated with only one zone.

   A range's minimum value is inclusive and the maximum value is
   exclusive.

   .. example::

      The following two ranges do not overlap:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 33,33,33

         * - min
           - max
           - zone
         * - 1
           - 10
           - A
         * - 10
           - 20
           - B

   .. note::
      :guilabel:`Min` and :guilabel:`Max` are absolute values: the
      absolute minimum and maximum value of any range without
      explicitly listing a specific value.

   Each range can be associated only to a single zone. You cannot assign
   the same range to more than one zone.

   You can add additional shard key ranges for the given collection.
