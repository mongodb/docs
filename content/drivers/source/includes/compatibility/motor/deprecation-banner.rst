   :variant: warning

   As of May 14, 2025, Motor is deprecated in favor of the GA release of the PyMongo Async
   API in the PyMongo library. We will not add new features to Motor, and we will
   provide only bug fixes until it reaches end of life on May 14, 2026. After that, we will
   fix only critical bugs until final support ends on May 14, 2027. We
   strongly recommend migrating to the PyMongo Async API while Motor is still supported.

   For more information about migrating, see the `Migrate to PyMongo Async <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/reference/migration/>`__
   guide in the PyMongo documentation.
