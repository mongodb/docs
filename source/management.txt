   The MMS Monitoring Agent is at the core of MMS. You must install
   the Agent before you can start monitoring or backing up your
   MongoDB deployments. If you have not yet installed the |monitoring|
   agent, see:
   :ref:`install-mms-monitoring`.

.. only:: hosted

   The On-Prem Monitoring Agent is at the core of MMS. You must
   install the Agent before you can begin monitoring your MongoDB
   deployments. If you have not yet installed the |monitoring| Agent, see
   :ref:`install-mms-monitoring`.

The following pages discuss management tools and authentication
requirements for |mms|.

.. both -saas and -hosted tocs are the same here, outstanding issue to
   refactor the toc-spec list to be a little more sensible in this
   regard.
