.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-access.rst
      
   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Add New Database User` dialog box.

      a. If it isn't already displayed, click the
         :guilabel:`Database Users` tab.
      
      #. Click :icon-fa5:`plus` :guilabel:`Add New Database User`.
      
   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Certificate`.

      In the :guilabel:`Authentication Method` section of the :guilabel:`Add
      New Database User` modal window, select the box marked :guilabel:`Certificate`.
      
   .. step:: Enter user information.

      a. Enter a username for the new user in the :guilabel:`Common Name` text
         field.
      
      #. (Optional) If you would like to download an Atlas-managed certificate
         after the new user is created, toggle the :guilabel:`Download certificate
         when user is added` switch to :guilabel:`On`.
      
         .. note::
      
            To download the certificate upon saving, you must provide a
            certificate expiration date.
      
      #. (Optional) Select a certificate expiration period.
      
         X.509 certificates expire and are invalid after the
         certificate expiration date you set. A user cannot 
         log in with an expired X.509 certificate and must be issued 
         a new certificate.
      
         To help manage this, |service| automatically creates a
         project-level alert when you create a new user with X.509
         authentication enabled. This alert sends a notification 30 days
         before that user's latest certificate expires, repeating every
         24 hours. You can view and edit this alert from |service|'s
         :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page. For more information on
         configuring alerts, see
         :doc:`Configure Alert Settings </configure-alerts>`.
      
         .. important::
      
            If a user loses their certificate, they will need a new
            certificate before they can log in again.
      
         .. important::
                
            You cannot revoke X.509 certificates. To revoke an X.509
            certificate-authenticated user's access to your project,
            you must delete that user.
      
         If you prefer to manage your own X.509 certificates, you 
         can upload a PEM-encoded certificate authority through
         :ref:`Self-Managed X.509 Certificates <self-managed-x509>`.
      
   .. step:: Assign privileges.
      
      Select the database user privileges. You can assign privileges to the new user
      in one or more of the following ways:
      
      - Select a :ref:`built-in role <atlas-user-privileges>` from the
        :guilabel:`Built-in Role` dropdown menu. You can select one
        built-in role per database user within the {+atlas-ui+}. If you delete the
        default option, you can click :guilabel:`Add Built-in Role` to select a new built-in role.
      
      - If you have any :ref:`custom roles <mongodb-roles>` defined, you can expand
        the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` section and select
        one or more roles from the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` dropdown menu. Click
        :guilabel:`Add Custom Role` to add more custom roles. You can also
        click the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` link to see the custom
        roles for your project.
      
      - Expand the :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` section and select one or more
        :ref:`privileges <atlas-specific-privileges>` from the
        :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` dropdown menu. Click
        :guilabel:`Add Specific Privilege` to add more privileges. This assigns the
        user specific privileges on individual databases and collections.
      
      |service| can apply a built-in role, multiple custom roles, and multiple specific
      privileges to a single database user. 
      
      To remove an applied role or privilege, click :icon-fa4:`trash-o`
      :guilabel:`Delete` next to the role or privilege you wish to delete.
      
      .. note::
      
        |service| doesn't display the :icon-fa4:`trash-o` :guilabel:`Delete` icon
        next to your :guilabel:`Built-in Role`, :guilabel:`Custom Role`, or
        :guilabel:`Specific Privilege` selection if you selected only one option. You
        can delete the selected role or privilege once you apply another role or privilege.
         
      For more information on authorization, see :manual:`Role-Based
      Access Control </core/authorization>` and :manual:`Built-in
      Roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` in the MongoDB manual.
      
   .. step:: Specify the resources in the project that the user can access.
      By default, users can access all the clusters and {+fdi+}\s in the 
      project. You can restrict access to specific clusters and {+fdi+}\s
      by doing the following: 
      
      a. Toggle :guilabel:`Restrict Access to Specific Clusters/Federated 
         Database Instances` to :guilabel:`ON`.
      
      #. Select the clusters and {+fdi+}\s to grant the user access to 
         from the :guilabel:`Grant Access To` list.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add User`.
