Introduction
------------

This tutorial demonstrates a Compass plugin which displays the
:manual:`users </core/security-users/>` of a database and their
respective :manual:`roles </core/authorization/>`.

Once complete, your plugin will look similar to the following:

.. figure:: /images/compass/user-tutorial-complete.png

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-plugins-prereqs.rst

Creating the Plugin
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/plugin-instantiate-users.rst

When prompted, enter the following values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 60

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Name
     - ``users``

   * - Description
     - Displays database users and their respective roles.

   * - Role
     - :ref:`Database.Tab <plugin-ref-database-tabs>`

This plugin is uses the :ref:`Database.Tab <plugin-ref-database-tabs>`
role, meaning it exists in its own tab in the |compass| database view.

Finally, run the following command to install the plugin's dependencies:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. code-block:: sh

   cd users && npm install

Creating the Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-tutorial-create-store.rst

The user plugin's store is called ``UsersStore``. It keeps the
following state variables:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 60

   * - ``users``
     - An array of objects representing the users of the currently
       selected database. For details on the fields returned in these
       objects, see :ref:`User Object <user-object>`.

   * - ``database``
     - A string representing the name of the currently selected
       database. This string is used in the *store* to filter
       the users displayed. Compass will only display users whose
       authentication database is the database currently being viewed.

   * - ``error``
     - An :abbr:`optional (may be null)` object containing error
       information.


.. _user-object:

User Object
```````````

The objects in the ``users`` state variable take the following form:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 60

   * - ``_id``
     - A unique identifier for the user, incorporating the user's name
       and authentication database.

   * - ``user``
     - The user's username.

   * - ``db``
     - The database on which the user was created.

   * - ``roles``
     - An array of objects representing the
       :manual:`roles </core/authorization/>` of the user and the
       databases in which those roles apply.

       For example:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          "roles" : [
            {
              "role" : "readWrite",
              "db" : "test"
            }
          ]

.. note ::

   A user can have roles pertaining to different databases than the
   one on which they were created. For more information on roles, see
   :manual:`Role-Based Access Control </core/authorization/>`.

Implementing the Store
``````````````````````

Update ``src/stores/store.js`` to match the following:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. literalinclude:: example-user-view/store.js
   :language: js
   :linenos:

Creating the Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The users view contains a *component*, which is a view which renders
based on the ``UsersStore`` store.

.. include:: /includes/fact-jsx-render.rst

Update ``src/components/users/users.jsx`` to match the following:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. literalinclude:: example-user-view/users.jsx
   :language: jsx
   :linenos:

This component displays a table showing each user whose authentication
database is the database currently being viewed, along with all of the
roles assigned to that user.

Styling the Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``users.jsx`` component imports its styles from the ``users.less``
file also located in the ``src/components/users/`` directory.

Update ``src/components/users/users.less`` to match the following:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
.. literalinclude:: example-user-view/users.less
   :language: jsx
   :linenos:

.. include:: /includes/fact-plugin-styling.rst

Running the Plugin
------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-compile-plugin.rst

Extending the Plugin
--------------------

One option to extend this plugin is allowing the |compass| user to
assign new user roles as well as edit and delete existing roles,
provided they have sufficient priviliges to execute such actions.
