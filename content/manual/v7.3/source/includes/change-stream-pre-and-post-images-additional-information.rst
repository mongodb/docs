Pre- and post-images are not available for a :ref:`change stream event
<change-stream-output>` if the images were:

- Not enabled on the collection at the time of a document update or
  delete operation.

- Removed after the pre- and post-image retention time set in
  ``expireAfterSeconds``.
  
  - The following example sets ``expireAfterSeconds`` to ``100``
    seconds on an entire cluster:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       use admin
       db.runCommand( {
          setClusterParameter:
             { changeStreamOptions: {
                preAndPostImages: { expireAfterSeconds: 100 }
             } }
       } )

  - The following example returns the current ``changeStreamOptions``
    settings, including ``expireAfterSeconds``:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       db.adminCommand( { getClusterParameter: "changeStreamOptions" } )

  - Setting ``expireAfterSeconds`` to ``off`` uses the default retention
    policy: pre- and post-images are retained until the corresponding
    change stream events are removed from the :term:`oplog`.

  - If a change stream event is removed from the oplog, then the
    corresponding pre- and post-images are also deleted regardless of
    the ``expireAfterSeconds`` pre- and post-image retention time.

Additional considerations:

- Enabling pre- and post-images consumes storage space and adds
  processing time. Only enable pre- and post-images if you need them.

- Limit the change stream event size to less than 16 megabytes. To limit
  the event size, you can:

  - Limit the document size to 8 megabytes. You can request pre- and
    post-images simultaneously in the :ref:`change stream output
    <change-stream-output>` if other change stream event fields like
    ``updateDescription`` are not large.

  - Request only post-images in the change stream output for documents
    up to 16 megabytes if other change stream event fields like
    ``updateDescription`` are not large.

  - Request only pre-images in the change stream output for documents up
    to 16 megabytes if:
    
    - document updates affect only a small fraction of the document
      structure or content, *and*
    
    - do not cause a ``replace`` change event. A ``replace`` event
      always includes the post-image.

- To request a pre-image, you set ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` to
  ``required`` or ``whenAvailable`` in :method:`db.collection.watch()`.
  To request a post-image, you set ``fullDocument`` using the same
  method.

- Pre-images are written to the ``config.system.preimages`` collection.
    
  - The ``config.system.preimages`` collection may become large. To
    limit the collection size, you can set ``expireAfterSeconds``
    time for the pre-images as shown earlier.
  
  - Pre-images are removed asynchronously by a background process.
