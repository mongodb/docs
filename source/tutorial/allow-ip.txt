An |ipaddr| is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. In |cloudgov|, you can only connect to a cluster from a 
trusted IP address. Within |cloudgov-short|, you can create a list of 
trusted IP addresses, referred to as a IP access list, that can be used 
to connect to your cluster and access your data.

Procedure
---------

You must add your IP address to the IP access list before you can 
connect to your cluster. To add your IP address to the IP access list:

.. include:: /includes/steps/allow-ip.rst

.. seealso:: |service| documentation

   :atlas:`Configure IP Access List Entries </security/ip-access-list/>`

Next Steps
----------

After allowing your IP address, you must 
:ref:`create a database user <create-dbuser>` to connect to your 
cluster.
