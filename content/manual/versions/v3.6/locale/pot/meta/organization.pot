msgid "The documentation project has two \"index files\": ``/contents.txt`` and ``/index.txt``. The \"contents\" file provides the documentation's tree structure, which Sphinx uses to create the left-pane navigational structure, to power the \"Next\" and \"Previous\" page functionality, and to provide all overarching outlines of the resource. The \"index\" file is not included in the \"contents\" file (and thus builds will produce a warning here) and is the page that users first land on when visiting the resource."

msgid "The placement of files in the repository depends on the *type* of documentation rather than the *topic* of the content. Like the difference between ``contents.txt`` and ``index.txt``, by decoupling the organization of the files from the organization of the information the documentation can be more flexible and can more adequately address changes in the product and in users' needs."

msgid "The organization of the site, like all Sphinx sites derives from the :rst:dir:`toctree <sphinx:toctree>` structure. However, in order to annotate the table of contents and provide additional flexibility, the MongoDB documentation generates :rst:dir:`toctree` structures using data from YAML files stored in the ``source/includes/`` directory. These files start with ``ref-toc`` or ``toc`` and generate output in the ``source/includes/toc/`` directory. Briefly this system has the following behavior:"
