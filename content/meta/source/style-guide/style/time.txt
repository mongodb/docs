You can show time by using either the 24-hour or 12-hour clock.

-  The 24-hour clock is the preferred format for international
   audiences and the format used in most computer systems, so use the
   24-hour clock when possible.
-  If the technology or interface that you're documenting shows or uses
   the 12-hour clock, then be consistent with the interface and use the
   12-hour clock.

24-hour Clock
-------------

When you use the 24-hour clock to show time, use the following
guidelines:

-  Use a colon to separate the hours, minutes, and seconds.
-  Show the hours, minutes, and seconds with two digits each, even if
   the leading digit is 0.
-  If you need to show a time zone, use Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC), and indicate the time-zone offset from UTC.

   * - 00:00:00 (midnight)

12-hour Clock
-------------

When you use the 12-hour clock to show time, use the following
guidelines:

-  Use a colon to separate the hours and minutes. If the minutes are
   00, you don't need to show them unless you're showing a span of
   time that includes a time with minutes.
-  Use uppercase letters for abbreviations of ante meridiem (AM) and
   post meridiem (PM). Separate these abbreviations from the time with
   a space. Do not use periods in the abbreviations.
-  When specifying time zones, show both the spelled-out name and the
   abbreviation. Show the name in lowercase letters; use uppercase
   letters and no periods for the abbreviation.
-  Avoid references to standard and daylight saving time because the
   appropriate designation changes frequently. However, if you need to
   include such a reference, insert *S* (for standard) or *D* (for
   daylight) as the second character in the abbreviation.
-  When referring to 12 AM, use *12 midnight* or just *midnight*. When
   referring to 12 PM, use *12 noon* or just *noon*.
