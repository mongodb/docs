  In the other supported stages:

  - With a single expression as its operand, if the expression resolves
    to an array, {{accumulator}} traverses into the array to operate on the
    numerical elements of the array to return a single value.

  - With a list of expressions as its operand, if any of the expressions
    resolves to an array, {{accumulator}} does **not** traverse into the
    array but instead treats the array as a non-numerical value.
