Self-Managed Replica Set Protocol Version

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB only supports replica set protocol version 1 
(:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`). ``pv1`` is the default for all new replica 
sets.

Preservation of Writes
----------------------

``w:1`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With :rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`, you can use
:rsconf:`~settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` to prioritize between faster
failovers and preservation of :writeconcern:`w:1 <\<number\>>` writes.

``w: "majority"`` Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pv1`` guarantees the preservation of confirmed :writeconcern:`w:
"majority" <"majority">` writes.

Availability
------------

``pv1`` is available in MongoDB version 3.2 or later and is the default
for all new replica sets.

Vetoes
------

``pv1`` does not use vetoes. Individual members can vote for or against
a candidate in a particular election, but cannot individually veto (abort)
an election unilaterally.

.. _simultaneous-primaries:

Detection of Simultaneous Primaries
-----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/footnote-two-primaries-edge-cases.rst

``pv1`` uses the concept of :term:`term`. This allows for a faster
detection of simultaneous primaries and for multiple successful
elections in a short period of time.

Back to Back Elections
----------------------

``pv1`` makes a "best-effort" attempt to have the secondary with the
highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. This
could lead to back-to-back elections as eligible members with
higher priority can call an election.

However, for ``pv1``:

- Priority elections have been limited to occur only if the higher
  priority node is within 10 seconds of the current primary. 

- Arbiters will vote no in elections if they detect a healthy primary
  of equal or greater priority to the candidate.

Double Voting
-------------

``pv1`` prevents double voting in one member's call for election. This
is achieved through its use of :term:`terms <term>`.
