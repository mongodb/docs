Network and Firewall Requirements
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-open-network-ports.rst

Preconfigured Security Features
-------------------------------

The following security features are part of the |service| product:

.. _security-tls:

|tls-ssl|
~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses |tls-ssl| to encrypt the connections to your databases.

.. _security-vpc:

Virtual Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-vpc-per-project-no-link.rst

Required Security Features
--------------------------

You *must* configure the following security features:

.. _security-whitelist:

Whitelist
~~~~~~~~~

|service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in
the project's whitelist. To connect, you must add an entry to the
whitelist. To set up the whitelist for the project, see
:doc:`security-whitelist`.

For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
:ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the |ipaddr| addresses of your |gcp| or
:abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` services to |service| project |ipaddr|
whitelist to grant those services access to the cluster.

User Authentication/Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| requires clients to authenticate to access the clusters, i.e.
the MongoDB databases. You must create database users to access the 
database. To set up database users to your clusters, see
:doc:`security-add-mongodb-users`.

To access clusters in a project, users must belong to that project.
Users can belong to multiple projects. See
:ref:`atlas-access`.

Optional Security Features
--------------------------

You *may* configure the following security features:

Custom Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports creating :ref:`custom roles <mongodb-roles>`
in cases where the built-in |service|
:ref:`database user privileges <atlas-user-privileges>` cannot
describe your desired set of privileges.

|vpc| Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports |vpc| peering with other |aws|, |azure|, or |gcp|
|vpc|\s. To use |vpc| Peering, see :doc:`security-vpc-peering`.

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports private endpoints on |aws| using 
the {+aws-pl+} feature. To use private endpoints, see 
:doc:`security-private-endpoint`.

Two Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to help users 
control access to their |service| accounts. To use
:abbr:`2FA (Two Factor Authentication)`, see
:doc:`security-two-factor-authentication`.

User Authentication/Authorization with |ldap|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports performing user authentication and authorization
with |ldap|. To use |ldap|, see
:doc:`Set up User Authentication and Authorization with LDAP </security-ldaps>`.

Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports using |aws| |kms|, Azure Key Vault, and |gcp| to
encrypt storage engines and cloud provider backups. To use encryption
at rest, see :doc:`security-kms-encryption`.

Client-Side Field Level Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports :manual:`client-side field level encryption
</core/security-client-side-encryption>`, including
:manual:`automatic </core/security-automatic-client-side-encryption>`
encryption of fields. 

.. note::

   All |service| users are entitled to use MongoDB's automatic client-side
   field level encryption features.

Prerequisites
`````````````

Minimum Driver and |mongo| Version
  The following support client-side field level encryption:

  - Official MongoDB drivers compatible with MongoDB Server 4.2 and
    later, or
  - :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell 4.2 and later.

  For more information on official MongoDB drivers, see :driver:`MongoDB
  Drivers </>`.

Minimum Server Version
  Drivers and the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell can only use client-side
  field level encryption if connected to a |service| cluster running
  MongoDB 4.2 or later.

.. note::

   :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>`, the :ref:`Data Explorer
   <data-explorer>`, and the :mdb-shell:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   (``mongosh``) do not support decrypting client-side field
   level-encrypted fields.

.. seealso:: 
   - :manual:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption
     </core/security-client-side-encryption/>`
   - :driver:`Use-Case Guide for Client-Side Field Level Encryption
     <use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide>`

Database Auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports auditing all system event actions. To use database
auditing, see :doc:`Set up Database Auditing </database-auditing>`.

Restrict MongoDB Support Access to |service| Backend Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organization owners can restrict MongoDB Production Support Employees
from accessing |service| backend infrastructure for any |service|
cluster in their organization. Organization owners may grant a 24 hour
bypass to the access restriction at the |service| cluster level.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restrict-support-access.rst

To enable this option, see :doc:`security-restrict-support-access`.

Access Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| surfaces authentication logs directly in the UI so that you 
can easily review successful and unsuccesful authentication attempts 
made against your clusters. To view your database access history, see 
:doc:`access-tracking`.
