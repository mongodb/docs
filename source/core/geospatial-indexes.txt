``2d`` Index Internals
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document provides a more in-depth explanation of the internals of MongoDB's
``2d`` geospatial indexes. This material is not necessary for normal operations
or application development but may be useful for troubleshooting and for
further understanding.

.. _geospatial-indexes-geohash:

Calculation of Geohash Values for ``2d`` Indexes
------------------------------------------------

When you create a geospatial index on
:term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`, MongoDB computes
:term:`geohash` values for the coordinate pairs within the specified
:ref:`location range <geospatial-indexes-range>` and then indexes the geohash values.

To calculate a geohash value, recursively divide a two-dimensional map into
quadrants. Then assign each quadrant a two-bit value. For example, a
two-bit representation of four quadrants would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   01  11

   00  10

These two-bit values (``00``, ``01``, ``10``, and ``11``) represent each
of the quadrants and all points within each quadrant. For a geohash with
two bits of resolution, all points in the bottom left quadrant would
have a geohash of ``00``. The top left quadrant would have the geohash
of ``01``. The bottom right and top right would have a geohash of ``10``
and ``11``, respectively.

To provide additional precision, continue dividing each quadrant into
sub-quadrants. Each sub-quadrant would have the geohash value of the
containing quadrant concatenated with the value of the sub-quadrant. The
geohash for the upper-right quadrant is ``11``, and the geohash for the
sub-quadrants would be (clockwise from the top left): ``1101``,
``1111``, ``1110``, and ``1100``, respectively.

To calculate a more precise geohash, continue dividing the sub-quadrant
and concatenate the two-bit identifier for each division. The more
"bits" in the hash identifier for a given point, the smaller possible
area that the hash can describe and the higher the resolution of the
geospatial index.

.. _geospatial-indexes-multi-location:

Multi-location Documents for ``2d`` Indexes
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   Support for multiple locations in a document.

While ``2d`` geospatial indexes do not support more than one set of
coordinates in a document, you can use a :ref:`multi-key index
<index-type-multi-key>` to index multiple coordinate pairs in
a single document. In the simplest example you may have a field (e.g.
``locs``) that holds an array of coordinates, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id : ObjectId(...),
     locs : [ [ 55.5 , 42.3 ] ,
              [ -74 , 44.74 ] ,
              { lng : 55.5 , lat : 42.3 } ]
   }

The values of the array may be either arrays, as in ``[ 55.5, 42.3 ]``,
or embedded documents, as in ``{ lng : 55.5 , lat : 42.3 }``.

You could then create a geospatial index on the ``locs`` field, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { "locs": "2d" } )

You may also model the location data as a field inside of a
sub-document. In this case, the document would contain a field
(e.g. ``addresses``) that holds an array of documents where each
document has a field (e.g. ``loc:``) that holds location
coordinates. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id : ObjectId(...),
     name : "...",
     addresses : [ {
                    context : "home" ,
                    loc : [ 55.5, 42.3 ]
                   } ,
                   {
                    context : "home",
                    loc : [ -74 , 44.74 ]
                   }
                 ]
   }

You could then create the geospatial index on the ``addresses.loc`` field as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { "addresses.loc": "2d" } )

For documents with multiple coordinate values, queries may return the
same document multiple times if more than one indexed coordinate pair
satisfies the query constraints. Use the ``uniqueDocs`` parameter to
:dbcommand:`geoNear` or the :operator:`$uniqueDocs` operator with
:operator:`$geoWithin`.

To include the location field with the distance field in multi-location
document queries, specify ``includeLocs: true`` in the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command.
