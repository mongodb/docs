msgid "The :term:`storage engine` is the component of the database that is responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, as different engines perform better for specific workloads. Choosing the appropriate storage engine for your use case can significantly impact the performance of your applications."

msgid ":doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` is the default storage engine starting in MongoDB 3.2. It is well-suited for most workloads and is recommended for new deployments. WiredTiger provides a document-level concurrency model, checkpointing, and compression, among other features. In MongoDB Enterprise, WiredTiger also supports :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest`."
