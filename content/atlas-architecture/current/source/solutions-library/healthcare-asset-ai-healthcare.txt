Predictive AI for Early Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Predictive AI can be used in healthcare to generate an accurate diagnosis
from large datasets. `Microsoft Fabric Data Science
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/data-science-overview>`__
presents a robust platform to train and experiment with ML Models and
manage MLOps cycles. This solution uses models for the following purposes:
  
1. **BI-RADS prediction**    

   BI-RADS is an industry-standard mechanism to analyze mammogram
   findings. Healthcare specialists use BI-RADS to describe results from
   breast-imaging tests with a number from 0 to 6, with the possibility of
   malignancy increasing with the score. 

   This solution uses the VGG16 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to
   predict BI-RADS scores from images. The model is trained on mammogram images from
   a `Kaggle dataset
   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asmaasaad/king-abdulaziz-university-mammogram-dataset>`__. 
   Each images is grouped into folders that correspond to their BI-RADS. 
   
   Fabric Data Science analyzes the performance of multiple models for this 
   task and selects the best one. It trains the models, runs experiments, 
   and manages multiple versions. The training images are directly uploaded 
   to the Lakehouse in OneLake from the user's local machine by using the 
   Lakehouse UI. Additionally, you can easily reference the images stored 
   in Azure Blob Storage by using the ``wget`` or ``curl`` commands, using `shortcuts
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/get-started-shortcuts>`__,
   or by using a `data pipeline
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/tutorial-lakehouse-data-ingestion>`__.
   The solution stores the image metadata and final predictions in MongoDB Atlas.    

#. **Biopsy classification**    

   Classification or regression models can be used to classify tumors as
   malignant or benign. The random forest classifier model is trained on a
   `Kaggle dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninjacoding/breast-cancer-wisconsin-benign-or-malignant>`__
   that includes input parameters such as clump thickness, uniformity of cell size
   and shape, bare nuclei, and mitoses. The model can then predict whether
   a tumor is malignant or benign. In production, you can add more parameters
   to the dataset and train the model on these values to make more accurate 
   predictions. During solution development, the random forest model had an
   accuracy rate of over 97%. The solution fetches the training dataset from
   MongoDB Atlas, and the prediction output is updated in MongoDB by using
   the :ref:`MongoDB Spark Connector <mdb-spark-connector>`.

Fabric Data Science makes training and managing your models easy by automatically
logging related parameters for each model and experiment.

enabling enterprise-wide data analysis and advanced visualizations.
Through the `MongoDB Atlas Connector
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/mongodb-atlas-sql-interface>`__,
healthcare data can be combined with other enterprise sources in
Microsoft OneLake. The geographical visualization dashboard (Figure 6)
showcases this integration, displaying patient distribution and enabling
sophisticated analytical capabilities.
