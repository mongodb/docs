msgid "A member may show a negative time value behind the primary when :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` is called. This behavior is expected if the method is called after a secondary replicates a write following a period of inactivity, but before it has received a heartbeat from the primary with its latest optime."

msgid "For the most up-to-date information on your replica set, it is generally advisable to run :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` on the primary."
