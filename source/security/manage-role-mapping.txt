You can map your |idp| groups to |mms| roles. This streamlines
authorization setup. You can grant one |idp| group one or more roles to
simplify their access to |mms| organizations, projects, and
clusters.

Role Mapping Process
--------------------

1. |mms| applies the role mappings when you log in.

2. |mms| compares the |idp| groups named **memberOf** to role
   mappings defined for your organizations. These organizations must
   use the same |idp| that the user did to authenticate.

   - |mms| applies the mapped roles to federated users if you
     defined role mappings.

   - |mms| applies the default role if:

     - You haven't defined role mappings, or
     - Role mappings would result in a user without any roles.

   - Organization role mappings define federated users' |mms|
     access. If a federated user logs in but doesn't belong to an |idp|
     group mapped to a desired organization, |mms| removes the
     mapped role from the user in that organization and its projects.
     The federated user may still belong to other |idp| groups.

     .. example::

        Consider a scenario where a user belongs to the **admin** |idp|
        group. You have configured a role mapping of **admin** to the
        :authrole:`Organization Owner` in **Organization A**. If you
        remove that user from the **admin** |idp| group, |mms|
        deletes that users' :authrole:`Organization Owner` role when
        the user next logs in.

   - Every project must have at least one user that has the
     :authrole:`Project Owner` role. |mms| won't remove a role if 
     removing the role removes the last owner from a project.
   - Every organization must have at least one user that has the
     :authrole:`Organization Owner` role. |mms| won't remove a role if 
     removing the role removes the last owner from an organization.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have:

- Created an |idp| application. This application must have a |saml|
  attribute named to **memberOf**. Map this attribute to the |idp|
  source attributes for groups. This attribute links the |idp| groups
  with your |service| roles.
- Linked an :ref:`IdP to Cloud Manager <mms-manage-fed-auth>`.
- Mapped an :ref:`organization <mms-manage-fed-org-map>` to
  your |idp|.
- Created at least one group in your |idp|.
- Added at least one user in your |idp| application to a group you
  created.
