.. dbcommand:: refineCollectionShardKey

   Modifies the collection's :ref:`shard key <shard-key>` by adding new
   field(s) as a suffix to the existing key. Refining a collection's
   shard key can address situations
   where the existing key has led to :ref:`jumbo (i.e. indivisible)
   chunks <jumbo-chunks>` due to insufficient cardinality.

.. note:: Data Distribution

   As part of refining the shard key, the
   :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command updates the
   :doc:`chunk ranges </core/sharding-data-partitioning>` and
   :ref:`zone ranges <zone-sharding>` to incorporate the new
   fields without modifying the range values of the existing key
   fields. That is, the refinement of the shard key does not
   immediately affect the distribution of chunks across shards or
   zones. Any future chunk splits or migration occur as part of the
   routine sharding operations.

Syntax
------

.. note::

   To use the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, the sharded
   cluster must have :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>`
   of ``4.4``.

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
      { 
        refineCollectionShardKey: "<database>.<collection>", 
        key: { <existing key specification>, <suffix1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }
      } 
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`refineCollectionShardKey <refineCollectionShardKey-namespace>`
     - string
     - .. _refineCollectionShardKey-namespace:
     
       The :term:`namespace` of the sharded collection in the
       form ``"<database>.<collection>"``.

   * - :ref:`key <refineCollectionShardKey-key>`
     - document
     - .. _refineCollectionShardKey-key:
     
       The document that specifies the field or fields to use as the
       new :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>` for the
       collection.

       ``{ <existing key specification>, <suffix1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``

       .. important::

          - The new key must start with the existing shard key.

          - The new key must be supported by an index that must exist
            :red:`before` you run the
            :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. See
            :ref:`refineCollectionShardKey-index-considerations` for
            more information.

       For the suffix fields, set the field values to either:

       - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`

       - ``"hashed"`` to specify a :ref:`hashed shard key
         <hashed-shard-keys>` *if* no other field in the shard key has
         a ``"hashed"`` specification and the current shard key is not
         supported by a unique index since hashed indexes :ref:`do not
         support uniqueness constraint <unique-index-restrictions>`.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/sharding-shard-key`

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`refineCollectionShardKey` privilege actions on :ref:`database
and/or collection <resource-specific-db-and-or-collection>` to run the
command. That is, a user must have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants
the following :ref:`privilege <privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { resource: { db: <database>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "refineCollectionShardKey" ] }

The built-in :authrole:`clusterManager` role provides the appropriate
privileges.


Considerations
--------------

.. _refineCollectionShardKey-index-considerations:

Index Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Index Existence
      An index that supports the command's specified :ref:`key
      <refineCollectionShardKey-key>` must exist :red:`prior` to
      running the command.

      A supporting index is an index that starts with the new shard key
      specification; i.e. the :ref:`index prefix
      <compound-index-prefix>` matches the new shard key specification.
      That is, to change the shard key to ``{ x: 1, y: 1 }`` from ``{ x:
      1 }``, and index that starts with ``{ x: 1, y: 1 }`` must exist; e.g.

      - ``{ x: 1, y: 1 }``

      - ``{ x: 1, y: 1, a: 1, b: 1}``

      .. note::

         - The supporting index cannot be a :doc:`partial index </core/index-partial>`.

         - The supporting index cannot be a :ref:`sparse index <index-type-sparse>`.
         
         - If the collection uses a non-``simple`` collation, the supporting
           index must specify ``{ locale: "simple" }`` collation.

- Unique Index
      If the current shard index has a :doc:`uniqueness constraint
      </core/index-unique>`, the new shard key index must also have a
      unique constraint.

      | After creating the unique index to support the new shard key,
        **drop** the old shard key index :red:`before` running
        :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey`.

      | Also, if the current shard index has a :doc:`unique constraint
        </core/index-unique>`, then the new shard key cannot specify
        ``"hashed"`` for any of its fields.
      
      | See also :ref:`Sharded Collection and Unique Indexes
        <sharding-shard-key-unique>`.
   
- Index Collation
      If the sharded collection has a non-``simple`` default
      :ref:`collation <collation>`, then the index *must* include a
      collation document with ``{ locale : "simple" }``. At least one
      of the indexes whose fields support the shard key pattern must
      have the simple collation.

Examples
--------

To set up the example in the ``test`` database:

#. Use following :dbcommand:`shardCollection` operation to shard the
   ``orders`` collection in the ``test`` database. The operation
   uses the ``customer_id`` field as the initial :ref:`shard key
   <shard-key>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "test.orders", key: { customer_id: 1 } } )

To modify the shard key to be the ``customer_id`` field and the
``order_id`` field ``{ customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }``,

#. :method:`Create the index <db.collection.createIndex()>` to
   support the new shard key if the index does not already exist.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("test").orders.createIndex( { customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 } )

#. Run :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command to add the ``order_id``
   field as a suffix:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { 
         refineCollectionShardKey: "test.orders", 
         key: { customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }
      } )

Upon successful completion of the command, the shard key for the
collection has changed to ``{ customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }``. To verify,
you can run :method:`sh.status()`.

.. tip::

   After you refine the shard key, it may be that not all documents in
   the collection have the suffix field(s). To populate the missing
   shard key field(s), see :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

   Before refining the shard key, ensure that all or most documents in
   the collection have the suffix fields, if possible, to avoid having
   to populate the field afterwards.

Collection with non-``simple`` Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up the example in the ``test`` database:

#. Create the ``cafés`` collection in the ``test`` database,
   specifying French ``fr`` as the default collation.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("test").createCollection( "cafés", { collation: { locale: "fr" } } );

#. Shard the collection using ``customer_id`` field as the initial
   :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`. Because the collection has a default ``fr``
   collation and not a ``simple`` collation, the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command must include a ``collation:
   { locale: "simple" }`` option:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { 
         shardCollection: "test.cafés", 
         key: { customer_id: 1 },
         collation: { locale: "simple" } 
      } )

To modify the shard key to be both the ``customer_id`` field and the
``order_id`` field ``{ customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }``,

#. :method:`Create the index <db.collection.createIndex()>` to
   support the new shard key if the index does not already exist.
   Because the collection uses a non-simple collation, the index
   must include the ``collation: { locale: "simple" }`` option.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("test").cafés.createIndex( 
         { customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }, 
         { collation: { locale: "simple" } } 
      )

#. Run :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command to add the ``order_id``
   field as a suffix:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { 
         refineCollectionShardKey: "test.cafés",
         key: { customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 } 
      } )

Upon successful completion of the command, the shard key for the
collection has changed to ``{ customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }``. To verify,
you can run :method:`sh.status()`.

.. tip::


   After you refine the shard key, it may be that not all documents in
   the collection have the suffix field(s). To populate the missing
   shard key field(s), see :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

   Before refining the shard key, ensure that all or most documents in
   the collection have the suffix fields, if possible, to avoid having
   to populate the field afterwards.
