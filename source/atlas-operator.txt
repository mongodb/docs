What is |ak8so|?
----------------

|ak8so| is a new service that integrates |service| resources with your
|k8s| {+cluster+}. You can now deploy and manage the lifecycle of your 
cloud-native applications that need data services in a single control 
plane with secure enterprise platform integration.

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-ref`.

What Can You Do?
----------------

You can use |ak8so| to manage resources in |service| without leaving
|k8s|. You deploy |ak8so| into |k8s| {+clusters+}. |ak8so| 
manages resources in |service| based on |k8s| :ref:`custom resources 
<custom-resources>`. It ensures that the state of the projects, 
{+clusters+}, and database users in |service| matches the 
configurations in each :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`,
:ref:`atlascluster-custom-resource`, and 
:ref:`atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource` that you 
create in your |k8s| {+cluster+}.

Get Hands-On Experience with |ak8so|
------------------------------------

To create your first {+cluster+} in |service| with |ak8so|, see one of 
the following tutorials:

- :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-ref`
- :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-helm-ref`

To configure |ak8so| access to |service|, see
