Read Operations
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Read operations, or :term:`queries <query>`, retrieve data stored in
the database. In MongoDB, queries select :term:`documents <document>`
from a single :term:`collection`.

Queries specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents
that MongoDB returns to the clients. A query may include a *projection*
that specifies the fields from the matching documents to return. The
projection limits the amount of data that MongoDB returns to the client
over the network.

Query Interface
---------------

For query operations, MongoDB provide a :method:`db.collection.find()`
method. The method accepts both the query criteria and projections and
returns a :doc:`cursor </core/cursors>` to the matching documents. You
can optionally modify the query to impose limits, skips, and sort
orders.

The following diagram highlights the components of a MongoDB query
operation:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-mongodb-find.rst

The next diagram shows the same query in SQL:

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-sql-select.rst

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.find( { age: { $gt: 18 } }, { name: 1, address: 1 } ).limit(5)

   This query selects the documents in the ``users`` collection that
   match the condition ``age`` is greater than ``18``. To specify the
   greater than condition, query criteria uses the greater than (i.e.
   :query:`$gt`) :ref:`query selection operator <query-selectors>`.
   The query returns at most ``5`` matching documents (or more
   precisely, a cursor to those documents). The matching documents will
   return with only the ``_id``, ``name`` and ``address`` fields. See
   :ref:`projections` for details.

.. see:: :doc:`/reference/sql-comparison` for additional examples
   of MongoDB queries and the corresponding SQL statements.

Query Behavior
--------------

MongoDB queries exhibit the following behavior:

- All queries in MongoDB address a *single* collection.

- You can modify the query to impose :method:`limits <cursor.limit()>`,
  :method:`skips <cursor.skip()>`, and :method:`sort orders
  <cursor.sort()>`.

- The order of documents returned by a query is not defined unless you
  specify a :method:`~cursor.sort()`.

- Operations that :doc:`modify existing documents
  </tutorial/modify-documents>` (i.e. *updates*) use the same query
  syntax as queries to select documents to update.

- In :doc:`aggregation </core/aggregation>` pipeline, the
  :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage provides access to MongoDB
  queries.

MongoDB provides a :method:`db.collection.findOne()` method as a
special case of :method:`~db.collection.find()` that returns a single
document.

Query Statements
----------------

Consider the following diagram of the query process that specifies a
query criteria and a sort modifier:

.. include:: /images/crud-query-stages.rst

In the diagram, the query selects documents from the ``users``
collection. Using a :doc:`query selection operator
</reference/operator>` to define the conditions for matching documents,
the query selects documents that have ``age`` greater than (i.e.
:query:`$gt`) ``18``. Then the :method:`~cursor.sort()` modifier
sorts the results by ``age`` in ascending order.

For additional examples of queries, see
:doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`.

.. _projections:

Projections
-----------

Queries in MongoDB return all fields in all matching documents by
default. To limit the amount of data that MongoDB sends to
applications, include a :term:`projection` in the queries. By
projecting results with a subset of fields, applications reduce their
network overhead and processing requirements.

Projections, which are the the *second* argument to the
:method:`~db.collection.find()` method, may either specify a list of
fields to return *or* list fields to exclude in the result documents.

.. important:: Except for excluding the ``_id`` field in inclusive
   projections, you cannot mix exclusive and inclusive projections.

Consider the following diagram of the query process that specifies a
query criteria and a projection:

.. include:: /images/crud-query-w-projection-stages.rst

In the diagram, the query selects from the ``users`` collection. The
criteria matches the documents that have ``age`` equal to ``18``. Then
the projection specifies that only the ``name`` field should return in
the matching documents.

Projection Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclude One Field From a Result Set
```````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { "user_id": { $lt: 42} }, { history: 0} )

This query selects a number of documents in the ``records``
collection that match the query ``{ "user_id": { $lt: 42} }``, but
excludes the ``history`` field.

Return Two fields *and* the ``_id`` Field
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { "user_id": { $lt: 42} }, { "name": 1, "email": 1} )

This query selects a number of documents in the ``records`` collection
that match the query ``{ "user_id": { $lt: 42} }``, but returns
documents that have the ``_id`` field (implicitly included) as well as
the ``name`` and ``email`` fields.

Return Two Fields *and* Exclude ``_id``
```````````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { "user_id": { $lt: 42} }, { "_id": 0, "name": 1 , "email": 1 } )

This query selects a number of documents in the ``records``
collection that match the query ``{ "user_id": { $lt: 42} }``, but
only returns the ``name`` and  ``email`` fields.

.. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results` for more
   examples of queries with projection statements.

Projection Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB projections have the following properties:

- In MongoDB, the ``_id`` field is always included in results unless
  explicitly excluded.

- For fields that contain arrays, MongoDB provides the following
  projection operators: :projection:`$elemMatch`, :projection:`$slice`,
  :projection:`$`.

- For related projection functionality in the :doc:`aggregation
  framework </core/aggregation>` pipeline, use the
  :pipeline:`$project` pipeline stage.
