Version Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three numbers in a MongoDB version:

``<major version number>.<release number>.<revision number>``

The second number, the release number, indicates release stability. An
odd release number indicates the release is still in
development. An even release number indicates a general availability release.

Additionally, the three numbers indicate the following:

- ``<major version number>``: This rarely changes. A change to this number
  indicates very large changes to MongoDB.

- ``<release number>``: A release can include many changes, including new
  features and updates. Some changes could possibly break backwards
  compatibility, which would be noted in the Release Notes.
  Even-numbered release numbers are stable branches. Odd-numbered
  release numbers are development branches.

- ``<revision number>``: This is used for changes pertaining to bugs and
  security issues.

  little risk.

  and other works-in-progress. Some things may be different than 1.0
