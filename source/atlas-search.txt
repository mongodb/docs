Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search/>` queries on a collection.
Atlas Search enables you to perform full-text searches on collections
hosted on MongoDB Atlas. Atlas Search indexes specify the behavior of the
search and which fields to index.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this guide uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to
create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Run an Atlas Search Query
-------------------------

This section shows how to create an aggregation pipeline to run an
Atlas Search query on a collection. You can use the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder
method to create a ``$search`` pipeline stage, which specifies the search
criteria. Then, call the ``aggregate()`` method and pass your pipeline as a parameter.

.. tip:: 

   To learn more about aggregation operations and builders, see the :ref:`java-aggregation`
   guide. 

Before running an Atlas Search query, you must create an Atlas Search index
on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create an Atlas Search
index, see the :ref:`java-search-indexes` section in the Indexes guide. 

Atlas Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example runs an Atlas Search query by performing the
following actions:

- Constructs a ``$search`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to query for documents in which the ``title``
  field contains the word ``"Alabama"``

- Constructs a ``$project`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.project()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to include the ``title`` field in the query results

- Passes the pipeline stages to the ``aggregate()`` method and prints the results
