If you are using MongoDB in the Cloud (Atlas), you will need to:

- `Create an Atlas Account and 
  Cluster <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/>`_

- :doc:`Set Up Connectivity to Atlas </cloud/connectionstring>` 

Or, if you plan on using a local instance of MongoDB, you will need to:
  
- :doc:`Install MongoDB </server/install>` and start up an instance to 
  which you will connect.
