      Prometheus authentication credentials are specifically designed
      for use with the Prometheus integration in |service-fullname|.
      |service| uses these credentials to only access the Prometheus
      discovery endpoint and scrape Prometheus metrics from |service|
      nodes. They are strictly limited to these functions and do not
      have any additional permissions or capabilities beyond accessing
      and collecting monitoring data.

         Copy your username and password in a secure location. You can't

         * - Discovery Method
           - Description
      
         * - `HTTP Service Discovery <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/>`__
           - This method requires Prometheus v2.28 and later. It
             automatically generates the `scrape_config
             <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config>`__
             part of your `configuration file
             <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file>`__
             to discover targets over an HTTP endpoint.
             
             a. Add the IP of the device hosting your Prometheus instance to the
                :ref:`IP Access List <access-list>`. This grants Prometheus
                the network access to scrape metrics from your |service| clusters.
                Ensure that ``0.0.0.0/0`` isn't on the list. Having this entry
                disables the integration.

                .. include:: /includes/fact-nested-wildcard-ip.rst
      
             b. In the :guilabel:`Choose Discovery API Target Type`
                step in the {+atlas-ui+}, do one of the following tasks:
      
                - Select :guilabel:`Public Internet`.
                - Select :guilabel:`Private IP for Peering`.
                - Select :guilabel:`Private Endpoint`, and then select 
                  or create the endpoints.
      
             c. Insert the following snippet into the ``scrape_configs`` section
                of your ``Prometheus.yml`` file and update it with values for
                your Prometheus integration.

                .. note::

                  For private endpoints, the configuration is 
                  autogenerated based on the selected endpoints.

         * - `File Service Discovery <https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets>`__
           - This method allows Prometheus to read YAML or JSON documents to
             configure the targets to scrape from. You are responsible for
             providing the targets by making a request to the
             :ref:`Discovery API <prometheus-discovery-endpoint>` and
             storing its results in a ``targets.json`` file.
      
             To make the request, substitute the placeholder text in one of
             the following tabs or create your own script in another language.
      
             .. tabs::
      
               .. tab:: Shell Command

                     curl --header 'Accept: application/json' 
                     # Sets the `Authorization` header on every scrape request with the
                     # username and password from the previous step.
                     --user <username>:<password> 
                     # The URL that Prometheus fetches the targets from. 
                     # Replace the <group-id> with the project ID of your Atlas instance.

                     while True:

                       if  r.status_code == 200:
