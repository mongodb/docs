MongoDB releases are available as ``.deb`` packages
for easy installation and management for users of Debian and Ubuntu
systems. While some of these distributions include their own MongoDB
packages, the official packages are generally more up to date. The
procedure for installing MongoDB on these systems is generally
similar; however:

#. Users of systems that run "Upstart," which includes versions of
   Ubuntu since 9.10 "Karmic," use the following tutorial:

   :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu`

#. Users of all other systems, which use SysV style init processes,
   should use the following tutorial:

   :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian`
