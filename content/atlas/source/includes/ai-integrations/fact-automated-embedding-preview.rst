|service| supports two embedding modes:

- **Manual embedding**: Generate embedding vectors on the client's
  side with an embedding model you specify.

- **Automated embedding**: MongoDB embeds text on the server's side
  without needing to generate them manually.
  To learn more, see :dochub:`Automated Embedding <auto-embedding-in-community>`.

  .. important::

     Automated embedding is available as a Preview feature only for
     MongoDB Community Edition v8.2 and later.
     The feature and the corresponding documentation might change at
     any time during the Preview period.
     To learn more, see `Preview Features <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/preview-features/>`__.
