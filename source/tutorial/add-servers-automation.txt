.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-automation-needs-automation-agent.rst


Procedure
---------

Install the {+mdbagent+} on each host that you want |mms| to manage.
The following procedure applies to all operating systems.

Instructions for a specific operating system can be read on
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent`.

On Linux hosts, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use
the same package manager to install the {+mdbagent+}. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
{+mdbagent+}.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have installed the {+mdbagent+} to all your hosts, you can
deploy your first :doc:`replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`,
:doc:`cluster </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`, or :doc:`standalone
</tutorial/deploy-standalone>`.
