     To add or change index options other than
     collation, you must drop the index using the
     :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` method and issue another
     {{method}} operation with the new options.

   - If you create an index with one set of options, and then issue the
     {{method}} method with the same index
     fields and different options (not including collation) without first
     dropping the index, {{method}} will *not*
     rebuild the existing index with the new options.

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-options.rst

   - If you call {{method}} multiple times concurrently
     with the same index specification, only
     the first operation will succeed. All other operations will have
     no effect.
