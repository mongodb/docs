============================================
Use *that*, *which*, and *such as* Correctly
============================================

A **restrictive clause** gives meaning to a sentence because it limits
the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you
change the meaning of the sentence. You can indicate a restrictive
clause with the relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you don't set off
a restrictive clause with commas.

A **nonrestrictive clause** doesn't change the core meaning of the
sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and can use
the relative pronoun *which* or *who* in some cases.

   * - He hired the man **who came from Kansas**. (Not the man from

       on sale.

   * - Enter the username and password **that you just created**.
       (Not the username and password that you created last month.)
     - The hourly backups are rolled into a nightly backup, **which is
       retained for two days**.

   * - Foods such as pizza and ice cream arenâ€™t very good for you.
     - Don't hyphenate words that begin with the prefix *multi*, such
       as *multitenant* and *multifaceted*, unless the root word starts
       with an *i* or a capital letter.

.. _restrictive-clauses:

Make sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

-  Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify
   restrictive clauses in which *that* is missing by looking for two
   successive nouns.
-  Don't substitute *which* for *that*.
-  For the use of *such as*, use a comma before a nonrestrictive clause
   and don't use a comma for a restrictive clause. To tell if the
   clause is nonrestrictive, remove the phrase starting with *such
   as* out of the sentence. See whether the sentence remains true.
