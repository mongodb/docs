.. warning::

   The TTL index does not guarantee that expired data will be deleted
   immediately. There may be a delay between the time a document expires
   and the time it is deleted from the database.

   The background task that removes expired documents runs *every 60
   seconds*. As a result, documents may remain in a collection *after*
   they expire but *before* the background task runs.

   The duration of the removal operation depends on the workload of
   your :program:`mongod` instance. Therefore, expired data may exist
   for some time *beyond* the 60 second period between runs of the
   background task.
