|ak8so| supports :ref:`{+cloud-backup+} <backup-cloud-provider>` for
your |service| {+clusters+}. {+Cloud-backup+} uses the native
snapshot capabilities of your cloud provider to support full-copy
snapshots and localized snapshot storage.

To manage {+cloud-backup+} with |ak8so|, you can specify and 
update the following custom resources:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Custom Resource
     - Purpose

   * - :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` 
     - Defines the backup policy, including the frequency of backups
       and the length of snapshot retention.

   * - :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource`
     - Defines the backup schedule, including the time of day that 
       |service| backs up your {+database-deployment+}, the number
       of days back in time to which you can restore, and the backup policy.

   * - :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource`
     - Defines the characteristics of a {+cluster+}. You
       must set the :setting:`spec.backupRef.name` field to the name of
       the configured backup schedule to enable {+cloud-backup+} for
       the {+cluster+}.

       Additionally, to configure continuous backup, you must set :setting:`spec.deploymentSpec.pitEnabled` to ``true``.

Each time you change any of the supported custom resources, |ak8so|
:ref:`creates or updates <ak8so-create-update-process>` the 
corresponding |service| configuration. 

Considerations
--------------

Review the following considerations:

- You can specify one backup policy per backup schedule.
- You can specify one backup schedule per {+cluster+}, but
  you can use the same backup schedule for multiple 
  {+clusters+}.
- |service| determines the order of nodes to snapshot based on your 
  {+cluster+} configuration. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Cloud Backups <single-region-cloud-backup>`.
- |ak8so| supports automatic :ref:`snapshot distribution <snapshot-distribution>`.
  You can configure this with the ``spec.copySetting`` field in the 
  :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource`.

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <ak8so-bcp>`, you 
   can't modify the :ref:`backup policy <configure-backup-policy>` for 
   an individual {+cluster+} below the minimum requirements set in the 
   {+bcp+}. You can modify the {+cluster+}-level backup policy at any 
   time. |service| augments any preexisting {+cluster+}-level policies 
   to meet the minimum requirements of the {+bcp+}. All new 
   {+clusters+} use the {+bcp+}. If you reduce the frequency of a 
   backup schedule, the change applies only to future backups. Any 
   existing :term:`oplog` remains for the original window. The minimum 
   requirements of the {+bcp+} apply. You can 
   :ref:`configure extra snapshot retention 
   <config-extra-snapshot-retention>`. You can also view backup details 
   for all ``M10+`` {+dedicated-clusters+} including deleted 
   {+clusters+} with retained snapshots. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`backup-retained-snapshots`.

Limitations
-----------

Certain limitations apply to {+cloud-backup+}. To learn more, see 
:ref:`<backup-cloud-provider>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable {+cloud-backup+} for your |ak8so|-managed 
{+cluster+}, you must: 

- Have a running |k8s| cluster with 
  |ak8so| :ref:`deployed <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
- Ensure your |ipaddr| address is in the organization's |api| 
  :ref:`access list <access-list>`.

Procedure
---------

Follow these steps to enable {+cloud-backup+} for your |ak8so|-managed 
{+clusters+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create the backup policy.

     To learn more about the parameters for a backup policy, see
     :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource`.

     **Example:**

     .. code-block:: sh

        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
        kind: AtlasBackupPolicy    
        metadata:
          name: "atlas-default-backuppolicy"
        spec:  
           items:               
              frequencyType: "weekly"
              frequencyInterval: 1
              retentionUnit: "days"
              retentionValue: 7    
         EOF

   .. step:: Create the backup schedule.

      In the :setting:`spec.policy.name` field, specify the 
      ``metadata.name`` from the
      :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` to apply your backup
      policy.

      To learn more about the other parameters for a backup schedule
      see :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource`.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasBackupSchedule   
         metadata:
           name: "atlas-default-backupschedule"      
         spec:
           autoExportEnabled: true
           copySettings:
           - cloudProvider: AWS
             frequencies:
             - HOURLY
             regionName: US_EAST_1
             shouldCopyOplogs: true
           referenceHourOfDay: 10
           referenceMinuteOfHour: 10
           restoreWindowDays: 2
           policy:
             name: atlas-default-backuppolicy
             namespace: mongodb-atlas-system              
         EOF

   .. step:: Apply the backup schedule to the {+cluster+}.

      In the :setting:`spec.backupRef.name` field of the
      :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource`, specify the 
      ``metadata.name`` from the 
      :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource` to apply your
      backup schedule to the {+cluster+}.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasDeployment 
         metadata:
           name: my-atlas-cluster     
         spec:
           backupRef:
             name: atlas-default-backupschedule
             namespace: mongodb-atlas-system              
         EOF
