Read Operations
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Read operations include all operations that return a cursor in
response to application data requests (i.e. *queries*,) and also
include a number of :doc:`aggregation </aggregation>` operations that
do not return a cursor but have similar properties as queries. These
commands include :dbcommand:`aggregate`, :dbcommand:`count`, and
:dbcommand:`distinct`.

.. note::

   All of the examples in this document use the :program:`mongo`
   shell interface. All of these operations are available in an
   idiomatic interface for each language by way of the :doc:`MongoDB
   Driver </applications/drivers>`. See your :api:`driver documentation <>` for
   full API documentation.

The following documents describe the syntax and structure of the
queries applications use to request data from MongoDB and how different
factors affect the efficiency of reads.
