Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure :wikipedia:`TLS/SSL
<Transport_Layer_Security>` to secure communications between the
{+connector-long+} and your MongoDB deployment.

To use TLS/SSL, your application and each of your Spark
workers must have access to cryptographic certificates that prove their
identity. Store the certificates in your JVM trust store and your JVM
key store. You can configure access to these certificates through your Spark
configuration file, or when launching a Spark job from the command line.

Create a JVM Trust Store
------------------------

The JVM trust store saves certificates that securely identify other applications
with which your application interacts. Using these certificates, your
application can prove that the connection to another application is genuine and
secure.

Create a trust store with the `keytool <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__ command line tool provided as part of the
JDK:

.. code-block:: sh

   keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>
           -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <password>

Create a JVM Key Store
----------------------

The JVM key store saves certificates that securely identify your application to
other applications. Using these certificates, other
applications can prove that the connection to your application is genuine and
secure.

Create a key store by using the `keytool
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__, or
`openssl <https://www.openssl.org/docs/>`__ command line tools.

Enable TLS/SSL
--------------

You can enable TLS/SSL for the connection to your MongoDB instance through the
``tls`` parameter in your connection URI.

The following example shows a connection URI with the ``tls`` option assigned
to ``true`` to enable TLS/SSL:

.. code-block:: none

   "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>?tls=true"

For more information about creating a connection string, see the
:manual:`Connection String guide <reference/connection-string/>` on the server
manual.

Configure Access to Certificate Stores
--------------------------------------

To configure your Spark application to access the certificates stored in your
JVM trust store and JVM key store, the following system properties must be set:

- javax.net.ssl.trustStore
- javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
- javax.net.ssl.keyStore
- javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword

Set the Properties in Your Spark Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the system properties in your Spark configuration file as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<Path to your trust store> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Your trust store password> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<Path to your key store> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<Your key store password>"

   spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<Path to your trust store> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Your trust store password> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<Path to your key store> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<Your key store password>"

Set the Properties From the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the system properties from the command line by adding them with the
``--conf`` flag when you submit a Spark job:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./bin/spark-submit --name "<Your app name>" \
                      --master "<Master URL>" \
                      --conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<Path to your trust store> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Your trust store password> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<Path to your key store> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<Your key store password>" \
                      sparkApplication.jar \
                      --conf "spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<Path to your trust store> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Your trust store password> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<Path to your key store> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<Your key store password>" \
                      sparkApplication.jar
