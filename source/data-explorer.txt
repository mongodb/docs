|mms| provides the ability to introspect collections in your managed
MongoDB deployments via the :guilabel:`Data Explorer` view. Data
Explorer reads from the primary unless the primary is unavailable. If
the primary is unavailable, Data Explorer reads from a non-hidden,
non-delayed secondary member. 

Data Explorer uses the Automation Agent to retrieve all data. No |mms|
configuration changes are required to access the Data Explorer.
