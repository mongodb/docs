{+avs+} queries take the form of an 
:manual:`aggregation pipeline stage </aggregation>`. For the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries, {+avs+} returns the results of your
semantic search.

.. note::

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline:

Definition
----------

The :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage performs an |ann| or |enn| search on
a vector in the specified field. 

.. _vectorSearch-ann:

|ann| Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |ann| search, {+avs+} finds vector embeddings in your data that are
closest to the vector embedding in your query based on their proximity
in multi-dimensional space and based on the number of neighbors that it
considers. It uses the |hnsw| algorithm and finds the vector embeddings
most similar to the vector embedding in your query without scanning
every vector. Therefore, |ann| search is ideal for querying large
datasets without significant filtering.

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-avs-recall.rst

.. _vectorSearch-enn:

|enn| Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |enn| search, {+avs+} exhaustively searches all the indexed vector
embeddings by calculating the distance between all the embeddings 
and finds the exact nearest neighbor for the vector embedding in your
query. This is computationally intensive and might negatively impact
query latency. Therefore, we recommend |enn| searches for the following
use-cases:

- You want to determine the :term:`recall` and accuracy of your |ann| query
  using the ideal, exact results for the |enn| query.
- You want to query less than 10000 documents without having to tune the 
  number of nearest neighbors to consider.
- Your want to include selective pre-filters in your query against
  collections where less than 5% of your data meets the given pre-filter.

Syntax 
------

The field that you want to search must be indexed as {+avs+}
:ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type inside a :ref:`vectorSearch 
<avs-types-vector-search>` index type. 

.. pipeline:: $vectorSearch

   A ``$vectorSearch`` pipeline has the following prototype form: 

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "$vectorSearch": {
          "exact": true | false,
          "filter": {<filter-specification>},
          "index": "<index-name>",
          "limit": <number-of-results>,
          "numCandidates": <number-of-candidates>,
          "path": "<field-to-search>",
          "queryVector": [<array-of-numbers>]
        }
      }

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-options:

Fields 
------

The ``$vectorSearch`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``exact``
     - boolean
     - Optional 
     - This is required if ``numCandidates`` is omitted. 

       Flag that specifies whether to run |enn| or |ann| search. Value
       can be one of the following: 
 
       - ``false`` - to run |ann| search 
       - ``true`` - to run |enn| search

       If omitted, defaults to ``false``. 

       .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-requirements-cluster-version-ann-enn.rst

   * - ``filter``
     - document
     - Optional
     - :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` expression that
       compares an indexed field to use as a pre-filter. 
       You can filter on {+avs-filter-types+}.

       To learn which MQL operators {+avs+} supports
       in your filter, see :ref:`vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter`.

   * - ``index`` 
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Name of the {+avs+} index to use.
       
       {+avs+} doesn't return results if you misspell the index name or 
       if the specified index doesn't already exist on the {+cluster+}.

   * - ``limit`` 
     - number 
     - Required 
     - Number (of type ``int`` only) of documents to return in the
       results. This value can't exceed the value of ``numCandidates`` if
       you specify ``numCandidates``.

   * - ``numCandidates``
     - number 
     - Optional 
     - This field is required if ``exact`` is ``false`` or omitted.
       
       Number of nearest neighbors to use during the search. Value must 
       be less than or equal to (``<=``) ``10000``. You can't specify a
       number less than the number of documents to return (``limit``).
       
       We recommend that you specify a number at least 20 times higher than the 
       number of documents to return (``limit``) to increase accuracy.
       
       This overrequest pattern is the recommended way to 
       trade off latency and :term:`recall` in your |ann| searches, 
       and we recommend tuning this parameter based on your specific dataset 
       size and query requirements.

       To learn more about other variables that might impact this parameter, see :ref:`avs-num-candidates`.

   * - ``path``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Indexed :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type field to search.

   * - ``queryVector``
     - array of numbers 
     - Required 
     - Array of numbers of ``float32``, |bson|
       :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with subtype
       ``float32``, or |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` 
       vectors with subtype ``int1`` or ``int8`` type that represent the
       query vector. 

       To learn more about generating |bson| ``binData``
       vectors with subtype ``float32``, ``int8``, ``int1``,
       see :ref:`avs-bindata-vector-subtype`. 

       The array size must match the number of vector ``dimensions`` 
       specified in the :ref:`index definition <avs-types-vector-search>`  
       for the field. 

       You must embed your query with the same model that you used to
       embed the data.

       You can query your embeddings with full-fidelity vectors,
       as long as the vector subtype is the same. This is only possible with
       ``binData`` vectors with subtype ``float32``. If you use any other
       subtype (``int8`` or ``int1``), {+avs+} doesn't return any results or errors.

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-clients:

Supported Clients
-----------------

You can run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries by using the 
{+atlas-ui+}, {+mongosh+}, and any :driver:`MongoDB driver </>`.

You can also use {+avs+} with local |service| deployments that you
create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see :atlascli:`Create a
Local Atlas Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-limitations:

Limitations 
~~~~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` is supported only on |service| {+clusters+}
running the following MongoDB versions: 

- v6.0.11
- v7.0.2 and later (including :abbr:`RCs (Release Candidates)`). 

:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` can't be used in 
:manual:`view definition </core/views/>` and the following pipeline
stages:  

- :pipeline:`$lookup` sub-pipeline :icon-fa5:`star`
- :pipeline:`$facet` pipeline stage

:icon-fa5:`star` You can pass the results of :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
to this stage.

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-behavior:

Behavior 
--------

:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` must be the first stage of any pipeline where it
appears. 

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-index:

{+avs+} Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must index the fields to search using the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
stage inside a :ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index
definition. You can index the following types of fields in an {+avs+}
:ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index definition: 

- Fields that contain vector embeddings as :ref:`vector
  <avs-types-vector-search>` type.  
- Additional fields as the :ref:`filter <avs-types-vector-search>` 
  type to enable vector search on pre-filtered data.

To learn more about these 
{+avs+} field types, see :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`. 

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score:

{+avs+} Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+avs+} assigns a score, in a fixed range from ``0`` to ``1`` 
(where ``0`` indicates low similarity and ``1`` indicates high
similarity), to every document that it returns. 

The score is calculated according to the similarity measure that
you specify in the :ref:`index definition <avs-types-vector-search-options>`. 
For ``cosine`` and ``dotProduct`` :ref:`similarities <avs-types-vector-search-options>`,
{+avs+} normalizes the score to ensure that the score is not negative.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Cosine
      :tabid: cosine

      For ``cosine``, {+avs+} uses the following algorithm to normalize the
      score: 

      .. code-block:: shell 
         :copyable: false 

         score = (1 + cosine(v1,v2)) / 2

      This algorithm normalizes the score by considering the similarity score of the 
      document vector (``v1``) and the query vector (``v2``), which has the range 
      [``-1``, ``1``]. {+avs+} adds ``1`` to the similarity score to normalize 
      the score to a range [``0``, ``2``] and then divides by ``2`` to ensure a 
      value between ``0`` and ``1``.

   .. tab:: Dot Product
      :tabid: dotProduct
    
      For ``dotProduct``, {+avs+} uses the following algorithm to normalize
      the score:  

      .. code-block:: shell 
         :copyable: false 

         score = (1 + dotProduct(v1,v2)) / 2

      This algorithm normalizes the score by considering the similarity score of the 
      document vector (``v1``) and the query vector (``v2``), which has the range 
      [``-1``, ``1``]. {+avs+} adds ``1`` to the similarity score to normalize 
      the score to a range [``0``, ``2``] and then divides by ``2`` to ensure a 
      value between ``0`` and ``1``.

   .. tab:: Euclidean 
      :tabid: euclidean
    
      For ``euclidean`` similarity, {+avs+} uses the following algorithm to
      normalize the score to ensure a value between ``0`` and ``1``: 

      .. code-block:: shell 
         :copyable: false 

         score = 1 / (1 + euclidean(v1,v2))

      This algorithm normalizes the score by calculating the euclidean distance,
      which is the distance between the document vector (``v1``) and the query 
      vector (``v2``), which has the range [``0``, ``∞``]. {+avs+} then transforms 
      the distance to a similarity score by adding ``1`` to the distance and then 
      divides ``1`` by the result to ensure a value between ``0`` and ``1``.

Each returned document includes the score as metadata. 
To include each returned document's score along with the
result set, use a :pipeline:`$project` stage in your aggregation
pipeline.

To retrieve the score of your {+avs+} query results, use
``vectorSearchScore`` as the value in the :manual:`$meta 
</reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression. That is, after the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage, in the :pipeline:`$project` stage, the
``score`` field takes the :manual:`$meta
</reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression. The expression
requires the ``vectorSearchScore`` value to return the score of
documents for the vector search. 

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 11

      db.<collection>.aggregate([
        {
          "$vectorSearch": {
            <query-syntax>
          }
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "<field-to-include>": 1,
            "<field-to-exclude>": 0,
            "score": { "$meta": "vectorSearchScore" }
          }
        }
      ]) 

.. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-avs-pre-filtering-score-impact.rst

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter:

{+avs+} Pre-Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option matches |bson|
{+avs-filter-types+}.

You **must** index the fields that you want to filter your data by as the 
:ref:`filter <avs-types-vector-search>` type in a :ref:`vectorSearch
<avs-types-vector-search>` type index definition. Filtering your data is 
useful to narrow the scope of your semantic search and ensure that not
all vectors are considered for comparison. 

{+avs+} supports the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option
for the following :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` 
:manual:`operators </reference/operator/query/>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Type
     - :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` operator

   * - Equals 
     - :query:`$eq`, :query:`$ne`

   * - Range 
     - :query:`$gt`, :query:`$lt`, :query:`$gte`, :query:`$lte`

   * - In set 
     - :query:`$in`, :query:`$nin`

   * - Logical 
     - :query:`$not`, :query:`$nor`, :expression:`$and`, :expression:`$or`

.. note:: 

   The :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option doesn't support other
   :manual:`query operators </reference/operator/query/>`,
   :manual:`aggregation pipeline operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>`,
   or :ref:`{+fts+} operators <operators-ref>`.

Considerations
``````````````

{+avs+} supports the short form of :query:`$eq`. In the short
form, you don't need to specify ``$eq`` in the query. 

.. example::
   
   For example, consider the following filter with ``$eq``: 

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false 

      "filter": { "_id": { "$eq": ObjectId("5a9427648b0beebeb69537a5") }

   You can run the preceding query using the short form of ``$eq`` in the
   following way: 

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false 

      "filter": { "_id": ObjectId("5a9427648b0beebeb69537a5") }

You can also specify an array of filters in a single query 
by using the :expression:`$and` operator.

.. example::
   
   For example, consider the following pre-filter for
   documents with a ``genres`` field equal to ``Action`` and a
   ``year`` field with the value ``1999``, ``2000``, or ``2001``:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false 

      "filter": {
        "$and": [
          { "genres": "Action" },
          { "year": { "$in": [ 1999, 2000, 2001 ] } }
        ]
      }

.. _avs-num-candidates:

``numCandidates`` Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |ann| search, we recommend that you specify a ``numCandidates``  
number at least 20 times higher than the number of documents to return 
(``limit``) to increase accuracy. For example, if you set ``limit`` to 
return ``5`` results, consider setting ``numCandidates`` to ``100`` as 
a starting point.

This overrequest pattern is the recommended way to 
trade off latency and :term:`recall` in your |ann| searches. 
However, we recommend tuning this parameter based on your specific dataset 
size and query requirements. To ensure that you get accurate results,
consider the following variables:

- **Index Size**: Larger collections typically require higher ``numCandidates`` values 
  to maintain recall. A collection with millions of vectors might need significantly 
  more candidates than one with thousands of vectors.

- **Limit Value**: Because ``numCandidates`` is highly correlated with the index 
  size, low ``limit`` values require proportionally 
  higher ``numCandidates`` values to maintain recall.

- **Vector Quantization**: :ref:`Quantized vectors <avs-quantization>` 
  reduce storage at the cost of accuracy. Using quantized 
  vectors (``int8`` or ``int1`` subtypes) might require higher ``numCandidates`` 
  values compared to full precision ``float32`` vectors to maintain similar recall.

.. _vectorSearch-concurrent-queries:

Parallel Query Execution Across Segments 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend dedicated :ref:`Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>`
to isolate vector search query processing. You might see improved query 
performance on the dedicated Search Nodes. Note that the high-CPU systems
might provide more performance improvement. When {+avs+} runs on search
nodes, {+avs+} parallelizes query execution across segments of data. 

Parallelization of query processing improves the response time in many
cases, such as queries on large datasets. Using intra-query parallelism
during {+avs+} query processing utilizes more resources, but improves
latency for each individual query. 

.. note:: 

   {+avs+} doesn't guarantee that each query will run concurrently. For
   example, when too many concurrent queries are queued, {+avs+} might
   fall back to single-threaded execution.

   You might see inconsistent results for the same successive queries.
   To mitigate this, increase the value of ``numCandidates`` in your
   :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries.

.. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following queries search the sample ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
collection using the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. The queries search
the ``plot_embedding`` field, which contains embeddings created using the
``text-embedding-ada-002`` embedding model from OpenAI.
