   |reconfig| waits until a majority of voting
   replica set members install the new replica configuration before
   returning success. A voting member is *any* replica set member where
   :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is ``1``, including arbiters.

   Replica set members propagate their replica configuration via
   :ref:`heartbeats <replica-set-heartbeats>`. Whenever a member learns
   of a configuration with a higher :rsconf:`version` and
   :rsconf:`term`, it installs the new configuration. The
   reconfiguration process has two distinct 'waiting' phases:

   \1) Wait for the current configuration to be *committed* before installing the new configuration.
      The "current" configuration refers to the replica configuration in
      use by the primary at the time |reconfig| is issued. 
      
      .. _replSetReconfig-configuration-committed:

      A configuration is committed when:

      - A majority of voting replica set members have installed the
        current configuration, *and*

      - All writes which were :writeconcern:`"majority"` committed in
        the previous configuration have also replicated to a majority in
        the current configuration.
      
      Typically, the current configuration has already been installed on
      a majority of voting replica set members. However, the majority
      committed writes in the previous configuration may not all be
      committed in the current configuration. :rsconf:`Delayed
      <members[n].secondaryDelaySecs>` members *or* members that are
      :method:`lagging behind <rs.printSecondaryReplicationInfo()>` the
      primary can increase the time spent in this phase.
         
      If the operation was issued with a 
      |reconfig-maxTimeMS| limit *and* 
      the operation exceeds the limit while waiting, the operation
      returns an error and discard the new configuration. The 
      limit is *cumulative* and does not reset after proceeding to 
      the next phase.

   \2) Wait for a majority of voting members in the new configuration to install the new configuration.
      The "new" configuration refers to the replica configuration 
      specified to |reconfig|.

      The primary installs and begins using the new replica
      configuration before propagating the configuration to the
      remaining replica set members. The operation only waits for a
      majority of voting members to install the new configuration, and
      does not require waiting for the new configuration to be
      :ref:`committed <replSetReconfig-configuration-committed>`.
            
      If the operation was issued with a |reconfig-maxTimeMS| limit
      *and* the operation exceeds the limit while waiting, the operation
      returns an error *but* continues using and propagating the new
      configuration.

   Issuing a |reconfig-force| reconfiguration
   immediately installs the new configuration regardless of the
   commitment status of the previous configuration. Force
   reconfiguration can cause unexpected behavior, such as the
   rollback of :writeconcern:`"majority"` committed write operations.

   To check the commitment status of the current replica configuration,
   issue :dbcommand:`replSetGetConfig` with the 
   :ref:`commitmentStatus <replSetGetConfig-commitmentStatus>` parameter 
   on the replica set :term:`primary`.

   |reconfig| by default allows adding or
   removing no more than ``1`` :rsconf:`voting <members[n].votes>`
   member at a time. For example, a new configuration can make at most
   *one* of the following changes to the cluster :rsconf:`membership
   <members[n].votes>`:

   - Adding a new voting replica set member.

   - Removing an existing voting replica set member.

   - Modifying the :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` for an existing replica
     set member.

   To add or remove multiple voting members, issue a series of
   |reconfig| operations to add or remove one member at a
   time.

   Issuing a |reconfig-force| reconfiguration
   immediately installs the new configuration even if it adds or removes
   multiple voting members. Force reconfiguration can cause unexpected
   behavior, such as the rollback of :writeconcern:`"majority"`
   committed write operations.
