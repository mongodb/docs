Example
-------

The following example illustrates a ``delete`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "delete",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      },
      "documentKey": {
         "_id": ObjectId("599af247bb69cd89961c986d")
      }
   }

The ``fullDocument`` document is omitted as the document no longer exists at the
time the change stream cursor sends the ``delete`` event to the client.
