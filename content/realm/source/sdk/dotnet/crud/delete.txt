Delete an Object
----------------

.. example::

   The following code shows how to delete one object from
   its realm:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/Delete.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-delete-multiple-objects:
.. _dotnet-delete-collection:

Delete Multiple Objects
-----------------------

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to delete a
   collection from a realm:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/DeleteCollection.cs
      :language: csharp

Delete an Object and its Dependent Objects
------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you have :ref:`dependent objects
<dotnet-client-relationships>` that you want to delete when
you delete the parent object. We call this a **chaining
delete**. Realm will not delete the dependent objects for
you. If you do not delete the objects yourself, they will
remain orphaned in your realm. Whether or not this is a
problem depends on your application's needs.

Currently, the best way to delete dependent objects is to
iterate through the dependencies and delete them before
deleting the parent object.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to perform a
   chaining delete by first deleting all of Ali's dogs,
   then deleting Ali:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/ChainingDelete.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-delete-all-of-object:
.. _dotnet-delete-all-object-of-a-specific-type:

Delete All Object of a Specific Type
------------------------------------

Realm supports deleting all instances of a
:ref:`Realm type <dotnet-objects>` from a
realm.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to delete all
   Dog instances from a realm:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/DeleteAllOfClass.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-delete-all-objects-in-a-realm:
.. _dotnet-delete-all:

Delete All Objects in a Realm
-----------------------------

It is possible to delete all objects from the realm. This
does not affect the schema of the realm. This is useful for
quickly clearing out your realm while prototyping.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to delete everything
   from a realm:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/DeleteAll.cs
      :language: csharp
