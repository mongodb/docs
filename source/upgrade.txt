Overview
--------

In this section, you can identify the changes you must
make to your application to upgrade your driver to a new version.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new driver version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) your
  application runs on. To view compatibility information, see the
  :ref:`Compatibility <scala-compatibility>` page.
- Address any breaking changes between the current version of the driver
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <scala-breaking-changes>` section. To learn
  more about {+mdb-server+} release compatibility changes, see the
  :ref:`<scala-server-release-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To minimize the number of changes your application might require when
   you upgrade driver versions in the future, use the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+}. <scala-stable-api>`

.. _scala-breaking-changes:

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification in a convention or behavior in
a specific version of the driver that might prevent your application from
working properly if not addressed before upgrading.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that
introduced them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking
changes between the current and upgrade versions. For example, if you
are upgrading the driver from v4.0 to v4.7, address all breaking changes from
the version after v4.0 including any listed for v4.7.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v5.2:

Version 5.2 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6. To learn more about this change,
  see the :ref:`<scala-server-release-change-v5.2>` section.

- Revises the `mongodb-crypt <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-crypt>`__
  dependency versioning to match the versioning for the JVM drivers. Future versions of
  ``mongodb-crypt`` will be released alongside the driver and will share the same version number.
  You must upgrade your ``mongodb-crypt`` dependency to v5.2.0 when upgrading your driver for
  this release.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v5.1:

Version 5.1 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- When using the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication mechanism, you must
  not include comma characters in the ``authMechanismProperties`` connection
  string value.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v5.0:

Version 5.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Introduces the following changes to the ``ConnectionId`` class:

  - The ``ConnectionId`` constructor now accepts a value of type ``long`` as its second
    parameter instead of type ``int``. Similarly, the constructor now accepts a value of
    type ``Long`` as its third parameter instead of type ``Integer``. Because this change breaks
    binary compatibility, recompile any existing code that calls the
    ``ConnectionId`` constructor.

  - The ``withServerValue()`` method now accepts a parameter of type ``long`` rather than
    type ``int``. Because this change breaks binary compatibility, you must recompile any code
    that calls the ``withServerValue()`` method.

  - The ``getServerValue()`` method now returns a value of type ``Long`` instead of type
    ``Integer``. Similarly, the ``getLocalValue()`` method returns a value of type
    ``long`` instead of type ``int``. Because this change breaks both binary and source
    compatibility, update any source code that uses these methods and rebuild your binary.

- Replaces the following record annotations from the
  ``org.bson.codecs.record.annotations`` package with
  annotations of the same name from the ``org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations`` package:

  - ``BsonId``
  - ``BsonProperty``
  - ``BsonRepresentation``

- Changes the data type of the ``connectTimeout`` timeout duration parameter for the
  ``SocketSettings.Builder.connectTimeout()`` and
  ``SocketSettings.Builder.readTimeout()`` methods. The data type of this
  parameter is now ``long`` instead of ``int``.

  In earlier versions, this parameter is of type ``int`` for both methods. This
  change breaks binary compatibility and requires recompiling, but does not
  require code changes.

- Removes the ``Filters.eqFull()`` method, released
  exclusively in ``Beta``, which allowed you
  to construct an equality filter when performing a vector search.
  Instead, you can use the ``Filters.eq()`` method when instantiating a
  ``VectorSearchOptions`` type, as shown in the following code:

  .. code-block:: java

     VectorSearchOptions opts = vectorSearchOptions().filter(eq("x", 8));

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v5.0-observables:

- Removes the ``org.mongodb.scala.ObservableImplicits.ToSingleObservableVoid``
  implicit class. The ``org.reactivestreams.Publisher[Void]`` type no longer
  converts automatically to ``org.mongodb.scala.SingleObservable[Void]``. The
  API also exposes ``org.mongodb.scala.Observable[Unit]`` instead of
  ``org.mongodb.scala.Observable[Void]``.

  For more information, see the `Observable
  <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/5.0/apidocs/mongo-scala-driver/org/mongodb/scala/Observable.html>`__
  trait in the Scala API documentation.

- Changes how ``ClusterSettings`` computes the ``ClusterConnectionMode``
  setting, making it more consistent by using the specified
  replica set name, regardless of how it is configured. Previously, the driver
  considered the replica set name only if it was set in the connection string.

  For example, the following two code samples both return the value
  ``ClusterConnectionMode.MULTIPLE``. Previously, the second example returned
  ``ClusterConnectionMode.SINGLE``.

  .. code-block:: java

     ClusterSettings.builder()
         .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?replicaSet=replset"))
         .build()
         .getMode()

  .. code-block:: java

     ClusterSettings.builder()
         .hosts(Collections.singletonList(
                 new ServerAddress("127.0.0.1", 27017)
         ))
         .requiredReplicaSetName("replset")
         .build()
         .getMode()

- ``BsonDecimal128`` values respond to method calls in the same way as
  ``Decimal128`` values. ``BsonDecimal128.isNumber()`` now returns ``true`` and
  ``BsonDecimal128.asNumber()`` returns the equivalent ``BsonNumber``.

- Removes the `ServerAddress <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/ServerAddress.html>`__
  methods ``getSocketAddress()`` and ``getSocketAddresses()``.

  Instead of ``getSocketAddress()``, use the ``getByName()`` instance
  method of ``java.net.InetAddress``.

  Instead of ``getSocketAddresses()``, use the ``getAllByName()`` instance
  method of ``java.net.InetAddress``.

- Removes the `UnixServerAddress <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/UnixServerAddress.html>`__
  methods ``getSocketAddress()`` and ``getUnixSocketAddress()``.

  Instead of ``getSocketAddress()``, use the ``getByName()`` instance
  method of ``java.net.InetAddress``.

  Instead of ``getUnixSocketAddress()``, construct an instance of
  ``jnr.unixsocket.UnixSocketAddress``. Pass the full path of the UNIX
  socket file to the constructor. By default, MongoDB creates a UNIX
  socket file located at ``"/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock"``. To learn more
  about the ``UnixSocketAddress`` class, see the `UnixSocketAddress <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.jnr/jnr-unixsocket/latest/jnr/unixsocket/UnixSocketAddress.html>`__ API documentation.

- Removes the ``Parameterizable`` interface. Instead of
  implementing this interface on a custom ``Codec`` type,
  override the ``CodecProvider.get()`` method on the
  codec's ``CodecProvider`` if the codec is intended for a parameterized
  type.

- Removes the ``isSlaveOk()`` method from the
  ``ReadPreference`` and ``TaggableReadPreference`` classes. To check whether a read preference allows
  reading from a secondary member of a replica set, use the ``isSecondaryOk()`` methods from
  these classes instead.

- Removes the ``DBCollection.getStats()`` and ``DBCollection.isCapped()``
  helper methods for the ``collStats`` command. Instead of these methods, you can use the
  ``$collStats`` aggregation pipeline stage.

- Removes the ``MapCodec`` and ``IterableCodec`` classes.
  Instead of ``MapCodec``, use ``MapCodecProvider``. Instead of ``IterableCodec``,
  use ``CollectionCodecProvider``, or ``IterableCodecProvider`` for ``Iterable``
  types that aren't ``Collection`` types.

- Removes the ``sharded()`` and ``nonAtomic()`` methods from the
  ``MapReducePublisher`` and ``MapReduceIterable`` classes.

- Removes the following methods for use with ``geoHaystack`` indexes:

  - ``Indexes.geoHaystack()``
  - ``IndexOptions.getBucketSize()``
  - ``IndexOptions.bucketSize()``

  Instead, you can use the ``$geoNear`` aggregation pipeline stage or a geospatial
  query operator on a 2d index. For more information, see the
  :manual:`Geospatial Queries </geospatial-queries>` page in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- Removes the ``oplogReplay`` option from find operations. The
  following ``oplogReplay`` methods are no longer available:

  - ``DBCursor.oplogReplay()``
  - ``DBCollectionFindOptions.isOplogReplay()``
  - ``DBCollectionFindOptions.oplogReplay()``
  - ``FindPublisher.oplogReplay()``
  - ``FindIterable.oplogReplay()``

- Removes the following ``Exception`` constructors:

  - ``MongoBulkWriteException(BulkWriteResult, List<BulkWriteError>, WriteConcernError, ServerAddress)``
  - ``MongoCursorNotFoundException(long, ServerAddress)``
  - ``MongoQueryException(ServerAddress, int, String)``
  - ``MongoQueryException(ServerAddress, int, String, String)``
  - ``MongoQueryException(MongoCommandException)``

- Removes the following overloads for the ``BulkWriteResult.acknowledged()`` method:

  - ``acknowledged(Type, int, List<BulkWriteUpsert>)``
  - ``acknowledged(Type, int, Integer, List<BulkWriteUpsert>)``
  - ``acknowledged(int, int, int, Integer, List<BulkWriteUpsert>)``

- Removes the following ``ChangeStreamDocument`` constructors:

  - ``ChangeStreamDocument(String, BsonDocument, BsonDocument, BsonDocument,
    TDocument, TDocument, BsonDocument, ...)``
  - ``ChangeStreamDocument(String, BsonDocument, BsonDocument, BsonDocument,
    TDocument, BsonDocument, BsonTimestamp, ...)``
  - ``ChangeStreamDocument(OperationType, BsonDocument, BsonDocument, BsonDocument,
    TDocument, BsonDocument, BsonTimestamp, ...)``

- Removes the following constructors for events:

  - ``CommandEvent(RequestContext, int, ConnectionDescription, String)``
  - ``CommandEvent(int, ConnectionDescription, String)``
  - ``CommandEvent(RequestContext, long, int, ConnectionDescription, String)``
  - ``CommandFailedEvent(RequestContext, int, ConnectionDescription, String,
    long, Throwable)``
  - ``CommandFailedEvent(int, ConnectionDescription, String, long, Throwable)``
  - ``CommandStartedEvent(RequestContext, int, ConnectionDescription, String,
    String, BsonDocument)``
  - ``CommandStartedEvent(int, ConnectionDescription, String, String, BsonDocument)``
  - ``CommandSucceededEvent(RequestContext, int, ConnectionDescription, String,
    BsonDocument, long)``
  - ``CommandSucceededEvent(int, ConnectionDescription, String, BsonDocument, long)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckedInEvent(ConnectionId)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckedOutEvent(ConnectionId, long)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckedOutEvent(ConnectionId)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent(ServerId, long, Reason)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent(ServerId, Reason)``
  - ``ConnectionCheckOutStartedEvent(ServerId)``
  - ``ConnectionReadyEvent(ConnectionId)``
  - ``ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent(ConnectionId, long, Throwable)``
  - ``ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent(ConnectionId, BsonDocument, long)``

- Removes the ``errorLabels`` option from the ``WriteConcernError``
  class. This includes the ``addLabel()`` and ``getErrorLabels()`` methods and the
  constructor that includes an ``errorLabels`` parameter. Instead, you can use
  the error labels included in the ``MongoException`` object that contains the
  ``WriteConcernError``.

- Removes the following classes from the
  ``com.mongodb.event`` package:

  - ``ConnectionAddedEvent``
  - ``ConnectionPoolOpenedEvent``
  - ``ConnectionRemovedEvent``
  - ``ClusterListenerAdapter``
  - ``ConnectionPoolListenerAdapter``
  - ``ServerListenerAdapter``
  - ``ServerMonitorListenerAdapter``

  The driver also removes the following related methods from the
  ``ConnectionPoolListener`` interface:

  - ``connectionAdded()``
  - ``connectionPoolOpened()``
  - ``connectionRemoved()``

  For more information about the ``com.mongodb.event`` package, see the
  `API documentation. <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/package-summary.html>`__

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v5.0-list-collections:

- Adds the ``authorizedCollection`` option for the ``listCollections`` command.
  This introduces a breaking binary change in the ``MongoDatabase.listCollectionNames()``
  method. This change does not require any changes to source code, but you must
  recompile any code that uses this method.

- Removes the following methods and types related to the
  `Stream
  <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.11/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/Stream.html>`__
  interface:

  - ``MongoClientSettings.Builder.streamFactoryFactory()`` method.
    Use the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder.transportSettings()`` method instead.
  - ``MongoClientSettings.getStreamFactoryFactory()`` method.
    Use the ``MongoClientSettings.getTransportSettings()`` method instead.
  - ``NettyStreamFactoryFactory`` class.
    Instead, call the ``TransportSettings.nettyBuilder()`` method to create
    a ``NettyTransportSettings`` object. Then, call the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder.transportSettings()``
    method to apply the settings.
  - ``NettyStreamFactory`` class.
  - ``AsynchronousSocketChannelStreamFactory`` class.
  - ``AsynchronousSocketChannelStreamFactoryFactory`` class.
  - ``BufferProvider`` interface.
  - ``SocketStreamFactory`` class.
  - ``Stream`` interface.
  - ``StreamFactory`` interface.
  - ``StreamFactoryFactory`` interface.
  - ``TlsChannelStreamFactoryFactory`` class.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v4.8:

Version 4.8 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Ends support for connecting to {+mdb-server+} versions v3.4 and
  earlier. To learn more about this change, see the :ref:`<scala-server-release-change-v4.8>`
  section.
- Requires adding an explicit dependency on the ``org.bson.codecs.record``
  module if your application deploys the driver in an OSGi container and
  relies on the driver for encoding and decoding Java records.

- ``RecordCodec`` deserializes POJOs and record classes that are specified
  as type parameters of ``List`` or ``Map`` fields to the proper record and POJO types.
  Previously, this codec deserialized them as ``Document`` values.

  For example, the following record class definitions show a ``Book`` record
  that contains a ``List`` that receives a ``Chapter`` type parameter:

  .. code-block:: java

     public record Book(String title, List<Chapter> chapters) {}
     public record Chapter(Integer number, String text) {}

  Starting in this version, the codec deserializes data in the ``List`` into
  ``Chapter`` record classes instead of ``Document`` values.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v4.7:

Version 4.7 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- The ``setWindowFields`` builder API is no longer in beta. The new pipeline
  stage builder method breaks binary and source compatibility. See the
  `Aggregates <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.7/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Aggregates.html>`__
  API documentation for information about the new ``setWindowFields()`` method signatures.

  If your application uses this builder in a version earlier than v4.7, update
  your source code to use the new method signature and rebuild your binary.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v4.2:

Version 4.2 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Updates the ``ObjectId`` class and its ``serialVersionUID`` field
  to use a new format that minimizes serialization compatibility issues
  across different versions of the driver.

  If an application using driver version 4.2 or later attempts to
  perform Java Object Serialization on any objects that contain an
  ``ObjectId`` and were serialized by a prior version of the driver, Java
  throws an ``InvalidClassException``.

  To learn more about Java Object Serialization, see `Serializable Objects 
  <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html>`__ in
  the Java documentation.

.. _scala-breaking-changes-v4.0:

Version 4.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Removes several classes and methods marked as deprecated in the 3.12 release.
- Modifies insert helper methods to return an ``InsertOneResult`` or
  ``InsertManyResult`` object instead of ``void``.
- Modifies ``toJson()`` methods in the ``BsonDocument``, ``Document``, and
  ``DbObject`` classes to return a relaxed JSON format instead of a strict JSON
  format. This makes the JSON documents more readable, but can make it more
  difficult to identify the BSON type information, such as the difference
  between a 32-bit and 64-bit integer. If your application relies on the
  strict JSON format, use the strict mode when reading or writing data.
- Changes the default BSON representation of ``java.util.UUID`` values
  from ``JAVA_LEGACY`` to ``UNSPECIFIED``. Applications that store or retrieve
  UUID values must explicitly specify which representation to use. You can
  specify the representation in the ``uuidRepresentation`` property of
  a ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

  The UUID representation that you specify strictly controls how the driver
  decodes UUIDs. In version 4.0, the ``JAVA_LEGACY`` representation works
  only with subtype 3. In previous versions of the driver, if you specified the
  ``JAVA_LEGACY`` representation, the driver would decode binary objects
  of subtypes 3 and 4 as UUIDs. 

  For a list of members in the ``UuidRepresentation`` enum, see the
  `v4.0 API documentation. <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.0/apidocs/bson/org/bson/UuidRepresentation.html>`__

- The connection pool no longer restricts the number of wait queue threads
  or asynchronous tasks that require a connection to MongoDB. The
  application throttles requests as necessary rather than depending on
  the driver to throw a ``MongoWaitQueueFullException``.
- The driver no longer logs using the ``java.util.logging`` package
  and only supports the SLF4J logging framework.
- The embedded and Android drivers were removed. If your application
  relies on these drivers, you must continue to use a 3.x Java driver
  version.
- The uber JARs for the Java driver, ``mongo-java-driver`` and ``mongodb-driver``, are no
  longer published. If your application relies on these uber JARs, remove
  them as a dependency and use one of the following packages instead:
  
  - If your application uses the current API, add the ``mongodb-driver-sync`` package
    as a dependency.
  - If your application uses the legacy API, add the ``mongodb-driver-legacy`` package
    as a dependency.

- Several classes introduce binary compatibility breaks, such
  as the method signature change to the insert helper methods. Recompile
  any classes that link to the driver against this version or later to ensure
  that they continue to work.

.. _scala-server-release-changes:

Server Release Compatibility Changes
------------------------------------

A server release compatibility change is a modification
to the {+driver-short+} that discontinues support for a set of
{+mdb-server+} versions.

The driver discontinues support for a {+mdb-server+} version after it reaches
end-of-life (EOL).

To learn more about the MongoDB support for EOL products,
see the `Legacy Support Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/legacy>`__.

.. _scala-server-8.1-incompatibility:

Server Version 8.1 Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use a 3.x version of the {+driver-short+} to connect to a
MongoDB deployment running {+mdb-server+} v8.1. Starting in {+mdb-server+} v8.1,
the ``buildinfo`` command requires authentication, causing an
incompatibility with the v3.x driver.

.. _scala-server-release-change-v5.2:

Driver Version 5.2 Server Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The v5.2 driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6. To use the
v5.2 driver, your {+mdb-server+} must be v4.0 or later. To learn
how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see :manual:`Release
Notes </release-notes>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _scala-server-release-change-v4.8:

Driver Version 4.8 Server Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The v4.8 driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.4 and earlier.
To use the v4.8 driver, your {+mdb-server+} must be v3.6 or later. To learn
how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see :manual:`Release
Notes </release-notes>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
