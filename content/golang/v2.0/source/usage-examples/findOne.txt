.. _golang-find-one:

===============
Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a single document from a collection by using the
``FindOne()`` method.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

This example uses the following ``Restaurant`` struct as a model for documents
in the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/findOne.go
   :start-after: start-restaurant-struct
   :end-before: end-restaurant-struct
   :language: go 
   :copyable: 
   :dedent:

The following example matches documents in the ``restaurants`` collection
in which the ``name`` is "Bagels N Buns", returning the first document
matched:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/findOne.go
   :start-after: begin findOne
   :end-before: end findOne
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :emphasize-lines: 9

Expected Result
---------------

Running the full example prints the following document, which is stored in the 
``result`` variable as a ``Restaurant`` struct:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: False

   // results truncated
   {
      "ID": "5eb3d668b31de5d588f42950",
      "Name": "Bagels N Buns",
      "RestaurantId": "40363427"
      "Address": [...],
      "Borough": "Staten Island",
      "Cuisine": "Delicatessen",
      "Grades": [...]
   }
