|service| user roles define the actions |service| users can perform in
organizations, projects, or both. Organization and project ``Owners``
can manage |service| users and their roles within their respective
organizations and projects.

You can apply these permissions **only** on the :ref:`the 
organization level <org-level-best-practices>` or
:ref:`the project level <project-level-best-practices>`. So,
you should carefully plan the hierarchy of your
organizations and projects. To learn more, see
:ref:`<db-deployment-best-practices>`.

Organization Roles
------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Organization Role (UI)
     - Organization Role (API)
     - Description

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Owner

     - ``ORG_OWNER``

     - Grants root access to the organization, including:

       - :authrole:`Project Owner` access to all projects in
         the organization, even if added to a project with a
         non-Owner role.

       - Privileges to administer organization settings.

       - Privileges to add/remove/edit |service| users and :ref:`database users <mongodb-users>`
         within the organization.

       - Privileges to delete the organization.

       - All the privileges granted by the other organization roles
         combined.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Project Creator

     - ``ORG_GROUP_CREATOR``

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to create projects in the organization.

       - Privileges granted by the :authrole:`Organization Member` role.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Billing Admin

     - ``ORG_BILLING_ADMIN``

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to administer billing information for the organization.

       - Privileges granted by the :authrole:`Organization Member` role.

       - Privileges to create, edit, delete, acknowledge, and 
         unacknowledge billing alerts.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Read Only

     - ``ORG_READ_ONLY``

     - Provides read-only access to everything in the organization,
       including all projects in the organization.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Member

     - ``ORG_MEMBER``

     - Provides read-only access to the settings, users,
       and billing in the organization and the projects they belong to.

       Unlike :authrole:`Organization Read Only`,
       an :authrole:`Organization Member` can only access projects 
       they have been explicitly added to.

       For an :authrole:`Organization Member`, within a project, the
       user has the privileges as determined by the user's
       :ref:`project role <project-roles>`. If a user's project role is
       :authrole:`Project Owner`, then the user can
       add a new user to the project, which results in adding the
       newly-added user to the organization as well (if the newly added
       user is not already in the organization).

.. _project-roles:

Project Roles
-------------

The following roles grant privileges within a project.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Project Role (UI)
     - Project Role (API)
     - Description

   * - .. authrole:: Project Owner

     - ``GROUP_OWNER``

     - Grants the privileges to perform the following actions: 

       - :ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.
     
       - Manage :ref:`project access <manage-project-access>` and 
         :doc:`project settings </tutorial/manage-project-settings>`.

       - Manage :ref:`IP Access List <access-list>` entries.

       - :ref:`Manage programmatic access to a project 
         <about-project-api-keys>`.
       
         You can grant |api| Keys access to a project with either an
         organization or a project role. If your key has both the
         :authrole:`Organization Owner` and :authrole:`Project Owner`
         roles, it can access all projects in the organization.
  
       - Manage :ref:`database access <mongodb-users>` for {+database-deployments+} within 
         the project.
       
       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and :doc:`audit 
         </database-auditing>` logs for all clusters in the project.

         To retrieve logs, you must have the :authrole:`Project Data 
         Access Read Only` role or higher in the project that the 
         cluster belongs to.

       - :ref:`Manage backups for and restore data to
         <restore-archive-snapshots>` all clusters in the project. 

       - :appservices:`Create {+app-services+} apps </manage-apps/create/create-with-realm-ui/>`.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Cluster Manager

     - ``GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER``

     - A user with the :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role can 
       perform the following tasks:
       
       - Grants access to edit, :doc:`pause </pause-terminate-cluster>`,
         and resume |service| clusters.

       - :ref:`Test failover <test-failover>`.
      
       The :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role doesn't allow users
       to:

       - Create |service| {+database-deployments+}.
      
       - Access the :doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>`.

       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and
         :doc:`audit </database-auditing>` logs.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Data Access Admin

     - ``GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_ADMIN``

     - Grants access to the :doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>`. This 
       role also grants privileges of :authrole:`Project Read
       Only`.

       Allows the user to perform the following
       :doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>` actions:

       - View, create, and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

       - View, modify, and delete documents.

       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and :doc:`audit 
         </database-auditing>` logs for all clusters in the project.

       - View the sample query field values in the 
         :doc:`/performance-advisor`.

        
       The :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` role does not grant 
       privileges to initiate backup or restore jobs.

       .. COMMENT
          In Atlas, Data Access Admin does not have access to real time 
          metrics tab, so can't actually get to the screen to kill.  As 
          such, will not mention the killOp privilege in Atlas. Mention 
          only in CloudMgr/OpsMgr docs.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Data Access Read/Write

     - ``GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_WRITE``

     - Grants access to the :doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>`;

       - View, modify, and delete documents.

       - View indexes.

       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and 
         :doc:`audit </database-auditing>` logs for all clusters in the

         values in the :doc:`/performance-advisor`.
