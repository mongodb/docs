===============================
Remove Members from Replica Set
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For best
results always *shut down* the :program:`mongod` instance before
removing it from a :term:`replica set`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   In versions prior to 2.2, you *must* to shut down the :program:`mongod` instance
   before removing it.

To remove a member:

1. Connect to the :term:`primary`.

   If you do not know which member is the primary, connect to any member
   and issue the :method:`db.isMaster()` command.

#. Use :method:`rs.remove()` in either of the following forms to remove
   the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27017")
      rs.remove("mongo3.example.net")

   MongoDB disconnects the shell briefly and forces a re-connection as
   the replica set runs a new election for primary. The shell displays
   an error even if this command succeeds.

To add a member back to a replica set, see the :doc:`procedure for
adding replica set members </tutorial/expand-replica-set>`.
