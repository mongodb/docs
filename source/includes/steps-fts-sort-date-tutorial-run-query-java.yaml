  a. Create a file named ``SortDateForSpeed.java``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``SortDateForSpeed.java`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-sort-date-for-speed-constant-desc.rst
