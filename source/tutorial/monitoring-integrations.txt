Overview
--------

You can choose to use a third-party product to view and analyze the performance
metrics |mms| collects about your deployment. |mms| currently provides
integration with `New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_. In future releases, |mms|
may provide integrations with additional products.

When integrated with a third-party application, |mms| sends the application the
same metric data as displayed in the |mms| :doc:`diagnostic charts
</tutorial/view-diagnostics>`. |mms| sends the data at the same resolution as
collected for the charts.

Integrate with New Relic
------------------------

You can configure |mms| to send metric data about your deployment to `New
Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_ for viewing through the New Relic MongoDB plugin.
You can also use Insights for New Relic to run analytics on the collected data.

To integrate |mms| with New Relic, you must have a New Relic account and must
retrieve the account information listed below. If you do not have an existing
New Relic account, you can sign up using `<http://newrelic.com/mongodb>`_.

To enable New Relic to receive metric data about your MongoDB deployment,
retrieve the following information from your New Relic account settings. You
may need to create new Insights API keys. Retrieve the following:

- Account ID
- License Key
- Insights API Insert Key
- Insights API Query Key

You enter this information when configuring the integration. If any of the
keys later become invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
eventually removes the invalid credentials.

Configure |mms| integration with New Relic by doing the following:
