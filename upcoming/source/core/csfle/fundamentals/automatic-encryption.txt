MongoDB supports automatically encrypting fields in read and write
operations when using {+csfle+}. You can perform automatic encryption
using :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and official MongoDB drivers. For a complete list 
of official compatible drivers with support for {+csfle-abbrev+}, see Driver
Compatibility :ref:`csfle-driver-compatibility`.

How Encrypted Writes and Reads Work
-----------------------------------

The following diagrams show how the client application and driver write
and read field-level encrypted data.

Encrypted Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For write operations, the driver encrypts field values *prior* to
writing to the MongoDB database.

The following diagram shows the steps taken by the client application and
driver to perform a write of field-level encrypted data:

.. _encrypted-reads-diagram:

Encrypted Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For read operations, the driver encrypts field values in the query
*prior* to issuing the read operation.

For read operations that return encrypted fields, the driver
automatically decrypts the encrypted values *only if* the driver was
configured with access to the Customer Master Key (CMK) and Data Encryption Keys (DEK) used to encrypt those values.

The following diagram shows the steps taken by the client application and
driver to query and decrypt field-level encrypted data:

Enabling Automatic {+csfle+}
-----------------------------------------------------

To enable automatic encryption, specify automatic encryption settings in
your client's ``MongoClient`` instance.

The following code snippets show how to create a client with automatic
encryption enabled in ``mongosh`` and MongoDB drivers:

For more information on CSFLE-specific ``MongoClient`` settings, 
see :ref:`csfle-reference-mongo-client`.

.. _field-level-encryption-automatic-remote-schema:

Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement
----------------------------------------------

MongoDB supports using :ref:`schema validation
<schema-validation-overview>` to enforce encryption of specific fields
in a collection. Clients performing automatic {+csfle+} have
specific behavior depending on the database connection
configuration:

- If the connection 
  :ref:`{+auto-encrypt-options+} <csfle-enc-options-example>`
  ``schemaMap`` object contains a key for the specified collection, the 
  client uses that object to perform automatic field level encryption 
  and ignores the remote schema. At minimum, the local rules **must** 
  encrypt those fields that the remote schema marks as requiring 
  encryption.

- If the connection 
  :ref:`{+auto-encrypt-options+} <csfle-enc-options-example>`
  ``schemaMap`` object does *not* contain a key for the specified 
  collection, the client downloads the server-side remote schema for 
  the collection and uses it to perform automatic field level 
  encryption.
