Description
-----------

``Disk I/O % Utilization`` alerts indicate that the percentage of disk
|iops| utilized reaches a specified threshold. This threshold is
specified when the alert is created.

.. note::

   The utilization measurements for the following alerts include
   requests from all processes, not just MongoDB processes.

:alert:`Disk I/O % utilization on Data Partition
<Disk I/O % utilization on Data Partition is>`
occurs if the percentage of time during which requests are being
issued to any partition that contains the MongoDB collection data
meets or exceeds the threshold.

:alert:`Disk I/O % utilization on Index Partition
<Disk I/O % utilization on Index Partition is>`
occurs if the percentage of time during which requests are being
issued to any partition that contains the MongoDB index data meets
or exceeds the threshold.

:alert:`Disk I/O % utilization on Journal Partition
<Disk I/O % utilization on Journal Partition is>`
occurs if the percentage of time during which requests are being
issued to the partition that contains the MongoDB
:term:`journal` meets or exceeds the threshold.

Possible Observations
---------------------

These are a few possible methods to observe high Disk I/O %
Utilization:

- The disk |iops| use from the :guilabel:`Disk IOPS` graph in the
  cluster :doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>` is higher than the
  provisioned |iops| from the Atlas cluster :doc:`configuration page
  </scale-cluster>`.

- There is a high :guilabel:`IOWait` curve in the
  :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` :doc:`metric
  </monitor-cluster-metrics>`. IOWait measures the percentage of time
  the CPU is idle and waiting for an I/O operation to complete. The
  :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` chart is located under the
  :guilabel:`Hardware Metrics` section of the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

Common Triggers
---------------

These are a few common events which may lead to high
Disk I/O % Utilization and trigger these alerts:

- :manual:`Unoptimized queries </core/query-optimization/>` can cause
  extra disk |iops| usage.

- There may be a one-time event which causes a spike in disk |iops|
  and exceeds the |iops| threshold, such as an :manual:`index build
  </core/index-creation/>`.

Possible Solutions
------------------

These are a few possible actions to consider to help resolve
``Disk I/O % Utilization`` alerts:

- :manual:`Optimize your queries </core/query-optimization/>`.

- Use the |service| :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor/>`
  to view slow queries and suggested :manual:`indexes </indexes>`.

- Review :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>` for
  possible further indexing improvements.

  .. note::

     You may need to temporarily increase your cluster |iops| to create
     new indexes. To change a cluster's |iops|, go to the
     :guilabel:`Cluster Configuration` page and:
