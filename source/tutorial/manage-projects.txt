      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-projects-create.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To create a project for an organization using the API, see 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Project </Projects/operation/createProject>`.

.. _view-projects:

View Projects
-------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view a project, you must either: 

- Be an :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner`
- Receive an :ref:`invitation <atlas_add_users>` that grants access to
  the project. An :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` can invite users to projects.

.. include:: /includes/fact-project-invite-deprecation.rst

Procedure

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-projects-describe-and-list.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To view a project using the API, see 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Return One Project </Projects/operation/getProject>` or 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Return One Project using Its Name </Projects/operation/getProjectByName>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To view projects in the {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-view-projects-ui.rst
      
      A {+bcp+} icon appears next to each project name that has a 
      :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`.

.. _move-project:

Move a Project
--------------

When you move a project to another |service| organization, |service| 
copies the project users and their respective roles to the 
same project in the destination organization. However, |service| 
doesn't carryover teams assigned to the project because you define 
teams at the organization level. 

When you move projects across organizations, your changes take effect
immediately. The move doesn't:

- Impact cluster uptime or current cluster configuration. 
- Cause downtime for your {+database-deployment+} or changes to your
  connection string. 

.. important::

   |service| removes existing API Keys after moving the project. You
   must :ref:`create a new API Key <create-project-api-key>`
   after moving the project.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To move a project to another |service| organization, you must be an
:authrole:`Organization Owner` for both the current and the destination
organization.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To move a project for an organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps-move-project.rst

.. _delete-project:

Delete a Project
----------------

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, you 
   can't delete the project if any snashots exist.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To delete a project for an organization, you must either have the
  :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project or have the
  :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the project's organization.

- You must terminate any |service| Services apps and/or |charts| instances.

- The project has no outstanding invoices.

- The project has no active {+database-deployments+}.
  :ref:`Terminate active {+clusters+} <terminate-cluster>` or
  :doc:`{+Serverless-instances+} </terminate-serverless-instance>` in the project
  before you delete it.

- The project has no configured :ref:`private endpoint connections
  <private-endpoint>`.

- The project has no active :ref:`federated database instances  <atlas-data-federation>`.

Procedure

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-projects-delete.rst
   
   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To delete a project for an organization using the API, see 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Remove One Project </Projects/operation/deleteProject>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To delete a project for an organization using the {+atlas-ui+},
      you can delete from the organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view
      or the project's :guilabel:`Project Setting` view.

      To delete a project from the organization's
