  |service| displays the details to connect to the cluster via a

   Use the displayed connection details to connect to the cluster via a
   :program:`mongo` shell or via a MongoDB Driver.

   The connection details use the MongoDB administration user and
   password set up for the group. Update the ``PASSWORD`` placeholder
   with the password for the user.

   To connect with a different MongoDB user, replace the user name and
   password in the connection details.

   To connect to a database other than ``admin`` but still authenticate
   to the ``admin`` database, update the connection string to specify
   the other database and include the ``&authSource=admin`` option in
   the connection string. See :urioption:`authSource` for more
   information.

   .. admonition:: WINDOWS and ``mongo`` shell
      
      To connect via the :program:`mongo` shell on Windows, enclose the
      specified connection string in quotes; e.g.

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo "mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/admin?replicaSet=replName" --ssl --username <name> --password PASSWORD

      The connection string does not include the :program:`mongo` shell
      commandline options ``--ssl --username <name> --password
      PASSWORD``.

      To connect via the :program:`mongo` shell on other operating
      system, the quotes are not required.

   For examples of connecting via the MongoDB Drivers, see
   :doc:`/driver-connection`.
