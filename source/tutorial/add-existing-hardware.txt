Add Existing Hardware to MMS

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| provides an interface for deploying MongoDB on your existing systems
and infrastructure. To allow |mms| to manage a MongoDB instance on your
infrastructure, you must install the Automation Agent on each system.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that the :ref:`directories used by the
Automation Agent <automation-agent-directories>` have appropriate
permissions for the user running the agent.

You may deploy Automation Agents on various Linux operating systems,
including RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu, and on Mac OSX. MMS
lists the OS version requirements on the :guilabel:`Automation Agent`
install page.

To install the agent using ``rpm`` or ``deb`` packages, you must have root
access.

Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.

.. This will need updating. We need a new page that links to the
   three different deployment tutorials:

   Next Steps
   ----------

   Once you have successfully deployed automation, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-deployments-with-automation` to begin using
   Automation to manage MongoDB deployments.
