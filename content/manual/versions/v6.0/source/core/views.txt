A MongoDB view is a read-only queryable object whose contents are
defined by an :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` on
other collections or views.

MongoDB does not persist the view contents to disk. A view's content is
computed on-demand when a client queries the view.

Use Cases
---------

You can use views to:

- Create a view on a collection of employee data to exclude any
  personally identifiable information (PII). Your application can query
  the view for employee data that does not contain any :abbr:`PII
  (Personally Identifiable Information)`.

- Create a view on a collection of sensor data to add computed fields
  and metrics. Your application can use :method:`find operations
  <db.collection.find()>` to query the computed data.

- Create a view that joins two collections containing inventory and
  order history. Your application can query the view without managing or
  understanding the underlying pipeline.

Behavior
--------

The following sections describe behavior specific to views.

Read Only
~~~~~~~~~

Views are read-only. Write operations on views return an error.

Snapshot Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Views do not maintain timestamps of collection changes and do not
support point-in-time or snapshot read isolation.

.. _views-pipelines:

View Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view's underlying aggregation pipeline is subject to the 100
megabyte memory limit for blocking sort and blocking group
operations.
