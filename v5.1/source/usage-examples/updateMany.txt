Update Multiple Documents
=========================

You can update multiple documents using the ``updateMany()`` method on
a ``MongoCollection`` object. The method accepts a **filter** that matches the
document you want to update and an **update** statement that instructs the
driver how to change the matching document. The ``updateMany()`` method updates
all the documents in the collection that match the filter.

To perform an update with the ``updateMany()`` method, you must pass
a query filter and an update document. The query filter specifies which
documents in the collection to match and the update document provides
instructions on what changes to make to them.

You can optionally pass an instance of ``UpdateOptions`` to the ``updateMany()`` method in
order to modify the behavior of the call. For example, if you set the
``upsert`` field of the ``UpdateOptions`` object to ``true`` and no documents
match the specified query filter, the operation inserts a new document
composed of the fields from both the query and update document.

Upon successful execution, the ``updateMany()`` method returns an instance
of ``UpdateResult``. You can retrieve information such as the number of
documents modified by calling the ``getModifiedCount()`` method. If you
specified ``upsert(true)`` in an ``UpdateOptions`` object and the
operation results in an insert, you can retrieve the ``_id`` field of the
new document by calling the ``getUpsertedId()`` method on the
``UpdateResult`` instance.

If your update operation fails, the driver raises an exception and does not update
any of the documents matching the filter. For example, if you try to set
a value for the immutable field ``_id`` in your update document, the
``updateMany()`` method does not update any documents and throws a
``MongoWriteException`` with the message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Performing an update on the path '_id' would modify the immutable field '_id'

If your update document contains a change that violates unique index
rules, the method throws a ``MongoWriteException`` with an error
message that should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   E11000 duplicate key error collection: ...

For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific
conditions, see the API documentation for ``updateMany()``, linked at the
bottom of this page.

Example
-------

In this example, we use a ``Filter`` builder to filter our query for
movies in the genre "Frequently Discussed". 

Next, we update documents that match our query in the ``movies`` collection of the
``sample_mflix`` database. We perform the following
updates to the matching documents:

- Add ``Frequently Discussed`` to the array of ``genres`` only if it does not
  already exist
- Set the value of ``lastUpdated`` to the current time.

We use the ``Updates`` builder, a factory class that contains static
helper methods to construct the update document. While you can pass an update
document instead of using the builder, the builder provides type checking and
simplified syntax. Read our
:doc:`guide on Updates </fundamentals/builders/updates>` in the Builders
section for more information.

After you run the example, you should see a similar output.

If you query the updated document or documents, they should look something like
this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Movie(num_mflix_comments=100, genres=[ ... Frequently Discussed], lastUpdated= ... )
