.. method:: db.createView()

   .. include:: /includes/views/disambiguate-standard-materialized.rst

   Creates a :ref:`view <views-landing-page>` as the result of the applying
   the specified :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` to
   the source collection or view. Views act as read-only collections,
   and are computed on demand during read operations. You must create
   views in the same database as the source collection. MongoDB
   executes read operations on views as part of the underlying
   aggregation pipeline.

Syntax
------

``db.createView`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <collation>)

The method has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Parameter

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``view``

     - string

     - The name of the view to create.
       
       

   * - ``source``

     - string

     - The name of the source collection or view from which to create
       the view. The name does not include the database name and implies
       the same database as the view to create; it is not the full
       namespace of the collection or view. You must create views in the
       same database as the source collection.
       
       

   * - ``pipeline``

     - array

     - An array that consists of the :ref:`aggregation pipeline stage(s)
       <aggregation-pipeline>`.  :method:`db.createView` creates the view by
       applying the specified ``pipeline`` to the ``source`` collection or view.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst

   * - ``collation``

     - document

     - Optional. Specifies the default :ref:`collation <collation>` for the view.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst
       
       If the underlying ``source`` is a collection, the view does not
       inherit the collection's collation settings. 
       
       If no collation is specified, the view's default collation is the
       "simple" binary comparison collator.
       
       If the underlying ``source`` is another view, the view must specify
       the same collation settings.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option-specification.rst


The ``db.createView()`` method wraps the following
:dbcommand:`create` command operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )
   
.. important:: View Names are Included in Collection List Output
   
   Operations that list collections, such as
   :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and :method:`db.getCollectionNames()`,
   include views in their outputs.
