If both the source and destination {+clusters+} are running MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+,
and |mms| monitors the source {+cluster+}, |service| can push a source
{+cluster+} to an |service| {+cluster+} using the procedure described in this section.

This process uses |mongosync| as the underlying data migration tool,
enabling faster live migrations with less downtime:

- |service| syncs data from the source to the destination {+cluster+} until
  you cut your applications over to the destination |service| replica set.

- Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure:

  - Stop writes to the source {+cluster+}.
  - Stop your application instances, point them to the |service| {+cluster+},
    and restart them.

Supported Source and Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration Pairs

For this type of live migration, |service| supports the following source
and destination {+cluster+} configuration pairs:

.. _migrate-from-c2c-push-prereqs:

Required Access
---------------

.. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/pull-live-migrate.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the push live migration from a {+cluster+} running
MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or later monitored in |mms| to |service|:

.. include:: /includes/live-migration-c2c-push-prereqs.rst

- If the {+cluster+} runs with authentication, meet the following prerequisites:

  - For replica sets, grant the :authrole:`backup` and :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`
    roles on the admin database to the user that will run the migration process.
  - For sharded {+clusters+}, grant the :authrole:`backup`, :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`,
    and :authrole:`clusterMonitor` roles on the admin database to the user
    that will run the migration process. Ensure the specified user exists
    on every shard and the config server replica set.
    The user must have permissions that allow the following actions:

    - Stop or start the sharded {+cluster+} balancer.
    - Read all databases and collections on the host.
    - Read the oplog on the host.

  - Ensure that this user is authenticated using
    :manual:`both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

Live Migration Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow. For detailed steps,
see the :ref:`procedure for migrating a cluster from Cloud Manager to Atlas <lm-push-c2c-procedure>`.

.. include:: /includes/import/network-access-push-lm-c2c.rst

.. _lm-push-c2c-migration-validation:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the live migration procedure, |service| runs validation
checks on the source and destination {+clusters+}.

- The source and destination {+cluster+}\'s MongoDB version is at least |fcv|
  6.0 and is matching as described in :ref:`c2c-push-limitations`.
- The source {+cluster+}\'s database user has the correct permissions as
  described in :ref:`live-import-push-c2c-security`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-validate-enable-collect-dbstats-push-c2c.rst

- The destination |service| {+cluster+} doesn't have |bic| enabled.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the destination {+cluster+}, the following considerations apply:

- The source and destination {+clusters+} are either both replica sets, or
  they are both sharded {+clusters+}. The number of shards may differ
  between the source and the destination {+cluster+}.

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  {+cluster+} as the destination for live migration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-perf-target-cluster.rst

- Do **not** change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Migrate Your {+Cluster+}
------------------------

.. important::

   Avoid making changes to the source {+cluster+} configuration while the
   live migration procedure runs, such as removing replica set members
   or modifying :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` runtime settings, such as
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``.

Push Live Migration APIs

   The Live Migration APIs mention |com|, however, the type of live migration
   described in this section only supports migrating source {+clusters+}
   monitored in |mms| to destination {+clusters+} in |service|.

Push Live Migration CLI Commands

      The Live Migration CLI commands might mention |com|, however, the
      type of live migration described in this section only supports
      migrating source {+clusters+} monitored in |mms| to destination
      {+clusters+} in |service|.
