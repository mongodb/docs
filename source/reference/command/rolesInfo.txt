.. dbcommand:: rolesInfo

   Lists the privileges and child roles that a role contains. To
   view role information you must have the :authaction:`viewRole` action
   on the role's database or be authenticated as a user explicitly
   granted the role.

   To view information for a role on the database on which the command
   is run, specify the name of the role:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { rolesInfo: "<role>" }

   To view information on a role on another database, use a document
   that specifies the role's name and database.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { rolesInfo: { role: "<role>", db: "<database>" } }

   To view information for several roles, use an array of documents that
   specify the roles and their databases:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { rolesInfo: [
           { role: "associate", db: "products" },
           { role: "manager", db: "resources" },
        ]
      }
