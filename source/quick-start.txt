Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to configure the {+connector+} to send data between MongoDB
and {+kafka+}.

After completing this guide, you should understand how to use the {+kafka-connect+}
REST API to configure {+connector+}s to read data from MongoDB and write it to a
Kafka topic, and to read data from a Kafka topic and write it to MongoDB.

To complete the steps in this guide, you must download and work in a
**sandbox**, a containerized development environment that includes services
required to build a sample *data pipeline*.

Read the following sections to set up your sandbox and sample data pipeline.

.. note::

   After you complete this guide, you can remove the environment by
   following the instructions in the :ref:`<kafka-quickstart-remove-the-sandbox>`
   section.

Install the Required Packages
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/tutorials/pipeline-requirements.rst

Download the Sandbox
--------------------

We created a sandbox that includes the services you need in this tutorial
to build your sample data pipeline.

To download the sandbox, clone the tutorial repository to your development
environment. Then navigate to the directory that corresponds to the quickstart
tutorial. If you use bash or a similar shell, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb-university/kafka-edu.git
   cd {+sandbox-directory+}

Start the Sandbox
-----------------

The sandbox starts the following services in Docker containers:

- MongoDB, configured as a replica set
- {+kafka+}
- {+kafka-connect+} with the {+connector+} installed
- Apache Zookeeper which manages the configuration for {+kafka+}

To start the sandbox run the following command from the tutorial directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker compose -p mongo-kafka up -d --force-recreate

When you start the sandbox, Docker downloads any images it needs to run.

.. include:: /includes/tutorials/download-note.rst

After Docker downloads and builds the images, you should see the following
output in your development environment:

.. include:: /includes/tutorials/docker-success.rst

.. include:: /includes/tutorials/port-mapping-note.rst

Add Connectors
--------------

To complete the sample data pipeline, you must add connectors to {+kafka-connect+}
to transfer data between {+kafka-connect+} and MongoDB. Add a **source connector** to
transfer data from MongoDB to {+kafka+}. Add a **sink connector** to transfer
data from {+kafka+} to MongoDB.

To add connectors in the sandbox, first start an interactive bash shell in
your Docker container using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

After your shell session starts, you should see the following prompt:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   MongoDB Kafka Connector Sandbox $ 

.. _kafka-quick-start-source-connector-section:

Add a Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the shell in your Docker container to add a source connector using the
{+kafka-connect+} REST API.

The following API request adds a source connector configured with the
following properties:

- The class {+kafka-connect+} uses to instantiate the connector
- The connection URI, database, and collection of the MongoDB replica set from
  which the connector reads data
- An aggregation pipeline that adds a field ``travel`` with the value
  ``"MongoDB Kafka Connector"`` to inserted documents the connector reads from MongoDB

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '
        {"name": "mongo-source",
         "config": {
            "connector.class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
            "connection.uri":"mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0",
            "database":"quickstart",
            "collection":"sampleData",
            "pipeline":"[{\"$match\": {\"operationType\": \"insert\"}}, {$addFields : {\"fullDocument.travel\":\"MongoDB Kafka Connector\"}}]"
            }
        }
        ' \
        http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n"

.. note:: Why do I see the message 'Failed to connect'?

   It takes up to three minutes for the {+kafka-connect+} REST API to start. If
   you receive the following error, wait three minutes and run the preceding
   command again:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      ...
      curl: (7) Failed to connect to connect port 8083: Connection refused

To confirm that you added the source connector, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl -X GET http://connect:8083/connectors

The preceding command should output the names of the running connectors:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   ["mongo-source"]

To learn more about source connector properties, see the page on
:ref:`<source-configuration-index>`.

To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see the MongoDB manual page on
:manual:`Aggregation Pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>`.

.. _kafka-quick-start-sink-connector-section:

Add a Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the shell in your Docker container to add a sink connector using the
{+kafka-connect+} REST API.

The following API request adds a sink connector configured with the
following properties:

- The class {+kafka-connect+} uses to instantiate the connector
- The connection URI, database, and collection of the MongoDB replica set to
  which the connector writes data
- The {+kafka+} topic from which the connector reads data
- A change data capture handler for MongoDB change event documents

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '
        {"name": "mongo-sink",
         "config": {
            "connector.class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector",
            "connection.uri":"mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0",
            "database":"quickstart",
            "collection":"topicData",
            "topics":"quickstart.sampleData",
            "change.data.capture.handler": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.cdc.mongodb.ChangeStreamHandler"
            }
        }
        ' \
        http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n"

To confirm that you added both source and sink connector, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: shell

    curl -X GET http://connect:8083/connectors

The preceding command should output the names of the running connectors:

.. code-block:: none
    :copyable: false

    ["mongo-source", "mongo-sink"]

To learn more about sink connector properties, see the page on
:ref:`<kafka-sink-configuration-properties>`.

To learn more about change data capture events, see the
:ref:`<sink-fundamentals-cdc-handler>` guide.

.. _kafka-quick-start-send-a-document:

Send the Contents of a Document through Your Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send the contents of a document through your connectors, insert a
document into the MongoDB collection from which your source connector reads
data.

To insert a new document into your collection, enter the MongoDB shell from
the shell in your Docker container using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   mongosh mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0

After you run the preceding command, you should see the following prompt:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false

   rs0 [primary] test>

From the MongoDB shell, insert a document into the ``sampleData``
collection of the ``quickstart`` database using the following commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use quickstart
   db.sampleData.insertOne({"hello":"world"})

After you insert a document into the ``sampleData`` collection, confirm that
your connectors processed the change. Check the contents of the ``topicData``
collection using the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.topicData.find()

You should see output that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
       {
         _id: ObjectId(...),
         hello: 'world',
         travel: 'MongoDB Kafka Connector'
       }
   ]

Exit the MongoDB shell with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   exit

.. _kafka-quickstart-remove-the-sandbox:

Remove the Sandbox
------------------

To conserve resources in your development environment, remove the sandbox.

Before you remove the sandbox, exit from the shell session in your Docker
container by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   exit

You can choose to remove both the Docker containers and images, or exclusively
the containers. If you remove the containers and images, you must download
them again to restart your sandbox which is approximately {+pipeline-size+}
in size. If you exclusively remove the containers, you can reuse the
images and avoid downloading most of the large files in the sample data
pipeline.

Select the tab that corresponds to the removal task you want to run.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Remove Containers and Images
      :tabid: remove-containers-and-images

      Run the following shell command to remove the Docker containers and
      images from the sandbox:

      .. code-block:: shell

         docker-compose -p mongo-kafka down --rmi all

   .. tab:: Remove Containers
      :tabid: remove-containers

      Run the following shell command to remove the Docker containers but
      keep the images for the sandbox:

      .. code-block:: shell

         docker-compose -p mongo-kafka down
