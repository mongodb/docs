.. important:: CSFLE and Queryable Encryption self-lookup may send malformed values in subpipelines

   In |cve-version-list|, a bug in query analysis of 
   certain complex self-referential :pipeline:`$lookup` subpipelines 
   may result in literal values in expressions for encrypted fields 
   being sent to the server malformed.
   
   Should this occur, no documents are returned or written. 
   This issue affects the ``mongocryptd`` binary and ``mongo_crypt_v1`` 
   shared library in the following MongoDB Server versions:
   
   - 7.3.0 - 7.3.3
   - 7.0.0 - 7.0.11
   - 6.0.0 - 6.0.16
   - 5.0.0 - 5.0.28
