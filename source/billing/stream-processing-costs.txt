You incur {+atlas-sp+} costs for the following items: 

- Stream Processing Instance (SPI)
- Data Transfer

Stream Processing Instance (SPI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges per hour per {+SPI+} worker, where the worker resources and the 
hourly rate are determined by the {+SPI+} tier. You are billed when there is 
at least one stream processor running in your {+SPI+} tier. A {+SPI+} worker can 
run up to 4 stream processors. The 5th stream processor will spin up a new worker 
for which you will be charged an additional {+SPI+} worker. Billing is recorded in 
one-second increments.

The allocated vCPU and RAM vary depending on your {+SPI+} worker tier:
