  Provisioning Settings
  ---------------------

  :guilabel:`Provisioning Settings` affect integration with cloud service providers.
  This page lets you:

  - Configure integration with cloud service providers
    so that you can provision servers directly from the |mms|
    interface. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-cloud-server-settings`.

  - Supply the SSH public key you will use to log in to a provisioned
    server. You can add multiple keys and select which to use when
    provisioning a given server.
