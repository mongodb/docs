  a. Choose the point from which you want to restore your backup.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 40 40
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Restore Type

          - Description

          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

          - Allows you to choose one
            :manual:`stored snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`.

          - Select an existing :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` to restore.

        * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

          - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up
            to but not including the selected time. By default, the
            Oplog Store stores 24 hours of data.

            .. example::

               If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the
               restore is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

            .. important::

               You cannot perform a |pit| restore that covers any time
               prior to the latest backup resync. For the conditions
               that cause a resync, see
               :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

          - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  c. If you are restoring a sharded cluster that runs |fcv-link| of 4.0
     or earlier and you chose :guilabel:`Point In Time`:

     i.  A list of :guilabel:`Checkpoints` closest to the time you
         selected appears.

     ii. To start your point in time restore, you may:

         - Choose one of the listed checkpoints, or
         - Click :guilabel:`Choose another point in time` to remove the
           list of checkpoints and select another date and time from
           the menus.
