========================================
Deploy Worker Roles on Azure Version 1.6
========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The screenshots in this article refer to the older (pre-June 2012)
Windows Azure portal, but the functionality is the same.

Deploy in a Development Environment
-----------------------------------

The solution can be built and run in a development environment using the
Azure emulators as is using Visual Studio 2010 (if adequate disk space
is available). Since this solution uses Cloud Drive you cannot run from
a development environment against Azure cloud storage. Instead, when you
run in your development environment it uses development storage:

- The MongoDB log file is located at:

  ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\dftmp\Resources\<deploymentid>\directory\MongodLogDir``

  On a development environment the port that :program:`manual:mongod` listens on would be
  configured port (``27017`` by default) + instance id.

- The MongoDB data files are at:

  ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\dftmp\wadd\devstoreaccount1\mongoddatadrive(replica set name)\mongoddblob(instance id).vhd\data``

  Additionally when the app is running you should be able to access the
  drives on mounting as you would access any mounted drive.

Deploy in the Azure Environment
-------------------------------

Login to the `Azure management portal <http://www.windowsazure.com/>`_
using your Azure credentials.

Azure Setup (First Time Only Per Deployment)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create an affinity group for your deployment. Choose your required
   location for the group.

   .. image:: /images/azure-worker-roles-deploy-affinity.png

#. Create the required number of storage accounts to store the blobs.
   For region/affinity choose the affinity group you created earlier.
   Note The access key for the storage account created is the one you
   need to specify in your cloud configuration.

   .. image:: /images/azure-worker-roles-deploy-storage-account.png

#. Create a new hosted service to host your MongoDB package. For
   region/affinity group, use the same affinity group as your storage
   account. For cloud drives the compute and storage instances
   should be in the same azure domain. Choose do not deploy.

Deployment Configuration for MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Sample.MvcMovie Web Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If deploying the sample application, you can use the default settings as
is. You would only need to set the storage settings for diagnostics.

In the Settings tab, set the following:

- ``ReplicaSetName``: This should be the same as the replica set name
  specified in the ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDBRole``.

- ``Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString``:
  Specify your Azure storage credentials. Ensure that the connection
  mode is ``https``.

Deployment Configuration for MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Manager Web Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deploy the manager application you can use the default settings as
is. You would only need to set the storage settings for diagnostics and
mongodb data directory.

In the Settings tab, set the following:

- ``ReplicaSetName``: This should be the same as the replica set name
  specified in the ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDBRole``.

- ``MongoDBDataDir``: Ensure that connection mode is ``http``.

- ``Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString``:
  Specify your Azure storage credentials. Ensure that the connection
  mode is ``https``.

Deployment Configuration for MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDBRole Worker Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the ``Configuration`` tab:

   - Ensure the VM size for ReplicaSetRole is at least Medium. Larger
     instance sizes provide more RAM and also greater bandwidth. For
     more information on instance sizes, see
     <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee814754.aspx>.

   - Set the Instance Count equivalent to the required number of replica
     set members. The default is 3.

#. In the ``Settings`` tab, edit connection settings to use actual
   storage account credentials (created earlier). It is recommended to
   use different storage accounts for data and diagnostics. This would
   allow you to give access to external monitors for diagnostics
   information without giving access to your data. Set the following:

   - MongoDBDataDir``: Ensure that connection mode is ``http``.

   - ``ReplicaSetName``: This is the name of the replica set in the
     replica set configuration. This is also the suffix to the blob
     container created in your storage account. This needs to be the
     same as the replica set name in the client applications.

   - ``MongoDBDataDirSize``: Maximum size of your cloud drive where
     mongod data files are stored. Currently the maximum size can be
     1TB.

   - ``MongoDBLogVerbosity``: Verbosity for mongod logging. Default is null.

   - ``RecycleOnExit``: This dictates whether the worker role is
     recycled when MongoDB exits. Default is false.

   - ``Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString``:
     Ensure that the connection mode is ``https``.

   ..note:: If deploying multiple Azure instances make sure you use
     different storage accounts for each of the deployments or different
     replica set names if using the same storage account.

#. In the ``Local Storage`` tab, configure the amount of local storage
   required depending on the VM size chosen. Ensure ``Clean on role recycle``
   is unchecked. The following are recommendations:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - **VM Size**
        - **MongoDBLocalDataDir**
        - **MongodLogDir**
      * - Medium
        - 256000 (250 GB)
        - 51200 (50GB)
      * - Large
        - 768000 (750 GB)
        - 51200 (50GB)
      * - Extra Large
        - 1024000 (1000GB)
        - 51200 (50GB)

   .. image:: /images/azure-worker-roles-deploy-rs-2.png

#. Create the Azure package:

   a. Right-click on the cloud project and selecting ``Package``. Select
      the following:

      - ``Service configuration``: ``Cloud``

      - ``Build configuration``: ``Release``

      .. image:: /images/azure-worker-roles-deploy-package.png

   #. If required, enable remote desktop on the role instances. See
      <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg443832.aspx>.

   #. Deploy the created package from the Azure management portal. More
      details on deploying can be found at
      ``http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee336122.aspx``.

When deploying to the Azure cloud make sure to check deployment
warnings/errors to see for any breaking issues. Some common errors are

- Remote desktop is enabled but the remote desktop certificate has not
  been uploaded to the portal

- https is not chosen for diagnostics connection string

- If deploying the sample MvcMovie application, you can safely ignore
  the warning that indicates you are only running 1 instance of it.
