.. _rust-delete-one-usage:

=================
Delete a Document
=================

You can delete a document from a collection by calling the `delete_one()
<{+api+}/struct.Collection.html#method.delete_one>`__ method on a ``Collection``
instance.

Pass a query filter to the ``delete_one()`` method to match the document you want to
delete from the collection. If multiple documents match the query filter, MongoDB
deletes the first matching document according to their :term:`natural order` in the
database or according to the sort order specified in a `DeleteOptions <{+api+}/options/struct.DeleteOptions.html>`__
instance.

The ``delete_one()`` method returns a `DeleteResult <{+api+}/results/struct.DeleteResult.html>`__
type. This type contains information about the result of the delete operation, such as
the total number of documents deleted.

To learn more about delete operations, see the :ref:`rust-delete-guide` guide.

Example
-------

This example deletes a document that matches a query filter from the ``restaurants``
collection in the ``sample_restaurants`` database. The example uses a ``Restaurant`` struct
that has ``name`` and ``borough`` fields to model the documents in the collection. 

This example uses a query filter that matches documents in which the value of the
``name`` field is ``"Haagen-Dazs"`` and the ``borough`` field is ``"Brooklyn"``. MongoDB
deletes the first of several results that match the query filter.
