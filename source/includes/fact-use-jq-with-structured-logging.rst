When working with MongoDB structured logging, the
`jq command-line utility <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ is a useful
tool that allows for easy pretty-printing of log entries, and powerful
key-based matching and filtering.

``jq`` is an open-source JSON parser, and is available for
Linux, Windows, and macOS.
