The |k8s-op-full| uses a |k8s| |k8s-configmap| to link to a single and unique
|onprem| :opsmgr:`Project </tutorial/manage-projects>`. If the 
referenced project doesn't exist, the |k8s-op-short| creates it 
according to the ``projectName`` that you provide in the ConfigMap.

To create a |k8s-op-short| ConfigMap, you can edit a few lines of the
:ref:`example ConfigMap <example-k8s-configmap>` |yaml| file and apply
the ConfigMap. To view a full example, see the :github:`project.yaml
</mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/samples/mongodb/project.yaml>` file.

Alternatively, you can use the |cloud| :cloudmgr:`UI 
</tutorial/nav/k8s-config-for-mdb-resource/>` or the |onprem| 
:opsmgr:`UI </tutorial/nav/k8s-config-for-mdb-resource/>` to create or 
choose a project, and automatically generate the ConfigMap YAML file, 
which you can then apply to your Kubernetes environment. 

Considerations
--------------

1. You can deploy only one MongoDB resource per project. This limit 
   applies because |onprem| supports only one authentication method for 
   database user access per project. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`k8s-deploy-mdb-resources`.

2. You must pair a |k8s-op-full| deployment to a unique
   |onprem| :opsmgr:`Project </tutorial/manage-projects>`. 
   You can either create a distinct ConfigMap for each |k8s-op-full| instance
   you deploy, or you can reuse the same ConfigMap for any number of deployments
   by omitting the ``data.projectName`` from your ConfigMap, so that
   project names align with deployed resource names. Where a project name is 
   provided in the config map, if that project does not 
   exist yet it will be created.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Kubernetes version 1.11 or later or Openshift version
  3.11 or later.
- |k8s-op-full| version 0.11 or later
  :doc:`installed </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`.

.. _connect-https-om-custom-ca:

Connect to HTTPS-enabled Ops Manager Using a Custom CA
------------------------------------------------------

You might have chosen to use your own |tls| certificate to enable
|https| for your |onprem| instance. If you used a custom certificate,
you need to add the CA that signed that custom certificate to the
|k8s-op-short|. To add your custom CA, complete the following:

Next Steps
----------

Now that you created your ConfigMap, :ref:`create-k8s-secret` before
you start :doc:`deploying MongoDB resources </deploy>`.
