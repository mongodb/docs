The |mms|, MongoDB Database, AppDB and Backup Daemon custom resources that 
comprise a standard |k8s-op-short| deployment are each deployed as |k8s| 
``statefulSets``. The |k8s-op-short| supports increasing the storage associated with 
these specific resources by increasing the capacity of their respective |k8s| 
``persistentVolumeClaims`` when the underlying |k8s| ``storageClass`` supports |k8s| 
``persistentVolume`` expansion.

Depending on the specific resource type, you can increase storage in one of two ways. 
You can either manually increase storage, or you can leverage the |k8s-op-short| 
easy storage expansion feature. The following table illustrates which of these two 
procedures is supported for a given custom resource type.

Prerequisites
-------------

Storage Class Must Support Resizing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the |k8s-sc| and volume plugin provider that the |k8s-pvs|
use supports resize:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl patch storageclass/<my-storageclass> --type='json' \
           -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/allowVolumeExpansion", "value": true }]'

If you don't have a ``storageClass`` that supports resizing, ask your |k8s|
administrator to help.

Easy Expand Storage
-------------------

.. note:: 

   The easy expansion mechanism requires the default RBAC included with the |k8s-op-short|. 
   Specifically, it requires ``get``, ``list``, ``watch``, ``patch`` and ``update`` 
   permissions for ``persistantVolumeClaims``. If you have customized any of 
   the |k8s-op-short| RBAC resources, you might need to adjust permissions to 
   allow the |k8s-op-short| to resize storage resources in your |k8s| cluster.

   This process results in a rolling restart of the MongoDB custom resource 
   in your |k8s| cluster.
