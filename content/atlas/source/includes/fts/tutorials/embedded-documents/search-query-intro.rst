You can run queries against the embedded document fields. This 
tutorial uses :ref:`embeddedDocument <embedded-document-ref>` and :ref:`text <text-ref>` 
operators inside the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator in the queries. 

In this section, you will connect to your cluster and run 
the sample queries using the operators against the fields in the 
``schools`` collection.
