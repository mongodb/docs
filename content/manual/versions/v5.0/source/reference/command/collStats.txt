.. dbcommand:: collStats

   The :dbcommand:`collStats` command returns a variety of storage statistics
   for a given collection.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`~db.collection.stats` helper method.  
      Specific fields in the ``collStats`` output can be accessed using the
      :method:`~db.collection.dataSize`,
      :method:`~db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount`,
      :method:`~db.collection.isCapped`,
      :method:`~db.collection.latencyStats`,
      :method:`~db.collection.storageSize`,
      :method:`~db.collection.totalIndexSize`, and
      :method:`~db.collection.totalSize`
      helper methods

   .. |command| replace:: ``collStats``

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      collStats: <string>,
      scale: <int>
   }

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command takes the following fields:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``collStats``

     - string

     - The name of the target collection. 

   * - ``scale``

     - int

     - Optional. The scale factor for the various size data (with the exception of
       those sizes that specify the unit of measurement in the field name). The
       value defaults to 1 to return size data in bytes. To display
       kilobytes rather than bytes, specify a ``scale`` value of ``1024``.
       
       If you specify a non-integer scale factor, MongoDB uses the integer
       part of the specified factor. For example, if you specify a scale
       factor of ``1023.999``, MongoDB uses ``1023`` as the scale factor.
       
       The scale factor rounds the affected size values to whole numbers.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-stats-scaleFactor.rst

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB removes the MMAPv1 storage
   engine. In conjunction with this change, MongoDB removes the
   MMAPv1 specific :dbcommand:`collStats` option ``verbose``.

Behavior
--------

Scaled Sizes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless otherwise specified by the metric name (such as ``"bytes
currently in the cache"``), values related to size are displayed in
bytes and can be overridden by ``scale``.

The scale factor rounds the affected size values to whole numbers.

Accuracy after Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |cmd| replace:: :dbcommand:`collStats`
.. |opt| replace:: size

.. include:: /includes/fact-unexpected-shutdown-accuracy.rst

In-Progress Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`collStats` includes
information on indexes currently being built. For details, see:

- :data:`collStats.nindexes`
- :data:`collStats.indexDetails`
- :data:`collStats.indexBuilds`
- :data:`collStats.totalIndexSize`
- :data:`collStats.indexSizes`

Replica Set Member State Restriction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-repl-state-restrictions-operation.rst

.. |operations| replace:: :dbcommand:`collStats`

Non-Existent Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run :dbcommand:`collStats` for a non-existent collection, then
depending on your database implementation, :dbcommand:`collStats` might
return ``0`` values in the output fields instead of returning an error.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { collStats : "nonExistentCollection" } )

Example output with ``0`` values in the fields:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      ns: 'test.nonExistentCollection',
      size: 0,
      count: 0,
      ...
   }

Example
-------

The following operation runs the :dbcommand:`collStats` command on the
``restaurants`` collection, specifying a scale of ``1024`` bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { collStats : "restaurants", scale: 1024 } )

The following document provides a representation of the
:dbcommand:`collStats` output. Depending on the configuration of your
collection and the storage engine, the output fields may vary.

.. _collStats-output:

Output
------

.. data:: collStats.ns

   The namespace of the current collection, which follows the format
   ``[database].[collection]``.

.. data:: collStats.size

   The total uncompressed size in memory of all records in a
   collection. The :data:`~collStats.size` does not
   include the size of any indexes associated with the collection,
   which the :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` field reports.

   The ``scale`` argument affects this value. Data compression does not
   affect this value.

.. data:: collStats.timeseries

   :data:`~collStats.timeseries` appears when you run the
   :dbcommand:`collStats` command on a :ref:`time series collection
   <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

   This document contains data for internal diagnostic use.

.. data:: collStats.count

   The number of objects or documents in this collection.


.. data:: collStats.avgObjSize

   The average size of an object in the collection. The ``scale``
   argument does not affect this value.

.. data:: collStats.storageSize

   The total amount of storage allocated to this collection for
   :term:`document` storage. The ``scale`` argument affects this
   value.

   If collection data is compressed (which is the :option:`default for
   WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor>`), the
   storage size reflects the compressed size and may be smaller than
   the value for :data:`collStats.size`.

   :data:`~collStats.storageSize` does not include index size. See
   :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` for index sizing.

.. data:: collStats.freeStorageSize

   *Unavailable for the In-Memory Storage Engine*

   The amount of storage available for reuse. The ``scale`` argument
   affects this value.

   The field is only available if storage is available for reuse (i.e.
   greater than zero).

.. data:: collStats.nindexes

   The number of indexes on the collection. All collections have at
   least one index on the :term:`_id` field.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.nindexes` includes in its
   count those indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.indexDetails

   A document that reports data from the :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredTiger>`
   storage engine for each index in the collection. Other storage engines will
   return an empty document.

   The fields in this document are the names of the indexes, while the
   values themselves are documents that contain statistics for the
   index provided by the storage engine. These statistics are for
   internal diagnostic use.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.indexDetails` contains
   details on indexes currently being built, including
   warnings and errors.

.. data:: collStats.indexBuilds

   An array that contains the names of the indexes that are currently
   being built on the collection. Once an index build completes, the
   index does not appear in the :data:`~collStats.indexBuilds`.

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. data:: collStats.totalIndexSize

   The total size of all indexes. The ``scale`` argument affects this
   value.

   If an index uses prefix compression (which is the :option:`default
   for WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the
   returned size reflects the compressed size for any such indexes when
   calculating the total.
   
   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` includes
   in its total the size of those indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.totalSize

   The sum of the :data:`~collStats.storageSize` and
   :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize`. The ``scale`` argument affects
   this value.

.. data:: collStats.indexSizes

   This field specifies the key and size of every existing index on
   the collection. The ``scale`` argument affects this value.

   If an index uses prefix compression (which is the :option:`default
   for WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the
   returned size reflects the compressed size.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.indexSizes` includes
   sizes of indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.scaleFactor

   The ``scale`` value used by the command.

   If you had specified a non-integer scale factor, MongoDB uses the
   integer part of the specified factor. For example, if you specify a
   scale factor of ``1023.999``, MongoDB uses ``1023`` as the scale
   factor.

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. data:: collStats.capped

   This field will be "true" if the collection is
   :term:`capped <capped collection>`.

.. data:: collStats.max

   Shows the maximum number of documents that may be present in a
   :term:`capped collection`.

.. data:: collStats.maxSize

   Shows the maximum size of a :term:`capped collection`.

.. data:: collStats.wiredTiger

   :data:`~collStats.wiredTiger` only appears when using the
   WiredTiger storage engine.

   This document contains data reported
   directly by the WiredTiger engine and other data for internal
   diagnostic use.

.. data:: collStats.inMemory

   :data:`~collStats.inMemory` only appears when using the in-memory
   storage engine.

   This document contains data reported
   directly by the storage engine and other data for internal
   diagnostic use.
