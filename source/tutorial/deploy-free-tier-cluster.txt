|service| Free Tier clusters provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. Free Tier clusters never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on Paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster`.
