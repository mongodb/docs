Installing to a Server Before Installing MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy the Automation Agent to a server that does not have
MongoDB installed, ensure the user that owns the Automation Agent has
``Read`` and ``Write`` permissions on the MongoDB data and log
directories you plan to use.
