Replica sets use elections to support 
:term:`high availability <high availability>`. 

:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections`
   Elections occur when the primary becomes unavailable and the
   replica set members autonomously select a new primary.

:doc:`/core/replica-set-rollbacks`
   A rollback reverts write operations on a former primary when the
   member rejoins the replica set after a failover.
