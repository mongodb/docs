Create a Hashed Index
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.4

:ref:`Hashed indexes <index-type-hashed>` compute a hash of the value
of a field in a collection and index the hashed value. These indexes
permit equality queries and may be suitable shard keys for some
collections. MongoDB automatically computes the hashes when resolving
queries using hashed indexes. Applications do **not** need to compute
hashes.

.. see:: :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding` for more information about hashed
   indexes in sharded clusters, as well as :doc:`/core/indexes` and
   :doc:`/administration/indexes` for more information about indexes.

Procedure
---------

To create a :ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>`, specify
``hashed`` as the value of the index key, as in the following
example:

.. example:: Specify a hashed index on ``_id``

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.ensureIndex( { _id: "hashed" } )

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB supports ``hashed`` indexes of any single field. The hashing
function collapses sub-documents and computes the hash for the entire
value, but does not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes.

You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields.
