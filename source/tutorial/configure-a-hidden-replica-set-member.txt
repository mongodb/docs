Hidden members are part of a :term:`replica set` but cannot become
:term:`primary` and are invisible to client applications. Hidden members
may vote in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`. For
more information on hidden members and their uses, see
:doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

Considerations
--------------

The most common use of hidden nodes is to support :doc:`delayed
members </core/replica-set-delayed-member>`. If you only need to prevent a member from
becoming primary, configure a :doc:`priority 0 member
</core/replica-set-priority-0-member>`.

Examples

Member Configuration Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a secondary member as hidden, set its
:rsconf:`members[n].priority` value to ``0`` and
set its :rsconf:`members[n].hidden` value to
``true`` in its member configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5

   {
     "_id" : <num>
     "host" : <hostname:port>,
     "priority" : 0,
     "hidden" : true
   }


Configuration Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example hides the secondary member currently at the index
``0`` in the :rsconf:`members` array. To configure
a :term:`hidden member`, use the following sequence of operations in a
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the primary, specifying the member
to configure by its array index in the
:rsconf:`members` array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].hidden = true
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After re-configuring the set, this secondary member has a priority of
``0`` so that it cannot become primary and is hidden. The other members
in the set will not advertise the hidden member in the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` or :method:`db.isMaster()` output.
