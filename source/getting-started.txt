This procedure guides you through creating and configuring an |service|
cluster, populating the cluster with data, and modifying that data.

A. Create an |service| User Account
-----------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

.. admonition:: |mms-full| Users
   :class: note

   If you are an existing |mms-full| user, you can use your |mms| credentials
   to log in to |service|_. You can then
   create a new |service| project from |mms|. 

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/add-atlas-project-cm-version.rst
   
   Once you have created a |service| project, you can move on to the next
   section.

Go to |service|_ to create
your user account. As a part of creating an |service| user, |service|
automatically creates a default :doc:`organization and project
</organizations-projects>` for you to deploy your first cluster into. You
can add additional :doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations>` and
:doc:`projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` later.

Creating a user for |service| also creates that user on `jira.mongodb.org
<http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. If you later change the user's password or email
address in |service|, you will also change the password or email address in
`jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_.

Once you log in, the |service| UI automatically opens the cluster creation
dialog.

B. Create an |service| Free Tier Cluster
----------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 10 minutes*

|service| Free Tier clusters are an ideal development sandbox, providing
access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features and
functionality. You can deploy only one Free Tier cluster per |service|
project.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on Paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/create-new-cluster`.

C. Insert Data Into Your Cluster
--------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

The following steps in this tutorial show you how to insert and
interact with data on your cluster. Select the appropriate tab based
on how you would like to interact with your cluster data:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: atlas-gui
       name: Atlas GUI
       content: |   

         |service| provides a :abbr:`GUI (Graphical user interface)`
         to add and interact with data in your cluster, called the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`.

         To insert data into your cluster using the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-insert.rst

         .. seealso::

            For more information on Data Explorer in |service|, see
            :doc:`/data-explorer`.

         D. View and Edit Your Cluster Data
         ----------------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

         Now that you have inserted a document into your cluster, you
         can try modifying it.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-edit.rst

         E. Summary
         ----------

         You have just set up an |service| cluster to host your data,
         populated that cluster with data, and learned how to interact
         with that data using the |service| Data Explorer.

         Moving Forward
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         If you continue to grow your cluster, consider
         :doc:`scaling your cluster </scale-cluster/>` to support more
         users and operations.

         D. Modify Data in your Free Tier Cluster
