The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a sharded cluster
from the MongoDB Community Edition to the MongoDB Enterprise Edition.
For example, the steps can be used to upgrade MongoDB 6.0 Community to 
MongoDB 6.0 Enterprise.

Rolling Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When updating the sharded clusters manually, you can perform a
rolling upgrade on the shard replica sets and config servers to
update each MongoDB Community Server to Enterprise edition with
minimal downtime.

In a rolling upgrade, each secondary is taken down and upgraded.
The Enterprise server rejoins the replica set as a
secondary. When all secondaries are upgraded, you can
:term:`step down` the primary, forcing the replica set to elect
one of the Enterprise servers as the new primary. 

Steps
-----

To minimize downtime, manually upgrade each from MongoDB
Community Server to Enterprise Edition: 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Stop the balancer

      During an upgrade, the balancer should not attempt to
      redistribute data between the shards. To prevent the
      balancer from attempting to redistribute data, stop the
      balancer for the duration of the upgrade.

      To stop the balancer, connect to :program:`mongos` and run
      the :method:`sh.stopBalancer` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.stopBalancer()

      If a balancing round is in progress, the operation waits
      for balancing to complete.

      To confirm that the balancer is stopped, use the
      :method:`sh.getBalancerState` method:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            sh.getBalancerState()

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            false

      The command returns ``false`` when the balancer is stopped.

   .. step:: Upgrade the config servers

      Perform a rolling upgrade of the config servers.

      For the procedure, see :ref:`Upgrade a Replica Set to
      MongoDB Enterprise <upgrade-to-enterprise-rs>`.

   .. step:: Upgrade the shards

      Perform a rolling upgrade on each shard.

      For the procedure, see :ref:`Upgrade a Replica Set to
      MongoDB Enterprise <upgrade-to-enterprise-rs>`.

   .. step:: Upgrade routers (mongos)

      Perform a rolling upgrade of the :program:`mongos`
      instances from the Community installation to Enterprise. 

      a. Connect to ``mongos`` and stop the router process:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer()

      #. .. include:: /includes/tabs-remove-com-mongos

      #. .. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-install-binaries.rst

      #. To start the router, run Enterprise ``mongos`` with the
         same configuration as you used for the Community
         ``mongos``.

         For example:

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo mongos --config /etc/mongos.conf


   .. step:: Restart the balancer

      To restart the balancer, connect to :program:`mongos` and
      use the :method:`sh.startBalancer` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.startBalancer()

      To confirm that the balancer is running, use the
      :method:`sh.getBalancerState` method:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            sh.getBalancerState()

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            true

      The command returns ``true`` when the balancer is running.

.. important::

   Before using any Enterprise features, ensure that all members have
   been upgraded to Enterprise edition.
