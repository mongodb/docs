You can configure advanced options in your Federated Authentication
instance for greater control over your federated users and
authentication flow.

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-fed-management-access.rst

To open the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console`:

.. include:: /includes/fact-open-fed-auth-console.rst

.. _advanced-option-default-role:

Assign a Default User Role for an Organization
----------------------------------------------

You can have |service| assign users who authenticate through the |idp| a
default :ref:`role <organization-roles>` in a mapped organization. You
can select different roles for different organizations.

.. note::

   The selected role only applies to users who authenticate through the
   |idp| if they do not already have a :ref:`role <organization-roles>`
   in the organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/assign-default-org-role.rst

.. _restrict-org-access-by-domain:

Restrict Access to an Organization by Domain
--------------------------------------------

You can specify a list of approved domains to prevent users outside of
those domains from accessing your organization. Use this list to define
a list of approved domains for your organization without needing to
directly map those domains to your |idp|.

.. important:: Considerations

   Once you enable the :guilabel:`Restrict Access by Domain` option:

   - You can only invite new users to join your organization whose email
     addresses are in the approved list of domains.

   - Users who are already in your organization whose usernames do not
     contain a domain in the approved list are *not* restricted
     access to your organization.

   - Any domains which are mapped to your |idp| are automatically added
     to the approved list.

.. _bypass-saml:

Bypass SAML Mode
----------------

:guilabel:`Bypass SAML Mode` provides a login |url| which
bypasses your federated authentication, and instead allows you to
authenticate with your |service| credentials.

If your Federated Authentication settings are not properly configured,
you may not be able to log in to |service| through your |idp|. The
:guilabel:`Bypass SAML Mode` |url| helps prevent you from being locked
out of your |service| organization. While configuring and testing your
|idp|, we recommend that you make note of the :guilabel:`Bypass SAML
Mode` URL to ensure you can log in to |service| and properly configure
your Federated Authentication settings.

Each :guilabel:`Bypass SAML Mode` URL is associated with an individual
|idp|, and corresponds to the IdP's :guilabel:`Login URL`.

:guilabel:`Bypass SAML Mode` is enabled by default, however you may want
to disable it as a security measure once you are confident that you have
properly configured your Federated Authentication.

To set :guilabel:`Bypass SAML Mode`, from the
:guilabel:`Federation Management Console`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/bypass-saml-mode.rst
.. _restrict-fed-user-membership:

Restrict User Membership to the Federation
------------------------------------------

You can prevent users in your Federated Authentication instance from
creating new organizations or using their credentials to access
organizations outside of the federation. Configure this setting for
full control of your federated users and to help ensure that federated
users only have access to desired |service| organizations.

.. important::

   This setting applies to the *entire* federation, including all
   Identity Providers and Organizations within the federation.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you enable this setting:

-  No users in your Federated Authentication instance can gain access
   to organizations outside of your federation. 

   - Similarly, no federated users can accept or receive invitations
     to join organizations outside of your federation.

- Users in your federation with the :authrole:`Organization Owner`
  role can still create new organizations. These new organizations
  are automatically connected to your federation.
  
- Users in your federation without the :authrole:`Organization Owner`
  role cannot create any new organizations.

- Users in your federation retain access to any organizations they had
  access to prior to the membership restriction.
