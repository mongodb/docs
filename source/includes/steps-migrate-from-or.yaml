  If you don't already have an Atlas deployment, :doc:`create one
  </cloud/atlas>` now.

title: Stop your applications
ref: stop-applications
content: |
  Stopping your applications prevents any additional database writes
  from occurring while you move your data from ObjectRocket to Atlas.
---
title: Run ``mongodump`` on your ObjectRocket deployment
ref: run-mongodump
content: |
  ``mongodump`` creates a binary export of the contents of your deployment.
  The :manual:`mongodump documentation </reference/program/mongodump/>`
  contains detailed instructions on using the ``mongodump`` utility. Use
  your ObjectRocket credentials to access your ObjectRocket deployment.

  In the following example, a user named ``db_user`` exports all databases
  to a directory named ``dump`` in the current working directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongodump --host iad-mongos2.objectrocket.com --port 12345 --username db_user --password "myPwd" --out dump

title: Use ``mongorestore`` to restore the ``dump`` directory to your Atlas deployment
ref: restore-dump
content: |
  The :manual:`mongorestore documentation </reference/program/mongorestore/>`
  contains detailed instructions on using the ``mongorestore`` utility. Use
  your Atlas credentials to access your Atlas deployment.

  In the following example, a user named ``db_user`` restores the default
  ``dump`` directory to the host ``example1.mongodb.net``:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongorestore --host example1.mongodb.net --port 27017 --username db_user --password "myPwd" dump/
