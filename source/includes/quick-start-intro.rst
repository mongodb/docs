You can configure {+mcli+} access to your MongoDB service using
the :ref:`mcli-config-command` and :ref:`mcli-config-set-command`
commands. In the following steps, the commands:

- Create the ``default`` profile in the
  ``mongocli.toml`` file.
- Set your programmatic |api| access keys and project ID in the
  profile.

You can use this profile with all the other commands in this
tutorial.
