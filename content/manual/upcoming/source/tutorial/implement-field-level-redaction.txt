Implement Field Level Redaction
===============================

   :description: Implement field-level redaction using the `$redact` pipeline operator to restrict document contents based on embedded access criteria.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

The :pipeline:`$redact` pipeline operator restricts the contents of the
documents based on information stored in the documents themselves.

.. include:: /images/redact-security-architecture.rst

To store the access criteria data, add a field to the documents and
embedded documents. To allow for multiple combinations of access levels for
the same data, consider setting the access field to an array of arrays.
Each array element contains a required set that allows a user with that
set to access the data.

Then, include the :pipeline:`$redact` stage in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` operation to restrict contents of
the result set based on the access required to view the data.

For more information on the :pipeline:`$redact` pipeline operator,
including its syntax and associated system variables as well as
additional examples, see :pipeline:`$redact`.

Procedure
---------

For example, a ``forecasts`` collection contains documents of the
following form where the ``tags`` field determines the access levels
required to view the data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 1,
      title: "123 Department Report",
      tags: [ [ "G" ], [ "FDW" ] ],
      year: 2014,
      subsections: [
          {
              subtitle: "Section 1: Overview",
              tags: [ [ "SI", "G" ], [ "FDW" ] ],
              content:  "Section 1: This is the content of section 1."
          },
          {
              subtitle: "Section 2: Analysis",
              tags: [ [ "STLW" ] ],
              content: "Section 2: This is the content of section 2."
          },
          {
              subtitle: "Section 3: Budgeting",
              tags: [ [ "TK" ], [ "FDW", "TGE" ] ],
              content: {
                  text: "Section 3: This is the content of section3.",
                  tags: [ [ "HCS"], [ "FDW", "TGE", "BX" ] ]
              }
          }
      ]
   }

For each document, the ``tags`` field contains various access groupings
necessary to view the data. For example, the value ``[ [ "G" ], [
"FDW", "TGE" ] ]`` can specify that a user requires either access level
``["G"]`` or both ``[ "FDW", "TGE" ]`` to view the data.

Consider a user who only has access to view information tagged with
either ``"FDW"`` or ``"TGE"``. To run a query on all documents with
year ``2014`` for this user, include a :pipeline:`$redact` stage as in
the following:

.. code-block:: none

   var userAccess = [ "FDW", "TGE" ];
   db.forecasts.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { year: 2014 } },
        { $redact:
            {
              $cond: {
                       if: { $anyElementTrue:
                              {
                                $map: {
                                        input: "$tags" ,
                                        as: "fieldTag",
                                        in: { $setIsSubset: [ "$$fieldTag", userAccess ] }
                                      }
                              }
                           },
                        then: "$$DESCEND",
                        else: "$$PRUNE"
                     }
            }
        }
      ]
   )

The aggregation operation returns the following "redacted" document for the user:

.. code-block:: none

   { "_id" : 1,
     "title" : "123 Department Report",
     "tags" : [ [ "G" ], [ "FDW" ] ],
     "year" : 2014,
     "subsections" :
        [
           {
             "subtitle" : "Section 1: Overview",
             "tags" : [ [ "SI", "G" ], [ "FDW" ] ],
             "content" : "Section 1: This is the content of section 1."
           },
          {
            "subtitle" : "Section 3: Budgeting",
            "tags" : [ [ "TK" ], [ "FDW", "TGE" ] ]
          }
        ]
   }
