Materialized views on time series data are useful for:

- archiving
- analytics
- facilitating data access for teams that cannot access the raw data

To create an :doc:`On-Demand Materialized view
</core/materialized-views>`, use the :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation
pipeline stage to transform and store your data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.weather.aggregate([
     {
        $project: {
           date: {
              $dateToParts: { date: "$timestamp" }
           },
           temp: 1
        }
     },
     {
        $group: {
           _id: {
              date: {
                 year: "$date.year",
                 month: "$date.month",
                 day: "$date.day"
              }
           },
           avgTmp: { $avg: "$temp" }
        }
     }, {
        $merge: { into: "dailytemperatureaverages", whenMatched: "replace" }
     }
   ])

The preceding pipeline, will create or update the
``dailytemperatureaverages`` collection with all daily temperature
averages based on the ``weather`` collection.

.. note::

   It is not possible to natively schedule the refreshing of these
   materialized views.
