Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your
cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the
event of data loss.

You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for an 
|cloudgov-short| project to manage backups for or to restore a 
backup to clusters in that project.

.. tip::

   |cloudgov-short| user roles are the same as 
   :atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`.

Restores between standard projects and Gov region-only projects are not allowed. 
If a backup is created from a cluster in a Gov region-only 
(|aws-fr-high| or |gaw|) project, the data can only be restored to a cluster 
in a Gov region-only project. The same restriction applies to standard projects, 
where backups in standard regions can only be restored to clusters in standard projects.

Cross-cloud restore is supported between |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| regions. 

For a list of regions by cloud provider, see :ref:`<supported-regions>`.

See the |service| documentation to configure 
:atlas:`Cloud Backups </backup/cloud-backup/overview/>`
