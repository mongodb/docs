To enable reuse of existing third-party backup solutions, you can 
integrate {+onprem+} with one of the following third-party backup 
platforms that support certified MongoDB cluster snapshot backups and 
restores with secure and scalable storage (including cold storage), 
immutability enforcement, and compliance policy support:

- {+cohesity-link+}
- {+cohesity-netbackup-link+}
- {+rubrik-link+}

With these integrations, you can coordinate scheduled or on-demand 
backups and restores of your MongoDB clusters directly from your
third-party management console to streamline your backup, retention, and
recovery operations across data platforms without the complexity and 
additional operational costs of managing {+onprem+} at backup scale. 

To begin the backup or restore process, the third-party backup
platform calls the {+admin-api+} to put your MongoDB cluster into a 
backup-ready or restore-ready state. The third-party platform handles
all backup or restore operations, before it calls the {+admin-api+} 
again to return the cluster to a normal running state. 

While |mdb-support| can help you configure the integration points in 
{+onprem+}, contact your third-party vendor for functionality or 
performance issues related to the backup and restore process.

Limitations
-----------

You can use only a single solution to back up a single cluster. You 
can't use {+onprem+} and a third-party platform to back up the same 
cluster. You can't use multiple third-party platforms to back up the 
same cluster.

.. note:: 

   Third-party backups can't run alongside {+onprem+}'s native backup
   process on the same cluster. However, you can run both types of 
   backups in separate clusters within the same project for a flexible 
   resilience strategy.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Your {+onprem+} project must run {+onprem-full+} version 8.0.8 or 
  later to integrate with third-party backup platforms.

- See your vendor's documentation for the tooling version to use.

- Synchronize the clocks across all of your host machines 
  before you configure {+onprem+} for third-party backup integration. 
  To learn more, see :manual:`Clock Synchronization 
  </administration/production-notes/#clock-synchronization>`.

Integrate {+onprem+} with a Third-Party Backup Platform
--------------------------------------------------------

Complete the following preliminary setup in {+onprem+} before you go to
your third-party platform to finish setting up your integration: 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Generate API keys for the {+admin-api+}.  

      To grant the appropriate level of {+admin-api+} access to your 
      third-party vendor, you must generate either a global or 
      project-level API key in {+onprem+}. 

      See your third-party vendor's documentation to determine which 
      level of API access is necessary for your integration. 

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Global API Access
            :tabid: global
            
            To generate an API key for global {+admin-api+} access: 

            a. In the {+onprem+} :guilabel:`Admin` console, click 
               :guilabel:`General` and :guilabel:`API Keys`.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Create API Key` button.

            #. In the :guilabel:`Enter API Key Information` modal, 
               provide a description for your API key and select 
               :guilabel:`Global Backup Admin` from the
               :guilabel:`Global Permissions` drop-down menu.
             
            #. Click the ``Next`` button.

            #. Copy the :guilabel:`Public Key` and :guilabel:`Private Key`
               and store them in a secure location.

               Each API request requires these keys in the header to 
               securely communicate with {+onprem+}.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

         .. tab:: Project-Level API Access
            :tabid: project

            To generate an API key for project-level {+admin-api+} access: 

            a. In your {+onprem+} project, expand the 
               :guilabel:`Access Manager` drop-down menu and select 
               :guilabel:`Project Access`.
      
            #. Click the :guilabel:`API Keys` tab.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Create API Key` button.

            #. In the :guilabel:`Enter API Key Information` modal, 
               provide a description for your API key and select 
               :guilabel:`Project Backup Admin` from the
               :guilabel:`Project Permissions` drop-down menu.
             
            #. Click the ``Next`` button.

            #. Copy the :guilabel:`Public Key` and :guilabel:`Private Key`
               and store them in a secure location.

               Each API request requires these keys in the header to 
               securely communicate with {+onprem+}.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

      To learn more about {+admin-api+} access, see :ref:`mms-prog-api-key`.

   .. step:: Enable third-party backup in the {+onprem+} configuration. 
      
      a. In the {+onprem+} :guilabel:`Admin` console, click 
         :guilabel:`General` and :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Custom` tab. 
      
      #. Add one of the following key and value pairs to enable 
         third-party backup at the global or project level. 

         See your third-party vendor's documentation to determine which
         level of access is necessary for your integration.
                     
         .. list-table:: 
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 20 40 40 

            * - Access Level
              - Key 
              - Value

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save` to enable third-party backup.
    
   .. step:: (Conditional) Enable third-party backup in the {+onprem+} project settings.

      If you enabled third-party backup at the project level in the 
      previous step, you must enable third-party backup in your MongoDB
      project settings: 

      a. In your {+onprem+} project, click :guilabel:`Settings`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Beta Features` tab, and click
         :guilabel:`Backup Third Party Managed`.
    
   .. step:: Install {+mdbagent+}s on every server in the cluster. 

      If not already installed, install {+mdbagent+}s on every server in 
      each MongoDB cluster that you want to back up:  

      a. In your {+onprem+} project, click :guilabel:`Deployment`, the
         :guilabel:`Agents` tab, and the 
         :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings` tab.
      
      #. Select your host machine's operating system from the 
         :guilabel:`Select your operating system` drop-down menu.

      #. Follow the instructions to install a {+mdbagent+} on each of 
         the MongoDB servers that you want to back up. 

      To learn more, see :ref:`automation-agent-install-steps-manage`. 

   .. step:: Set an oplog file path for third-party backup.
      
      To set an directory for {+mdbagent+} oplog output: 

      a. In the {+onprem+} :guilabel:`Admin` console, click 
         :guilabel:`General` and :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Custom` tab, and add the following key and
         value pair: 

         .. list-table:: 
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 50 50 

            * - Key 
              - Value 
            
            * - ``brs.thirdparty.baseOplogFilePath``
              - Path to a directory that the {+mdbagent+} can access.
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Save` to add your file path parameter.

      #. For each {+mdbagent+} that you set up previously, 
         verify that the Agent can read and write to the oplog directory. 

         For verification methods, see your operating system's 
         documentation.

   .. step:: Enable monitoring and backup on every server in the cluster.

      In your {+onprem+} project, click :guilabel:`Deployment`, and 
      the :guilabel:`Servers` tab to view the MongoDB cluster 
      servers that your {+onprem+} project manages.
      
      For each server: 
         
      a. Click the :icon-mms:`ellipsis` menu next to your target 
         server's {+mdbagent+}.
                     
      #. Click :guilabel:`Activate Monitoring` and 
         :guilabel:`Activate Backup`.
         
      #. Click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.

         The :guilabel:`Review Your Changes` modal appears.

      #. After you review your changes, click 
         :guilabel:`Confirm & Deploy`. 

   .. step:: Set continuous backup to third-party managed.

      a. In your {+onprem+} project, click :guilabel:`Continuous Backup`.

      #. Hover over the :guilabel:`Status` column for the target 
         sharded cluster or replica set and click :guilabel:`Manage`. 

      #. In the ensuing modal, click :guilabel:`Manage`. 
         
         The cluster's :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` status changes to 
         :guilabel:`Third Party Managed`.

   .. step:: Finish integrating with your third-party platform.
      
      To finish integrating {+onprem+} with your third-party backup 
      platform, see your vendor's documentation:
