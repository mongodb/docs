Create a Role
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. By default, MongoDB
provides a number of 
:doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>`
that administrators may use to control
access to a MongoDB system. However, if these roles cannot describe
the desired privilege set of a particular user type in a deployment,
you can define a new, customized role.

A role's privileges apply to the database where the role is created. The
role can inherit privileges from other roles in its database. A role
created on the ``admin`` database can include privileges that apply to all
databases or to the :ref:`cluster <resource-cluster>` and can inherit
privileges from roles in other databases.

The combination of the database name and the role name
uniquely defines a role in MongoDB.
