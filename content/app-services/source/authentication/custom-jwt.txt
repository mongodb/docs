.. _custom-jwt-authentication-overview:

The Custom JWT authentication provider allows users to log in with an
authentication credential from a third-party system (external to Atlas
App Services) and use that token to access data and services with App Services. 
The external system must return a signed :jwt-io:`JSON Web
Token (JWT) <introduction>` that contains a unique ID value for the
authenticated user.

Authentication and Authorization
--------------------------------

The third-party JWT provider authenticates users and returns a JWT. App Services 
uses the JWT to identify your application's users and authorize their requests.

App Services is agnostic to the authentication methods used by the third-party 
provider. It does not impose any restrictions on the
external authentication system's requirements or authentication methods.
For example, the system could require the user to perform multi-factor
authentication (MFA), provide specific credentials, or otherwise identify
themselves.

.. _json-web-tokens:

How JWT Authentication Works
----------------------------

There are many resources online that dive into the intricacies of JWT 
authentication and the token structure. In the context of App Services, the 
following diagram provides the process flow of a user logging on to a 
Device Sync app. The steps below the diagram provide details.

.. figure:: /images/custom-auth-diagram.png
   :alt: Diagram of Custom JWT authentication architecture.
   :figwidth: 750px

JWT authentication with App Services follows these general steps:

1. The user logs on to the third-party authentication provider by whatever means 
   the provider requires.

#. If authentication succeeds, the provider returns a JWT to the client app.

#. The client app logs on to the App Services app, providing the JWT credential.

#. App Services parses and decodes the JWT.

#. If you manually provided signing keys in App Services, App Services checks if 
   the signing key in the JWT matches one of the signing keys you specified. If 
   so, the user is authenticated. 

#. If you configured App Services to use a JSON Web Key (JWK) URI, App 
   Services passes the JWT and public key to the third-party provider's JWK API. 

   #. The provider decodes and verifies the signature and returns a JWK.

   #. App Services checks if the signature in the JWK matches the JWT's 
      signature. If so, the user is authenticated.

.. important:: Access Token Always Expires after 30 Minutes

  App Services always specifies a 30-minute access token expiry even if the
  custom JWT token specifies a different expiry through the ``exp`` key. 
  App Services will check the custom JWT token ``exp`` to ensure that the token
  is still valid before issuing the 30-minute expiry. For more information on 
  App Services access tokens, refer to :ref:`manage-user-sessions`.

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration:
.. _config-custom-jwt:

Configuration
-------------

You configure Custom JWT Authentication from the UI or with the CLI. Choose your 
preferred method below.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You enable the JWT authentication provider from the App
      Services UI by selecting :guilabel:`Custom JWT Authentication`
      from the :guilabel:`Authentication` page.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To enable and configure the Custom JWT authentication provider with
      {+cli-ref+}, define a :ref:`configuration
      object <appconfig-auth>` for it in ``/auth/providers.json``.

      A :ref:`Custom JWT provider configuration <appconfig-auth>` has
      the following form:

      .. code-block:: none
         :caption: /auth/providers.json
         
         {
           "custom-token": {
             "name": "custom-token",
             "type": "custom-token",
             "config": {
               "audience": "<JWT Audience>",
               "requireAnyAudience": <boolean>,
               "signingAlgorithm": "<JWT Signing Algorithm>",
               "useJWKURI": <boolean>,
               "jwkURI": "<JWK or JWKS URL>",
             },
             "secret_config": {
               "signingKeys": [
                 "<Signing Key Secret Name>",
                 ...
               ]
             },
             "metadata_fields": [
               {
                 "required": <boolean>,
                 "name": "<JWT Field Path>",
                 "field_name": "<Metadata Field Name>",
               },
               ...
             ],
             "disabled": <boolean>
           }
         }


.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-verification-method:

Verification Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Verification Method` field determines how App Services will 
validate the JWT returned from the JWT provider. You can configure App Services 
to validate the JWT by using the signing key(s) you provide, or to validate by 
using a JSON Web Key (JWK) URI issued by the third-party provider.

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-manually-signing-keys:

Manually Specify Signing Keys
`````````````````````````````
You can configure your app to use one or more signing keys to validate the JWT. 
There are two settings you need to provide:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | :guilabel:`Signing Algorithm`
       | *config.signingAlgorithm*

     - The cryptographic method that the external system uses to sign
       the JWT. Custom authentication supports JWTs signed using either of
       the following algorithms:

       - ``HS256``
       - ``RS256``
       
   * - | :guilabel:`Signing Key`
       | *secret_config.signingKeys*

     - A list of up to three :ref:`Secrets <app-secret>`
       that each contain a signing key used by the third-party 
       authentication system to sign :abbr:`JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)`.
       The key can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, 
       underscores, and hyphens, and must be between 32 and 512 characters long. 
       The following is a valid 256-bit signing key:

       .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false
 
         231a58b00632c9c4d8ac02b268ca4caf8dd48fd020e3dffa72666523d860988f

       .. note::
 
         If you are uncertain of what value to use, consider visiting a random 
         key generator website, like `keygen.io <https://keygen.io/>`_, and 
         using one of the generated 256-bit values. 

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Set the Signing Algorithm:

         .. figure:: /images/custom-jwt-signing-algorithm.png
             :alt: The Signing Keys configuration inputs

      2. Create one or more signing keys to sign the JWT. To do 
         this, provide a name for the key (which is solely for your reference 
         later), and then specify a 256-bit signing key. 

         .. figure:: /images/custom-jwt-signing-key.png
             :alt: The Signing Keys configuration inputs


   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 2, 5-8

         "config": {
           "signingAlgorithm": "<JWT Signing Algorithm>",
         },
         "secret_config": {
           "signingKeys": [
             "<Signing Key Secret Name>",
             ...
           ]
         }

.. warning::

  A :guilabel:`Signing Key` is a secret key and anyone with the
  key can issue valid user credentials for your app. Ensure that
  it's never stored in a publicly accessible location, such as a
  git repository, message board, or in your code.

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-jwk-uri:

Use a JWK URI
`````````````
Some external authentication systems provide a `JSON Web Key Set
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517>`_ (JWKS) that describes the signing
algorithm and signing keys the system uses to sign JWTs. You can use the
JWKS to configure the provider instead of manually specifying the
signing algorithm and keys. The returned JWKS must include a
``kid`` header that specifies the Key ID of a key from the JWKS. The JWKS 
may specify up to three signing keys and must use the ``RS256`` algorithm. 

.. note:: 
   
   JWK and JWKS are used synonymously in Atlas App Services. 

There is only one value you need to provide:

- ``JWK URI``, which is the third-party URL that hosts a JWK or JWKS service. 
  When you choose this option, App Service automatically sets encryption  
  to the required ``RS256`` method.
       
.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      Specify the URL to the third-party JWKS endpoint:

      .. figure:: /images/custom-jwt-jwk-uri.png
        :alt: The JWKS URI input

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. code-block:: javascript

         "config": {
           "useJWKURI": <boolean>,
           "jwkURI": "<JWK or JWKS URL>"
         }
            

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields:

Metadata Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Metadata Fields` are additional data that describe each internal 
App Services user. App Services determines the value of each metadata field from 
the value of a field included in the third-party JWT. 
For example, if you set the ``name`` field of a user, then App Services will use 
that field in the JWT as the user's display name. 

.. note:: 

  App Services refreshes a user's metadata whenever they log in and exposes the 
  fields in the ``data`` object of the :ref:`user metadata <user-objects>`.

.. important:: JWT and Metadata Field Character Limits

   The length of a JWT token increases with the number of metadata fields in the 
   token and the size of each field. **App Services limits the length of a 
   JWT token to 1 million characters, and the length of each metadata field to 
   4096 characters.** If you exceed these limits, App Services logs an error 
   and the ticket is not processed.

There are three values that you need to specify for each metadata field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | :guilabel:`Required`
       | *required*

     - If ``true`` , the metadata field is required for all
       users associated with the provider. The JWT 
       returned by the external system must have a
       value assigned to the field designated by :guilabel:`Path`.

   * - | :guilabel:`Path`
       | *name*

     - The name of, or the path to, a field in the JWT that contains the value 
       for the metadata field. To specify the path to a field in
       an embedded object, use :manual:`dot notation </core/document/#dot-notation>`.
       If the name of the field itself in the JWT contains a period (``.``) 
       character, use a backslash (``\``) to escape the period. For example, if 
       the name is ``http://example.com/id``, use ``http://example\.com/id``.

   * - | :guilabel:`Field Name`
       | *field_name*

     - Optional. A name for the metadata field in the user object's ``data``
       document that maps to the JWT **Path**. This field name 
       must be less than 64 characters long.

       **Default Value Rules**

       - If this field is not specified, the name defaults to the name of 
         the JWT field that contains the value.

       - If this field is not specified and the **Path** value uses dot notation, 
         the default name will be the last part of the notation. For example, if 
         you specify a path of ``location.primary.city``, the default value for 
         the name is ``city``.

       
.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      To define a metadata field, click :guilabel:`Add Field` and
      specify the mapping between the metadata field in the JWT and its
      corresponding field name in the user object.
      
      .. figure:: /images/custom-auth-metadata-fields.png
         :alt: The metadata fields configuration table

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To define a metadata field in a Custom JWT authentication
      configuration file, add an entry for the field to the
      ``metadata_fields`` array. Each entry should be a document of the
      following form:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           required: <boolean>,
           name: "<field path>",
           field_name: "<metadata field name>"
         }


      Use a backslash (``\``) to escape period (``.``) characters in JWT keys. 
      
      For example, in this JSON object, you represent the ``"nested_key"`` in 
      the path name as ``valid\.json\.key\.nested_key``.

      .. code-block:: json 

        { "valid.json.key": {
            "nested_key": "val"
          }
        } 

.. example::

   An external authentication system returns JWTs that include
   additional information about each user in the ``user_data`` field:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      (JWT JSON)

      {
        "aud": "myapp-abcde",
        "exp": 1516239022,
        "sub": "24601",
        "user_data": {
          "name": "Jean Valjean",
          "aliases": [
            "Monsieur Madeleine",
            "Ultime Fauchelevent",
            "Urbain Fabre"
          ]
        }
      }

   To include the values from the ``user_data`` field in each user's
   :ref:`user object <user-objects>`, specify the following
   metadata fields in your App Services configuration:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Path
        - Field Name

      * - ``user_data.name``
        - ``name``

      * - ``user_data.aliases``
        - ``aliases``

   The :ref:`user object <user-objects>`, will now include those fields:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      (USER METADATA OBJECT)

      {
        "id": "59fdd02846244cdse5369ebf",
        "type": "normal",
        "data": {
          "name": "Jean Valjean",
          "aliases": [
            "Monsieur Madeleine",
            "Ultime Fauchelevent",
            "Urbain Fabre"
          ]
        },
        identities: [
          {
            "id": "24601",
            "provider_type": "custom-token",
            "data": {
              "name": "Jean Valjean",
              "aliases": [
                "Monsieur Madeleine",
                "Ultime Fauchelevent",
                "Urbain Fabre"
              ]
            },
          }
        ]
      }

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-audience:

Audience
~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Audience` of a JWT specifies the intended recipient of the token. 
JWTs describe their audience in the ``aud`` claim. App Services
expects ``aud`` to contain the App ID of the App for which the provider
is configured. However, if the external authentication system JWT specifies a 
different ``aud`` value, then you can configure the provider to use that value 
instead.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      There are two fields you configure:

      .. list-table::
              :header-rows: 1
              :widths: 15 30

              * - Field
                - Description

              * - ``Audience``

                - A single value or comma-separated list of values for the 
                  audience or audiences expected to be found in a client JWT. 

              * - ``Require``
                
                - If you provide multiple audiences, you must 
                  specify how to handle them. Your options are:

                  - **All of these audiences**: the JWT must include every audience in 
                    the list.

                  - **Any one of these audiences**: the JWT only needs to include one
                    audience from the list.

      To set an audience, configure ``config.audience``. There are two fields 
      you configure:

      .. list-table::
              :header-rows: 1
              :widths: 15 30

              * - ``requireAnyAudience``
                - Boolean. If ``false``, the JWT must include **all** of the listed
                  audiences. If ``true``, the JWT must only include one or 
                  more of the listed audiences.

.. _custom-jwt-authentication-examples:

Using JWT Authentication
------------------------

You can register new Custom JWT users and log them in using one of the Realm SDKs 
or an API service.

Realm SDKs
~~~~~~~~~~

For code examples that demonstrate how to register and log in using
Custom JWT authentication, see the Realm SDK documentation for your
preferred language and platform:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-login-jwt>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Node SDK <node-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-login-custom-jwt>`
- :ref:`Web SDK <web-login-custom-jwt>`

API Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can authenticate Data API requests using the Custom JWT
provider. You can either require users to create accounts before using a 
service, or configure your API endpoints to automatically create a new
user account if the request contains a valid JWT that does not match an
existing user. There are two approaches to using JWTs with your service APIs:

- specify the JWT directly in the ``jwtTokenString`` request header

- start a user session with the JWT and include the session access token
  as an ``Authorization`` header bearer token.

For more information, see :ref:`Authenticate Data API Requests
<data-api-authenticate-requests>`.
