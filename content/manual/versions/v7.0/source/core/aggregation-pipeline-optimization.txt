Aggregation pipeline operations have an optimization phase which
attempts to reshape the pipeline for improved performance.

To see how the optimizer transforms a particular aggregation pipeline,
include the :method:`explain <db.collection.aggregate()>` option in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method.

.. include:: /includes/fact-optimizations-subject-to-change.rst

In addition to learning about the aggregation pipeline optimizations
performed during the optimization phase, you will also see how to
improve aggregation pipeline performance using :ref:`indexes and
document filters <aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters>`.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-projection-optimization:

Projection Optimization
-----------------------

The aggregation pipeline can determine if it requires only a subset of
the fields in the documents to obtain the results. If so, the pipeline
only uses those fields, reducing the amount of data passing through the
pipeline.

``$project`` Stage Placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |$project| replace:: :pipeline:`$project`

.. include:: /includes/aggregation/fact-project-stage-placement.rst

.. _aggregation-pipeline-sequence-optimization:

Pipeline Sequence Optimization
------------------------------

.. _agg-project-addFields-match-optimization:

(``$project`` or ``$unset`` or ``$addFields`` or ``$set``) + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an aggregation pipeline that contains a projection stage
(:pipeline:`$addFields`, :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$set`, or
:pipeline:`$unset`) followed by a :pipeline:`$match` stage, MongoDB
moves any filters in the ``$match`` stage that do not require values
computed in the projection stage to a new ``$match`` stage before the
projection.

If an aggregation pipeline contains multiple projection or ``$match``
stages, MongoDB performs this optimization for each ``$match`` stage,
moving each ``$match`` filter before all projection stages that the
filter does not depend on.

Consider a pipeline with the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 18-23

   {
      $addFields: {
         maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
         minTime: { $min: "$times" }
      }
   },
   {
      $project: {
         _id: 1,
         name: 1,
         times: 1,
         maxTime: 1,
         minTime: 1,
         avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
      }
   },
   {
      $match: {
         name: "Joe Schmoe",
         maxTime: { $lt: 20 },
         minTime: { $gt: 5 },
         avgTime: { $gt: 7 }
      }
   }

The optimizer breaks up the ``$match`` stage into four individual
filters, one for each key in the ``$match`` query document. The
optimizer then moves each filter before as many projection stages as
possible, creating new ``$match`` stages as needed.

Given this example, the optimizer automatically produces the following
*optimized* pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 6, 11
   :copyable: false

   { $match: { name: "Joe Schmoe" } },
   { $addFields: {
       maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
       minTime: { $min: "$times" }
   } },
   { $match: { maxTime: { $lt: 20 }, minTime: { $gt: 5 } } },
   { $project: {
       _id: 1, name: 1, times: 1, maxTime: 1, minTime: 1,
       avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
   } },
   { $match: { avgTime: { $gt: 7 } } }

.. note::

   The optimized pipeline is not intended to be run manually. The
   original and optimized pipelines return the same results.

   You can see the optimized pipeline in the :ref:`explain plan
   <example-aggregate-method-explain-option>`.

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ avgTime: { $gt: 7 } }`` depends on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage to compute the ``avgTime`` field. The
:pipeline:`$project` stage is the last projection stage in this
pipeline, so the :pipeline:`$match` filter on ``avgTime`` could not be
moved.

The ``maxTime`` and ``minTime`` fields are computed in the
:pipeline:`$addFields` stage but have no dependency on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage. The optimizer created a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage for the filters on these fields and placed it
before the :pipeline:`$project` stage.

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` does not
use any values computed in either the :pipeline:`$project` or
:pipeline:`$addFields` stages so it was moved to a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage before both of the projection stages.

After optimization, the filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` is in a
:pipeline:`$match` stage at the beginning of the pipeline. This has the
added benefit of allowing the aggregation to use an index on the
``name`` field when initially querying the collection.

.. _agg-sort-match-optimization:

``$sort`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$match`, the :pipeline:`$match` moves before the
:pipeline:`$sort` to minimize the number of objects to sort. For
example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $match: { status: 'A' } }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { status: 'A' } },
   { $sort: { age : -1 } }

``$redact`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, when the pipeline has the :pipeline:`$redact` stage
immediately followed by the :pipeline:`$match` stage, the aggregation
can sometimes add a portion of the :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage. If the added :pipeline:`$match` stage is at
the start of a pipeline, the aggregation can use an index as well as
query the collection to limit the number of documents that enter the
pipeline. See
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters` for more
information.

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

The optimizer can add the same :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

.. _agg-project-skip-optimization:

``$project``/``$unset`` + ``$skip`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$project` or :pipeline:`$unset` followed by 
:pipeline:`$skip`, the :pipeline:`$skip` 
moves before :pipeline:`$project`. For example, if
the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } },
   { $skip: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 5 },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } }

.. _aggregation-pipeline-coalescence-optimization:

Pipeline Coalescence Optimization
---------------------------------

When possible, the optimization phase coalesces a pipeline stage into
its predecessor. Generally, coalescence occurs *after* any sequence
reordering optimization.

.. _agg-sort-limit-coalescence:

``$sort`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$sort` precedes a :pipeline:`$limit`, the optimizer
can coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` if no
intervening stages modify the number of documents 
(e.g. :pipeline:`$unwind`, :pipeline:`$group`).
MongoDB will not coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the
:pipeline:`$sort` if there are pipeline stages that change the number of
documents between the :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$limit` stages..

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort : { age : -1 } },
   { $project : { age : 1, status : 1, name : 1 } },
   { $limit: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer coalesces the sequence
to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "$sort" : {
          "sortKey" : {
             "age" : -1
          },
          "limit" : NumberLong(5)
       }
   },
   { "$project" : { 
            "age" : 1, 
            "status" : 1, 
            "name" : 1 
     } 
   }

This allows the sort operation to only maintain the
top ``n`` results as it progresses, where ``n`` is the specified limit,
and MongoDB only needs to store ``n`` items in memory
[#coalescence-allowDiskUse]_. See :ref:`sort-and-memory` for more
information.

.. note:: Sequence Optimization with $skip

   If there is a :pipeline:`$skip` stage between the :pipeline:`$sort`
   and :pipeline:`$limit` stages, MongoDB will coalesce the
   :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` stage and increase the
   :pipeline:`$limit` value by the :pipeline:`$skip` amount. See
   :ref:`agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence` for an example.

.. [#coalescence-allowDiskUse] The optimization will still apply when
   ``allowDiskUse`` is ``true`` and the ``n`` items exceed the
   :ref:`aggregation memory limit <agg-memory-restrictions>`.

.. _agg-limit-limit-coalescence:

``$limit`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$limit` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$limit`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$limit` where the limit amount is the *smaller* of the two
initial limit amounts. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 100 },
   { $limit: 10 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$limit` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$limit` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$limit`
stage where the limit amount ``10`` is the minimum of the two initial
limits ``100`` and ``10``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 10 }

.. _agg-skip-skip-coalescence:

``$skip`` + ``$skip`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$skip` immediately follows another :pipeline:`$skip`,
the two stages can coalesce into a single :pipeline:`$skip` where the
skip amount is the *sum* of the two initial skip amounts. For example, a
pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 5 },
   { $skip: 2 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$skip` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$skip` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$skip`
stage where the skip amount ``7`` is the sum of the two initial
limits ``5`` and ``2``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 7 }

.. _agg-match-match-coalescence:

``$match`` + ``$match`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$match` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$match`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$match` combining the conditions with an
:expression:`$and`. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $match: { status: "A" } }

Then the second :pipeline:`$match` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$match` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$match`
stage 

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { $and: [ { "year" : 2014 }, { "status" : "A" } ] } }

.. _agg-lookup-unwind-coalescence:

``$lookup``, ``$unwind``, and ``$match`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When :pipeline:`$unwind` immediately follows :pipeline:`$lookup`, and the 
:pipeline:`$unwind` operates on the ``as`` field of the :pipeline:`$lookup`, 
the optimizer coalesces the :pipeline:`$unwind` into the :pipeline:`$lookup` 
stage. This avoids creating large intermediate documents. Furthermore, if 
:pipeline:`$unwind` is followed by a :pipeline:`$match` on any ``as`` subfield 
of the :pipeline:`$lookup`, the optimizer also coalesces the :pipeline:`$match`.

For example, a pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup: {
        from: "otherCollection",
        as: "resultingArray",
        localField: "x",
        foreignField: "y"
      }
   },
   { $unwind: "$resultingArray"  },
   { $match: {
       "resultingArray.foo": "bar"
     }
   }

The optimizer coalesces the :pipeline:`$unwind` and :pipeline:`$match` stages 
into the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. If you run the aggregation with ``explain``
option, the ``explain`` output shows the coalesced stages:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup: {
        from: "otherCollection",
        as: "resultingArray",
        localField: "x",
        foreignField: "y",
        let: {},
        pipeline: [
          {
            $match: {
              "foo": {
                "$eq": "bar"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        unwinding: {
          "preserveNullAndEmptyArrays": false
        }
      }
   }

You can see this optimized pipeline in the :ref:`explain plan
<example-aggregate-method-explain-option>`.

The ``unwinding`` field shown in the previous ``explain`` output
differs from the ``$unwind`` stage. The ``unwinding`` field shows how
the pipeline is internally optimized. The ``$unwind`` stage deconstructs
an array field from the input documents and outputs a document for each
element.

.. _sbe-pipeline-optimizations:

|sbe-title| Pipeline Optimizations
----------------------------------

MongoDB can use the :ref:`slot-based query execution engine 
<sbe-landing>` to execute certain pipeline stages when specific 
conditions are met. In most cases, the |sbe-short| provides improved 
performance and lower CPU and memory costs compared to the classic query
engine.

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-7.0-sbe-disabled.rst

To verify that the |sbe-short| is used, run the aggregation with the
``explain`` option. This option outputs information on the
aggregation's query plan. For more information on using ``explain``
with aggregations, see :ref:`example-aggregate-method-explain-option`.

The following sections describe:

- The conditions when the |sbe-short| is used for aggregation.

- How to verify if the |sbe-short| was used.

.. _agg-group-optimization-sbe:

``$group`` Optimization 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.2

.. include:: /includes/fact-sbe-group-overview.rst

When the |sbe| is used for :pipeline:`$group`, the :ref:`explain results
<explain-results>` include ``queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.stage:
"GROUP"``.

The location of the ``queryPlanner`` object depends on whether the
pipeline contains stages after the ``$group`` stage that cannot be
executed using the |sbe-short|.

- If ``$group`` is the last stage or all stages after ``$group`` can
  be executed using the |sbe-short|, the ``queryPlanner`` object is in
  the top-level ``explain`` output object (``explain.queryPlanner``).

- If the pipeline contains stages after ``$group`` that cannot be
  executed using the |sbe-short|, the ``queryPlanner`` object is in
  ``explain.stages[0].$cursor.queryPlanner``.

.. _agg-lookup-optimization-sbe:

``$lookup`` Optimization 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 6.0

.. include:: /includes/fact-sbe-lookup-overview.rst

When the |sbe| is used for :pipeline:`$lookup`, the :ref:`explain
results <explain-results>` include
``queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.stage: "EQ_LOOKUP"``. ``EQ_LOOKUP``
means "equality lookup".

The location of the ``queryPlanner`` object depends on whether the
pipeline contains stages after the ``$lookup`` stage that cannot be
executed using the |sbe-short|.

- If ``$lookup`` is the last stage or all stages after ``$lookup`` can
  be executed using the |sbe-short|, the ``queryPlanner`` object is in
  the top-level ``explain`` output object (``explain.queryPlanner``).

- If the pipeline contains stages after ``$lookup`` that cannot be
  executed using the |sbe-short|, the ``queryPlanner`` object is in
  ``explain.stages[0].$cursor.queryPlanner``.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters:

Improve Performance with Indexes and Document Filters
-----------------------------------------------------

The following sections show how you can improve aggregation performance
using indexes and document filters.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline can use :ref:`indexes <indexes>` from the input 
collection to improve performance. Using an index limits the amount of 
documents a stage processes. Ideally, an index can :ref:`cover 
<read-operations-covered-query>` the stage query. A covered query has 
especially high performance, since the index returns all matching 
documents.

For example, a pipeline that consists of :pipeline:`$match`, 
:pipeline:`$sort`, :pipeline:`$group` can benefit from indexes at 
every stage:

- An index on the ``$match`` query field efficiently 
  identifies the relevant data

- An index on the sorting field returns data in sorted order for the 
  ``$sort`` stage

- An index on the grouping field that matches the ``$sort`` 
  order returns all of the field values needed for the
  ``$group`` stage, making it a covered query.

To determine whether a pipeline uses indexes, review the query plan and 
look for ``IXSCAN`` or ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` plans.

.. note::
   In some cases, the query planner uses a ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` index plan 
   that returns one document per index key value. ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` 
   executes faster than ``IXSCAN`` if there are multiple documents per 
   key value. However, index scan parameters might affect the time 
   comparison of ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` and ``IXSCAN``.

For early stages in your aggregation pipeline, consider indexing the 
query fields. Stages that can benefit from indexes are:

:pipeline:`$match` stage
  During the ``$match`` stage, the server can use an index if ``$match`` is the first stage in the pipeline, after any optimizations from the :ref:`query planner <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

:pipeline:`$sort` stage
   During the ``$sort`` stage, the server can use an index if the stage is not preceded by a :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$unwind`, or 
   :pipeline:`$group` stage.

:pipeline:`$group` stage
  During the ``$group`` stage, the server can use an index to quickly
  find the :group:`$first <$first>` or :group:`$last <$last>` document
  in each group if the stage meets both of these conditions:

  - The pipeline :pipeline:`sorts <$sort>` and :pipeline:`groups
    <$group>` by the same field.

  - The ``$group`` stage only uses the :group:`$first` or 
    :group:`$last` accumulator operator.

  See :ref:`$group Performance Optimizations <group-pipeline-optimization>` for an example.

:pipeline:`$geoNear` stage 
  The server always uses an index for the ``$geoNear`` stage, since it 
  requires a :ref:`geospatial index <index-feature-geospatial>`.

Additionally, stages later in the pipeline that retrieve data from 
other, unmodified collections can use indexes on those collections 
for optimization. These stages include:

- :pipeline:`$lookup`
- :pipeline:`$graphLookup`
- :pipeline:`$unionWith`

Document Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the documents in
a collection, filter the documents first:

- Use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and :pipeline:`$skip`
  stages to restrict the documents that enter the pipeline.
  
- When possible, put :pipeline:`$match` at the beginning of the pipeline
  to use indexes that scan the matching documents in a collection.

- :pipeline:`$match` followed by :pipeline:`$sort` at the start of the
  pipeline is equivalent to a single query with a sort, and can use an
  index.

Example
-------
.. _agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence:

``$sort`` + ``$skip`` + ``$limit`` Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pipeline contains a sequence of :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$skip` followed by a :pipeline:`$limit`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 10 },
   { $limit: 5 }

The optimizer performs :ref:`agg-sort-limit-coalescence` to
transforms the sequence to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "$sort" : {
         "sortKey" : {
            "age" : -1
         },
         "limit" : NumberLong(15)
      }
   },
   {
      "$skip" : NumberLong(10)
   }

MongoDB increases the :pipeline:`$limit` amount with the reordering.

   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`
