  To install {+mcli+}, you can either:
  
  1. Clone the GitHub repository and install with Go or 
  #. Download and extract the binary. 

  Once downloaded, you can run the binary from any directory. Because
  you don't need to install the {+mcli+} into a global location, you can
  use it on shared hosts and other systems where you don't have a
  privileged account.

  To run ``mcli`` commands from anywhere in your system, you must
  either:
    
  1. Add the location of the executable to your ``PATH`` or
  #. Move the executable to a directory in your ``PATH``.

  You can accomplish this in several ways, depending on your personal
  settings and environment. Consult the documentation for your shell and
  operating system for more examples.

  .. example::

     In the following example, the user downloads and installs 
     the {+mcli+} by cloning the GitHub repository. The ``mcli``
     executable file saves to the ``$HOME/.bin`` directory.

     The user then adds this directory to their ``PATH``:

     .. code-block:: sh
        
        export PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"

  .. example::

     In the following example, the user downloads and extracts a
     binary for the {+mcli+} to the ``/mcli_0.0.1-macOS_x86_64``
     directory. 

     The user then moves the executable file to a directory already in
     their ``PATH``: 

     .. code-block:: sh

        cd mcli_0.0.1-macOS_x86_64
        mv mcli $HOME/.bin

  To verify your ``mcli`` installation, run the ``help`` command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mcli help

  The command returns the available commands and options for the
  {+mcli+}.
