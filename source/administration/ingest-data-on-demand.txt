Trigger Data Ingestion On Demand 
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can manually trigger an ingestion of snapshot data from the 
|service| cluster to {+adl+} datasets if you configured :guilabel:`On 
Demand` extraction in your {+dl+} pipeline. 

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

   .. step::  Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` on the left-hand navigation.

   .. step:: Click the vertical ellipsis (:icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v`) for the {+dl+} for which you configured :guilabel:`On Demand` ingestion and select :guilabel:`Trigger an On Demand Pipeline Run`.

   .. step:: Select the snapshot, from which to ingest data, from the dropdown.

      The dropdown shows a list of all the snapshots on your |service| 
      cluster. However, you can select only the snapshots from which 
      {+dl+} hasn't yet ingested data; the grayed-out snapshots are 
      snapshots from which your {+dl+} has already ingested data.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

      |service| displays a blue banner at the top of the page that 
      shows the data ingestion status.
