":dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` can trigger the current primary to step down"

msgid ""
"The median time before a cluster elects a new primary should not "
"typically exceed 12 seconds, assuming default :rsconf:`replica "
"configuration settings <settings>`. This includes time required to mark "
"the primary as :ref:`unavailable <replication-auto-failover>` and call "
"and complete an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. You can tune "
"this time period by modifying the "
":rsconf:`settings.electionTimeoutMillis` replication configuration "
"option. Factors such as network latency may extend the time required for "
"replica set elections to complete, which in turn affects the amount of "
"time your cluster may operate without a primary. These factors are "
"dependent on your particular cluster architecture."
