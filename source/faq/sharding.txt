This document answers common questions about :doc:`/sharding`. See also
the :doc:`/sharding` section in the manual, which provides an
:doc:`overview of sharding </sharding>`, including details on:

Is sharding appropriate for a new deployment?
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes. However, if your data set fits on a single server, you
should begin with an unsharded deployment as sharding while your data
set is small provides *little advantage* .

.. _faq-change-shard-key:

Can I select a different shard key after sharding a collection?
---------------------------------------------------------------

No.

There is no automatic support in MongoDB for choosing a different shard key
after sharding a collection. This reality underscores
the importance of choosing a good :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`. If you
*must* change a shard key after sharding a collection, the best option is to:

- dump all data from MongoDB into an external format.

- drop the original sharded collection.

- configure sharding using a more ideal shard key.

- :doc:`pre-split </tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` the shard
  key range to ensure initial even distribution.

- restore the dumped data into MongoDB.

Although you cannot select a different shard key for a sharded
collection, starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can update a document's shard
key value unless the shard key field is the immutable ``_id`` field.
For details on updating the shard key values, see
:ref:`update-shard-key`.

Before MongoDB 4.2, a document's shard key field value is immutable.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/sharding-shard-key`

Why are my documents not distributed across the shards?
-------------------------------------------------------

The balancer starts distributing data across the shards once the
distribution of chunks has reached certain thresholds. See
:ref:`sharding-migration-thresholds`.

In addition, MongoDB cannot move a chunk if the number of documents in
the chunk exceeds a certain number. See
:ref:`migration-chunk-size-limit` and :ref:`jumbo-chunk`.

How does ``mongos`` detect changes in the sharded cluster configuration?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances maintain a cache of the :term:`config
database` that holds the metadata for the :term:`sharded cluster`.

:binary:`~bin.mongos` updates its cache lazily by issuing a request to a
shard and discovering that its metadata is out of date. To force the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` to reload its cache, you can run the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command against each :binary:`~bin.mongos`
directly.

.. _faq-writebacklisten:

What does ``writebacklisten`` in the log mean?
----------------------------------------------

The writeback listener is a process that opens a long poll to relay
writes back from a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` after
migrations to make sure they have not gone to the wrong server.  The
writeback listener sends writes back to the correct server if
necessary.

These messages are a key part of the sharding infrastructure and should
not cause concern.

How does ``mongos`` use connections?
------------------------------------

Each :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance maintains a pool of connections to the
members of the sharded cluster. Client requests use these connections
one at a time; i.e. requests are not multiplexed or pipelined.

When client requests complete, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` returns the
connection to the pool. These pools do not shrink when the number of
clients decreases. This can lead to an unused :binary:`~bin.mongos` with a
large number of open connections. If the :binary:`~bin.mongos` is no longer
in use, it is safe to restart the process to close existing connections.

To return aggregated statistics related to all of the outgoing
connection pools used by the :binary:`~bin.mongos`, connect a
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` with , and run the
:dbcommand:`connPoolStats` command:

.. code-block:: sh

   db.adminCommand("connPoolStats");

See the :ref:`System Resource Utilization
<system-resource-utilization>` section of the :doc:`/reference/ulimit`
document.
