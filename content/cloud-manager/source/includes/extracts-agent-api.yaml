   With the new Agent API Key model, multiple Agent API Keys can be
   associated with a project. This gives users the ability to perform
   Agent key rotation.

   In addition, the new Agent API Key model improves on security as the
   keys are displayed only once upon creation and |mms|  no longer
   stores or displays these keys.

   You can use an Agent API key that you have already generated for the
   project. Otherwise, you can generate a new Agent API key. A project can
   have more than one Agent API key, and any of the project's agents can
   use any of the keys. For more information, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`.

   .. important::

      When you generate an Agent API Key, |mms| displays it **one time
      only**. You must copy this key. Treat it like a password; store
      it in a secure place. |mms| never displays the full key again.
