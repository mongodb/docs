   The |package-name| package is officially maintained and supported by
   MongoDB Inc. and kept up-to-date with the most recent MongoDB
   releases. This installation procedure uses the |package-name|
   package.

   The ``mongodb`` package provided by |distro-name| is **not**
   maintained by MongoDB Inc. and conflicts with the
   |package-name| package. To check if Ubuntu's ``mongodb`` package is
   installed on the system, run ``sudo apt list --installed |
   grep mongodb``. You can use ``sudo apt remove mongodb`` and ``sudo
   apt purge mongodb`` to remove and purge the ``mongodb``
   package before attempting this procedure.
