Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure how your application
connects to MongoDB and how it processes your data. When you set up your
application, you are required to supply a **connection string**, or
connection URI, which contains a set of instructions that {+odm+} uses to
connect to a MongoDB. To learn more about connection strings, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string/>` in the
{+server-manual+}.

You primarily configure {+odm+} by using a ``mongoid.yml`` file that
specifies your connection options and clients. To learn more about
creating a ``mongoid.yml`` file when setting up an application, see one
of the following guides:

- :ref:`mongoid-quick-start-rails`
- :ref:`mongoid-quick-start-sinatra`

Structure of mongoid.yml
------------------------

The simplest configuration for an application configures {+odm+} to
connect to a MongoDB server at ``localhost:27017`` and access the database
named ``myDB``. The ``mongoid.yml`` file for this configuration
resembles the following file:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: mongoid.yml

   development:
     clients:
       default:
         database: myDB
         hosts:
           - localhost:27017

The top level key in the preceding file, ``development``, refers to the
environment name which the application is running. Possible values include
``development``, ``test`` or ``production``. The third level key,
``default``, refers to the MongoDB client name. Most applications use a
single client named ``default``.

Generate Default Configuration
------------------------------

If you are using {+ror+} as your application framework, you can generate
a default configuration file in your application by running the
following shell command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   rails g mongoid:config

This command creates the configuration file at ``config/mongoid.yml``.
An initializer is also created at ``config/initializers/mongoid.rb``. We
recommended that you specify all settings in ``mongoid.yml``, but you can
also use the ``mongoid.rb`` initializer to set configuration options.
Settings in ``mongoid.yml`` always override settings in the initializer.

If you are not using {+ror+}, you can create the ``config/mongoid.yml``
file, then copy and paste the configuration file shown in the preceding
section.

Load {+odm+} Configuration
--------------------------

.. important::

   You must configure {+odm+} before using any {+odm+} component. After you
   use or reference a component, changing the configuration might not apply
   changes to already instantiated components.

If you are using {+ror+}, Rails automatically loads your {+odm+}
configuration for the current environment as stored in ``Rails.env``.

You can also specify {+odm+} as the ORM for your application by
adding the following lines to your ``application.rb`` file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   config.generators do |g|
     g.orm :mongoid
   end

If you are not using {+ror+}, you must load your {+odm+} configuration
manually. Call the ``Mongoid.load!`` method, which takes the
configuration file path as its argument:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Uses automatically detected environment name
   Mongoid.load!("config/mongoid.yml")
 
   # Specifies environment name manually
   Mongoid.load!("config/mongoid.yml", :development)

{+odm+} detects the environment name by examining the following sources,
in order:

1. If ``Rails`` top-level constant is defined: ``Rails.env``
#. If ``Sinatra`` top-level constant is defined: ``Sinatra::Base.environment``
#. ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable
#. ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

.. note::

   You can also configure {+odm+} directly in {+language+} without using
   a configuration file. This configuration style does not support the
   concept of environments. Any configuration that you provide is
   applied to the current environment.

.. _mongoid-config-options-all:

Configuration Options
---------------------

The following annotated example ``mongoid.yml`` file describes where to
set each type of configuration option and provides information about
each option and its parameters.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sample-config-options.yml
   :language: yaml

Version Based Defaults
----------------------

{+odm+} supports setting configuration options to their default values
for specific versions. This might be useful for when you update to a new
{+odm+} version. When upgrading your {+odm+} version, set the following
options on ``Mongoid::Config``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Mongoid.configure do |config|
     config.load_defaults <older version>
   end

This allows you to upgrade to a new version of {+odm+} while using
the configuration options from the previous installed version.
This feature gives you more time to implement tests for each changed
behavior to make sure your code doesn't break or behave in unexpected
ways. After you verify that your application works as expected, you can
remove this code to use the current version's default configuration.

ERb Pre-processing
------------------

When loading a configuration file, {+odm+} processes it by using
:github:`ERb <ruby/erb>` before parsing it as YAML. This allows {+odm+}
to construct the contents of the configuration file at runtime
based on environment variables.

Because {+odm+} performs ERb rendering before YAML parsing, all ERb
directives in the configuration file are evaluated, including those
occurring in YAML comments.

The following sample ``mongoid.yml`` file demonstrates how you can
reference an environment variable that stores your connection string:

.. code-block:: yaml

   development:
     clients:
       default:
         uri: "<%= ENV['MONGODB_URI'] %>"

.. tip::

   When outputting values from ERb, ensure the values are valid YAML
   and escape them as needed.

.. _mongoid-config-time-zones:

Time Zone Configuration
-----------------------

{+odm+} uses Active Support's time zone functionality, which provides
more functionality than {+language+}'s standard library. Active Support
allows configuration of the ``Time.zone`` variable, a thread-global
variable which provides context for working with date and time values.

You can implement correct time zone handling in your application by
performing the following steps:

1. Set the operating system's time zone to UTC.

#. Set your application default time zone to UTC, as shown in the
   following code:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      # If using Rails, in `application.rb`:
      class Application < Rails::Application
        config.time_zone = 'UTC'
      end
    
      # If not using Rails:
      Time.zone = 'UTC'

#. In each controller and job class, set the appropriate time zone in a
   ``before_filter`` callback:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        before_filter :fetch_user, :set_time_zone
    
        def set_time_zone
          Time.zone = @user.time_zone
        end
      end

#. Then, you can work with times in the local time zone.

#. Use Active Support methods instead of the {+language+} standard library.

   - Use the ``Time.zone.now`` or ``Time.current`` methods instead of
     ``Time.now``
   - Use the ``Date.current`` method instead of ``Date.today``

   The {+language+} standard library methods such as ``Time.now`` and
   ``Date.today`` reference your system time zone and not the value of
   the ``Time.zone`` variable.

   You might mistake these similarly named methods, so we recommend
   using the `Rails/TimeZone
   <https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-rails/cops_rails.html#railstimezone>`__
   feature from RuboCop in your tests.

Set Time Zone on MongoDB Data
-----------------------------

MongoDB stores all times in UTC without time zone information.
{+odm+} models load and return time values as instances of
``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``. You can set the ``use_utc`` option
to control how {+odm+} sets the time zone when loading values from the
database:

- ``false`` (*default*): {+odm+} uses the value of ``Time.zone`` to set
  the time zone of values from the database.
- ``true``: {+odm+} always sets the time zone as UTC on loaded
  time values.

The ``use_utc`` option affects only how data is loaded and does not affect
how data is persisted. For example, if you assign a ``Time`` or
``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` instance to a time field, the time
zone information of the assigned instance is used
regardless of the ``use_utc`` value.

Alternatively, if you assign a string value to a time field, any time
zone information in the string is parsed. If the string does not include
time zone information it is parsed according to the ``Time.zone`` value.

The following code sets a ``Time.zone`` value and demonstrates how
{+odm+} processes different time strings:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Time.use_zone("Asia/Kolkata") do
 
     # String does not include time zone, so "Asia/Kolkata" is used
     ghandi.born_at = "1869-10-02 7:10 PM"
 
     # Time zone in string (-0600) is used
     amelia.born_at = "1897-07-24 11:30 -0600"
   end

SSL/TLS Configuration
---------------------

You can configure advanced TLS options in your application, such as
enabling or disabling certain ciphers. To learn about the main SSL/TLS
options, see the :ref:`mongoid-config-options-all` section of this guide.

You can set TLS context hooks on the {+ruby-driver+}. TLS context
hooks are user-provided ``Proc`` objects that are invoked before any TLS
socket connection is created in the driver. These hooks can be used to
modify the underlying ``OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext`` object used by the
socket.

To set TLS context hooks, add a ``Proc`` to the ``Mongo.tls_context_hooks``
array. This task can be done in an initializer. The following example adds a hook
that only enables the ``"AES256-SHA"`` cipher:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Mongo.tls_context_hooks.push(
     Proc.new { |context|
       context.ciphers = ["AES256-SHA"]
     }
   )

Every ``Proc`` in ``Mongo.tls_context_hooks`` is passed an
``OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext`` object as its sole argument. These ``Proc``
objects are run sequentially during socket creation.

.. warning::

   TLS context hooks are global and affect all ``Mongo::Client``
   instances in an application.

To learn more about TLS context hooks, see :ruby:`Modifying SSLContext
</reference/create-client/#modifying-sslcontext>` in the {+ruby-driver+}
documentation.

Network Compression
-------------------

{+odm+} supports compression of messages to and from MongoDB. This
functionality is provided by the {+ruby-driver+}, which implements the
following supported algorithms:

- `Zstandard <https://facebook.github.io/zstd/>`__ (*Recommended*): To use ``zstandard``
  compression, you must install the :rubygems:`zstd-ruby
  <gems/zstd-ruby>` library. This compressor
  produces the highest compression at the same CPU consumption compared
  to the other compressors.
- :github:`Snappy <google/snappy>`: To use ``snappy`` compression, you
  must install the :rubygems:`snappy <gems/snappy>` library.
- `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__: To use ``zlib`` compression, you
  must install the :rubygems:`zlib <gems/zlib>` library.

To use wire protocol compression, configure the driver options
in your ``mongoid.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   development:
     clients:
       default:
         ...
         options:
           # Specify compresses to use. (default is no compression)
           # Accepted values are zstd, zlib, snappy, or a combination
           compressors: ["zstd", "snappy"]

If you do not explicitly request any compressors, the driver does not
use compression, even if the required dependencies for one or more
compressors are installed.

The driver chooses the first compressor, if you specify multiple, that
is supported by your MongoDB deployment.
