On the :guilabel:`Data Sources` page, an |service| 
:authrole:`Project Owner` can manage a deployment. 

To manage a deployment in |charts-short|:

.. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps-connect-deployment.rst

You can modify the following deployment settings.

Connect or Disconnect the Deployment or Data Sources
----------------------------------------------------

An |service| :authrole:`Project Owner` can connect the deployment or
its data sources. To learn more, see
:ref:`connect-disconnect-data-source`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-charts-connects-by-default.rst

To manage other data source settings, see :ref:`manage-existing-data-sources`.

Deployment Read Preference
--------------------------

Each :ref:`deployment <deployments>` has a read preference, which
determines the :manual:`replica set member </core/replica-set-members>`
that the data source reads data from. 

By default, a newly-added |service| {+cluster+} has a read 
preference of :guilabel:`Secondary`, which means that it reads from a
:manual:`secondary node </core/replica-set-secondary>`
within the |service| {+cluster+}. You can change the read preference of
a {+cluster+} using the :guilabel:`Read preference` dropdown. 

You can't change the read preference of a
{+fdi+}. {+Fdis+} have a read preference
of :guilabel:`Nearest` by default, which means that they read from the
replica set member whose network latency falls
within the acceptable latency window. To learn more, see
:manual:`/core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-nearest`.

The :guilabel:`Read preference` dropdown contains the following read
preference options for {+clusters+}:
