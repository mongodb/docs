|service| offers the following options for organization security.

Federated Authentication
------------------------

Link your |idp| to |service| if you provide each with the
appropriate metadata. After you link your |idp| to |service|, you can 
map domains, organizations, and roles to your |idp|. To learn more, see 
:ref:`atlas-federated-authentication`.

Multi-Factor Authentication
---------------------------

Configure |mfa| to help you control access to your |service| accounts.
To set up |mfa|, see :ref:`atlas-enable-mfa`.

|service| Backend Infrastructure Access Restrictions
-----------------------------------------------------
Allow temporary access for MongoDB Support to your |service| infrastructure, 
including :ref:`granting and revoking access <restrict-access>` at 
the {+cluster+} level.

{+atlas-cli+} Authentication
------------------------------
Use {+atlas-cli+} for secure authenticated access to your deployment 
via :ref:`Atlas CLI Authentication <atlas-ui-authentication-streams>` 
to manage your |service-fullname| deployments. Set up access using |service| 
credentials or an API key.
