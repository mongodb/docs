You can continually push logs from ``mongod``, ``mongos``, and audit logs to an AWS S3 bucket.
|service| exports logs every 5 minutes.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need

- an AWS account with permissions to manage IAM roles.
- an existing AWS S3 bucket.

Procedure
---------

To continually push logs to an AWS S3 bucket, follow these steps.

.. include:: /includes/steps/logs-push-s3.yaml

Limitations
-----------

- You can't specify which logs to send. |service| sends all ``mongod``, ``mongos``, and audit logs.
- Push-based log export doesn't support Bring Your Own Key (BYOK).
