    Each cloud provider has a selection of global regions to which
    |service| can deploy a zone. The choice of cloud provider may
    support or constrict your ability to deploy a zone to specific
    geographic locations. The configuration options available and
    the cost for running the cluster may also vary depending on
    cloud provider selection.

  |service| provides three options for configuring your
  |global-write-cluster| zones:

  - Configure |global-write| Zones Using a Template

  - Configure a |global-write| Single Region Zone

  - Configure a |global-write| Multi Region Zone

  Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to configure
  your |global-write-cluster| zones.

  .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Use a Template
        :tabid: zone-template

        |service| provides two templates for configuring |global-write|
        zones for the cluster, each with a description of the purpose
        of its underlying configuration. Click on a template to view the
        Zone Map for that template. The Zone Map provides a visual
        description of the cluster zone configuration, including estimates
        of geographic latency and coverage.

        Click :guilabel:`Zone configuration summary` below the zone map
        to view a summary of each zone in the |global-write-cluster|.
        |service| provides the following validations for each zone:

        .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 40 60

            * - Validation
              - Guidance

            * - :guilabel:`Low latency reads and writes in <geography>`
              - Indicates the geographic locale for which the zone supports
                low latency reads and writes. The exact geographic locale
                specified depends on the preferred :guilabel:`Region` for that
                zone. You can modify the zone's preferred region in the
                :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` section.

            * - :guilabel:`Local reads in all other zones`
              - Indicates whether data in this zone is replicated to every
                other zone for local secondary reads by clients in those
                zones.

                Click the :guilabel:`Configure Local Reads in All Zones`
                button in the :guilabel:`Zone configuration summary` to
                automatically configure every zone in the cluster for local
                reads.

            * - :guilabel:`(Not) Available during partial region outage`
              - Indicates whether the zone supports high availability, such
                that a majority of electable nodes remain healthy
                and reachable in the event of a partial region outage.
                :guilabel:`Regions` marked as :guilabel:`Recommended` in the
                |service| UI support high availability during partial regional
                outages.

                For complete documentation on how |service| ensures high
                availability in a single region, see

                - :ref:`amazon-aws-availability-zones`.
                - :ref:`google-gcp-availability-zones`.
                - :ref:`microsoft-azure-availability-zones`.

            * - :guilabel:`(Not) Available during full region outage`
              - Indicates whether the zone supports high availability, such
                that a majority of electable nodes remain healthy and
                rechable in the event of a complete regional outage.

        By default each template deploys a series of single-region zones and
        builds a map of country and subdivision locations geographically
        near each zone. MongoDB uses this location-zone map to route
        read and write operations which contain
        :ref:`location data <global-writes-collections>` to the
        shard or shards in the corresponding zone.

        Click the :guilabel:`Configure Location Mappings` in the Zone Map to
        view the list of location-zone mappings. To customize the
        location-zone mapping, click the :guilabel:`Zone` dropdown for a
        given :guilabel:`Location Name` and select a new zone. Click the
        :guilabel:`Reset` button to reset a custom mapping for any given
        location. Click the :guilabel:`Reset All Zone mappings` button to
        reset all custom mappings for the cluster.

        You can make additional configuration changes to each zone
        after selecting a zone template. For instructions, see the
        :guilabel:`Single Region Zone` tab.

        You can also create Multi-region zones. For instructions, 
        see the :guilabel:`Multi-Region Zone` tab. Clicking
        :guilabel:`Configure Local Reads in All Zones` converts all
        zones to multi-region.

        Click :guilabel:`View Zone Templates` in the Zone Map to return to
        the template selection.

      .. tab:: Single Region Zone
        :tabid: single-region

        The :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` section allows you to configure
        each zone in your cluster. |service| displays a drop-down box
        directly above the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` that indicates the
        currently selected zone. Click the :guilabel:`+ Add a Zone` button to
        add additional zones to the |global-write-cluster|, up to a maximum
        of nine (9) zones.

        The Zone Map updates as you modify each zone. If the Zone Map
        currently displays the template selection menu, click
        :guilabel:`Configure Zones Myself` to view the Zone map.

        Click the :guilabel:`Select the preferred region for your zone`
        drop-down box and select a region as the
        :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region for each shard assigned to the
        zone. |service| builds a map of countries and subdivisions that are
        geographically near the selected region. MongoDB uses this
        location-zone map to route read and write operations which contain
        :ref:`location data <global-writes-collections>` to the
        shard or shards in the corresponding zone.

        In the Zone Map, click
        :guilabel:`Configure Location Mappings` to view the list of location-zone mappings. To
        customize the location-zone mapping, click the :guilabel:`Zone`
        dropdown for a given :guilabel:`Location Name` and select a new zone.
        Click the :guilabel:`Reset` button to reset a custom mapping for any
        given location. Click the :guilabel:`Reset All Zone mappings` button
        to reset all custom mappings for the cluster.

        For each shard in the zone, |service| distributes the shard nodes
        with respect to the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration`. You can add
        additional shards to the zone by clicking
        :guilabel:`Additional Options` in the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration`
        section and selecting the total number of shards in the zone
        from the drop-down box. By default |service| deploys one shard per
        zone. |service| recommends creating additional zones to support
        heavy write load in a geographic region instead of adding multiple
        shards to a single zone. |service| supports no more than 50 shards
        per |global-write-cluster|.

        .. important::

          Selecting a
          :ref:`zone template <create-global-write-cluster-zone-templates>`
          resets any configuration changes made in the
          :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` section to the default for the
          selected template.

      .. tab:: Multi-Region Zone
        :tabid: multi-region

        The :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` section allows you to configure
        each zone in your cluster. |service| displays a drop-down box
        directly above the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` that indicates the
        currently selected zone. Click the :guilabel:`+ Add a Zone` button to
        add additional zones to the |global-write-cluster|, up to a maximum

        button to display the multi-region configuration controls.
        Zones for which you toggled the
        :guilabel:`Configure Local Reads in All Zones` in the
        :guilabel:`Zone configuration summary` display the multi-region
        zone controls by default.

        :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`
            Configure the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` and
            :guilabel:`Electable` nodes in the zone. For more information on
            the :guilabel:`Node Types`, see :ref:`global-writes-zones`.

            Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to add a new row for region
            selection and select the region from the dropdown. Specify the
            desired number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region. The total
            number of electable nodes across all regions in the zone must be
            3, 5, or 7.

            |service| builds a map of countries and subdivisions
            geographically near the selected region for the
            :guilabel:`Highest Priority` node. MongoDB uses this

            represents one :guilabel:`Region` where |service| deploys the
            configured :guilabel:`Number of Nodes` of the
            :guilabel:`Read-only` :guilabel:`Node Type`.

            Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to add additional
            :guilabel:`Read-only` rows. Consider
            adding :guilabel:`Read-only` nodes in each region where you
