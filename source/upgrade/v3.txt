Overview
--------

This page describes the changes you might need to make to your
application when you upgrade the {+driver-short+} to version 3.0.

How to Upgrade
--------------

This page lists the potential breaking changes introduced by the {+driver-short+} version 3.0.
To upgrade the {+driver-short+} to version 3.0, follow these steps:

1. Review the :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page to ensure the new
   driver version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions your application connects
   to and the .NET or {+framework+} version your application runs on.

#. If you're using a 2.x version of the {+driver-short+}, upgrade to
   v{+last-version-2-number+}. To do so, follow the
   :ref:`v2.x upgrade guide. <csharp-upgrade-v2>`

#. Address the breaking changes described in the
   :ref:`<csharp-breaking-changes-v3>` section.

   .. example::
    
      If you are upgrading the driver from v2.14 to v3.0, first use the v2.x upgrade guide
      to upgrade your driver to v{+last-version-2-number+}. Then, address all breaking
      changes for v3.0.

Version 3.0 Breaking Changes
----------------------------

- The driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6 and earlier. You must upgrade
  your {+mdb-server+} to v4.0 or later.

  To learn how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see
  :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

  To learn more about the compatibility between .NET/C# driver versions
  and {+mdb-server+} versions, visit the
  :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page.

- The driver drops support for .NET Core 2.x and .NET Framework 4.6. You must upgrade to
  .NET Core 3.x or later, or .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later.

  To learn more about the compatibility between .NET/C# driver versions
  and .NET versions, visit the
  :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page.

- The driver removes the
  `mongocsharpdriver <https://www.nuget.org/packages/mongocsharpdriver/#readme-body-tab>`__
  NuGet package, which implements the legacy v1.x API in driver versions 2.x.
  If you're using the v1.x API, you must migrate to the new API.

- The classes, methods, and properties in the ``MongoDB.Driver.Core`` namespace that were
  deprecated in v{+last-version-2-number+} are marked ``internal``. If the driver
  provides a replacement for a deprecated class, method, or property, the compiler
  messages in v{+last-version-2-number+} will display it.

- The methods, properties, and constructors in the ``MongoDB.Bson`` namespace that were
  deprecated in previous versions of the driver have been removed. If the driver
  provides a replacement for a deprecated method, property, or constructor, the compiler
  messages in v{+last-version-2-number+} will display it.

- The driver drops support for the
  ``MONGODB-CR`` authentication mechanism. To learn more about
  configuring authentication in the {+driver-short+}, see
  :ref:`Authentication Mechanisms. <csharp-authentication-mechanisms>`

- The driver replaces the ``IMongoQueryable`` interface with the
  ``IQueryable`` interface, following the pattern used by most other LINQ providers. If
  your application contains references to ``IMongoQueryable``, replace them with
  ``IQueryable``.

- The driver removes the ``ClusterBuilder.ConfigureSdamLogging()`` method.
  To configure logging in your application, see the :ref:`csharp-logging` guide.

- The LINQ2 provider has been removed from this version of the driver.
  You must use LINQ3 for all LINQ queries.
  
  Queries that use client-side projections will throw an ``ExpressionNotSupportedException``
  error by default. To enable client-side projections, set the
  ``EnableClientSideProjections`` property of a ``TranslationOptions`` object to
  ``true``. You can pass this ``TranslationOptions`` object to an
  ``AggregateOptions`` or ``FindOptions`` object to enable client-side projections
  for a single query, or to a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to enable client-side projections
  for all queries in an application.

- Previous versions of the {+driver-short+} supported two GUID representation modes.
  In version 3.0, ``GuidRepresentationMode.V3`` is the only supported mode. This change
  has the following effects on the driver:
  
  - The ``BsonBinaryData(Guid)`` constructor has been removed. To construct a ``BsonBinaryData``
    object from a GUID, use the ``BsonBinaryData.Create(Guid, GuidRepresentation)`` constructor.
  - The ``BsonBinaryData.GuidRepresentation`` property has been removed. 
  - You can call the ``BsonBinaryData.ToGuid()`` method only on ``BsonBinaryData``
    objects of subtype 4. If the object has any other subtype, you must call the
    ``BsonBinaryData.ToGuid(GuidRepresentation)`` method and specify the subtype.
  - GUID conversion by using the ``BsonTypeMapper`` class has been removed. To
    convert ``GUID`` values to BSON, use the ``BsonBinaryData(<GUID>,
    GuidRepresentation.Standard)`` constructor.

  The preceding changes affect your application only if you serialize and deserialize
  BSON documents directly. If you map your MongoDB documents only to :ref:`csharp-poco`,
  the ``GuidRepresentationMode`` doesn't affect your application.

  To learn more about serializing GUIDs in the {+driver-short+}, see the
  :ref:`GUIDs <csharp-guids>` page.

- Exception classes and their related types no longer contain the ``[Serializable]``
  attribute, and therefore no longer support the Microsoft legacy serialization API. To
  learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to serialize objects, see the
  :ref:`csharp-serialization` guide.

- TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer supported. You must use TLS 1.2 or higher. To learn
  more about configuring TLS/SSL in the {+driver-short+}, see :ref:`<csharp-tls>`.

- By default, the driver serializes ``Decimal128`` and ``decimal`` values as BSON
  ``Decimal128`` values. In previous versions of the driver, the driver serialized these
  values as BSON ``string`` values by default.
  To serialize a ``decimal`` or ``Decimal128`` value as a string in v3.0,
  apply the ``[BsonRepresentation(BsonType.String)]`` attribute to the field.
  
  To learn more about specifying BSON types during serialization, see the
  :ref:`Custom Serialization <csharp-custom-serialization>` section of the POCOs page.

- By default, the driver serializes ``DateTimeOffset`` values as BSON documents. In
  previous versions of the driver, the driver serialized these values as BSON arrays by
  default. To serialize a ``DateTimeOffset`` value as an array in v3.0, apply the
  ``[BsonRepresentation(BsonType.Array)]`` attribute to the field.

- The default JSON output mode is Relaxed Extended JSON, a string format based on the
  JSON standard that describes BSON documents. Relaxed Extended JSON emphasizes
  readability and interoperability at the expense of type preservation.

  To use a different JSON output mode, create a new ``JsonWriterSettings`` object. Set
  the ``OutputMode`` property of this object to a value from the ``JsonOutputMode`` enum,
  then pass the object to the ``ToJson()`` method when you serialize your document.
  The following code example shows how to serialize a BSON document to Strict JSON:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     // Configure JsonWriterSettings
     var jsonWriterSettings = new JsonWriterSettings
     {
         OutputMode = JsonOutputMode.Strict
     };

     // Serialize the document to JSON using the configured settings
     var json = document.ToJson(jsonWriterSettings);

- The ``MongoClient`` constructor accepts only one ``Credential`` object instead of an
  array.

- To use Amazon Web Services (AWS) authentication, you must add the
  ``MongoDB.Driver.Authentication.AWS`` package to your project and register the
  authentication provider in your application's bootstrap code. To learn more about
  using AWS authentication with the {+driver-short+}, see :ref:`csharp-mongodb-aws`.

- To use In-Use Encryption, you must add the ``MongoDB.Driver.Encryption`` package to
  your project and register the encryption mechanism in your application's bootstrap code.
  To learn more about using In-Use Encryption with the {+driver-short+}, see
  :manual:`In-Use Encryption </core/security-in-use-encryption>` in the {+mdb-server+}
  manual.

- If you try to serialize or deserialize a floating-point
  ``Infinity`` or ``NaN`` value to an integral representation, the driver throws an
  ``OverflowException``. To learn more about floating-point ``Infinity`` and ``NaN``
  values, see
  `Double.NaN, <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.nan?view=net-8.0#system-double-nan>`__
  `Double.PositiveInfinity, <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.positiveinfinity?view=net-8.0#system-double-positiveinfinity>`__
  and `Double.NegativeInfinity. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.negativeinfinity?view=net-8.0#system-double-negativeinfinity>`__
  on MSDN.

- The driver includes the following changes to the ``BsonValue`` class:

  - Removes the ``[Obsolete]`` attribute from the ``AsLocalTime`` and
    ``AsUniversalTime`` properties.
  - Adds the `AsNullableLocalTime <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonValue.AsNullableLocalTime.html#MongoDB_Bson_BsonValue_AsNullableLocalTime>`__
    and `AsNullableUniversalTime <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonValue.AsNullableUniversalTime.html#MongoDB_Bson_BsonValue_AsNullableUniversalTime>`__
    properties.
  - Removes the ``AsDateTime`` property. Use the `AsUniversalTime <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonValue.AsUniversalTime.html#MongoDB_Bson_BsonValue_AsUniversalTime>`__
    property instead. 
  - Removes the ``AsNullableDateTime`` property. Use the `AsNullableUniversalTime <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Bson/MongoDB.Bson.BsonValue.AsNullableUniversalTime.html#MongoDB_Bson_BsonValue_AsNullableUniversalTime>`__
    property instead.

- The driver removes individual cluster events from ``MongoClient.Cluster``. To listen for
  cluster events, call the `ClusterBuilder.Subscribe() <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.Core.Configuration.ClusterBuilder.Subscribe.html>`__
  method.

- If any type in a collection uses a scalar discriminator, the driver throws
  an exception if you perform either of the following actions on the collection:
  
  - Call the ``Aggregate().OfType<T>()`` method, as in the following example:

    .. code-block:: csharp

       collection.Aggregate().OfType<T>()

  - Call the ``Aggregate().Match(item => item is T)`` method, as in the following example:

    .. code-block:: csharp

       collection.Aggregate().Match(item => item is T)
  
  To use either of the preceding methods on a collection, you can apply a hierarchical
  discriminator to each class in the collection. See
  the :ref:`Polymorphic Objects <csharp-discriminator-hierarchical>`
  page to learn how.

  Alternatively, you can check each item's type in a different way. For example, you
  can call the ``Where()`` method and pass an expression that compares the item's type
  to the type you're looking for, as in the following example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     collection.AsQueryable().Where(item => item.GetType() == typeof(T));

  To learn more about type discriminators, see :ref:`<csharp-polymorphism>`.

- The driver has sealed some types that were not designed for extension by using inheritance.
  This includes the following changes:

  - The driver seals all concrete serializers. To implement a custom serializer, implement the
    ``IBsonSerializer`` interface.

  - The driver seals the ``MongoClient``, ``MongoDatabase``, and ``MongoCollection`` classes.
    We recommend using the ``IMongoClient``, ``IMongoDatabase``, and ``IMongoCollection``
    interfaces directly.
