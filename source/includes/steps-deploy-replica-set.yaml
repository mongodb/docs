title: "Set the default read and write concerns for your MongoDB replica set."
stepnum: 6
level: 4
ref: set-defaultrw
content: |

  In the :guilabel:`Default Read Concerns/Write Concerns` card, you
  configure the default level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB
  for read and write operations for this cluster. Setting the default
  read and write concern can help with MongoDB 5.0 and later deployments
  using arbiters.

  From the :guilabel:`Default Read Concerns` section, you can set
  :manual:`consistency and isolation properties for the data
  read</reference/read-concern/>` from the cluster.

  Select the default read concern from the :guilabel:`Level` dropdown
  menu. You can choose from the following values:

  - :manual:`local </reference/read-concern-local>`, the MongoDB 5.0 and
    later default value,
  - :manual:`available </reference/read-concern-available>`, the
    MongoDB 4.4 default value, or
  - :manual:`majority </reference/read-concern-majority>`.

  From the :guilabel:`Default Write Concerns` section, you configure the
  :manual:`default level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for
  write operations </reference/write-concern/>` from the cluster. You
  can set three parameters:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Parameter
       - Value

     * - w Option
       - Desired number of |mongod| instances that must acknowledge a
         write operation. You can enter one of the
         :manual:`following values </reference/write-concern/#w-option>`:

         - ``majority``, the MongoDB 5.0 and later default value, or
         - Any positive integer. MongoDB 4.4 defaults to ``1``.

     * - j Option
       - Flag that indicates whether the write acknowledgement must be
         written to the
         :manual:`on-disk journal </reference/write-concern/#j-option>`.

     * - w Timeout
       - :manual:`Desired time limit for the write concern
         </reference/write-concern/#wtimeout>` expressed in
         milliseconds. Set this value when you set **w** to a value
         greater than ``1`` including ``majority``.

title: "Set any advanced configuration options for your MongoDB replica set."
stepnum: 7
level: 4
ref: set-advanced
content: |

  The :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration Options` section allows you to 
  set MongoDB :doc:`runtime options 
  </reference/deployment-advanced-options>` for each MongoDB process
  in your deployment.

  To add an option:

  a. Click :guilabel:`Add Advanced Options`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Select a Startup Option` and select the
     :doc:`configuration option </reference/deployment-advanced-options>`.

  #. |mms| displays a context-sensitive input for configuring an
     acceptable value for the selected option.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Add` to add the selected option and its
     corresponding value to every process of the selected process type
     in the cluster.

  |mms| lists each process in the cluster grouped logically. Click
  the grey arrow to the left of the logical grouping to display
  its sub-groupings and processes. You can modify the advanced options
  for each process individually as necessary.

  For descriptions of the available :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration 
  Options`, see :doc:`/reference/deployment-advanced-options`.
