=======================
Install MongoDB on OS X
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. admonition:: Platform Support

   Starting in version 2.4, MongoDB only supports OS X versions 10.6
   (Snow Leopard) on Intel x86-64 and later.

MongoDB is available through the popular OS X package manager `Homebrew
<http://brew.sh/>`_ or through the MongoDB Download
site.

Install MongoDB with Homebrew
-----------------------------

`Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ [#homebrew-setup]_
installs binary packages based on published "formulae". The following
commands will update ``brew`` to the latest packages and install
MongoDB.

In a terminal shell, use the following sequence of commands to
update``brew`` to the latest packages and install MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   brew update
   brew install mongodb

Later, if you need to upgrade MongoDB, run the following
sequence of commands to update the MongoDB installation on your system:

.. code-block:: sh

   brew update
   brew upgrade mongodb
   
Optionally, you can choose to build MongoDB from source. Use the
following command to build MongoDB with SSL support: 

.. code-block:: sh

   brew install mongodb --with-openssl
   
You can also install the latest development release of MongoDB for
testing and development with the following command: 

.. code-block:: sh

   brew install mongodb --devel

.. [#homebrew-setup] Homebrew requires some initial
   setup and configuration. This configuration is beyond the scope of
   this document.

Manual Installation
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-osx-manual.rst

Run MongoDB
-----------

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start :program:`mongod` for the first time, you will need to
create the data directory. By default, :program:`mongod` writes data to
the :file:`/data/db/` directory.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-set-up-dbpath-osx.rst

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :program:`mongod`. If
you use an alternate location for your data directory, ensure that the
alternate directory has the appropriate permissions.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :program:`mongod`, run the executable :program:`mongod` at the
system prompt.

For example, if your ``PATH`` includes the location of the
:program:`mongod` binary, enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the :program:`mongod`
binary, enter the full path to the :program:`mongod` binary.

The previous command starts a :program:`mongod` instance that writes
data to the ``/data/db/`` directory. To specify an alternate data
directory, start :program:`mongod` with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod
--dbpath>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath <some alternate directory>

Whether using the default :file:`/data/db/` or an alternate directory,
ensure that the user account running :program:`mongod` has read and
write permissions to the directory.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the :program:`mongod` instance, press ``Control+C`` in the
terminal where the :program:`mongod` instance is running.
