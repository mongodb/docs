               You must specify at least one subnet. If you don't, 
               |aws| won't provision an :term:`interface endpoint` in
               your |vpc|. An interface endpoint is required for 
               clients in your |vpc| to send traffic to the private 
               endpoint.

  #. Copy the command the dialog displays and run it using the |aws|
