We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Kotlin community that includes users
with varying levels of experience using the Kotlin driver. We find the quickest
way to get support for general questions is through the `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`_.

Refer to our `support channels <https://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`__
documentation for more information.
