Some |service| features such as :ref:`Data Federation 
<atlas-data-federation>` require access to resources in your {+gcs+}
environment. To grant access in a secure manner, create or 
update a {+gcp+} `Service Account 
<https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview>`__
with access policy.
