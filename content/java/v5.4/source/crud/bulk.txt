   :description: Learn how to perform bulk operations by using the MongoDB Java Sync Driver
   :keywords: insert, update, replace, code example, efficiency

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations in the
{+driver-short+}.

To perform a single create, replace, update, or delete operation, you can use
the corresponding method. For example, to insert one document and replace one 
document, you can use the ``insertOne()`` and ``replaceOne()`` methods. When you
use these methods, your client makes one call to the database for each operation. 

By using a bulk write operation, you can perform multiple write operations in
fewer database calls. You can perform bulk write operations at the following levels:

- :ref:`Collection <java-sync-coll-bulk-write>`: You can use the 
  ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk write operations on a 
  single collection. In this method, each kind of write operation requires at
  least one database call. For example, ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` puts multiple update
  operations in one call, but makes two separate calls to the database for an insert
  operation and a replace operation.

- :ref:`Client <java-sync-client-bulk-write>`: If your application connects to
  {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 or later, you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
  method to perform bulk write operations on multiple collections and databases 
  in the same cluster. This method performs all write operations 
  in one database call.

.. _java-sync-coll-bulk-write:

Collection Bulk Write
---------------------

Bulk write operations contain one or more write operations. To perform a bulk 
write operation at the collection level, pass a ``List`` of ``WriteModel`` 
documents to the ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method. A ``WriteModel`` is a 
model that represents a write operation. 

The ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method performs each kind of write
operation in a separate database call. For example, when you pass ``DeleteOneModel``, 
``DeleteManyModel``, and ``ReplaceOneModel`` objects to the method, it performs
two calls: one for the delete operations and one for the replace operation.

.. note::

   When the client splits operations into separate database calls, it might 
   reorder operations for efficiency if the bulk write operation is not ordered. 
   To learn more about operation execution order, see the :ref:`orderOfExecution` section.

The following sections show how to create and use each ``WriteModel``
document. The examples in each section use the following documents in the
``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "name": "Karen Sandoval", "age": 31 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "William Chin", "age": 54 }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite() <{+driver-api+}/MongoCollection.html#bulkWrite(java.util.List,com.mongodb.client.model.BulkWriteOptions)>`__
- `WriteModel <{+core-api+}/client/model/WriteModel.html>`__
- `BulkWriteOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__

Insert Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, you must
create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``InsertOneModel`` for two documents
describing people:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end insertDocumentsExample

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. Instead, the method throws a ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

   The following example tries to insert two documents where the ``_id`` is
   ``1`` and ``3``:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin insertExceptionExample
      :end-before: end insertExceptionExample

   The following shows the output of the preceding code:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :copyable: false

      A MongoBulkWriteException occurred with the following message: 
      Bulk write operation error on server sample-shard-00-02.pw0q4.mongodb.net:27017. 
      Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key 
      error collection: crudOps.bulkWrite index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }', details={}}].

   To see why the document with the ``_id`` of ``3`` didn't insert, see
   the :ref:`Order of Execution <orderOfExecution>` section.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the `InsertOneModel
<{+core-api+}/client/model/InsertOneModel.html>`__
API documentation. 

Replace Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying
a query filter for the document you want to replace with the replacement
document. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``ReplaceOneModel`` cannot
   make changes to a document that violate unique index constraints on
   the collection, and the model does not replace a document if there
   are no matches to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to
replace a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a document that
contains an added ``location`` field: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin replaceDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end replaceDocumentsExample

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``ReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the first
result. You can specify a sort in a ``ReplaceOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the server performs the replace
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: java

   ReplaceOptions options = ReplaceOptions.sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"));

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `ReplaceOneModel
  <{+core-api+}/client/model/ReplaceOneModel.html>`__
  API documentation
- `ReplaceOptions
  <{+core-api+}/client/model/ReplaceOptions.html>`__
  API documentation
- :manual:`Unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or an
``UpdateManyModel`` specifying a query filter for documents you want to
update with what the updates are.

The ``UpdateOneModel`` updates the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all the documents that
match your query filter. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``UpdateOneModel`` and
   ``UpdateManyModel`` cannot make changes to a document that violate
   unique index constraints on the collection, and the models do not
   update any documents if there are no matches to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to update
the ``age`` field in a document where the ``_id`` is ``2``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin updateDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end updateDocumentsExample

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``UpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the first
result. You can specify a sort in an ``UpdateOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the server performs the update
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: java

   UpdateOptions options = UpdateOptions.sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"));

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

  API documentation
- `UpdateManyModel

  API documentation
- `UpdateOptions
  <{+core-api+}/client/model/UpdateOptions.html>`__
  API documentation
- :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Delete Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or a
``DeleteManyModel`` specifying a query filter for documents you want to
delete. 

The ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all the documents that
match your query filter. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``DeleteOneModel`` and
   ``DeleteManyModel`` do not delete any documents if there are no matches
   to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``DeleteOneModel`` to delete
a document where the ``_id`` is ``1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin deleteDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end deleteDocumentsExample

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `DeleteOneModel <{+core-api+}/client/model/DeleteOneModel.html>`__
- `DeleteManyModel <{+core-api+}/client/model/DeleteManyModel.html>`__

.. _orderOfExecution:

Order of Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts an optional ``BulkWriteOptions`` as a
second parameter to specify whether the execution of the bulk operations is
ordered or unordered.

Ordered Execution
`````````````````

By default, the ``bulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order. This means that the bulk operations execute in the order you
added them to the list until an error occurs, if any. 

Example 
^^^^^^^

The following example performs these bulk operations:

- An operation that inserts a document with a ``name`` value of ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and an
  ``age`` value of ``37``
- An operation that replaces the document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a new document
  that contains the ``location`` field
- An operation that updates the document with a ``name`` value of ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and
  changes the ``name`` to ``"Zaynab Hassan"``
- An operation that deletes all documents where the ``age`` value is greater than ``50``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulkWriteExample
   :end-before: end bulkWriteExample

After running this example, your collection contains the following 
document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
   { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Hassan", "age": 37 }

Unordered Execution
```````````````````

You can also execute bulk operations in any order by specifying "false"
to the ``order()`` method on ``BulkWriteOptions``. This means that
all the write operations execute regardless of errors and if any errors occur
the bulk operation reports them at the end. 

Adding to the preceding example, including the following specifies the bulk
operations to execute in any order: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulkWriteNotOrderedExample
   :end-before: end bulkWriteNotOrderedExample

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution. The
   order can differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.
   
   In the preceding example, if the ``bulkWrite()`` method decided to
   perform the insert operation after the update operation, nothing
   changes with the update operation because the document does not exist
   at that point in time. Your collection then contains the following
   documents: 
   
   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
   
      { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
      { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
      { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Omar", "age": 37 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `BulkWriteOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__
- `ordered() <{+core-api+}/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html#ordered(boolean)>`__

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write:

Client Bulk Write
-----------------

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later,
you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to write
to multiple databases and collections in the same cluster. The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
method performs all write operations in a single call.

The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method takes a 
list of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances to represent different write operations.
You can construct instances of the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` interface by using 
instance methods. For example, an instance of ``ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel`` represents an
operation to insert one document, and you can create this model by using
the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne()`` method.

.. note:: Bulk Write Errors

   If any of the write operations fail, the driver raises a
   ``ClientBulkWriteException`` and does not perform any further individual
   operations. ``ClientBulkWriteException`` includes a ``BulkWriteError`` that can
   be accessed by using the ``ClientBulkWriteException.getWriteErrors()``
   method, which provides details of the individual failure.

The models and their corresponding instance methods are described
in the table below.

The following sections provide examples of how to use the client ``bulkWrite()`` 
method.

To learn more about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite()
  <{+driver-api+}/MongoCluster.html#bulkWrite(java.util.List,com.mongodb.client.model.bulk.ClientBulkWriteOptions)>`__
- `ClientNamespacedWriteModel
  <{+core-api+}/client/model/bulk/ClientNamespacedWriteModel.html>`__
- `MongoNamespace <{+core-api+}/MongoNamespace.html>`__

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write-insert:

Insert Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to insert 
two documents. One document is inserted into the ``db.people`` collection, while
the other document is inserted into the ``db.things`` collection. 
The ``MongoNamespace`` instance defines the databases and collections that 
each write operation applies to.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/ClientBulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-insert-models
   :end-before: end-insert-models

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write-update:

Update Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to update
existing documents in the ``db.people`` and ``db.things`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/ClientBulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-update-models
   :end-before: end-update-models

This example increments the value of the ``age`` field by ``1`` in the
document that has a ``name`` value of ``"Freya Polk"`` in the ``people``
collection. It also sets the value of the ``manufacturer`` field to
``"Premium Technologies"`` in all documents that have a ``category``
value of ``"electronic"`` in the ``things`` collection.

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedUpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientUpdateOneOptions
<{+core-api+}/client/model/bulk/ClientUpdateOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the driver
performs the update operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: java

   ClientUpdateOneOptions options = ClientUpdateOneOptions
           .clientUpdateOneOptions()
           .sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"));

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write-replace:

Replace Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to replace
existing documents in the ``db.people`` and ``db.things`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/ClientBulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-replace-models
   :end-before: end-replace-models

After this example runs successfully, the document that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
in the ``people`` collection is replaced with a new document. The document in 
the ``things`` collection that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
is replaced with a new document.

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientReplaceOneOptions
<{+core-api+}/client/model/bulk/ClientReplaceOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the driver
performs the replace operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: java

   ClientReplaceOneOptions options = ClientReplaceOneOptions
           .clientReplaceOneOptions()
           .sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"));

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write-options:

Bulk Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass an instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` to the ``bulkWrite()``
method to specify options when running the bulk write operations.

Order of Execution Example
``````````````````````````

By default, the individual operations in a bulk operation are executed in the
order that you specify them until an error occurs, or until they execute 
successfully. However, you can pass ``false`` to the ``ordered()`` method on 
the ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` interface to perform write operations in an 
unordered way. When using the unordered option, an error-producing operation 
does not prevent execution of other write operations in the call to the 
``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following code sets the ``ordered()`` method on an
instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` and performs a bulk write operation to 
insert multiple documents.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bulk-write/ClientBulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-order-exec
   :end-before: end-order-exec

Even though the write operation inserting a document with a duplicate key results
in an error, the other operations are executed because the write operation is
unordered.
