====================
Assign a User a Role
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A role provides a user privileges to perform a set of :ref:`actions
<security-user-actions>` on a given :ref:`resource <resource-document>`. A
user can have multiple roles.

In MongoDB systems where :setting:`auth` is enabled, users must be granted
roles and the ensuing privileges to access databases. Without an assigned
role, a user cannot access database resources.

Assign a user's role according to the user's responsibilities. When assigning
a role, first determine the privileges the user needs and then the role that
grants those privileges.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`.

For descriptions of the access each system role provides, see
:ref:`system-defined roles <system-user-roles>.
