"If your application needs to perform queries on the content of a field "

"This pattern describes one method for supporting keyword search using "
"MongoDB to support application search functionality, that uses keywords "
"stored in an array in the same document as the text field. Combined with "
"a :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multikey>`, this pattern can support "
"application's keyword search operations."

"To add structures to your document to support keyword-based queries, "
"create an array field in your documents and add the keywords as strings "
"in the array. You can then create a :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-"
"multi-key>` on the array and create queries that select values from the "
"array."
