Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without
indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to return
query results. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB uses
the index to limit the number of documents it must scan.

Although indexes improve query performance, adding an index has negative
performance impact for write operations. For collections with a high
write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive because each insert must also
update any indexes.

Use Cases
---------

If your application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields,
you can create an index on those fields to improve performance. For
example, consider the following scenarios:

.. TODO: Add wildcard index scenario to the following table

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 10

   * - Scenario

     - Index Type

   * - A human resources department often needs to look up employees by
       employee ID. You can create an index on the employee ID field to
       improve query performance.

     - :ref:`Single Field Index <indexes-single-field>`

   * - A salesperson often needs to look up client information by
       location. Location is stored in an embedded object with fields
       like ``state``, ``city``, and ``zipcode``. You can create an
       index on the entire ``location`` object to improve performance
       for queries on any field in that object.

     - :ref:`Single Field Index <indexes-single-field>` on an object

   * - A grocery store manager often needs to look up inventory items by
       name and quantity to determine which items are low stock. You can
       create a single index on both the ``item`` and ``quantity``
       fields to improve query performance.

Get Started

Details
-------

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the
collection's data set in an easy-to-traverse form. MongoDB indexes use a
:wikipedia:`B-tree <B-tree>` data structure.

The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered
by the value of the field. The ordering of the index entries supports
efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. In
addition, MongoDB can return sorted results using the ordering in the
index.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain restrictions apply to indexes, such as the length of the index
keys or the number of indexes per collection. For details, see
:ref:`Index Limitations <index-limitations>`.

.. _index-type-id:

Default Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB creates a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on the
:ref:`_id <document-id-field>` field during the creation of a
collection. The ``_id`` index prevents clients from inserting two
documents with the same value for the ``_id`` field. You cannot drop
this index.

.. note::

   In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field.
   You can do this by using a field with an auto-generated :term:`ObjectId`.

.. _index-names:

Index Names
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys
and each key's direction in the index (``1`` or ``-1``) using underscores
as a separator. For example, an index created on ``{ item : 1, quantity:
-1 }`` has the name ``item_1_quantity_-1``.

You cannot rename an index once created. Instead, you must 
:ref:`drop <drop-an-index>` and recreate the index with a new name.

To learn how to specify the name for an index, see :ref:`specify-index-name`.

Index Build Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications may encounter reduced performance during index builds,
including limited read/write access to the collection. For more
information on the index build process, see :ref:`index-operations`,
including the :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` section.
