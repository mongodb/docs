      Use the checkboxes to select the desired domains, then click
      :guilabel:`Add` to add them to the approved list.
    
   b. Click :guilabel:`Add Domains`. |mms| opens a modal where
      you can manually add domains the approved list.

      Enter the domain you want approve in the input box, then
      click :guilabel:`Add`. Repeat this process for each domain you
      want to approve.

   .. note::

      If you have :ref:`restricted user membership to your federation
      <restrict-fed-user-membership>`, |mms| warns you if you add a
      domain which is being used to access organizations outside of your
      federation.

   Once you have added all desired domains, click :guilabel:`Submit`.
