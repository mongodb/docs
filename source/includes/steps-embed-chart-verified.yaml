  From the dashboard, click :icon-mms:`ellipsis` at the top-right of
  the chart to access its external sharing information. Select
  :guilabel:`Embed Chart` from the dropdown menu.

  If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this
  chart uses, you can skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled
  external sharing on the data source, you can do so now. Click the
  :guilabel:`Enable external sharing` link.

  The |html| code which appears in the modal window shows the parameters
  which are required to share a chart with authentication enabled, but
  it is not usable as-is. Continue with the subsequent steps to
  enable authenticated access.

  Click the link below the HTML code snippet in the modal window.

  .. note::

     You must be a :ref:`Project Owner <dashboard-permissions>` to
     access the :guilabel:`Authentication Settings` page. For users 
     with the Project Owner role, the link appears in the top-right 
     corner of the |charts| UI. As a non-admin user, you can still use 
     embedded charts, but you will need to ask a Project Owner for a 
     key.

title: Generate an embedding key.
ref: generate-key
level: 4

  Click the :guilabel:`Generate New Key` button to create a new
  embedding key. Store the key in a safe place.

  .. warning::

     If you generate a new key, any previous keys become invalid.
     Ensure that all the existing shared charts that use the old key
     are updated to use the new key.

title: Create the server-side code necessary for a verified
  signature.
ref: server-side-code
level: 4
content: |

  Generating a verified signature to accompany data requests from shared
  charts with authentication enabled requires server-side code. The
  verified signature creates a payload by generating a
  :wikipedia:`HMAC </HMAC>` from your embedding key, a timestamp, and
  identifying data from your chart. The verified signature is valid for
  a limited time period specified in your server-side code.

  Code examples demonstrating how to generate a verified
  signature are available for the following languages and platforms:

  - :github:`Node.js </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/node>`
  - :github:`C# </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/c-sharp>`
  - :github:`Java </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/java>`
  - :github:`Python </mongodb/charts-embedding-examples/tree/master/python>`
