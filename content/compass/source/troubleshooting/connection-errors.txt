The sections on this page list common errors seen when connecting to
|compass| and provide possible solutions.

MongoDB Not Running on the Provided Host and Port
-------------------------------------------------

Your connection failed when Compass attempted to connect to your
database on the specified host and port.

Likely Causes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error often occurs when:

- You provide no hostname or an invalid hostname to the |compass-short|
  connect dialog.

- The destination server rejects a connection on an incorrect port.

- Your MongoDB cluster or server has been shutdown or the server
  hostname has changed.

- You have a firewall actively blocking connections to/from your local
  network.

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

The solution to this issue may depend on how your MongoDB environment
is configured. Select the appropriate tab for your MongoDB environment
to view possible solutions:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: self-hosted
       name: Self-Hosted Environment
       content: |

         Try these solutions if you have a self-hosted MongoDB server,
         replica set, or cluster.

         Ensure Your MongoDB Instance is Running
         ```````````````````````````````````````

         |compass-short| must connect to a running MongoDB instance.
         Make sure you have
         :guides:`installed MongoDB and have a running mongod process </server/install/>`.
         You should also check that the port where your MongoDB instance is
         running matches the port you provide in the |compass-short|
         connect dialog. 

         Required Config File Setting: bindIp
         ````````````````````````````````````
         
         If you recently installed the MongoDB database server and are
         unable to establish an initial connection to that server,
         verify that you have specified a valid :setting:`net.bindIp`
         setting in your server :manual:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options/>`.

         Hostname and Port
         `````````````````
 
         If your self-hosted server is listening on an external network
         via :setting:`net.bindIp`, verify that you have specified your
         :guilabel:`Hostname` and :guilabel:`Port` correctly in the
         |compass-short| connect dialog.
 
         MongoDB Server Moved or Shutdown
         ````````````````````````````````

         .. include:: /includes/fact-server-moved-or-shutdown.rst
 
         Firewall
         ````````
 
         If you believe your firewall may be actively blocking
         connections to the port(s) your database(s) are operating on,
         try connecting from a different location, such as a home or
         internet cafe network. You can also visit http://portquiz.net/
         to test your connection to different ports.

     - id: atlas
       name: Atlas Cluster
       content: |

         If you are connecting to an |service| cluster, first follow
         the procedure described in the :atlas:`Connect via Compass
         </compass-connection/>` page in the |service| documentation.
         The steps on that page will help ensure that your connection
         settings are optimized for |service|.

         MongoDB Server Moved or Shutdown
         ````````````````````````````````
 
         .. include:: /includes/fact-server-moved-or-shutdown.rst

         Firewall
         ````````
 
         If you believe your firewall may be actively blocking
         connections to your database, try connecting from a different
         location, such as a home or internet cafe network.

         |service| clusters operate on port 27017. You must be able to
         access this port to access your cluster. To check if your
         local network blocks connections to port 27017, visit
         http://portquiz.net:27017/.

         Atlas IP Access List Does Not Include Your Address
         ``````````````````````````````````````````````````

         |service| only allows connections to a cluster from addresses
         listed in the project :atlas:`IP access list
         </security/ip-access-list/>`. Ensure that you have
         access listed your IP address so you can connect to your
         cluster.

Insert Document Button Disabled and Cannot Modify Documents
-----------------------------------------------------------

When using |compass-short|, you may be in a state where you cannot
perform any write operations, and can only read data.

Possible Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are in this state:

- The :guilabel:`Create Collection` and :guilabel:`Insert Document`
  buttons are disabled.

- You cannot modify any of your documents.

Likely Cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two likely causes for this behavior:

- You are connected to a secondary member of your cluster, which
  does not support write operations.

- You are using :guilabel:`Compass Readonly` edition, which does not
  support write operations.

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

Check Read Preference Setting
`````````````````````````````

In the |compass-short| :ref:`connection dialog <connect-run-compass>`, set your
:guilabel:`Read Preference` to :guilabel:`Primary`. This will ensure
that you connect to your cluster's primary member, which supports
write operations.

Check Replica Set Name
``````````````````````

Check that your :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` is accurate.
|compass-short| is only able to identify the primary correctly if the
replica set name is accurate.

If your cluster is hosted in |service|, you can obtain the correct
replica set name using the following procedure:

.. include:: /includes/fact-get-replica-set-name-steps.rst

Check Your Compass Edition
``````````````````````````

You cannot perform write operations in :guilabel:`Compass Readonly`
edition. You can check your Compass edition by opening the
top-level Compass dropdown menu and selecting
:guilabel:`About MongoDB Compass`.

To perform write operations, you must download a different edition
of MongoDB Compass. For more information on the differences between
Compass editions, see
:ref:`Capabilities of Compass Editions <compass-feature-table>`.

Connection to Cluster Shard Closed
----------------------------------

This error means that the connection to your MongoDB cluster was closed
before the initial setup completed.

Possible Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may see an error in |compass| similar to the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   connection 3 to cluster0-shard-00-00-a1b2c.mongodb.net:27017 closed

Likely Cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common source of this error is a missing |service|
:atlas:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list/>` entry for the public IP
address where |compass-short| is running.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

Ensure the public IP address where |compass-short| is running is
included in your |service| project's IP access list.

To configure your |service| access list:

1. Use the :guilabel:`Context` dropdown in the top-left of |service|
   to select your desired |service| project.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Security` tab.

#. Click the :guilabel:`IP Access List` menu option.

#. If your IP address is not in the access list, click
   :guilabel:`Add IP Address`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

|service| recognizes which entries in the access list include your
current IP address, and appends these addresses with
:guilabel:`(includes your current IP address)`.

.. seealso::

   For more information on configuring access list entries, see
   :atlas:`Configure Access List Entries </security/ip-access-list/>` in the
   |service| documentation.

Not Primary or Secondary is Not Writable
----------------------------------------

This error message indicates that you have connected to one of the
secondary members of a replica set without providing the correct
replica set name *and* requiring a connection to a primary in your
:guilabel:`Read Preference`.

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

Verify Atlas Replica Set Name
`````````````````````````````

You should ensure that you are providing the correct replica set name
in the |compass-short| connect dialog.

If your cluster is hosted in |service|, you can obtain the correct
replica set name using the following procedure:

.. include:: /includes/fact-get-replica-set-name-steps.rst

Allow Compass to Connect to the Secondary
`````````````````````````````````````````
Another approach to resolving this error is to allow |compass-short| to
connect to a secondary cluster member. Change your
:guilabel:`Read Preference` to either :guilabel:`Primary Preferred` or
:guilabel:`Secondary Preferred` in your connection settings. This
should allow you to bypass this error and connect.

.. note::

   When you connect to a secondary cluster member, you cannot
   create or modify documents, indexes, or databases. Only use this
   solution when you do not need to perform any write operations.

.. seealso:: 

   For more information on read preferences, see
   :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the MongoDB
   manual.

Authentication Failed
---------------------

When you attempt to connect to your cluster using |compass-short|, you
may encounter an error message stating
:guilabel:`Authentication Failed`.

Likely Causes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error message is often the result of one of five conditions:

- Your :guilabel:`Password` is missing after autofilling your
  connection details from a copied connection string. |compass-short|
  requires you to manually enter your password in the connection dialog
  as a security precaution.

- Your :guilabel:`Username` and/or :guilabel:`Password` are incorrect.

- You have not :atlas:`configured any MongoDB users
  </security-add-mongodb-users/>` for your |service| cluster.

- You did not select the correct :guilabel:`Authentication` method.

- You did not specify the correct :guilabel:`Authentication Database`.
  This setting corresponds to the :manual:`authSource
  </reference/connection-string/#urioption.authSource>` connection
  string option.

  .. note::

     For |service| clusters, the :guilabel:`Authentication Database` is
     usually ``admin``.

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure you provided the correct :guilabel:`Username` and
  :guilabel:`Password`.

- Ensure that the MongoDB user you are authenticating as exists.

- Verify your :guilabel:`Authentication Database` and authentication
  mechanism.

- Verify that your selected authentication mechanism is supported by
  your MongoDB database.
