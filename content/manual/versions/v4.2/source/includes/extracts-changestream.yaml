ref: changestream-resume
content: |

   Unlike the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
   change stream cursor after an error. The MongoDB drivers make *one*
   attempt to automatically resume a change stream cursor after certain
   errors.


   |watchmethod| uses information stored in the oplog to produce the
   change event description and generate a resume token associated to
   that operation. If the operation identified by the resume token
   passed to the ``resumeAfter`` or ``startAfter`` option has already
   dropped off the :term:`oplog`, |watchmethod| cannot resume the
   change stream.

   See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for more information on
   resuming a change stream.

ref: changestream-full-document-lookup
content: |
   By default, the :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` returns
   specific field changes/deltas for update operations. You can also
   configure the change stream to look up and return the current
   majority-committed version of the changed document. Depending on other
   write operations that may have occurred between the update and the
   lookup, the returned document may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update.

   Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
   and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
   change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
   BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
   cursor and returns an error.

ref: changestream-remove-shard
content: |

   If the deployment is a sharded cluster, a shard removal may cause an
   open change stream cursor to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not be fully resumable.

ref: changestream-remove-shard-with-link
content: |

   A shard removal may cause an open :doc:`change stream cursor
   </changeStreams>` to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not be fully resumable.

---
ref: changestream-invalid-events
content: |

  You cannot use ``resumeAfter`` to resume a change stream after an
  :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` (for example, a collection
  drop or rename) closes the stream. Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use
  :ref:`startAfter <change-stream-start-after>` to start a new change
  stream after an :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>`.

---
ref: changestream-cursor-open
content: |

   The :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` remains open until
   one of the following occurs:

   - The cursor is explicitly closed.

   - An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs; for
     example, a collection drop or rename.

   - The connection to the MongoDB deployment is closed.

ref: changestream-resume-token-hex-change
content: |

   With hex-encoded string resume tokens, you can compare and sort the
   resume tokens.

   Regardless of the fcv value, a 4.0 deployment can use
   either BinData resume tokens or hex string resume tokens to resume a
   change stream. As such, a 4.0 deployment can use a resume
   token from a change stream opened on a collection from a 3.6
   deployment.

   New resume token formats introduced in a MongoDB version
   cannot be consumed by earlier MongoDB versions.

---
ref: changestream-resume-token-downgrade
content: |

   A 3.6 deployment can, however, use the BinData resume token returned
   from a change stream opened against a collection from a deployment
   with fcv ``3.6``. However, a 3.6 deployment cannot use the
   hex-encoded string resume tokens.

   The resume token ``_data`` type depends on the MongoDB versions and,
   in some cases, the feature compatibility version (fcv) at the time
   of the change stream's opening/resumption (i.e. a change in fcv
   value does not affect the resume tokens for already opened change
   streams):

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :doc:`change streams </changeStreams>` are

   In MongoDB 4.0 and earlier, :doc:`change streams </changeStreams>` are
