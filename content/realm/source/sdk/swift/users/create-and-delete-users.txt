.. _ios-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<ios-register-a-new-user-account>` and :ref:`confirm 
<ios-confirm-a-new-users-email-address>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an App Services App.

.. _ios-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

You can call the :swift-sdk:`delete 
<Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE6delete7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGyF>` 
method on a user object to delete the user object from your App. 
This deletes the object from the server in addition to clearing local data.
