Stages
------

In the :method:`db.collection.aggregate` method, pipeline stages appear
in an array. Documents pass through the stages in sequence. All except
the :pipeline:`$out` and :pipeline:`$geoNear` stages can appear
multiple times in a pipeline.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )

Expressions
-----------

Expressions can include :ref:`field paths and system variables
<agg-quick-ref-field-paths>`, :ref:`literals <agg-quick-ref-literals>`,
:ref:`expression objects <agg-quick-ref-expression-objects>`, and
:ref:`expression operators <agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions>`.
Expressions can be nested.

.. _agg-quick-ref-field-paths:

Field Path and System Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregation expressions use :term:`field path` to access fields in the
input documents. To specify a field path, use a string that prefixes
with a dollar sign ``$`` the field name or the dotted field name, if
the field is in embedded document. For example, ``"$user"`` to specify
the field path for the ``user`` field or ``"$user.name"`` to specify
the field path to ``"user.name"`` field.

``"$<field>"`` is equivalent to ``"$$CURRENT.<field>"`` where the
:variable:`CURRENT` is a system variable that defaults to the root of
the current object in the most stages, unless stated otherwise in
specific stages. :variable:`CURRENT` can be rebound.

Along with the :variable:`CURRENT` system variable, other :ref:`system
variables <agg-system-variables>` are also available for use in
expressions. To use user-defined variables, use :expression:`$let` and
:expression:`$map` expressions. To access variables in expressions, use
a string that prefixes the variable name with ``$$``.

.. _agg-quick-ref-literals:

Literals
~~~~~~~~

Literals can be of any type. However, MongoDB parses string literals
that start with a dollar sign ``$`` as a path to a field and
numeric/boolean literals in :ref:`expression objects
<agg-quick-ref-expression-objects>` as projection flags. To avoid
parsing literals, use the :expression:`$literal` expression.

.. _agg-quick-ref-expression-objects:

Expression Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expression objects have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { <field1>: <expression1>, ... }

If the expressions are numeric or boolean literals, MongoDB treats the
literals as projection flags (e.g. ``1`` or ``true`` to include the
field), valid only in the :pipeline:`$project` stage. To avoid treating
numeric or boolean literals as projection flags, use the
:expression:`$literal` expression to wrap the numeric or boolean
literals.
