Overview
--------

The `{+connector-long+} <https://www.mongodb.com/kafka-connector>`__ is
a Confluent-verified connector that persists data from {+kafka+} topics as a
data sink into MongoDB and publishes changes from MongoDB into Kafka
topics as a data source.

We recommend that you use one of the following MongoDB partner service
offerings to host your {+kafka+} cluster and {+connector+}:

- `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/?utm_campaign=tm.pmm_cd.2023_partner_cwc_mongodb_generic&utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref/>`__

  - Register to learn more about the `MongoDB Source Connector <https://confluent.cloud/go/new-source-connector/MongoDbAtlasSource?utm_campaign=tm.partner_cd.cwc-mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref>`__,
    or read the `documentation <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-mongo-db-source.html>`__.
  - Register to learn more about the `MongoDB Sink Connector <https://confluent.cloud/go/new-sink-connector/MongoDbAtlasSink?utm_campaign=tm.partner_cd.cwc-mongodb&utm_medium=partnerref>`__,
    or read the `documentation <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-mongo-db-sink.html>`__.

- `Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) <https://aws.amazon.com/msk/>`__
- `Redpanda Cloud <https://redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud>`__

  - To learn more about the MongoDB Source Connector, read the `documentation <https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/create-mongodb-source-connector/>`__.
  - To learn more about the MongoDB Sink Connector, read the `documentation <https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/cloud/managed-connectors/create-mongodb-sink-connector/>`__.

.. note::

   You can also use Atlas Stream Processing, which is a MongoDB-native way to
   process streaming data by using the MongoDB Query API. It transforms the way
   that developers build modern applications.

   Use Atlas Stream Processing to continuously process streaming data,
   validate schemas, and materialize views into either Atlas database
   collections or Apache Kafka topics.

   To learn more about Atlas Stream Processing, see the
   `Atlas Stream Processing <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-stream-processing>`__
   product page or read the `docs <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-sp/overview/>`__.
