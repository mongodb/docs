.. _sentence-style-capitalization-guidelines:

Use sentence-style capitalization for titles and headings
---------------------------------------------------------

Use sentence-style capitalization for all titles and headings. In
sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word of
the title or heading, plus any proper nouns, proper adjectives, and
terms that are always capitalized, such as some acronyms and
abbreviations. If the title includes a colon, capitalize the first word
that follows the colon, regardless of its part of speech.

Following are some examples:

- Install or upgrade PHP 5.3 for CentOS 5.x
- Ubuntu Hardy: Using mod_python to serve your application
- PHP configuration limits for Cloud Sites
- Troubleshoot a Vyatta site-to-site VPN connection
- Differences between IMAP and POP

.. _active-voice:

Use Active Voice
----------------

In general, write in *active* voice rather than *passive* voice.

- Active voice identifies the agent of action as the subject of the
  verb—usually the user.
- Passive voice identifies the recipient (not the source) of the action
  as the subject of the verb.

Active-voice sentences clarify the performer of an action and are
easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. Passive voice is
usually less engaging and more complicated than active voice. When you
use passive voice, the actions and responses of the software can be
difficult to distinguish from those of the user. In addition, passive
voice usually requires more words than active voice.

Following are examples of active voice:

- After you install the software, start the computer.
- Click **OK** to save the configuration.
- Create a server.
- MongoDB products and services solve your business problems.

For more information about voice, see the `Use active voice </style-guide/writing/use-active-voice>`__ section in this style guide.

.. _present-tense:

Use Present Tense
-----------------

Users read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For
users, these activities take place in their present, so the present
tense is appropriate in most cases. Additionally, present tense is
easier to read than past or future tense.

Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will
occur later (from the users' perspective). To easily find and remove
instances of future tense, search for *will*.

Following are examples of present tense:

- After you log in, your account begins the verification process.
- Any user with a Cloud account can provision multiple ServiceNet
  database instances.
- The product prompts you to verify the deletion.
- To back up Cloud Sites to Cloud Files by using this example, you
  create two cron jobs. One job backs up the cloud site and database,
  and the second job uploads the backup to Cloud Files.

For more information about present tense, see the `Use present tense </style-guide/writing/use-present-tense/#use-present-tense>`__ section in the complete style guide.

.. _write-to-user:

Write to the User by Using Second Person and Imperative Mood
------------------------------------------------------------

Users are more engaged with documentation when you use second person
(that is, you address the user as *you*). Second person promotes a
friendly tone by addressing users directly. Using second person with
the imperative mood (in which the subject *you* is understood) and
active voice helps to eliminate wordiness and confusion about who or
what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps.

Using second person also avoids the use of gender-specific,
third-person pronouns such as *he*, *she*, *his*, and *hers*. If you
must use third person, use the pronouns *they* and *their*, but ensure
that the pronoun matches the referenced noun in number.

Use first person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These
pronouns emphasize the writer or MongoDB rather than the user, so
before you use them, consider whether second person or imperative mood
is more "user friendly." However, use *we recommend* rather than *it is
recommended* or *MongoDB recommends*. Also, you can use *we* in the
place of *MongoDB* if necessary.

The first-person singular pronoun *I* is acceptable in the question
part of FAQs.

Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document.

.. note::

   This guidelines document is written in second person, and the
   headings and task examples use imperative mood.

.. _step-text:

Write Clear and Consistent Step Text
------------------------------------

When you are providing instructions to users, you should generally
number the steps (unless you have just one step). For the steps, use
<<<<<<< HEAD
the following guidelines. The guidelines are followed by an example.
For more extensive examples, see the
:doc:`Steps </style-guide/style/tasks/#steps>` section of this style
guide.

the following guidelines. The guidelines are followed by an example. To
read more extensive examples, see the :ref:`Steps <style-steps>`
section of this style guide.
>>>>>>> 9614a09... (DOCSP-6719): Updated Style Guide starting with port of Rackspace Style Guide.

- Write each step as a complete imperative sentence (that is, a
  sentence that starts with an imperative verb) and use ending
  punctuation. In steps, the focus is on the user, and the voice is
  active.

- Usually, include only a single action in each step. If two actions
  are closely related, such as opening a menu and selecting a command
  from the menu, you can include both actions in one step.

- If a step specifies where to perform an action, state where to
  perform the action before describing the action.

- If a step specifies a situation or a condition, state the situation
  or condition before describing the action.

- Do *not* include explanatory or reference information in the action
  part of a step. If needed, follow the step with one or more
  paragraphs that provide such information.

- Do *not* document system actions, responses, or results as steps. Put
  necessary statements in paragraphs following the steps to which they
  apply.

- Use screenshots sparingly. Screenshots can help to orient the user,
  but a screenshot of every field or dialog box is usually not
  necessary.

- To indicate that a step is optional, include *(Optional)*, in
  italics, as a qualifier at the beginning of the step.

- If more than one method exists for completing an action, document
  only one method, usually the most efficient or preferred method.

.. _consistent-text-format:

Use Consistent Text Formatting
------------------------------

Certain text should be formatted differently from the surrounding text
to designate a special meaning or to make the text stand out to the
user. Usually this formatting is accomplished by applying a different
font treatment (such as bold, italics, or monospace).

The following table covers the most common items that should be
formatted. To learn more about detailed formatting, see the
:doc:`Text formatting </style-guide/style/text-formatting/>`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Text item
     - Treatment
     - Example
   * - Text you want to emphasize
     - Italics
     - The offset *must* be a multiple of the limit (or zero).
   * - Error messages
     - Monospace
     - ``The user does not have permission to perform this action.``
   * - Code examples
     - Monospace
     - ``$ grep "ftp" /etc/xinetd.d/*``
   * - File, directory, and folder names
     - Bold
     - However, if these items are shown as part of code, use
       monospace. For example: Copy the **index.php** file from your
       computer to the **content** folder. The following example shows
       a basic configuration for the FTP service, in a file in the
       ``/etc/xinetd.d`` directory.
   * - Keyboard key names and combinations
     - Bold
     - Press **Enter**.
   * - UI fields
     - Bold
     - Select **Start > Control Panel**, and then click the **Mail**
       icon.
   * - Placeholder text
     - Show in camelCase.
     - If the authoring tool allows it, apply italics to placeholders;
       if not, enclose them in angle brackets. For example: *hostName*
       or ``<hostName>``

.. _clarify-pronouns:

Clarify Pronouns such as It, This, There, and That
--------------------------------------------------

Pronouns are useful, but you must ensure that their antecedents (the
words that they are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the
pronouns) don’t contribute to vagueness and ambiguity.

- **It**: Ensure that the antecedent of *it* is clear. If multiple
  singular nouns precede *it*, any of them could be the antecedent.
  Also, avoid using *it is* to begin a sentence. Such a construction
  hides the real subject of the sentence.

- **This**: Avoid beginning a sentence with the pronoun *this*, unless
  you follow this with a noun to clarify its meaning.

- **There**: Avoid using *there is* and *there are* as the subject of a
  sentence or clause. Using *there* shifts the focus away from the real
  subject and often uses unnecessary words.

- **That**: Avoid using *that* as a demonstrative pronoun (which stands
  in for or points to a noun). Instead, use it as an adjective and
  follow it with a noun.

For more examples, see the `Use pronouns carefully </style-guide/writing/use-pronouns-carefully/>`__
section of this style guide.

.. _gerunds-and-participles:

Clarify Gerunds and Participles
-------------------------------

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers.
Gerunds are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of
words are useful and acceptable, but confusion can arise if they are
not placed precisely in a sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can
be a gerund or a modifier (or even a noun) depending on its placement
in a sentence. Clarify gerunds and participles as necessary.

For more information and examples, see the `Clarify gerunds and participles </style-guide/writing/clarify-gerunds-participles>`__ section of this style guide.

.. _code-examples-guidelines:

Write Clear and Consistent Code Examples
----------------------------------------

Observe the following guidelines when creating blocks of code as input
or output examples:

- Do not use screenshots to show code examples. Format them as blocks
  of code, in monospace, by using the appropriate markup in your
  authoring tool.

- When showing input, include a command prompt (such as $).

- As often as necessary, show input and output in separate blocks and
  provide explanations for each. For example, if the input contains
  arguments or parameters, explain those. If the user should expect
  something specific in the output, or you want to show only part of
  lengthy output, provide an explanation. Provide your users the
  information that they need, and separate the input and output when it
  makes sense.

- When the command is simple, and there is nothing specific to say
  about the output, you can show the input and output in the same code
  block, as the user would actually see the code in their own terminal.
  The inclusion of the command prompt will differentiate the input from
  the output.

- Ensure that any placeholder text in code is obvious. If the authoring
  tool allows it, apply italics to placeholders; if not, enclose them
  in angle brackets. Show all placeholder text in camelCase.

- Follow the conventions of the programming language used and preserve
  the capitalization that the author of the code used.

- For readability, you can break up long lines of input into blocks by
  ending each line with a backslash.

- If the input includes a list of arguments or parameters, show the
  important or relevant ones first, and group related ones. If no other
  order makes sense, use alphabetical order. If you explain the
  arguments or parameters in text, show them in the same order that
  they appear in the code block.

The following example illustrates many of these guidelines. For more
examples, see the `Code examples </style-guide/style/code-examples/>`
section of this style guide.

**Example: Create a VM running a Docker host**

1. Show all of the available virtual machines (VMs) that are running
   Docker by running the following command:

   ``$ docker-machine ls``

   If you have not created any VMs yet, your output should look as follows:

   ``NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER   STATE   URL``

2. Create a VM that is running Docker by running the following command:

   ``$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox test``

   The ``--driver`` flag indicates what type of driver the machine will
   run on. In this case, ``virtualbox`` indicates that the driver is
   Oracle VirtualBox. The final argument in the command gives the VM a
   name, in this case, ``test``.

   The output should look as follows:

   .. code::

      Creating VirtualBox VM...
      Creating SSH key...
      Starting VirtualBox VM...
      Starting VM...
      To see how to connect Docker to this machine, run: docker-machine env test

3. Run ``docker-machine ls`` again to see the VM that you created by
   running the following command:

   ``$ docker-machine ls``

   The output should look as follows:

   .. code::

      NAME             ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM
      test                      virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:237

.. _consistent-terminology:

Use Consistent Terminology
--------------------------

Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted
industry dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project.
Each word or phrase should have only one meaning, and should be used
consistently throughout the documentation.

- Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts.
  For example, don't use *agent* to refer to both a person and a
  process.

- If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't
  use it to express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the
  general meaning. For example, use *interface* as a noun that means
  user interface. Instead of also using *interface* as a verb, use
  *interact*.

- Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the
  use of one word for a particular object. Technical writing is not
  creative writing, and you should not be concerned that you will bore
  customers with colorless prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a
  precise set of terms consistently is required. Following is a common
  example of multiple terms that refer to the same thing:

  - menu command *(the preferred term)*
  - menu item
  - menu option

- Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly
  used as a verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as *display*.
  However, using the same word as more than one part of speech in the
  same document can be confusing to customers and translators, so avoid
  it when possible.

- Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are
  *marketecture* or *edutainment*. Most such words are specific to a
  single business culture and are not understood in other cultures.

- Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.

- Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms
  have similar but distinct meanings and should not be used
  interchangeably. For example:

  - environment, platform
  - version, release
  - panel, screen
  - window, dialog box

Additionally, replace the following nonpreferred terms with the
preferred terms.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

.. _support-mentions:

When and When Not to Suggest Contacting Support
-----------------------------------------------

A customer who has sought out documentation has inherently communicated
that documentation is their preferred channel of support at that
moment. Suggesting that they contact the Support team directly
undermines the purpose of the documentation and diminishes the user's
confidence in the instructions.

- Don't suggest contacting Support directly.

- Don't include Support phone numbers.

- Don't recommend creating a ticket unless it is for gaining access to
  a MongoDB feature.

  You should not recommend contacting the Support team in an article
  unless doing so is a required step. A required step is a task that
  the customer cannot complete without contacting Support by phone or
  by opening a ticket.
