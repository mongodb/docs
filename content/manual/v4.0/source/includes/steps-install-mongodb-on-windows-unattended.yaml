     You must open the command interpreter (not Powershell) as an

              For Windows 8 or greater, you can use the ``.msi`` to
              install all MongoDB binaries, including `MongoDB Compass
              <https:///www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__.

              From the Command Interpreter, go to the directory containing the
              ``.msi`` installation binary and run:

              .. include:: {{release_specification_default}}

              The operation installs the binaries to the default directory 
              ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin``.

              To specify a different installation location for the executables, 
              add the ``INSTALLLOCATION`` value.

              .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocation}}
              
              To suppress the installation of :ref:`MongoDB
              Compass <compass-index>`, you must explicitly include the
              ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"`` argument.

              .. include:: {{release_specification_nocompass}}

              To install specific MongoDB component sets, you can specify them in
              the ``ADDLOCAL`` argument using a comma-separated list including one
              or more of the following component sets:

              .. list-table::
                 :header-rows: 1
                 :widths: 20 80

                 * - Component Set Name
                   - Binaries Included in the Component Set

                 * - ``ServerNoService``
                   - ``mongod.exe``

                 * - ``ServerService``
                   - Set up ``mongod.exe`` as a Windows service.

                 * - ``Router``
                   - ``mongos.exe``
                 * - ``Client``
                   - ``mongo.exe``
                 * - ``MonitoringTools``
                   - ``mongostat.exe``, ``mongotop.exe``
                 * - ``ImportExportTools``
                   - ``mongodump.exe``, ``mongorestore.exe``, ``mongoexport.exe``, ``mongoimport.exe``
                 * - ``MiscellaneousTools``
                   - ``bsondump.exe``, ``mongofiles.exe``

              For example, to install just the MongoDB server
              (``mongod.exe``) and the ``mongo.exe`` shell as well as
              set up the MongoDB server as a Windows service, run:

              .. include:: {{release_specification_service}}

              To include Compass in the installs, remove ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"``.
   
        - id: Windows7
          name: Windows 7
          content:  |

              For Windows 7, you can use the ``.msi`` to install all
              MongoDB binaries except `MongoDB Compass
              <https:///www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__ since the
              ``.msi`` installer requires PowerShell version 3.0 or
              greater to install Compass. You can manually `install
              Compass from the Download Center
              <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass?jmp=docs>`__.

              From the Command Interpreter, go to the directory
              containing the ``.msi`` and run the following command:

              .. note::

                 The command includes the ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"``
                 argument to suppress the installation of :ref:`MongoDB
                 Compass <compass-index>`.

              .. include:: {{release_specification_nocompass}}

              The operation installs the binaries to the default directory 
              ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin``.

              To specify a different installation location for the executables, 
              add the ``INSTALLLOCATION`` value.

              .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocation_nocompass}}

              the ``ADDLOCAL`` argument using a comma-separated list including one
              or more of the following component sets:

                 * - Component Set
                   - Binaries

                 * - ``ServerNoService``
                   - ``mongod.exe``

                 * - ``ServerService``
                   - Set up ``mongod.exe`` as a Windows service.

                 * - ``Router``
                   - ``mongos.exe``
                 * - ``Client``
                   - ``mongo.exe``
                 * - ``MonitoringTools``
                   - ``mongostat.exe``, ``mongotop.exe``
                 * - ``ImportExportTools``
                   - ``mongodump.exe``, ``mongorestore.exe``, ``mongoexport.exe``, ``mongoimport.exe``
                 * - ``MiscellaneousTools``
                   - ``bsondump.exe``, ``mongofiles.exe``

              For example, to install just the MongoDB server
              (``mongod.exe``) and the ``mongo.exe`` shell as well as
              set up the MongoDB server as a Windows service, run:
