Thank you for contributing to MongoDB content!

Don't worry if your job title doesn't include the word *writer*,
*information*, or *content*—your most important contribution is your
knowledge and expertise. Your willingness to share what you know with
users will help them to accomplish their goals and be successful.

The Documentation team is ready to help turn your contributions into
clear, concise, consistent, easy-to-read content for users. We do this,
in part, by adhering to the standards that are defined in this style
guide. The team doesn't expect contributors to know or adhere to all of
these standards; however, if you are interested in improving your
writing or learning some of the style standards at MongoDB, we invite
you to explore them.

The style guide includes hundreds of standards, but you can start with
the following ones to help you boost the effectiveness of your writing.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 75 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Standard
     - More information and examples
   * - **Write in active voice**.

       Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the
       user) the subject of the sentence. Active-voice sentences are
       more direct and easier to understand than passive-voice
       sentences.
     - :ref:`use-active-voice`
   * - **Use present tense**.

       Users read content to help them perform tasks or to gather
       information. These activities occur in the users' present
       time, so the present tense is appropriate in most content.
     - :ref:`use-present-tense`
   * - **Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood**.

       Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them
       directly. You talk to users directly by using second person,
       addressing the user as *you*. When you use second person with
       the imperative mood (in which the subject *you* is understood)
       *and* active voice, you make the text clear, concise, and
       direct.
     - :ref:`write-to-the-user`
   * - **Write short sentences and paragraphs, and use lists whenever
       possible**.

       Even a well-written long sentence can be hard to follow and
       understand, so try to limit sentences to 25 words. Short
       paragraphs are easier to scan and understand than longer ones.
       When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of
       embedding the items in a paragraph.
     - :ref:`write-clear-concise-sentences-paragraphs`
   * - **Use action-oriented verbs**.

       Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your content
       come alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your
       writing, use strong, simple, action verbs.
     - :ref:`use-effective-verbs`
   * - **Write clear and brief step text**.

       When you write instructions for users, write short steps, number them,
       and use active voice and imperative mood.
     - :ref:`tasks`
   * - **Clarify pronouns**.

       Pronouns  such as *it*, *this*, *there*, and *that* are useful,
       but you must ensure that their antecedents (the words that they
       are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the pronouns)
       don’t cause vagueness and ambiguity.
     - :ref:`use-pronouns-carefully`
   * - **Use correct punctuation**.

       Use periods to end most sentences, avoid quotation marks, and
       use serial commas.
     - :ref:`use-correct-punctuation`

       :ref:`punctuation`
   * - **Use AP headline-style capitalization for all titles and
       headings**.

       To meet AP headline-style (or AP title case) capitalization requirements, 
       refer to the guidelines in the :ref:`titles-and-headings` guide.
     - :ref:`titles-and-headings`
   * - **Write clear and consistent code examples**.

       When you create blocks of code as input or output examples,
       follow some basic guidelines to make them clear to users.
     - :ref:`code-examples`
   * - **Use consistent and simple terminology**.

       Use short, simple words, and use them as they are defined in a
       general or accepted industry dictionary. Each word or phrase
       should have only one meaning that is used consistently
       throughout the content. Avoid using humor, jargon, and
       metaphors.
