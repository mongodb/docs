MongoDB is a document database designed to help developers build modern
applications faster. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents,
making it easy to model data the same way your application code uses it.
The flexible schema lets you evolve your data model without downtime,
iterate quickly, and easily handle non-uniform data.

MongoDB provides a powerful query engine, horizontal scaling, and
built-in high availability so you can support everything from rapid
prototyping to large, mission-critical workloads.

MongoDB is a fully-transactional operational database that supports a
wide range of workload types including:

- :ref:`Document-based structured search (OLTP) <mql-reference>`
- :ref:`Data aggregation <aggregation>`
- :ref:`Full-text search <fts-top-ref>`
- :ref:`Vector search <fts-vector-search>`
- :ref:`Geospatial search <geospatial-queries>`
- :ref:`Time series <manual-timeseries-landing>` 


Core Architecture
-----------------

MongoDB is built on several core architectural components that
distinguish it from relational databases:

- :ref:`manual-landing-document-database`: The flexible document
  data model lets you map your data to your application's needs.

- :ref:`manual-landing-transactions`: Multi-document ACID transactions
  allow complex operations that require data consistency.

- :ref:`manual-landing-high-availability`: Replication and automatic failover
  ensure your data is always available.

- :ref:`manual-landing-horizontal-scaling`: Sharding enables horizontal
  scaling to handle large datasets and high throughput.

.. _manual-landing-document-database:

Document Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed
of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON
objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,
and arrays of documents.

MongoDB's flexible object-oriented data model lets you structure data in
a way that mirrors the object models in your codebase. This eliminates
the need for the complex object-relational mapping required when using
relational databases.

Here is an example of a MongoDB document that shows how documents can
express complex, hierarchical data in a format that mirrors your
application's object model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
     name: "Alice",
     birthdate: ISODate("1990-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
     address: {
       street: "123 Main St",
       city: "Springfield",
       state: "IL"
     },
     hobbies: ["reading", "hiking", "coding"]
   }

Additional advantages of the document data model are:

- Documents correspond to native data types in many programming 
  languages.
- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins that can
  slow down performance.
- Dynamic schemas support polymorphism, which allows varied structures
  among documents in the same collection.

MongoDB stores documents in :ref:`Collections <collections>`.
Collections are similar to relational tables but do not enforce a rigid,
pre-defined schema.

In addition to collections, MongoDB supports read-only :ref:`views
<views-landing-page>`.

.. _manual-landing-transactions:

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, which let you run multiple
read and write operations as a single all-or-nothing event.

Key transaction features include:

- **ACID Guarantees:** Transactions provide atomicity, consistency,
  isolation, and durability across multiple operations.
- **Multi-Document Operations:** You can run complex operations that
  span multiple documents while maintaining data consistency.
- **Distributed Transactions:** You can coordinate transactions across
  sharded clusters with the same ACID guarantees.

To learn more, see :ref:`Transactions <transactions>`.

.. _manual-landing-high-availability:

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's built-in replication mechanism provides automatic failover,
data redundancy, and increased read capacity. With automatic failover,
if the primary server becomes unavailable, the cluster automatically
elects a new primary, which ensures that writes remain available.
Additionally, multiple copies of your data are stored across different
servers to improve data durability.

.. _manual-landing-horizontal-scaling:

Horizontal Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB natively supports horizontal scaling through a technique called
:ref:`Sharding <sharding-introduction>`.

Key sharding features include:

- **Automatic Data Distribution:** MongoDB automatically partitions data
  based on a shard key and distributes it across a cluster of machines.
- **Zone Sharding:** You can define geographical zones to control the
  placement of documents based on shard key ranges.
- **Shard Key Refinement:** You can refine your shard key to improve
  performance as your application evolves.
