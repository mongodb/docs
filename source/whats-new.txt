What's New in 2.0.0
--------------------

The following sections describe the changes in the 2.0.0 release of
the {+driver-short+}.

.. important:: Removals

   The 2.0.0 driver release removes many deprecated types and methods. To view
   a full list of removals, see the **Removals** sections of the
   :github:`v2.0 release notes </mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/2.0.0>`.

{+libbson+}
~~~~~~~

The 2.0.0 release of ``{+libbson+}`` includes the following changes:

New Features
````````````

- Adds support for the BSON Binary Vector subtype. To learn more, see
  `BSON Binary Vector subtype <{+api-libbson+}/binary_vector.html>`__ in
  the {+libbson+} API documentation.

Changes
```````

- Reduces the value of the ``BSON_ERROR_BUFFER_SIZE`` macro from ``504``
  to ``503`` to reserve the final byte for internal use.

- Renames the following ``pkg-config`` files:

  - ``libbson-1.0``: Renamed to ``bson2``
  - ``libbson-static-1.0``: Renamed to ``bson2-static``

- Removes the ``bson-1.0`` CMake package. Instead, use ``bson`` and
  specify a version or version range to be imported, as shown in the
  following example:

  .. code-block:: c
     
     find_package(bson 1.30...2.0)

- Renames the following imported targets:

  - ``mongo::bson_static``: Renamed to ``bson::static``
  - ``mongo::bson_shared``: Renamed to ``bson::shared``

- Adds the ``bson::bson`` target, which points to either the static
  library or shared library depending on the value of the
  ``BSON_DEFAULT_IMPORTED_LIBRARY_TYPE`` CMake option. If you don't set this option and
  both library types are available, ``bson::bson`` uses
  the static library.

{+libmongoc+}
~~~~~~~~~

The 2.0.0 release of ``{+libmongoc+}`` includes the following changes:

New Features
````````````

- Supports aggregate operations that include ``$lookup`` stages for
  In-Use Encryption. To learn more, see the following
  references in the {+mdb-server+} manual:

  - :upcoming:`$lookup and $graphLookup Behavior </core/csfle/reference/supported-operations/#-lookup-and--graphlookup-behavior>` for CSFLE
  - :upcoming:`$lookup and $graphLookup Behavior </core/queryable-encryption/reference/supported-operations/#-lookup-and--graphlookup-behavior>` for QE

Changes
```````

- If you pass the ``batchSize:0`` option to ``mongoc_client_watch``, ``mongoc_database_watch``,
  or ``mongoc_collection_watch``, the ``aggregate`` command no longer ignores this option and
  applies it.

- Removes ``bson_oid_init_sequence``. Instead, use ``bson_oid_init``.

- Changes the return type of ``mongoc_server_description_host`` from ``mongoc_host_list_t *``
  to ``const mongoc_host_list_t *``.

- Implements the following changes to URI authentication credentials validation, which
  apply when creating a new ``mongoc_uri_t`` object from a connection string:

  - Requires that usernames are non-empty for all authentication mechanisms.
  - Validates username and password specification requirements and returns
    a client error for the specified authentication mechanism.
  - For the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism, the ``authSource`` value defaults to
    ``$external``.
  - Validates ``authMechanism`` values and returns a client error for invalid values.
  - Validates ``authMechanismProperties`` values and returns a client error for invalid
    properties for the specified authentication mechanism.
  - Correctly parses colon (``:``) characters within ``authMechanismProperties`` values.
    For example, setting ``authMechanismProperties=A:B,C:D:E,F:G`` caused the driver to
    parse the value as ``{'A': 'B', 'C': 'D:E,F:G'}``. This is now parsed as
    ``{'A': 'B': 'C': 'D:E', 'F': 'G'}``.

- Generates an error if you call ``mongoc_bulk_operation_execute`` on the same 
  ``mongoc_bulk_operation_t`` repeatedly.

- Consistently applies the ``__cdecl`` calling convention to function declarations in
  the public API.

- ``mongoc_client_set_ssl_opts`` ignores a pooled ``mongoc_client_t`` and logs an error.
  Before popping a client, use ``mongoc_client_pool_set_ssl_opts`` to set TLS options on
  a ``mongoc_client_pool_t``.

- ``mongoc_client_set_ssl_stream_initiator`` ignores a pooled ``mongoc_client_t`` and
  logs an error.

- Renames the following ``pkg-config`` files:

  - ``libmongoc-1.0``: Renamed to ``mongoc2``
  - ``libmongoc-static-1.0``: Renamed to ``mongoc2-static``

- Removes the ``mongoc-1.0`` CMake package. Instead, use ``mongoc`` and
  specify a version or version range to be imported, as shown in the
  following example:

  .. code-block:: c
     
     find_package(mongoc 1.30...2.0)

- Renames the following imported targets:

  - ``mongo::mongoc_static``: Renamed to ``mongoc::static``
  - ``mongo::mongoc_shared``: Renamed to ``mongoc::shared``

- Adds the ``mongoc::mongoc`` target, which points to either the static
  library or shared library depending on the value of the
  ``MONGOC_DEFAULT_IMPORTED_LIBRARY_TYPE`` CMake option. If you don't set this option and
  both library types are available, ``mongoc::mongoc`` uses
  the static library.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.0 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/2.0.0>`.

  functions.

- Adds support for cache lifetime configuration of In-Use Encryption data
  encryption keys. To configure this feature, use the ``mongoc_auto_encryption_opts_set_key_expiration()``
  and ``mongoc_client_encryption_opts_set_key_expiration()`` functions.

    corresponding ``server_closed`` event before delivering ``topology_closed``
  - Before delivering a ``topology_closed`` event, the driver delivers a ``topology_changed``
    event that has a ``new_description`` of type ``Unknown``

- Fixes possible crashes when the driver reports the inserted document
  IDs in the verbose results of client bulk writes
