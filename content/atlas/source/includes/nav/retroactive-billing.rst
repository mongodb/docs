Retroactive Billing
-------------------

If you cancel a Developer or self-serve Pro support plan and
later reactivate paid support, billing
charges apply retroactively from the
date that a non-Basic support plan was last active (up to 90
days in the past) unless:

- You cancel Developer support and activate self-serve Pro.
- You cancel self-serve Pro support and activate Pro support that
  is tied to a subscription.

To subscribe to the Enterprise support plan, to pay with an 
alternative payment method, or for additional information about 
support plans, :contact:`contact MongoDB </atlas>`.
