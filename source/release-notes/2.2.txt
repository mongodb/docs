Upgrading
---------

MongoDB 2.2 is a standard, incremental production release and works as
a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 2.0.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses authentication, upgrade your drivers
(i.e. client libraries) and :program:`mongos` instances before
upgrading your :program:`mongod` instances.

.. TODO insert the following line if we eventually have a section on
   this change. See the :ref:`driver changes <2.2-driver-changes>`
   section for more information.

Read through all release notes before upgrading, and ensure that no
changes will affect your deployment.

2.2 processes can inter-operate with 2.0 and 1.8 tools and processes
in replica sets and sharded clusters, if you are not running with
authentication. As a result, you can safely upgrade the
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` components of your deployment
in any order.

.. _2.2-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrading a Standalone ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Download the v2.2 binaries from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. Shutdown your :program:`mongod` instance, replace the existing
   binary with the 2.2 :program:`mongod` binary and restart MongoDB.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://downloads.mongodb.org/

.. _2.2-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrading a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you may upgrade your replica set in any order, to minimize
downtime, use the following procedure:

#. Upgrade the :term:`secondary` members of the set one at a time by
   shutting down the :program:`mongod` and replacing the binary with
   the 2.2 binary.

#. Use the :func:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary to allow
   normal :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` procedure.

   :func:`rs.stepDown()` and :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` provide for
   shorter and more consistent failover procedures than simply
   shutting down the primary directly.

   When the primary has stepped down, shut the instance down and
   upgrade by replacing the :program:`mongod` binary with the 2.2
   binary.

Upgrading a Shard Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your cluster uses authentication, use the following upgrade
procedure:

- Upgrade all :program:`mongos` instances *first*, in any order.

- Upgrade all of the :program:`mongod` config server instances *one at
  a time*. When you have *less* than *three* config servers active,
  the cluster will be read-only which will prevent (and abort) all
  chunk migrations and chunk splits.

- Upgrade all remaining cluster components. Use the :ref:`upgrade
  procedure for replica sets <2.2-upgrade-replica-set>` for each of
  the shards and the :ref:`stand alone <2.2-upgrade-standalone>`
  procedure for each of the config servers. You may upgrade the
  components of your cluster in any order.

If your cluster *does not* use authentication, you may upgrade the
components of the cluster in any order, using the :ref:`upgrade
procedure for replica sets <2.2-upgrade-replica-set>` for each of the
shards and the :ref:`stand alone <2.2-upgrade-standalone>` procedure
for each of the config servers.

:wiki:`Documentation <Tag+Aware+Sharding>`

.. TODO see kristina's blog post.

Fully Supported Read Preference Semantics
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. TODO write blurb mentioning mongos.

   mongos and all major drivers support full read preference as
   specified:

:ref:`replica-set-read-preference`

.. including tagging

Compatibility Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO add sections here to describe compatibility changes with
   regards to authentication, drivers, and mongos'

.. _2.2-findandmodify-returns-null:

``findAndModify`` Returns Null Value for Upserts
````````````````````````````````````````````````

In version 2.2, for :term:`upsert` operations, :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
commands will now return the following output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {'ok': 1.0, 'value': null}

In the :program:`mongo` shell, :dbcommand:`findAndModify` operations
running as upserts will only output a ``null`` value.

Previously, in version 2.0 these operations would return an empty
document, e.g. ``{ }``.

See: :issue:`SERVER-6226`.

Naming
~~~~~~

Restrictions on Database Names
``````````````````````````````

Database names can no longer contain the following characters:

.. code-block:: none

   /\. "*<>:|?

The names of the data files include the database name.
If you attempt upgrade a database instance with one or more of these characters,
:program:`mongod` will refuse to start.

Change the name of these databases before upgrading.

```````````````````````````````````````````````

:issue:`SERVER-1506`

Documentation: :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`

Additional Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``indexCounters`` No Longer Report Sampled Data
```````````````````````````````````````````````

:status:`indexCounters` now report actual counters that reflect index
use and state. In previous versions, these data were sampled. See
:issue:`SERVER-5784` and :status:`indexCounters` for more information.

``_id`` Indexes on Capped Collections
`````````````````````````````````````

All :term:`capped collections <capped collection>` now have an ``_id``
field by default if they exist outside of the ``local`` database. This
change only affects capped collections created with 2.2 instances and
does not impact existing capped collections.

Additionally in :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, :term:`secondaries
<secondary>` will create indexes on the ``_id`` field for capped
collections.

By requiring an ``_id`` field, and creating ``_id`` indexes on
secondaries, MongoDB prevents situations where the absence of an
``_id`` field can cause problems for replication.

See: :issue:`SERVER-5516` for more information.

``$timestamp`` Extended JSON format
```````````````````````````````````

:issue:`SERVER-3483`

Added Build Flag to Use System Libraries
````````````````````````````````````````

The Boost library, version 1.49, is now embeded in the MongoDB
code base.

.. TODO help the verbs

Additionally, added a flag to ``scons`` so that the build process can
use system libraries, if desired. To build MongoDB with system
libraries for all libraries, use the following arguments to ``scons``:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons --use-system-all

You can use the ``--use-system-boost`` to only use the system Boost
library.

See the :issue:`SERVER-3829` and :issue:`SERVER-5172` issues for more
information.
