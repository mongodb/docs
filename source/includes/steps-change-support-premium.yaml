      If you cancel a Developer or self-serve Pro support plan and
      later reactivate paid support, billing
      charges apply retroactively from the
      date that a non-Basic support plan was last active (up to 90
      days in the past) unless:

      - You cancel Developer support and activate self-serve Pro.
      - You cancel self-serve Pro support and activate Pro support that
        is tied to a subscription.
