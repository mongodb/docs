# mongoreplay is new and different, in that it is the only mongo tool
# (at time of writing) that has *commands*.
#
# This file uses {{program}} to refer to the tool, {{role}} to refer to
# the option (:option:`mongoreplay --option`), and {{command}} to refer
# to the combination of the program and command, as in
# ":program:`mongoreplay` ``commandname``"

directive: option
description: |
  Specifies the format for terminal output.
  You can specify arguments immediately after the format 'verbs' by wrapping
  them in curly braces, as in ``%Q{<arg>}``.

  If you specify {{role}}, also specify ``format`` as the value for the
  :option:`--collect` option.

  {{role}} supports the following verbs:

  - ``%n``: namespace
  - ``%l``: latency
  
  - ``%t``: time. You may optionally specify the date layout using the
    Go Programming Language's `time formatting`_. Go
    uses ``Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`` as its reference time. You
    must specify the time format using the reference time. Thus, if you
    wanted to print the date in format ``yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm``, you would
    specify ``%t{2006-01-02 15:04}``. Refer to the Go `time formatting`_
    documentation for more information.
  
  - ``%T``: op time
  - ``%c``: command
  - ``%o``: number of connections
  - ``%i``: request ID
  - ``%q``: request. You may optinally specified a dot-delimited field
    within the JSON structure, as in, ``%q{command_args.documents}``.
  - ``%r``: response. You may optinally specified a dot-delimited field
    within the JSON structure, as in, ``%q{command_args.documents}``.
  - ``%Q{<arg>}``: display ``<arg>`` on presence of request data
  - ``%R{<arg>}``: display ``<arg>`` on presence of response data

  In addition, {{role}} supports the following start/end ANSI escape sequences:

  - ``%B``/``%b``: bold
  - ``%U``/``%u``: underline
  - ``%S``/``%s``: standout
  - ``%F``/``%f``: text color (required arg -- word or number, 8-color)
  - ``%K``/``%k``: background color (required arg -- same as %F/%f)
