title: Assign privileges.
ref: assign-user-privileges-manual

  Select the database user privileges. You can assign privileges to the new user
  in one or more of the following ways:

  - Select a :atlas:`built-in role </security-add-mongodb-users/#built-in-roles>` from the
    :guilabel:`Built-in Role` dropdown menu. You can select one
    built-in role per database user within the Atlas UI. If you delete the
    default option, you can click :guilabel:`Add Built-in Role` to select a new built-in role.

  - If you have any :atlas:`custom roles </security-add-mongodb-roles>` defined, you can expand
    the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` section and select
    one or more roles from the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` dropdown menu. Click
    :guilabel:`Add Custom Role` to add more custom roles. You can also
    click the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` link to see the custom
    roles for your project.

  - Expand the :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` section and select one or more
    :atlas:`privileges </security-add-mongodb-users/#specific-privileges>` from the
    :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` dropdown menu. Click
    :guilabel:`Add Specific Privilege` to add more privileges. This assigns the
    user specific privileges on individual databases and collections.

  {+atlas+} can apply a built-in role, multiple custom roles, and multiple specific
  privileges to a single database user. 
  
  To remove an applied role or privilege, click :icon-fa4:`trash-o`
  :guilabel:`Delete` next to the role or privilege you wish to delete.

  .. note::

    {+atlas+} doesn't display the :icon-fa4:`trash-o` :guilabel:`Delete` icon
    next to your :guilabel:`Built-in Role`, :guilabel:`Custom Role`, or
    :guilabel:`Specific Privilege` selection if you selected only one option. You
    can delete the selected role or privilege once you apply another role or privilege.
     
  For more information on authorization, see :ref:`Role-Based
  Access Control <authorization>` and :ref:`Built-in
  Roles <built-in-roles>`.

title: Specify the resources in the project that the user can access.
optional: true
ref: restrict-resource-access-manual
content: | 
  By default, users can access all the clusters and 
  :atlas:`federated database instances </data-federation/overview>` in the 
  project. You can restrict access to specific clusters and federated database instances
  by performing both of the following steps: 

  a. Toggle :guilabel:`Restrict Access to Specific Clusters/Federated 
     Database Instances` to :guilabel:`ON`.

  #. Select the clusters and federated database instances to grant the user access to 
     from the :guilabel:`Grant Access To` list.

title: Save as temporary user.
optional: true
ref: save-temp-user-manual
content: |
  Toggle :guilabel:`Temporary User` to :guilabel:`On` and choose
  a time after which {+atlas+} can delete the user from the
  :guilabel:`Temporary User Duration` dropdown. You can select one of the
  following time periods for the user to exist:

  - 6 hours
  - 1 day
  - 1 week

  In the :guilabel:`Database Users` tab, temporary users display
  the time remaining until {+atlas+} will delete the user. Once
  {+atlas+} deletes the user, any client or application that uses
  the temporary user's credentials loses access to the cluster.
