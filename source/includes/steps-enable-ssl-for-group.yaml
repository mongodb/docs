  b. Follow the procedure to configure the {+mdbagent+} to use that
     authentication method:

     - :doc:`SCRAM-SHA </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-scram>`
     - :doc:`X.509 Certificates </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-x509>`
     - :doc:`LDAP </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap>`
     - :doc:`Kerberos </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-kerberos>`

  .. note::

     If you had |tls| certificates for Legacy Agents, see
     **What if I had TLS certificates for Legacy Backup or Monitoring
     Agents?** at the end of this procedure for guidance.
