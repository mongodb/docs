title: "Run an |fts| query with the ``compound`` and ``wildcard`` operators on the ``users`` collection."
content: |
  The following query uses the :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stage to query 
  the collection. The query uses the following :ref:`compound-ref` operator 
  clauses:
    
  .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-isnull-stages

  To run this query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, and then configure the following 
     pipeline stage by selecting the ``$search`` stage from the dropdown and 
     adding the query for that stage. 

     .. include:: /includes/fts-tutorial/null-check/tutorial.rst

  If you enabled :guilabel:`Auto Preview`, |compass| displays the 
  following documents next to the ``$search`` pipeline stage:

  .. code-block:: javascript
