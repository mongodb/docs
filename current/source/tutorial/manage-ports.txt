Manage |onprem| Hostname and Ports
==================================

|onprem| must provide a consistent hostname and consistent ports.
Follow these procedures to:

- Override the default hostname for |onprem|
- Change the default ports for |onprem|
- Enable the health-check endpoints

.. note::

   All of these procedures are *optional*. You shouldn't need to change
   these settings unless your |onprem| Backup Daemons or |application|
   doesn't appear with the correct hostname, or you need to change
   ports to meet local security concerns.

.. _set-default-opsmanager-hostname:

Override the Ops Manager Hostname
---------------------------------

|onprem| tries to detect its host's |fqdn|. There might be times when
the |onprem| hosts select the wrong hostname. If you need to override
the hostname that |onprem| selected, you can set |onprem| to use a
hostname that you specify.

.. important::
   
   If |onprem| works as expected from the |url| you wanted, you can
   skip this procedure.

      To set the hostname on Linux hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/set-hostname-unix.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: debian

      To set the hostname on Ubuntu or Debian hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/set-hostname-unix.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: rhel

      To set the hostname on Red Hat or CentOS  hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/set-hostname-unix.rst


.. _change-default-opsmanager-port:

Change the Default Port
-----------------------

|onprem| uses the ports and health-check endpoints described in
:doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`. The endpoints default to
``disabled``.

.. tabs-platforms::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      To change the ports on Linux hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/change-ports-unix.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: debian

      To change the ports on Ubuntu or Debian hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/change-ports-unix.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: rhel

      To change the ports on Red Hat or CentOS hosts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/change-ports-unix.rst

.. _enable-debug-endpoints:

Enable the Health Check Endpoint
--------------------------------

|onprem| provides an |http| health-check endpoint. This endpoint is
accessed on port ``8090`` and is disabled by default. Before you enable
the endpoint, make sure that another application or process isn't using
port ``8090`` .

To enable the endpoint:

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-debug-endpoints.rst
