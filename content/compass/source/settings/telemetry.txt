|compass-short| collects anonymous aggregated usage data to improve
MongoDB products. |compass-short| collects this information by default,
but you can disable this data collection.

About this Task
---------------

|compass-short| telemetry tracks the following data:

- The type of MongoDB deployment that you connect |compass-short| to.
  For example, Enterprise Edition, Community Edition, or Atlas Data
  Lake.

- Hostnames of the deployments that you connect |compass-short| to.

- Actions that you perform in |compass-short|, such as creating
  collections and indexes. Telemetry only tracks the general action
  performed, and does not track field values or namespaces.

- Anonymized queries run in |compass-short|. These queries are stored
  such that they cannot be associated to individual users.

- Errors.

|compass-short| *does not* track:

- IP addresses, usernames, or credentials

- Data stored in your MongoDB deployment

- Personal identifiable information
