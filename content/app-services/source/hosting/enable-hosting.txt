.. include:: /includes/note-static-hosting-requires-paid-tier-cluster.rst

You need to enable static hosting for your application before you can
upload and access content. You can enable static hosting from the App Services UI.

.. TODO(DOCSP-19662): when enable cli hosting functionality restored,
.. add the following text back in:
.. or by :ref:`importing <deploy-cli>` an
.. application directory that enables hosting in its configuration file.
.. Select the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.


Procedure
---------

.. TODO(DOCSP-19662): when enable cli hosting functionality restored,
.. remove the below content and replace with the currently commented out content.

Enable hosting from the UI with the following procedure: 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Navigate to the Hosting Configuration Page

      To open the hosting configuration page, click :guilabel:`Hosting` in
      the left navigation menu of the App Services UI.


   .. step:: Enable Hosting

      On the :guilabel:`Hosting` configuration page, click :guilabel:`Enable
      Hosting`. App Services will begin provisioning hosting for your application.

      .. note::

         It may take a few minutes for App Services to finish provisioning hosting
         for your application once you've enabled it. You can :doc:`upload
         content to App Services </hosting/upload-content-to-app-services>` immediately,
         but you will need to wait for provisioning to complete before
         App Services serves your files.

..         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

..            To enable static hosting with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a local copy of your
..            application's configuration files.

..            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

..            .. code-block:: bash

..               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

..            .. tip::

..               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
..               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


..         .. step:: Create a Static Hosting Configuration

..            In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``enabled`` to ``true``, then save the file.

..            .. code-block:: json
..               :caption: /hosting/config.json

..               { "enabled": true }


..         .. step:: Deploy the Static Hosting Configuration

..            Once you've enabled static hosting, you can push the updated config to your
..            remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys your new configuration on push.

..            .. code-block:: bash

..               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>  --include-hosting"

..            .. note::

..               It may take a few minutes for App Services to finish provisioning
..               hosting for your application once you've enabled it. You can :doc:`upload
..               content to App Services </hosting/upload-content-to-app-services>`
..               immediately, but you will need to wait for provisioning to complete before
..               App Services serves your files.
