Example
-------

The following example illustrates a ``drop`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable:

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "drop",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "wallTime": <ISODate>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      }
   }

A ``drop`` event leads to an :data:`invalidate` event for change streams opened 
against its own ``ns`` collection.
