Character filters examine text one character at a time and perform
filtering operations. Character filters require a type field, and some
take additional options as well.

.. _htmlStrip-ref:

htmlStrip
---------

The ``htmlStrip`` character filter strips out HTML constructs. 

Attributes 
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``htmlStrip`` character filter has the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 12 12 11 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - yes
     - Human-readable label that identifies this character filter type. 
       Value must be ``htmlStrip``.

   * - ``ignoredTags``
     - array of strings
     - yes
     - List that contains the HTML tags to exclude from filtering.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following index definition example indexes the ``text.en_US``
field in the :ref:`minutes <custom-analyzers-eg-coll>` collection
using a custom analyzer named ``htmlStrippingAnalyzer``. The
custom analyzer specifies the following: 
   
- Remove all HTML tags from the text except the ``a`` tag using the
  ``htmlStrip`` character filter.  
- Generate tokens based on word break rules from the `Unicode Text
  Segmentation algorithm 
  <https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19034-uax29-34-draft.pdf>`__
  using the :ref:`standard-tokenizer-ref` tokenizer.

The following query looks for occurrences of the string ``head`` in
the ``text.en_US`` field of the ``minutes`` collection.

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/htmlstrip_query.rst

|fts| doesn't return the document with ``_id: 1`` because the 
string ``head`` is part of the HTML tag ``<head>``. The 
document with ``_id: 3`` contains HTML tags, but the string 
``head`` is elsewhere so the document is a match. The following
table shows the tokens that |fts| generates for the ``text.en_US``
field values in documents ``_id: 1``, ``_id: 2``, and  ``_id: 3`` in
the :ref:`minutes <custom-analyzers-eg-coll>` collection using the
``htmlStrippingAnalyzer``. 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Document ID 
     - Output Tokens 

   * - ``_id: 1``
     - ``This``, ``page``, ``deals``, ``with``, ``department``,
       ``meetings``  

   * - ``_id: 2``
     - ``The``, ``head``, ``of``, ``the``, ``sales``, ``department``,
       ``spoke``, ``first`` 

   * - ``_id: 3``
     - ``We'll``, ``head``, ``out``, ``to``, ``the``, ``conference``,
       ``room``, ``by``, ``noon``

.. _icuNormalize-ref:

icuNormalize
------------

The ``icuNormalize`` character filter normalizes text with the `ICU 
<http://site.icu-project.org/>`__ Normalizer. It is based on Lucene's 
`ICUNormalizer2CharFilter <https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_3_0/analyzers-icu/org/apache/lucene/analysis/icu/ICUNormalizer2CharFilter.html>`__. 

Attributes 
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``icuNormalize`` character filter has the following attribute:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 12 12 11 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - yes
     - Human-readable label that identifies this character filter type. 
       Value must be ``icuNormalize``.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following index definition example indexes the ``message`` field
in the :ref:`minutes <custom-analyzers-eg-coll>` collection using a
custom analyzer named ``normalizingAnalyzer``. The custom analyzer
specifies the following:  
   
- Normalize the text in the ``message`` field value using the
  ``icuNormalize`` character filter. 
- Tokenize the words in the field based on occurrences of whitespace
  between words using the :ref:`whitespace-tokenizer-ref` tokenizer.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/icuNormalize_mongosh.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true

The following query searches for occurrences of the string 
``no`` (for  number) in the ``message`` field of the ``minutes``
collection.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shell

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/icuNormalize_query.rst

|fts| matched document with ``_id: 4`` to the query term ``no``
because it normalized the numero symbol ``№`` in the field using the 
``icuNormalize`` character filter and created the token ``no`` for
that typographic abbreviation of the word "number". |fts| generates
the following tokens for the ``message`` field value in document
``_id: 4`` using the ``normalizingAnalyzer``:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Document ID 
     - Output Tokens 

   * - ``_id: 4``
     - ``write``, ``down``, ``your``, ``signature``, ``or``, ``phone``, ``no``

.. _mapping-ref:

mapping
-------

The ``mapping`` character filter applies user-specified normalization 
mappings to characters. It is based on Lucene's `MappingCharFilter 
<https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_0_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/charfilter/MappingCharFilter.html>`__. 

Attributes 
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``mapping`` character filter has the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 12 12 11 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - yes
     - Human-readable label that identifies this character filter type.

       Value must be ``mapping``.
 
   * - ``mappings``
     - object
     - yes
     - Object that contains a comma-separated list of mappings. A 
       mapping indicates that one character or group of characters 
       should be substituted for another, in the format 
       ``<original> : <replacement>``.

Example
~~~~~~~
         
The following index definition example indexes the 
``page_updated_by.phone`` field in the :ref:`minutes 
<custom-analyzers-eg-coll>` collection using a custom analyzer named 
``mappingAnalyzer``. The custom analyzer specifies the  following:  
         
- Remove instances of hyphen (``-``), dot (``.``), open parenthesis 
  (``(``), close parenthesis ( ``)``), and space characters in 
  the phone field using the ``mapping`` character filter.  
- Tokenize the entire input as a single token using the 
  :ref:`keyword-tokenizer-ref` tokenizer.

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/mapping_ui.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shell

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/mapping_mongosh.js
         :language: javascript
         :linenos:
         :copyable: true

The following query searches the ``page_updated_by.phone`` field for
the string ``1234567890``. 

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/mapping_query_ui.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shell

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/mapping_query.rst

The |fts| results contain one document where the numbers in the
``phone`` string match the query string. |fts| matched the
document to the query string even though the query doesn't
include the parentheses around the phone area code and the
hyphen between the numbers because |fts| removed these
characters using the ``mapping`` character filter and created a
single token for the field value. Specifically, |fts| generated
the following token for the ``phone`` field in document with
``_id: 1``:  
         
.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Document ID 
     - Output Tokens 

   * - ``_id: 1``
     - ``1234567890``
         
|fts| would also match document with  ``_id: 1`` for searches
for ``(123)-456-7890``, ``123-456-7890``, ``123.456.7890``, and
so on because for :ref:`bson-data-types-string` fields, |fts| also
analyzes search query terms using the index analyzer (or if
specified, using the ``searchAnalyzer``). The following table shows
the tokens that |fts| creates by removing instances of hyphen
(``-``), dot (``.``), open parenthesis (``(``), close parenthesis (
``)``), and space characters in the query term:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Query Term 
     - Output Tokens 

   * - ``(123)-456-7890``
     - ``1234567890``

   * - ``123-456-7890``
     - ``1234567890``

   * - ``123.456.7890``
     - ``1234567890``

.. _persian-ref:

persian
-------

The ``persian`` character filter replaces instances of `zero-width 
non-joiner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner>`__ 
with the space character. This character filter is based on Lucene's 
`PersianCharFilter <https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_0_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/fa/PersianCharFilter.html>`__. 

Attributes 
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``persian`` character filter has the following attribute:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 12 12 11 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - yes
     - Human-readable label that identifies this character filter type. 
       Value must be ``persian``.

Example
~~~~~~~ 

The following index definition example indexes the ``text.fa_IR``
field in the :ref:`minutes <custom-analyzers-eg-coll>` collection
using a custom analyzer named ``persianCharacterIndex``. The 
custom analyzer specifies the following:  

- Apply the ``persian`` character filter to replace non-printing
  characters in the field value with the space character.
- Use the :ref:`whitespace-tokenizer-ref` tokenizer to create tokens
  based on occurrences of whitespace between words.

      .. include:: /includes/fts/analyzers/character-filters/persian_query.rst

|fts| returns the  ``_id: 2`` document that contains the query term.
|fts| matches the query term to the document by first replacing
instances of zero-width non-joiners with the space character and
then creating individual tokens for each word in the field value
based on occurrences of whitespace between words. Specifically, |fts|
generates the following tokens for document with ``_id: 2``: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Document ID 
     - Output Tokens 

   * - ``_id: 2``
     - ``ابتدا``, ``رئیس``, ``بخش``, ``فروش``, ``صحبت``, ``کرد``
