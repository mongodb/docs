You can manually define relationships between fields across different 
collections in your |service| |erd|.

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/fact-dm-annotation.rst

You can manually add relationships to your |erd| by using 
one of the following methods: 

- **Side Panel**: Manually add a relationship by selecting a source collection.

- **Drag and Drop**: Create a relationship by clicking and dragging from one 
  collection to another.

In addition to specifying collection and field properties for each relationship, 
you can also specify **cardinality**. In data modeling, cardinality refers to 
the number of records in one collection that can relate to one or more records 
in another collection. Cardinality can help you decide whether to :ref:`embed 
<data-modeling-embedding>` or :ref:`reference <data-modeling-referencing>` data 
in your data model. To learn more, see :ref:`data-modeling-relationships`.

Before You Add Relationships
----------------------------

To add relationships, ensure you have already 
:ref:`generated a diagram <atlas-ui-data-modeling>`.

Procedure
---------

To learn how to add relationships to your |erd|, select 
the tab corresponding to your preferred method:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Side Panel
      :tabid: side-panel
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
         
         .. step:: Open your |erd|.

            From the :icon-lg:`Diagram` :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab, open your
            |erd|.

         .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/steps-collection-side-panel.rst
            
         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add Relationship`.

            In the side panel's :guilabel:`Relationship` tab, click 
            :guilabel:`Add Relationship`.

         .. step:: Specify :guilabel:`Relationship Properties`.

            .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/data-modeling-relationship-fields.rst

            |service| automatically saves and updates your changes as you 
            make them.

         .. step:: Add annotations for your relationship. 
            
            In the side panel's :guilabel:`Notes` tab, you can add annotations 
            for your relationship. This can be helpful for documenting the 
            purpose and details of the relationship.


   .. tab:: Drag and Drop
      :tabid: drag-drop

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Open your |erd|

            From the :icon-lg:`Diagram` :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab, open your
            |erd|.

         .. step:: Click the relationship :icon-lg:`Relationship` icon 

            In the upper-left corner of the diagram view, click the relationship
            :icon-lg:`Relationship` icon to enable drag-and-drop relationship 
            creation.
            
         .. step:: Click one collection and drag it to another

            When you click a collection and drag it to another, 
            |service| opens the side panel and displays the 
            :guilabel:`Relationship Properties` tab.

         .. step:: Specify :guilabel:`Relationship Properties`.

            .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/data-modeling-relationship-fields.rst

            |service| automatically saves and updates your changes as you 
            make them. 

         .. step:: Add annotations for your relationship. 
            
            In the side panel's :guilabel:`Notes` tab, you can add annotations 
            for your relationship. This can be helpful for documenting the 
            purpose and details of the relationship.
            
After you create a relationship, |service| displays each relationship in 
the :guilabel:`Relationships` tab.

Delete Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a relationship from your |erd|:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Open the relationship side panel 
      
      Click on the relationship in the diagram. The relationship side panel 
      opens on the right side of the screen.

   .. step:: Select the relationship to delete

      In the :guilabel:`Relationship Properties` tab, click the :icon-lg:`Trash` 
      :guilabel:`Delete` button.
