Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **aggregation operations** in the
{+driver-long+}.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections based on
your specifications in the **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation
pipeline consists of one or more **stages**. Each stage performs an
operation based on its expression operators. After the driver executes
the aggregation pipeline, it returns an aggregated result.

Analogy
~~~~~~~

Aggregation operations operate similarly to a car factory. Car factories
have an assembly line. The assembly lines have assembly stations with
specialized tools to peform a specific task. To build a car, you send
raw parts to the factory. Then, the assembly line transforms and
assembles the parts into a car.

The assembly line resembles the **aggregation pipeline**, the assembly
stations in the assembly line resemble the **aggregation stages**, the
specialized tools represent the **expression operators**, and the
finished product resembles the **aggregated result**. 

Compare Operations
------------------

The following table lists the tasks you can perform with find and aggregation operations.

.. list-table::

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select *what* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select *what* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Rename fields
       | Calculate fields
       | Summarize data
       | Group values

Limitations
-----------

Aggregation operations have limitations. When performing agregation
operations, keep the following in mind:

- Returned documents must not violate the :manual:`BSON document size
  limit </reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size>` of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If
  required, you may exceed this limit by using the `allowDiskUse
  <{+api+}/mongo/options#AggregateOptions.SetAllowDiskUse>`__
  method.
- The :manual:`$graphLookup
  </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` stage
  has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores
  ``allowDiskUse``.

Examples
--------

To run the examples in this section, load the sample data into the
``tea.menu`` collection with the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation.go
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Each document represents a tea on the menu of a shop. It conatains
information about the tea type, the toppings you can add, and its price.

Average Rating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example calculates and displays the average rating and
amount of ratings for each tea.

The aggregation pipleline uses the ``$group`` stage to group the
documents by the ``category`` field, calculates the average using the
``$avg`` expression operator, and counts the number of documents using
the ``$sum`` expression operator.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      // create the stage
      groupStage := bson.D{
          {"$group", bson.D{
              {"_id", "$category"},
              {"average_price", bson.D{
                  {"$avg", "$price"},
              }},
              {"type_total", bson.D{
                  {"$sum", 1},
              }},
      }}}

      // pass the stage into a pipeline
      // pass the pipeline as the second paramter in the Aggregate() method
      cursor, err := coll.Aggregate(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{groupStage})
      if err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }

      // display the results
      var results []bson.M
      if err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }
      for _, result := range results {
          fmt.Printf("Average price of %v tea: $%v \n", result["_id"], result["average_price"])
          fmt.Printf("Amount of %v tea: %v \n\n", result["_id"], result["type_total"])
      }

   .. output::
      :language: go

      Average price of black tea: $6.075 
      Amount of black tea: 4 

      Average price of green tea: $5.7 
      Amount of green tea: 4 

Omit Fields in Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example matches documents where you can get milk foam as a
topping and lists the two cheapest options.

The aggregation pipleline contains the following stages:

- ``$match`` stage to match documents where its ``toppings`` contain "milk foam"
- ``$unset`` stage to omit the ``_id`` and ``category`` fields
- ``$sort`` stage to sort the ``price`` and ``toppings`` in ascending order
- ``$limit`` stage to show the first two documents

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      // create the stages
      matchStage := bson.D{{"$match", bson.D{{"toppings", "milk foam"}}}}
      unsetStage := bson.D{{"$unset", bson.A{"_id", "category"}}}
      sortStage := bson.D{{"$sort", bson.D{
          {"price", 1},
          {"toppings", 1}},
      }}
      limitStage := bson.D{{"$limit", 2}}

      // pass the stage into a pipeline
      // pass the pipeline as the second paramter in the Aggregate() method
      cursor, err := coll.Aggregate(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{matchStage, unsetStage, sortStage, limitStage})
      if err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }

      // display the results
      var results []bson.M
      if err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }
      for _, result := range results {
          fmt.Printf("Tea: %v \nToppings: %v \nPrice: $%v \n\n", result["type"], result["toppings"], result["price"])
      }

   .. output::
      :language: go

      Tea: Hojicha 
      Toppings: [lemon ginger milk foam] 
      Price: $5.55 

      Tea: Gyokuro 
      Toppings: [berries milk foam] 
      Price: $5.65
