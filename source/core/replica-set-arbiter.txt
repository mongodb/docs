Replica Set Arbiter
===================

.. start-content

An arbiter does **not** have a copy of data set and **cannot** become
a primary. Replica sets may have arbiters to add a vote in
:ref:`elections for primary <replica-set-elections>`. Arbiters
*always* have exactly ``1`` election vote, and thus
allow replica sets to have an uneven number of voting members without the
overhead of an additional member that replicates data.

.. important:: Do not run an arbiter on systems that also host the
   primary or the secondary members of the replica set.

To add an arbiter, see :doc:`/tutorial/add-replica-set-arbiter`.

Example
-------

For example, in the following replica set, an arbiter allows the set
to have an odd number of votes for elections:

.. end-content-even-votes-example

Security
--------

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, arbiters exchange credentials with
other members of the set to authenticate via :setting:`keyfiles <keyfile>`. MongoDB encrypts the
authentication process. The MongoDB authentication exchange is
cryptographically secure.

Because arbiters do not store data, they do not possess the internal table of user and role mappings
used for authentication.  Thus, the only way to log on to an arbiter with authorization active is to
use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`.


Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only communication between arbiters and other set members are:
votes during elections, heartbeats, and configuration data. These
exchanges are not encrypted.

**However**, if your MongoDB deployment uses TLS/SSL, MongoDB will encrypt
*all* communication between replica set members. See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information.

As with all MongoDB components, run arbiters in trusted network
environments.
