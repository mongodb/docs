You can stop a migration job from the :guilabel:`Job Overview` pane on the 
:guilabel:`Data Migration` tab. 

About this Task
---------------

The effects of stopping a migration job on your destination database depend on 
the type and stage of the migration job:

- If you stop a snapshot migration job during the snapshot stage, any 
  partially migrated data remains in the MongoDB database.
- After a migration job is stopped, you cannot resume it. To migrate data from
  a stopped migration job, you can create a new job and select the option 
  :guilabel:`Drop destination collections before migration`.

Once initiated, the process of canceling or completing a migration job may 
take up to one minute.

Steps
-----

To stop your migration job, follow the instructions below based on the current stage of execution:

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab

   .. step:: Click on the migration job in the :guilabel:`History` pane

   .. step:: Stop the migration job 

      a. In the upper-right corner of the screen, click the red :guilabel:`Terminate` button.
      #. On the pop-up modal, click the red :guilabel:`Terminate` button.
         Once a migration job cancels, an :guilabel:`x` icon displays 
         in the :guilabel:`History` pane, and the status of the
         migration job updates to :guilabel:`Snapshot cancelled`.
