name: resumeAfter
description: |

  Directs :method:`db.watch()` to attempt resuming
  notifications starting after the operation specified in the resume
  token. 

  Each change stream event document includes a resume token as the
  ``_id`` field. Pass the *entire* ``_id`` field of the change event
  document that represents the operation you want to resume after.

  ``resumeAfter`` is mutually exclusive with ``startAtOperationTime``.

optional: true
type: document
operation: db.watch

name: fullDocument
description: |

  By default, :method:`db.watch()` returns the delta of
  those fields modified by an update operation, instead of the entire
  updated document.

  Set ``fullDocument`` to ``"updateLookup"`` to direct
  :method:`db.watch()` to look up the most current 
  majority-committed version of the updated document.
  :method:`db.watch()` returns a ``fullDocument`` field with
  the document lookup in addition to the ``updateDescription`` delta.

name: maxAwaitTimeMS
description: |
  
  The maximum amount of time in milliseconds the server waits for new

  Defaults to ``1000`` milliseconds.

name: startAtOperationTime
description: |

   The starting point for the change stream. If the specified starting
   point is in the past, it must be in the time range of the oplog. To
   check the time range of the oplog, see

   ``startAtOperationTime`` is mutually exclusive with ``resumeAfter``.
