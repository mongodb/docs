   You must select the same region in which your |aws| |vpc|

   |service| creates |vpc| resources in the region

  a. Enter the following details about your |aws| |vpc|:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - :guilabel:`Your VPC ID`
          - Unique identifier of the peer |aws| |vpc|. Find this value on 
            the |vpc| dashboard in your |aws| account.

        * - :guilabel:`Your Subnet IDs`
          - Unique identifiers of the subnets your |aws| |vpc| uses. 
            Find these values on the :guilabel:`Subnet` dashboard in your |aws| account.

  #. Copy the command the dialog displays and run it using the |aws| 
     CLI.

     .. note::
      
        You can't copy the command until |service| finishes
        creating |vpc| resources in the background.

        See :aws:`Creating an Interface Endpoint </vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint>` to perform this 
        task using the |aws| CLI.

     |aws| creates the private endpoint and connects it from your |vpc|
     to the |service| |vpc| using the details you provided.
     
  #. You may receive an error like the following when you create the 
     private endpoint:

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false

        An error occurred (InvalidParameter) when calling the CreateVpcEndpoint 
        operation: The VPC endpoint service com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-<...> 
        does not support the availability zone of the subnet: subnet-<...>.

     If you receive this error, |service| has deployed |vpc| 
     resources into different availability zones than the ones to 
     which you deployed your |vpc| subnets. To resolve this error: 
      
     i. :aws:`Describe the service endpoint </cli/latest/reference/ec2/
        describe-vpc-endpoint-services.html>` on the ``service-name`` 
        from the command displayed in the CLI command in the |service| 
        UI.

     #. Deploy a |vpc| subnet into at least one of the availability 
        zones the service endpoint supports.

     #. Create the private endpoint again using the |vpc| subnet IDs you
        deployed into the supported availability zones. If you're using
        the |aws| CLI, Replace the :guilabel:`Subnet IDs` in the 
        |service| UI with the |vpc| subnets you deployed. Copy the 
        displayed command again, then run it using the |aws| CLI.
           
  #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

        * - :guilabel:`Your VPC Endpoint ID`
          - A 22-character alphanumeric string that identifies your 
            private endpoint. Find this value on the |aws| VPC 
            Dashboard under :guilabel:`Endpoints` > 
            :guilabel:`Endpoint ID`.

        * - :guilabel:`Your VPC Endpoint Hostname`
          - The hostname of your private endpoint. Find this value on the
            |aws| VPC Dashboard under 
            :guilabel:`Endpoints` > :guilabel:`DNS Name`.

            .. note::
             
               The |aws| UI might list multiple :guilabel:`DNS names`: one 
               for the region and one for each availability zone to which 
               the endpoint is deployed. 

               Use the :guilabel:`DNS Name` for the region. This is the 
               first :guilabel:`DNS Name` in the list.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

  You can connect to an |service| cluster using the {+aws-pl+} private 
  endpoint when all of the resources are configured and the private
  endpoint becomes available.

  To verify that the {+aws-pl+} private endpoint is available:

  a. In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation,
     click :guilabel:`Network Access`.
  #. In the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab, verify the following 
     statuses for the region that contains the cluster 
     you want to connect to using {+aws-pl+}:

     .. list-table::
