MongoDB :term:`agents <agent>` interact with the MongoDB databases in
your deployment as a MongoDB user would. Each agent must be
authenticated and then granted privileges according to what their roles
are on your deployment. As a result, you must configure your MongoDB
deployment and your agents to support authentication.

You can specify the deployment's authentication mechanisms when
:doc:`adding </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>` the
deployment, or you can 
:doc:`edit the settings </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` 
for an existing deployment. At minimum, the deployment must enable the
authentication mechanism you want the agents to use.

Adding an :term:`agent` as a MongoDB user requires configuring an
:manual:`authentication </core/authentication>` mechanism. Agents can
use any supported :doc:`authentication mechanism
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>`, but all agents must
use the same mechanism.
