Overview
--------

.. cond:: cloud

   If you use :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`
   but cannot use general :atlas:`Atlas Live Migration </migration-live-atlas-managed/>` 
   due to network restrictions, you can migrate your MongoDB deployments to 
   |service-short| via |cloud-short|. To live migrate data from your MongoDB 
   deployments to clusters in |service-short| using |cloud-short|:

   1. Add your deployments to |cloud-short|.
   #. Add credentials for Monitoring.
   #. Follow the Live Migration Process to |service-short|.

For detailed steps, see :ref:`cc-to-atlas-procedure`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the Live Migration process from MongoDB Community 
to |service-short|, you must:

- Have an existing deployment in 
  :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`.

.. cond:: cloud

   - :doc:`Start a free trial of Cloud Manager </tutorial/getting-started>`.

.. cond:: onprem

   - Start a free trial of
     :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager </tutorial/getting-started>` or install
     :doc:`Ops Manager </core/installation-checklist>`.

Considerations
--------------

.. cond:: cloud

   When you add your MongoDB Community deployment to |cloud-short|,
   you need to add credentials for Monitoring only, not for Automation 
   or Backup. Adding your deployment for Monitoring imports your 
   deployment's metadata into |cloud-short| to help with the Live 
   Migration process. It does not import your deployment's actual data.

   To learn more about authentication 
   credentials, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

.. cond:: onprem

   Credentials for Monitoring 
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When you add your MongoDB Community deployment to |cloud-short| 
   or |onprem|, you need to add credentials for Monitoring only, 
   not for Automation or Backup. Adding your deployment for Monitoring 
   imports your deployment's metadata into |cloud-short| or |onprem|
   to help with the Live Migration process. It does not import your 
   deployment's actual data.

   To learn more about authentication 
   credentials, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

   Setup Considerations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can use |cloud-short| or |onprem| to migrate your MongoDB deployments. 
   However, |cloud-short| requires less setup than |onprem| since it's a 
   hosted version of |onprem|. To migrate your deployment using |onprem|, 
   you need to :doc:`install it locally </core/installation-checklist>`.
