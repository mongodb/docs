You can use the {+atlas-ui+} and |api| to simulate an outage on your
|service| multi-region {+cluster+} and observe how your application
handles an outage in one or more regions. You can also run multiple
simulations. When running multiple simulations, we recommend a five
minute interval between simulations.  

Required Access
---------------

To start an outage simulation, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
the project.

Simulate Regional Outage Process 
--------------------------------

When you submit a request to test an outage using the {+atlas-ui+} 
or |api|, |service| simulates an outage event. During a simulated
outage, |service|: 

- Removes network connectivity to nodes in the selected regions.
- Does **not** trigger a monitoring alert for :alert:`Replica set has no primary`.

If your application takes more than 15 minutes to notice connection loss
to some nodes, we recommend that you reduce your |tcp| retransmission 
timeout values. To learn more, see :manual:`modify tcp_retries2 value
</faq/diagnostics/#do-tcp-retransmission-timeouts-affect-mongodb-deployments->`.

Simulate Regional Outage Using the {+atlas-ui+} 
-----------------------------------------------

To simulate a Regional Outage in the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Test Resilience` modal.

      a. For the {+cluster+} you wish to perform outage testing, click 
         the :guilabel:`...` button.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Test Resilience`. 

      #. Select :guilabel:`Regional Outage`. |service| displays a 
         :guilabel:`Test Resilience` modal with the steps |service| 
         takes to simulate an outage event. To learn more, see 
         :ref:`Simulate Regional Outage Process <test-outage-process>`.

   .. step:: Begin the simulation.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Select Regions`.

      #. Select the tab corresponding to the type of outage you want to simulate:

         .. tabs::

            .. tab:: Minority of Electable Nodes
               :tabid: minority

               Select fewer than half of your electable nodes.

            .. tab:: Majority of Electable Nodes
               :tabid: majority
         
               Select at least one more than half of your electable 
               nodes and keep at least one electable node remaining.

               After selecting a majority of your electable nodes, your 
               replica set won't have a :manual:`primary node
               </core/replica-set-members#replica-set-primary-member>`. 
               This means that your replica set can't perform write 
               operations and read operations that are not configured 
               with a suitable :manual:`readPreference 
               </core/read-preference/>`.

      #. Select :guilabel:`Simulate Regional Outage` to begin the test.
          
         |service| notifies you when the outage occurs.

   .. step:: End the simulation.

      Select a tab corresponding to the type of outage you are 
      performing:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Minority of Electable Nodes
            :tabid: minority

            When you finish testing the outage, click 
            :guilabel:`End Simulation`.

         .. tab:: Majority of Electable Nodes
            :tabid: majority

            When you finish testing the regional outage, you can perform
            one of the following:
          
            - Restore your multi-region {+cluster+} by adding 
              electable nodes to your replica set. To learn more, see 
              :ref:`reconfigure-rs-during-regional-outage`.

            - End the regional outage simulation by clicking 
              :guilabel:`End Simulation`.

Simulate Regional Outage Using the |api| 
----------------------------------------

You can use the :oas-atlas-op:`Test Outage </startOutageSimulation>`
|api| endpoint to simulate an outage event. To learn more about the
outage process, see :ref:`Simulate Regional Outage Process
<test-outage-process>`. 

Verify the Outage
-----------------

To verify that the outage is successful, monitor your application and
ensure your read and write operations are working as expected.
