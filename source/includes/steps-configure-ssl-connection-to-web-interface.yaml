        * - |https| PEM Key File
          - Provide the file system path where the ``.pem`` file
            is located on all |onprem| hosts.

        * - |https| PEM Key File Password
          - Provide the Password you used to encrypt the ``.pem`` 
            file, if you encrypted it.

        * - |url| to Access Ops Manager
          - Provide the full |url| for |application| including port 
            ``8443`` for |https| access.

            |onprem| may be encrypted, but |onprem| will not require
            encryption.
