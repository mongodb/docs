1.15.0 Release
--------------

**July 15, 2025**

New Features 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-Existing Namespaces 
```````````````````````

.. important::

   This feature is currently in Public Preview. Please review
   the :ref:`behavior and limitations <c2c-pre-existing-dest-data>` in order
   to use this feature in production environments.

Adds the ``preExistingDestinationData`` parameter to the :ref:`/start
<c2c-api-start>` API endpoint. If ``preExistingDestinationData`` is ``true``, 
pre-existing namespaces are allowed on the destination cluster. For more
information, see :ref:`/start Request Body Parameters <c2c-api-start-params>`.

   .. include:: /includes/release-notes/REP-6356-warning.rst

Verify Metadata 
```````````````

Starting in version 1.15, the embedded verifier checks for collection metadata,
indexes, and views. If the verifier finds a mismatch during metadata 
verification, it returns a ``map[MismatchType]int`` error listing the 
mismatches. To learn more, see :ref:`c2c-verification-checks`.``

Other Changes
`````````````

- Adds ``longRetryTime`` as a hidden flag to increase ``mongosync`` resiliency 
  against cluster scaling events. When mongosync's retryer encounters a server 
  selection error with the server topology tag ``ReplicaSetNoPrimary``, the 
  retryer bumps its total duration to the value set by ``longRetryTime``. 
  By default, ``longRetryTime`` is 30 minutes.

- Adds two :ref:`log <c2c-logging>` metrics:
  
  - Source and destination ping latency 
  - Average source CRUD event rate

Fixed Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes an issue where the embedded verifier reported "stream hashing" too 
  early, potentially leading to long cutover times.

- Updates ``circl`` package to v1.6.0 to resolve a security vulnerability.

Live Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Live upgrades <c2c-live-upgrade>` to 1.15 are not supported.
