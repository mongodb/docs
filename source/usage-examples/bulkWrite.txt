=======================
Perform Bulk Operations
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


The ``bulkWrite()`` method performs batch write operations against a
*single* collection. This method reduces the number of network round trips from
your application to the server which therefore increases the potential 
throughput and performance. Since you only receive the success status after 
all the operations return, we recommend you use this if that meets the 
requirements of your use case.

You can specify one or more of the following write operations in
``bulkWrite()``:

- ``insertOne``
- ``updateOne``
- ``updateMany``
- ``deleteOne``
- ``deleteMany``
- ``replaceOne``

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts the following parameters:

- A ``List`` of objects that implement ``WriteModel``: the classes that
  implement the ``WriteModel`` correspond to the aforementioned write
  operations. E.g. the ``InsertOneModel`` class wraps the ``insertOne`` write 
  operation. See the links to the API documentation at the bottom of this page 
  for more information on each class.
  
- ``BulkWriteOptions``: *optional* object that specifies settings such as
  whether to ensure the writes are ordered.

.. note::

   Retryable writes run on MongoDB server versions 3.6 or later in bulk
   write operations unless they include one or more instances of 
   ``UpdateManyModel`` or ``DeleteManyModel``.

.. note::

  By default, MongoDB executes bulk write operations one-by-one in the
  specified order (i.e. serially). During an ordered bulk write, if
  an error occurs during the processing of an operation, MongoDB returns
  without processing the remaining operations in the list. In contrast,
  when you set ``ordered`` to ``false``, MongoDB continues to process remaining
  write operations in the list. Unordered operations are theoretically faster
  since MongoDB can execute them in parallel, but should only be used if
  the writes do not depend on order.

The ``bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` object that
contains information about the write operation results including the number
of documents inserted, modified, and deleted.

If one or more of your operations attempts to set a value that violates a
:manual:`unique index </core/index-unique>` on your collection, an
exception is raised that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   The bulk write operation failed due to an error: Bulk write operation error on server <hostname>. Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key error collection: ... }].

Similarly, if you attempt to perform a bulk write against a collection
that uses :manual:`schema validation </core/schema-validation>` and one or
more of your write operations provide an unexpected format, you may
encounter exceptions.

Example
-------

The following code sample performs an ordered bulk write operation on the
``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. The example call
to ``bulkWrite()`` includes examples of the ``InsertOneModel``,
``UpdateOneModel``, and ``DeleteOneModel``. 

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java

The output should resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Result statistics:
   inserted: 3
   updated: 2
   deleted: 1
