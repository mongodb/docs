|service| lets you restore data from a snapshot of a {+cluster+} using
{+encrypt-at-rest+}.

Restore Considerations
-----------------------

In addition to the :ref:`prerequisites <restore-prereq>`, consider the
following requirements and limitations when restoring with
{+encrypt-at-rest+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-reqs.rst

- This feature is only available for ``M10+`` dedicated {+clusters+}.

- |service| can only restore to a {+cluster+} that uses the same 
  encryption provider as the source {+cluster+}. Snapshots taken from 
  {+clusters+} without {+encrypt-at-rest+} cannot be restored to a 
  {+cluster+} with it, or to a |mms| project.

- When you run an automated restore for an |service| {+cluster+} from a
  different project with Encryption at Rest, the |aws| |kms| key values
  for both clusters can differ but they must be created in the same region.

- If the target project doesn't have a {+cluster+} with Encryption at
  Rest enabled, you can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a {+cluster+} with
  Encryption at Rest, or :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
  in an existing {+cluster+}.

- Clusters that use :ref:`AWS KMS <security-aws-kms>` encrypt their
  |pit| restore :term:`oplog` data with the customer's |cmk|. The
  current |cmk| must be valid for the encrypted oplog data to perform
  a restore from a snapshot.

Procedure
---------

To restore from a snapshot using Encryption at Rest:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-details.rst

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Restore` action.
      
      In the :guilabel:`Actions` column, expand the 
      :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`Actions` menu, and click 
      :guilabel:`Restore` for the snapshot that you want to restore.

   .. step:: Select the target |service| :guilabel:`Project`.
      
      From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog box, select the target |service|
      :guilabel:`Project` to which you want to restore. You can restore 
      to any |service| project for which the authenticated |service| 
      user has the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

   .. step::  Select the :guilabel:`Cluster` to restore to.
      
      You can only restore to an |service| replica set running 
      Encryption at Rest. The target cluster must run the same or 
      greater version of MongoDB as the :guilabel:`MongoDB Version` of 
      the snapshot.

      After the restoration procedure, |service| triggers a key rotation
      for MongoDB encryption key. |service| then encrypts the new 
      MongoDB encryption keys based on the configured Encryption at 
      Rest provider for the target cluster.

   .. step:: Restart your application. 
      
      Ensure your application uses the new target cluster.

Troubleshoot Encryption at Rest
--------------------------------

If |service| has an issue with the encryption of either the snapshot
or the target cluster, it displays one of the following errors:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error

     - Result

   * - Can't restore a non-encrypted snapshot to a cluster with
       Encryption at Rest enabled.

     - The snapshot can't be restored to |service|.

   * - Target cluster doesn't have encryption enabled.

     - You can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       a new target cluster with Encryption at Rest, or
       :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       on your desired target cluster.

   * - Encryption provider of target cluster doesn't match selected
       snapshot's encryption provider.

     - The encryption provider for the snapshot and target cluster
       don't match. You can either:

       1. Create a new snapshot with the same encryption provider.
       #. Change the encryption provider for the target cluster.

   * - Encryption credentials on snapshot aren't present.

     - |service| can't restore a snapshot whose encryption key was
       deleted.
