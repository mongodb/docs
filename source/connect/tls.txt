Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>`
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

When you enable TLS for a connection, {+driver-short+} performs the following actions:

- Uses TLS to connect to the MongoDB deployment
- Verifies the deployment's certificate
- Ensures that the certificate certifies the deployment

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
MongoDB Server manual. 

.. important::

   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) is beyond the scope of this document. This page assumes prior
   knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.

.. _pymongo-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

To enable TLS for the connection to your MongoDB instance, set the ``tls`` connection
option to ``True``. You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/tls-tabs.rst

.. tip::
   
   If your connection string includes the ``+srv`` modification, which specifies the
   SRV connection format, TLS is enabled on your connection by default.

   To learn more about the SRV connection format, see
   :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} documentation.

.. _pymongo-specify-ca-file:

Specify a CA File
------------------

During the TLS handshake, the MongoDB deployment presents a certificate key file to your
application to establish its identity. Usually, a deployment's certificate has been
signed by a well-known CA, and your application relies on this CA to validate the certificate.

During testing, however, you might want to act as your own CA.
In this case, you must instruct {+driver-short+} to
use your CA certificates instead of ones signed by another CA.

To do so, use the ``tlsCAFile`` connection option to specify the path to a ``.pem`` file
containing the root certificate chain.
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/ca-file-tabs.rst

.. _pymongo-certificate-revocation:

Check Certificate Revocation
----------------------------

When an X.509 certificate is no longer trustworthy—for example, if its private key
has been compromised—the CA revokes the certificate. {+driver-short+} includes two ways
to check whether a server's certificate has been revoked.

.. _pymongo-disable-ocsp:

OCSP
~~~~

To use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to validate a server certificate,
you must install {+driver-short+} with the ``ocsp`` option, as shown in the following
example:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m pip install pymongo[ocsp]

The certificate-validation process varies depending on the version of {+mdb-server+} you're
connecting to:

- **MongoDB v4.4 or later:** The server staples a
  time-stamped OCSP response to its certificate. {+driver-short+} validates the certificate
  against the OCSP response. If the CA has revoked the certificate, or if the OCSP response
  is otherwise invalid, the TLS handshake fails.
- **MongoDB v4.3 or earlier:** The server supplies an OCSP endpoint, which {+driver-short+}
  contacts directly. {+driver-short+} then validates the certificate against the OCSP
  response. If the CA hasn't revoked the certificate, the TLS handshake continues--even if
  the OCSP response is invalid or malformed.

To stop {+driver-short+} from contacting the OCSP endpoint, set the
``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` connection option to ``True``.
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/ocsp-tabs.rst

.. note::

   Even if the ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` option is set to ``True``, {+driver-short+}
   still verifies any OCSP response stapled to a server's certificate.

.. _pymongo-crl:

Certificate Revocation List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using OCSP, you can instruct {+driver-short+} to check the server's certificate
against a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) published by the CA.
To do so, use the ``tlsCRLFile`` connection option to specify the path to a ``.pem``
or ``.der`` file from the CA.
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/crl-tabs.rst

.. note:: 
  
   You can't use both a CRL and :ref:`OCSP <pymongo-disable-ocsp>` in the same TLS handshake.

.. _pymongo-client-cert:

Present a Client Certificate
----------------------------

Some MongoDB deployments require every connecting application to present a client certificate
that proves its identity. To specify the client certificate for {+driver-short+} to present,
set the ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` option to the file path of the ``.pem`` file that
contains your certificate and private key.
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/client-cert-tabs.rst

.. important::
   
   Your client certificate and private key must be in the same ``.pem`` file. If they
   are stored in different files, you must concatenate them. The following example
   shows how to concatenate a key file and a certificate file into a third file called
   ``combined.pem`` on a Unix system: 

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cat key.pem cert.pem > combined.pem

.. _pymongo-key-file-password:

Provide a Key Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the private key in your certificate file is encrypted, you must provide a password. To
do so, use the ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`` connection option to specify the password or
passphrase for the encrypted private key. 
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/key-file-password.rst

.. _pymongo-insecure-tls:

Allow Insecure TLS
------------------

When TLS is enabled, {+driver-short+} automatically verifies the certificate that
the server presents. When testing your code, you can disable this verification.
This is known as *insecure TLS.*

When insecure TLS is enabled, {+driver-short+} requires only that the server present an
X.509 certificate. The driver accepts a certificate even if any of the following are
true: 

- The hostname of the server and the subject name (or subject alternative name) 
  on the certificate don't match.
- The certificate is expired or not yet valid. 
- The certificate doesn't have a trusted root certificate in the chain. 
- The certificate purpose isn't valid for server identification.

.. note::

   Even when insecure TLS is enabled, communication between the client and server
   is encrypted with TLS.

To enable insecure TLS, set the ``tlsInsecure`` connection
option to ``True``. You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/insecure-tls-tabs.rst

To disable only certificate validation, set the ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` option to
``True``, and set the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``False`` or omit it:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-cert-validation-tabs.rst

To disable only hostname verification, set the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` option to
``True``, and set the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``False`` or omit it:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-host-verification-tabs.rst

.. warning:: Don't Use in Production

   Always set the ``tlsInsecure``, ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``, and
   ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` options to ``False`` in production.
   
   Setting any of these options to ``True`` in a production environment makes
   your application insecure and potentially
   vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.
