  .. tip::

     Linux and macOS users may wish to copy |tool-binary| to a filesystem
     location that is defined in the ``$PATH`` environment variable, such
     as ``/usr/bin``. Doing so allows referencing |tool-binary| directly
     on the command line by name, without needing to specify its full
     path, or first navigating to its parent directory. See the
     :ref:`installation guide <tutorial-installation>` for your platform
     for more information.
