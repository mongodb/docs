  Create an ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-enterprise.repo`` file so that
  you can install MongoDB enterprise directly, using ``yum``.
action:
  - heading: For the *latest* stable release of MongoDB Enterprise
    pre: |
      Use the following repository file:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-enterprise]
      name=MongoDB Enterprise Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-enterprise/stable/$basearch/
      gpgcheck=1
      enabled=1
  - heading: For specific version of MongoDB Enterprise
    pre: |
      To install
      MongoDB Enterprise packages from a specific :ref:`release
      series <release-version-numbers>`, such as 2.4 or 2.6, you can
      specify the release series in the repository configuration. For
      example, to restrict your system to the 2.6 release series,
      create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-enterprise-2.6.repo`` file
      to hold the following configuration information for the MongoDB
      Enterprise 2.6 repository:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-enterprise-2.6]
      name=MongoDB Enterprise 2.6 Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-enterprise/2.6/$basearch/
      gpgcheck=0
      enabled=1
  - pre: |
      ``.repo`` files for each release can also be found `in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/>`_.
      Remember that odd-numbered minor release versions (e.g. 2.5) are development versions and are unsuitable
      for production deployment.

      Specify each component package individually and append the
      version number to the package name, as in the following example
      that installs the ``2.6.1`` release of MongoDB:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install -y mongodb-enterprise-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-server-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-shell-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-mongos-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-tools-2.6.1
  - heading:
      text: Pin a specific version of MongoDB Enterprise.
      character: "'"
    pre: |
      Although you can specify any available version of MongoDB
      Enterprise, ``yum`` will upgrade the packages when a newer
      version becomes available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin
      the package. To pin a package, add the following ``exclude``
      directive to your ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-enterprise,mongodb-enterprise-server,mongodb-enterprise-shell,mongodb-enterprise-mongos,mongodb-enterprise-tools
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use different naming conventions.
  See the :v2.4:`2.4 version of documentation for more information
