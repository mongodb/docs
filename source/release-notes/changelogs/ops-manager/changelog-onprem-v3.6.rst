.. _opsmgr-server-3.6.0:

|onprem| Server 3.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2017-12-05*

- Added support for a new :doc:`organizations and projects hierarchy
  </organizations-projects>` to facilitate the management of your Ops
  Manager deployments. Groups are now known as Projects. You can put
  multiple Projects under an Organization.

- Added support for nested LDAP groups via the ``member`` field when
  configuring |onprem| to use LDAP for |onprem| authentication.

  Although |onprem| 3.6 supports the use of either ``member`` or
  ``memberOf`` for configuration, support for LDAP via the ``memberOf``
  field will be removed in a future version of |onprem|. When
  possible, use ``member`` instead.
  
- Added support for a new :doc:`Agent API Key model
  </tutorial/manage-agent-api-key>`. Multiple Agent API Keys can now be
  associated with a project. This gives users the ability to perform
  Agent key rotation.

- The bundled |jdk| is version 8u152.

Automation
``````````

- Added support for management of the :doc:`MongoDB Connector for
  Business Intelligence </tutorial/deploy-bi-connector>`. The MongoDB
  Connector for Business Intelligence allows you to query a MongoDB
  database using SQL commands to aid in data analysis. It translates
  SQL queries from data analysis tools to MongoDB aggregation pipelines
  on MongoDB database.

- Added the ability to :doc:`retrieve the on-disk logs
  </tutorial/view-logs>` for all MongoDB and |onprem| Agent
  processes. The logs are sent to the |onprem| server and available
  for download by |onprem| administrators.

- Agent Upgrade: :ref:`automation-4.5.7.2375`

Backup
``````

- Added support for :doc:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup>`.
  This functionality allows you to query specific backup snapshot. You
  can use the queryable backups to:

  - Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.

  - Compare previous versions of data against the current data.

  - Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing
    data from multiple snapshots.

  .. important::
  
     On Windows, :doc:`queryable restores </tutorial/query-backup/>`
     work on MongoDB 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 snapshots once the |onprem|
     :term:`Backup Daemon` can access
     :ref:`MongoDB 3.4.11 <3.4.11-changelog>` or later.

- Added support for IBM Cloud Object Storage and DellEMC Elastic Cloud
  Storage for S3 Blockstore Snapshot Storage

- Added support for performing
  :doc:`automated restores from one Project to another Project</tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>`.

- Added the ability to reschedule the expiration time of a snapshot.

- Added support for automated restores via the Public API.

- Agent Upgrade: :ref:`backup-6.0.3.689`.

Monitoring
``````````

- Added :ref:`Real-Time Metrics <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

- Added the :doc:`Performance Advisor </tutorial/performance-advisor>`.
  The Performance Advisor monitors any operation with a query predicate
  that MongoDB considers slow and suggests new indexes to improve query
  performance.

- Added the :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`. This feature
  provides the ability to introspect collections in your managed
  MongoDB deployments via the Data Explorer view.

- Agent Upgrade: :ref:`monitoring-6.1.1.395`.

Release Advisories for |onprem| 3.6
```````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /release-notes/release-advisories/advisories-v3.6.rst

Deprecation
```````````

- MongoDB 2.4 is no longer supported for Automation and Backups:

  - All MongoDB 2.4 processes in Automation will be unmanaged.

  - All MongoDB 2.4 backups will be stopped.

- MongoDB 3.0 is no longer supported as a backing store for |onprem|.

Upcoming Incompatibilities
``````````````````````````

- Support for MongoDB 3.2 as a backing store for |onprem| will be
  removed in |onprem| 4.0.

- Support for restores delivered by SCP will be removed in |onprem|
  4.0.

- Support for LDAP via the ``memberOf`` field will be removed in Ops
  Manager 4.0. Use ``member`` instead. In |onprem| 3.6, you may use
  either ``member`` or ``memberOf``.

- Support for the older Agent API Key model will be removed in Ops
  Manager 4.0. Instead, use the new-style keys. In |onprem| 3.6, the
  new-style keys are preferred, the but the older keys will still work.
