Overview
--------
 
This guide walks you through how to migrate data from Compose to MongoDB Atlas 
using the Atlas Live Migration process. 

.. include:: /includes/live_migration_description.rst
 
.. time:: 20

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/migration_pr_compose.rst

Procedure
---------
 
.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create an Atlas deployment.

      If you don't already have an Atlas deployment, :atlas:`create one
      </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` now. 
      You'll need a :atlas:`cluster tier
      </tutorial/create-new-cluster/#select-the-cluster-tier>` 
      of ``M10`` or larger to perform Live Migration.

   .. step:: Log in to your Compose account.

      Log in to your `Compose account <https://app.compose.io/session/new>`_
      and navigate to the deployment you want to migrate to Atlas.
        
      .. note::
         It will be helpful during the migration process to keep one
         browser window open on your Compose deployment console and one
         window open on your `Atlas console <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`_.
   
   .. step:: Create an oplog user.
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: connected
      
         .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Add-ons` link in the left-side navigation. 
            If you don't have the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on, add it with the
            :guilabel:`Add` button.

         .. step:: If you already have the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on, click
            :guilabel:`Configure` to see the oplog user username and password.
     
            .. figure:: /images/compose-oplog-addon.png
               :figwidth: 700px  
               :alt: Shows the oplog username and password fields within the 
                     Oplog Access add-on.
  
      To perform the migration process, the oplog user must have
      the following privileges:

      - The :manual:`readAnyDatabase </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-readAnyDatabase>` role.
      - The :manual:`clusterMonitor </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-clusterMonitor>` role.
      - The :manual:`backup </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-backup>` role.

      If you can't grant these permissions to the oplog user,
      the Live Migration process will not work. In this case, use
      :atlas:`mongodump and mongorestore </import/mongorestore/>` to migrate
      your data to Atlas.

   .. step:: Review migration steps.
     
      Read through the overview of migration steps in the Live Migration
      dialog window, then click the green :guilabel:`I'm ready to migrate`
      button.

   .. step:: Add IP address ranges to your Compose deployment whitelist.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Open two browser tabs:

            - For the Atlas Live Migration process dialog from the previous step.
            - For your Compose deployment dashboard.

         .. step:: On your Compose deployment dashboard, click the :guilabel:`Security`
            link in the left-side navigation. The :guilabel:`Whitelist TCP/HTTP
            IPs` section displays a list of IP address ranges which are allowed
            to access your Compose deployment.

         .. step:: Add the IP address range which is listed at the top of the
            Atlas Migration process dialog window.
     
            .. figure:: /images/compose-add-ips.png
               :figwidth: 700px
               :alt: Shows IP address range entered in the Whiltelist TCP/HTTP 
                     IPs section. 
     
            .. note::
               Your Atlas migration IP address ranges may be different from
               those shown here. 

   .. step:: Add the hostname and port of your Compose deployment to the
      Atlas Live Migration dialog.

      On the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on page, you'll find a connection
      string with a hostname and port for oplog access. Copy them to the Atlas
      Live Migration dialog.

      .. figure:: /images/compose-hostname.png
         :figwidth: 650px
         :alt: Shows field filled in with a hostname and port.
   
   .. step:: Enter the oplog user's credentials in the Live Migration dialog.

      Enter the username and password for :guilabel:`oploguser` in the
      Atlas Live Migration dialog window.

   .. step:: Enter your Compose TLS/SSL Certificate data.

      If you don't have TLS/SSL enabled on your Compose deployment, skip this
      step.
      
      .. important::
         
         In some Compose deployments, you can no longer view your TLS/SSL
         certificate in the Compose UI. If this is the case for your
         deployment, you have two options:

         - Contact Compose directly to request your TLS/SSL certificate.
         - Use :atlas:`MongoMirror </import/mongomirror/>` to migrate your data to Atlas.

         See the `Compose documentation
         <https://help.compose.com/docs/lets-encrypt-certificates>`__ for more
         information about SSL certificates.
  
      On the :guilabel:`Oplog Access` add-on page, you'll find an SSL
      certificate. Copy it to the CAFile text box on the Atlas Live
      Migration dialog.

      .. figure:: /images/compose-cafile.png
         :figwidth: 664px
         :alt: Shows an SSL certificate pasted into the CAFile text box.

      .. note::
         Copy the entire certificate file, including the
         ``BEGIN CERTIFICATE`` and ``END CERTIFICATE`` lines. 

   .. step:: Validate your Live Migration form.

      Click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to check that all your form
      fields are valid and your clusters are ready for migration. When your
      form is validated, you're ready to begin the migration.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Start Migration`.

      A countdown timer in a progress bar indicates how much time remains
      before your target cluster is ready to migrate data from your source
      cluster. Wait until the countdown timer and the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`
      button are green before proceeding to the next step.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`.

   .. step:: Perform the cutover.

      When Atlas detects that the source and destination clusters are nearly
      in sync, it starts an extendable 72 hour timer to begin the cutover
      procedure. If the 72 hour period passes, Atlas stops synchronizing with
      the source cluster. You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by
      clicking the :guilabel:`Extend time` hyperlink below the :guilabel:`<time>
      left to cut over` timer.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Once you are prepared to cut your applications over to the
            destination Atlas cluster, click :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`.

         .. step:: Atlas displays a walk-through screen with instructions
            on how to proceed with the cutover. These steps are also outlined
            below:

            1. Stop your application. This ensures that no additional writes
               are generated to the source cluster.

            #. Wait for the optime gap to reach zero. When the counter reaches
               zero, the source and destination clusters are in sync.

            #. Restart your application using the new connection string
               provided in step 3 of the Live Migrate cutover UI.

               .. step:: Once you are prepared to cut your applications over to the
                  destination Atlas cluster, click :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`.

         .. step:: Once you have completed the cutover procedure and confirmed
            your applications are working normally with the Atlas cluster,
            click :guilabel:`Cut Over` to complete the migration procedure.
            This allows Atlas to:

            - Mark the migration plan as complete.
            - Remove the Application Server subnets from the destination
              cluster IP access list.
            - Remove the MongoDB user that Live Migrate used to import data
              to the destination cluster.
