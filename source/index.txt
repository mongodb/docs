What is |compass|?
------------------

|compass| is the :abbr:`GUI (Graphical User Interface)` for MongoDB.
|compass-short| allows you to analyze and understand the contents of
your data without formal knowledge of MongoDB
:manual:`query syntax </tutorial/query-documents>`. In addition to
exploring your data in a visual environment, you can also use
|compass-short| to :ref:`optimize query performance <explain-plans>`,
:ref:`manage indexes <compass-indexes>`, and implement
:ref:`document validation <validation>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use |compass-short|, you must connect to an existing MongoDB 
database. You can connect to:

- A MongoDB server that you have 
  :manual:`installed locally </installation/>`, or

- A MongoDB |service| cluster.
