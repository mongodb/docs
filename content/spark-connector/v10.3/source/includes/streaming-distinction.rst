   Apache Spark contains two different stream-processing engines:
   
   - `Spark Streaming with DStreams <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html>`__,
     now an unsupported legacy engine
   
   - `Spark Structured Streaming <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html>`__.
