                     a. Copy the Homebrew command from the |service| UI
                        window and run it in a terminal.

                     #. A copyable connection command appears in Step 3 of the
                        |service| UI window. Be sure to update the

                        option with your database user's username.

                     #. Copy and paste the ``mongo`` command and connection string into a
                        terminal and run it. The shell prompts you for the
                        :manual:`--password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`
                        option.

                     a. Run the following command in a terminal to extract
                        the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

                        .. code-block:: shell

                           tar -xzf ./<filename>.tgz

                     #. Add the ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH``
                        environment variable.

                        .. code-block:: none

                           export PATH=/<extraction-directory>/bin:$PATH

                        .. note::

                           This command applies only to the current shell session. Edit
                           the ``PATH`` environment variable in ``~/.profile``
                           to update the variable across shell sessions and reboots.

                     #. A copyable connection command appears in Step 3 of the
                        |service| UI window. Be sure to update the
                        :manual:`--username </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-username>`
                        option with your database user's username.

                     #. Copy and paste the ``mongo`` command and connection string into a
                        terminal and run it. The shell prompts you for the
                        :manual:`--password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`
                        option.

            The connection string includes the user name of a database user set
            up for the project for authentication purposes. To connect as a
            different database user, update the ``--username`` option with
            the username of a different database user.

            1. Select your shell version from the dropdown menu. To
               check which version of the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
               shell is installed on your system, run the following
               command from a terminal:

               .. code-block:: bash

                  mongo --version

               If your shell version is older than 3.6, MongoDB
               recommends that you upgrade to the newest version.

            #. A copyable connection command appears in Step 2 of the |service|
               UI window. Be sure to update the
               :manual:`--username </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-username>`
               option with your database username.

            #. Copy and paste the ``mongo`` command and connection
               string into a terminal and run it.

               The shell prompts you for the :manual:`--password
               </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`
               option.

               The connection string includes the user name of a
               database user set up for the project for authentication
               purposes. To connect with a different database user,
               update the
               :manual:`--username </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-username>`
               option with the username of a different database user.
