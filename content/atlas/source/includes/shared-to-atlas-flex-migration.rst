.. important::

    As of February 2025, you can create {+Flex-clusters+}, and can no longer
    create ``M2`` and ``M5`` {+clusters+} or {+Serverless-instances+} in the 
    {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, |ak8so|, HashiCorp Terraform,
    or |service| CloudFormation Resources.

    As of January 22, 2026, |service| no longer supports ``M2`` and ``M5`` 
    {+clusters+} and {+Serverless-instances+}. All existing ``M2`` and ``M5``
    {+clusters+} were migrated to {+Flex-clusters+}.
    
    |service| migrated {+Serverless-instances+} to {+Free-clusters+},
    {+Flex-clusters+}, or {+Dedicated-clusters+} according to your usage. 
    To see which tiers |service| migrated your instances
    to, consult the `All Clusters <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/clusters>`__ 
    page in the {+atlas-ui+}.
