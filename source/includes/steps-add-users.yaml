     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`User Name`

       - The user's login name.

     * - :guilabel:`Database`

       - The database to which the user authenticates. 
       
         The user's name and authentication database serve as a unique
         identifier for that user. That is, if two users have the same
         name but are created in different databases, they are two
         separate users.

         .. note::

            A user's access is not restricted by this selection. By
            assigning to the user roles in other databases, a user
            created in one database can have permissions to act on
            other databases.

     * - :guilabel:`Roles`

       - The actions a user can perform on specified databases. A given role
         can be granted for a specific database or for all databases. You can
         assign a user roles on different databases. You can assign
         the following roles:

         Roles available in the ``admin`` database:

         - :authrole:`backup`

         - :authrole:`clusterMonitor`

         - ``enableSharding``
              Allows the MongoDB user to enable sharding on a database
              and to shard a collection. See the
              :authaction:`enableSharding` privilege action in the
              MongoDB manual.

         - :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`

         - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`

         Roles available in any database. Specify the role in the form
         ``role@dbname``.

         - :authrole:`read`

           You must specify the database; e.g. ``read@test`` for
           :authrole:`read` role on the ``test`` database or
           ``read@admin`` for :authrole:`read` role on the ``admin``
           database.

         - :authrole:`readWrite`

           You must specify the database; e.g. ``readWrite@test`` for
           :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``test`` database or
           ``readWrite@admin`` for :authrole:`readWrite` role on the
           ``admin`` database.


         For more information on roles, see :manual:`Role-Based Access Control
         </core/authorization>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - The user's password. Users can change their passwords.

         |service| clusters use :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1
         </core/security-scram-sha-1>` to authenticate MongoDB users.
