You can continually push logs from ``mongod``, ``mongos``, and audit logs to an 
|aws| |s3| bucket from an ``M10+`` {+cluster+}.
|service| exports logs every 5 minutes.

Required Access
---------------

To push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` access to 
|service|.

To push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket using the {+atlas-admin-api+}, you 
must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to |service|.

Considerations
--------------

- You can't specify which logs to send. |service| sends all ``mongod``, ``mongos``, and audit logs.
- Push-based log export doesn't support Bring Your Own Key (BYOK).
- You can only push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket from an ``M10+`` |service| {+cluster+}.
- |service| doesn't export log lines over 10 MB.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need:

- an |aws| |iam| role with `sts:AssumeRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__ that grants |service| access to your |aws| resource with a maximum session duration set to 12 hours.
- an existing |aws| |s3| bucket.
- An ``M10+`` |service| {+cluster+}.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   During the procedure, |service| creates a role policy to access the |s3| bucket with the following permissions:

   * `s3:ListBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`__
   * `s3:PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__
   * `s3:GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__
   * `s3:GetBucketLocation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLocation.html>`__

To continually push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket, follow these steps.
