Manage Namespace Metadata Catalog for Wildcard Collections
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The {+adf+} namespace catalog contains namespace metadata (such as 
databases, collections, and partitions) for each wildcard (``*``) 
collection in each  {+fdi+} store in the {+fdi+} storage configuration. 
For commands and queries on wildcard collections, {+df+} returns the 
data from the catalog or returns an error if the  {+fdi+} store doesn't 
exist. 

When objects that are included in a wildcard collection specification 
are modified in your |s3| bucket, the catalog must be updated for you 
to see the changes when you run ``list`` commands against wildcard 
collections. By default, the catalog is refreshed every hour for all 
active {+fdi+}\s. In addition, the namespace metadata catalog is 
refreshed in the background when you: 

- :ref:`Update the storage configuration <adf-setstorageconfig>`. 
- Run the ``show collections`` command.
- Query a collection.
- Run the :ref:`update-catalog-cmd` command.

You can determine when the catalog was last updated by using the 
:ref:`catalog-info-cmd` command and can manually update the catalog 
by using the :ref:`update-catalog-cmd` command. You must have the 
:atlas:`atlasAdmin </security-add-mongodb-users/#atlasAdmin>` role 
to update the catalog.
