     In |onprem| 1.8 and later, |onprem| can manage SSL for you if you
     using Automation for the deployment. With Automation, |mms| prompts
     you for the certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you
     enable SSL and then configures the agents appropriately. See:
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment` for more information.

  To ensure that the Backup Agents use SSL when connecting to |onprem|,
  Configure |onprem| to use SSL for all connections. The
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-web-interface` tutorial
  describes how to set up |onprem| to run over HTTPS.

  Starting with |onprem| 1.4, the Backup Agent validates the SSL
  certificate of the |onprem| server by default.

  If you are not using a certificate signed by a trusted 3rd party, you
  must configure the Backup Agent to trust the |onprem| server.
