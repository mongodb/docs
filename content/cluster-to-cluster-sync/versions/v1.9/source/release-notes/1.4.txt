Patch Releases
--------------

.. _1.4.1-c2c-release-notes:

1.4.1 - June 23, 2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed:

- Fixes a build misconfiguration so that telemetry information is sent
  correctly.

.. _1.4.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.4.0 Release
-------------

**June 21, 2023**

Set Cluster Workload Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.4.0, you can set the workload level that
{+c2c-product-name+} uses to sync data between the source and
destination clusters. For more information, see the
:option:`--loadLevel` option.

Faster Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.4.0 improves ``change event application`` speeds for improved
performance.

Improved Memory Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In version 1.4.0, ``mongosync`` uses less memory to buffer change
events. Improved memory handling alleviates some out-of-memory (OOM)
issues.

Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.4.0, ``mongosync`` collects anonymous, aggregated usage
data to improve MongoDB products. You can disable collection of this
:ref:`telemetry <c2c-telemetry>` data when you start ``mongosync``.

Bug Fixes
----------

- Fixes an issue so documents with ``_id`` values that evaluate to the
  same string replicate correctly.

- Fixes a collection naming issue. Prior to version 1.4.0, ``mongosync``
  crashes when a new collection reuses a dropped collection's name with
  letter case changes.
  
  For example, previous versions of ``mongosync`` crash if a new
  ``SampleName`` collection replaces the dropped ``samplename``
  collection.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

The MongoDB server's :dbcommand:`validate` command may report data
corruption on destination clusters that run MongoDB version 6.0 through
6.0.6. The data on the destination server is not corrupt. A bug in the
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` database engine,
:issue:`WT-11051`, causes the false report.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.4.0, the minimum supported version of MongoDB is 6.0.5.
