{+Serverless-instances+} offer pay-per-operation pricing, meaning that 
you only pay for the Processing Units consumed by your database 
operations and storage consumed by your data and indexes. You do not 
need to specify a cluster size since serverless instances seamlessly 
scale to accommodate changes in workload traffic.

{+Serverless-instances+} 
may be more cost effective for applications with low or intermittent 
traffic. To learn more about {+serverless-instances+} and use cases, 
see :ref:`Choose a Database Deployment Type <ref-deployment-types>`.

Usage Costs

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Price

   * - Read Processing Unit (``RPU``)
     - Read operations to the database.
       
       You are charged one ``RPU`` for each document read (up to 4KB) 
       or for each index read (up to 256 bytes).
      
     - The price for each million ``RPU``\s decreases based on volume 
       of reads in a day, starting at $0.30 per million ``RPU``\s. See 
       :ref:`rpu-pricing` for details.

   * - Write Processing Unit (``WPU``)
     - Write operations to the database.

       You are charged one ``WPU`` for each combined document and index 
       written (up to 1KB).

     - $1.25 per million.

   * - Storage
     - Logical document and index storage.
     - $0.25 per ``GB`` per month, prorated and billed *per day*.

   * - Backup
     - Daily snapshots.
     - Two daily snapshots are included for free.

   * - Restore from Backup
     - The time required to restore your serverless instance.

       .. important::

          Data transfer as part of the backup and restore process is 
          charged separately.

     - $2.50 per restore hour.

   * - Data Transfer
     - Data transfer to and from the database.

       .. tip::
          
          If your data transfer costs are a significant portion of your 
          bill, see :ref:`reducing-data-transfer-costs`.

     - $0.015 per ``GB`` (preview pricing).

       .. important::

          During the preview period, data transfer costs may be updated 
          to account for the source and destination regions of a 
          transfer.
       
.. ZC - 7/6/21 - After public beta (for GA) update to:
   $0.015-$0.09 per ``GB``, depending on the source and destination 
   of the transfer.

.. _rpu-pricing:

Read Processing Unit Pricing 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The price for each million (M) ``RPU``\s depends on volume of reads 
that day. Prices are in cascading tiers:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 50 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tier 
     - Description
     - Price

   * - 0-5 M ``RPU``\s 
     - The first 5 million ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.30

   * - 5-25 M ``RPU``\s 
     - The next 20 million ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.25
   
   * - 25-75 M ``RPU``\s 
     - The next 50 million ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.20
   
   * - 75+ M ``RPU``\s 
     - All subsequent ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.15

.. example::
   
   If an application uses 31 million ``RPU``\s in a day, the price for 
   those ``RPU``\s is $7.70.

   - $0.30/M for the first 5 million ($1.50).

   - $0.25/M for the next 20 million ($5).

   - $0.20/M for the last 6 million ($1.20).

   could result in an expensive invoice. Use 
   :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to monitor usage.

You can pay for {+serverless-instances+} with:

- A :ref:`payment method <payment-method>` added through the |service|
