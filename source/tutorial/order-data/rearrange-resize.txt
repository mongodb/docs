   :description: In this tutorial rearrange and resize charts on your dashboard using drag and drop to optimize space and improve readability.

*Time to Complete: 2 minutes*

The dashboard is starting to get crowded at the top row with plenty of
empty space below. You can make the display easier to digest by
rearranging and resizing some of the charts. |charts-short| makes this
a straight-forward process by providing simple drag and drop
capabilities for reorganizing a dashboard.

Instructions
------------

You can rearrange charts by dragging the top-left corner of the chart,
and resize charts by dragging the bottom-right corner. For additional
details on rearranging and resizing charts, see the
:ref:`Manage Existing Dashboards <manage-existing-dashboards>` section.

Try reorganizing your dashboard to get something like this:

   :alt: Organized Dashboard

Next Steps
----------

In the last chart of the dashboard, we will explore some of the
customer data available in the schema to create an
:ref:`area chart <order-data-area-chart>` showing the age distribution
of customers.
