Overview
--------

:manual:`Single field indexes </core/index-single/>` are indexes with a reference to a single field within a collection's
documents. They improve single field query and sort performance, and support :manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl>` that
automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time.

.. note::

   The ``_id_`` index is an example of a single field index. This index is automatically created on the ``_id`` field
   when a new collection is created.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>`.

Create Single Field Index
-------------------------

The following example creates an index in ascending order on the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.py
   :start-after: start-index-single
   :end-before: end-index-single
   :language: python
   :copyable:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index created in the preceding code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: start-index-single-query
   :end-before: end-index-single-query

To learn more, see :manual:`Single Field Indexes
</core/index-single>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
