          The Python examples below assume that you have `connected to a MongoDB replica set and have accessed a database
          <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html#making-a-connection-with-mongoclient/>`__
          that contains an ``inventory`` collection.

      - id: linux
        name: linux
        content: |
          To make sure your MongoDB process is running on linux, run the following command:
            .. cssclass:: copyable-code
            .. code-block:: sh

              ps -ef | grep 'mongod'
         
          If a mongod process is running, you will see something like:

            .. code-block:: sh 
              
              502  6990   540   0  7Feb18 ttys008    8:53.94 ./mongod

  If you have properly installed mongo, you should be able to access your mongod
  instance with:
    .. cssclass:: copyable-code
    .. code-block:: sh

      mongo
    
  If a mongo shell successfully starts, you will see some log output to the console
  and then a command prompt. Type the following to make sure you are running mongo shell,
  it will return the version number of the shell.
    
    .. cssclass:: copyable-code
    .. code-block:: sh
    
      > db.version()
...
