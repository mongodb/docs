|service| provides the ability to manage user authentication and
authorization from all MongoDB clients using your own Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (|ldap|) server over |tls|. A single |ldaps|
(|ldap| over |tls|) configuration applies to all clusters in a project.

If you enable user authorization with |ldap|, you can create |ldap|
groups on the ``admin`` database by mapping |ldap| groups to MongoDB
roles on your |service| databases. To use |ldap| groups effectively,
:doc:`create additional projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` within
|service| to control access to specific deployments in your
organization, such as creating separate |service| projects for
development and production environments. You can then map an |ldap|
group to a role in the |service| project to provide access to the
desired deployment.

.. note::

   When user authorization is enabled and an |ldap| user does not
   belong to any |ldap| group, |service| does not assign any database
   roles to the user. When user authentication is enabled and user
   authorization is disabled, |service| assigns MongoDB database roles
   to the |ldap| user.

If you have multiple departments with their own billing needs, alert
settings, and project members, create a new
:doc:`organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>` for each
department.

.. note::

   An explanation of |ldap| is out of scope for the MongoDB
   documentation. Please review :rfc:`RFC 4515 <4515>` and
   :rfc:`RFC 4516 <4516>`  or refer to your preferred |ldap|
   documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must meet the following prerequisites to manage user authentication
and authorization using |ldap| in |service|:

- |service| cluster using MongoDB 3.6 or later.

- |ldap| server using |tls| that is accessible to |service| clusters
  over the network using either  :doc:`VPC </security-vpc-peering>` or
  VNet peering connection or the cluster nodes' public IP addresses.

- |ldap| group memberships for each user are embedded as an attribute
  in each user's |ldap| entry for user authorization only.

Recommendation
--------------

For your |ldaps| service to access |service| clusters, MongoDB
recommends one of two configurations:

Using a |vpc| or VNet:

1. Run your |ldap| server in a |vpc| or VNet.
#. Establish a peering connection to your |service| project.
#. Use a public |fqdn| that resolves to the private IP address
   of your |ldap| server.

Using your data center:

1. Run your |ldap| server with a public |fqdn| that resolves to a
   public IP address.
#. Configure the |ldap| server to allow inbound access from the
   |service| cluster nodes' public IP addresses.


Considerations
--------------

Usernames
~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses the full Distinguished Name (DN) of users in your |ldap|
server as the |service| username. For example, an example |ldap| user
named ``ralph`` has the following username in |service|:

``cn=ralph,cn=Users,dc=aws-atlas-ldap-01,dc=myteam,dc=com``

Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the administrator enables user authentication or both user
authentication and authorization with |ldap|, database users must
override the following parameters in the connection string for their
clients.

* ``authSource`` must be ``$external``

* ``authenticationMechanism`` must be ``PLAIN``

.. example::

   The following connection string for the ``mongo`` client
   authenticates an |ldap| user named ``rob``:

   ``mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-tijis.mongodb.net/test?authSource=%24external" --authenticationMechanism PLAIN --username cn=rob,cn=Users,dc=atlas-ldaps-01,dc=myteam,dc=com``

To copy the connection string:

1. Click :guilabel:`Connect` on the :guilabel:`Clusters` page.
#. Edit the string with your ``User DN`` and password.

.. note::

   Use escape characters in place of special characters in MongoDB
   connection strings. The example above passes '%24' for the '$'.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |ldap| to authenticate and authorize users, you cannot:

- Provide public IP addresses that refer to other internal or private
  IP addresses using Network Address Translation to allow |service|
  traffic to your |ldap| server.

- Use both |ldap| and SCRAM authentication for the same database user.

Procedures
----------

Configure Authentication with LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following procedure to configure user authentication with
|ldap| for all clusters in a project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-authentication-ldaps.rst

Configure Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following procedure to configure user authorization with |ldap|
for all clusters in a project:

.. include:: /includes/fact-ldap-authz-intro.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-authorization-ldaps.rst

Tutorials for Third-Party LDAP Providers
----------------------------------------

Use the following tutorials to configure |service| to authenticate and
authorize users from third-party LDAP providers:

- :doc:`security-ldaps-azure`
- :doc:`security-ldaps-okta`
- :doc:`security-ldaps-onelogin`
