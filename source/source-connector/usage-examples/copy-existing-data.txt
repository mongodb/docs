Copy Existing Data
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This usage example demonstrates how to copy data from a MongoDB collection to an
{+ak+} topic using the {+mkc+}.

Example
-------

Suppose you need to copy a MongoDB collection to {+ak+} and filter some of the data.

Your requirements and your solutions are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Requirement
     - Solution

   * - Copy the ``customers`` collection of the ``shopping`` database in your 
       MongoDB deployment onto an {+ak+} topic.
     - | See the :ref:`<source-usage-example-copy-existing-data-copy-data>` section of this guide.

   * - Only copy documents that have the value "Mexico" in the ``country`` field.
     - | See the :ref:`<source-usage-example-copy-existing-data-mask-data>` section of this guide.

The ``customers`` collection contains the following documents:

.. _usage-example-copy-sample-document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "country": "Mexico",
     "purchases": 2,
     "last_viewed": { "$date": "2021-10-31T20:30:00.245Z" }
   }
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "country": "Iceland",
     "purchases": 8,
     "last_viewed": { "$date": "2015-07-20T10:00:00.135Z" }
   }

Copy Data
~~~~~~~~~

Copy the contents of the ``customers`` collection of the ``shopping`` database by 
specifying the following configuration options in your source connector:

.. code-block:: properties

   database=shopping
   collection=customers
   copy.existing=true

Your source connector copies your collection by creating change event documents
that describe inserting each document into your collection. 

To learn more about change event documents, see the
:ref:`Change Streams <source-connector-fundamentals-change-event>` guide.

To learn more about the ``copy.existing`` option, see
:ref:`<source-configuration-copy-existing>` in the {+mkc+}.

.. _source-usage-example-copy-existing-data-mask-data:

Filter Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter data by specifying an aggregation pipeline in the 
``copy.existing.pipeline`` option of your source connector configuration. The
following configuration specifies an aggregation pipeline that matches all
documents with "Mexico" in the ``country`` field:

.. code-block:: properties

   copy.existing.pipeline=[{ "$match": { "country": "Mexico" } }]

To learn more about  the ``copy.existing.pipeline`` option, see
:ref:`<source-configuration-copy-existing>` in the {+mkc+}.

To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see the following resources:

- :ref:`<source-usage-example-custom-pipeline>` Usage Example
- :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>` in the MongoDB manual.


Specify the Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your source connector configuration to copy the ``customers`` collection should
look like this:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/copy/source.properties
    :language: properties
    :emphasize-lines: 5,6

Once your connector copies your data, you see the following change event
document corresponding to the 
:ref:`preceding sample collection <usage-example-copy-sample-document>`
in the ``shopping.customers`` {+ak+} topic:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/copy/payload.json
    :language: json
    :copyable: false
    :emphasize-lines: 6,7

.. note:: Write the Data in your Topic into a Collection

   Use a change data capture handler to convert change event documents in an
   {+ak+} topic into MongoDB write operations. To learn more, see the
   :ref:`Change Data Capture Handlers <sink-fundamentals-cdc-handler>` guide.
