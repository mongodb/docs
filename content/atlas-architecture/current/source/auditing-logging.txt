To monitor and log |service| platform activities, use auditing and logs.

- :ref:`MongoDB Atlas Database Auditing <arch-center-auditing>` is available
  on ``M10+`` clusters.
  
  As |a-service| administrator, you can create and enable custom JSON audit
  filters in MongoDB to precisely control what gets audited across your
  system and track system activity for deployments with multiple users.
  This approach lets you specify exactly which actions, database users,
  and |service| roles should be monitored, giving you more granular control
  over your auditing process compared with the standard filter builder in
  the {+atlas-ui+}.

- :ref:`MongoDB Atlas Logging <arch-center-logging>` provides a comprehensive
  view of platform activities, including user actions and system events.
  
  You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to view logs, or you can export logs to
  external systems for further analysis. |service| logs include detailed
  information about database operations, user activities, and system events,
  enabling you to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure
  compliance with security and operational policies.
