      {{mechanism}} for your |mms| project.

      .. note::

         |onprem| can manage agent authentication for you if you use
         Automation to manage the agents. With Automation, |onprem|
         creates the users for each agent and configures the agent
         appropriately. To learn more about authentication, see
         {{document}}.

ref: _configure-agent-ldap-intro
content: |
  If your MongoDB deployment enforces access control, the {{agent}} must
  authenticate to MongoDB as a user with the proper access. If you use
  :ref:`Automation <automation>`, |mms| takes care of this for you.

  MongoDB Enterprise supports simple and SASL binding to |ldap| servers
  via ``saslauthd`` and operating system libraries:

  - MongoDB Enterprise for Linux can bind to an |ldap| server either
    via ``saslauthd`` via operating system libraries.

  - MongoDB Enterprise for Windows can bind to an |ldap| server via the
    operating system libraries.

  {{agent}} support authenticating to MongoDB instances using |ldap|.
    
  If your MongoDB deployment uses |ldap| to authenticate users, to
  authenticate the {{agent}}, create a user in the ``$external``
  database with the appropriate roles in MongoDB.
