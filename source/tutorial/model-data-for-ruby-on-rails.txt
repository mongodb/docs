MongoDB Data Modeling and Rails
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial discusses the development of a web application on Rails
and MongoDB. MongoMapper will serve as our object mapper. The goal is
to provide some insight into the design choices required for building
on MongoDB. To that end, we'll be constructing a simple but non-trivial
social news application. The `source code for newsmonger
<http://github.com/banker/newsmonger>`_ is available on github for
those wishing to dive right in.

Assuming you've configured your application to work with MongoMapper,
let's start thinking about the data model.

Modeling Stories
----------------

A news application relies on stories at its core, so we'll start with a
Story model:

.. code-block:: ruby
 
   class Story
    include MongoMapper::Document

    key :title,     String
    key :url,       String
    key :slug,      String
    key :voters,    Array
    key :votes,     Integer, :default => 0
    key :relevance, Integer, :default => 0

    # Cached values.
    key :comment_count, Integer, :default => 0
    key :username,      String

    # Note this: ids are of class ObjectId.
    key :user_id,   ObjectId
    timestamps!

    # Relationships.
    belongs_to :user

    # Validations.
    validates_presence_of :title, :url, :user_id
   end

Obviously, a story needs a ``title``, ``url``, and ``user_id``, and should belong
to a user. These are self-explanatory.

Caching to Avoid N+1
--------------------

When we display our list of stories, we'll need to show the name of the
user who posted the story. If we were using a relational database, we
could perform a join on users and stores, and get all our objects in a
single query. But MongoDB does not support joins and so, at times,
requires bit of denormalization. Here, this means caching the
``username`` attribute.

A Note on Denormalization
-------------------------

Relational purists may be feeling uneasy already, as if we were
violating some universal law. But let's bear in mind that MongoDB
collections are not equivalent to relational tables; each serves a
unique design objective. A normalized table provides an atomic,
isolated chunk of data. A document, however, more closely represents an
object as a whole. In the case of a social news site, it can be argued
that a username is intrinsic to the story being posted.

What about updates to the ``username``? It's true that such updates will be
expensive; happily, in this case, they'll be rare. The read savings
achieved in denormalizing will surely outweigh the costs of the
occasional update. Alas, this is not hard and fast rule: ultimately,
developers must evaluate their applications for the appropriate level
of normalization.

Fields as arrays
----------------

With a relational database, even trivial relationships are blown out
into multiple tables. Consider the votes a story receives. We need a
way of recording which users have voted on which stories. The standard
way of handling this would involve creating a table, 'votes', with each
row referencing ``user_id`` and ``story_id``.

With a document database, it makes more sense to store those votes as
an array of user ids, as we do here with the ``'voters'`` key.

For fast lookups, we can create an index on this field. In the MongoDB shell:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   db.stories.ensureIndex('voters');

Or, using MongoMapper, we can specify the index in
:file:`config/initializers/database.rb`:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Story.ensure_index(:voters)

To find all the stories voted on by a given user:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Story.all(:conditions => {:voters => @user.id})

Atomic Updates
--------------

Storing the ``voters`` array in the ``Story`` class also allows us to
take advantage of atomic updates. What this means here is that, when a
user votes on a story, we can

1. ensure that the voter hasn't voted yet, and, if not,

#. increment the number of votes and

#. add the new voter to the array.

MongoDB's query and update features allows us to perform all three
actions in a single operation. Here's what that would look like from
the shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   // Assume that story_id and user_id represent real story and user ids.
   db.stories.update({_id: story_id, voters: {'$ne': user_id}}, 
     {'$inc': {votes: 1}, '$push': {voters: user_id}});

What this says is "get me a story with the given id whose ``voters``
array does not contain the given user id and, if you find such a story,
perform two atomic updates: first, increment ``votes`` by 1 and then
push the user id onto the ``voters`` array."

This operation highly efficient; it's also reliable. The one caveat is
that, because update operations are "fire and forget," you won't get a
response from the server. But in most cases, this should be a non-issue.

A MongoMapper implementation of the same update would look like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   def self.upvote(story_id, user_id)
     collection.update({'_id' => story_id, 'voters' => {'$ne' => user_id}}, 
       {'$inc' => {'votes' => 1}, '$push' => {'voters' => user_id}})
   end

Modeling Comments
-----------------

In a relational database, comments are usually given their own table,
related by foreign key to some parent table. This approach is
occasionally necessary in MongoDB; however, it's always best to try to
embed first, as this will achieve greater query efficiency.

Linear, Embedded Comments
-------------------------

Linear, non-threaded comments should be embedded. Here are the most
basic MongoMapper classes to implement such a structure:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Story
     include MongoMapper::Document
     many :comments
   end

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Comment
    include MongoMapper::EmbeddedDocument
    key :body, String

    belongs_to :story
  end

If we were using the Ruby driver alone, we could save our structure like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   @stories  = @db.collection('stories')
   @document = {:title => "MongoDB on Rails",
                :comments => [{:body     => "Revelatory! Loved it!",
                               :username => "Matz"
                              }
                             ]
               }
   @stories.save(@document)

Essentially, comments are represented as an array of objects within a
story document. This simple structure should be used for any
one-to-many relationship where the many items are linear.

Nested, Embedded Comments
-------------------------

But what if we're building threaded comments? An admittedly more
complicated problem, two solutions will be presented here. The first is
to represent the tree structure in the nesting of the comments
themselves. This might be achieved using the Ruby driver as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   @stories  = @db.collection('stories')
   @document = {:title => "MongoDB on Rails",
                :comments => [{:body     => "Revelatory! Loved it!",
                               :username => "Matz",
                               :comments => [{:body     => "Agreed.",
                                              :username => "rubydev29"
                                             }
                                            ]
                              }
                             ]
               }
   @stories.save(@document)

Representing this structure using MongoMapper would be tricky,
requiring a number of custom mods.

But this structure has a number of benefits. The nesting is captured in
the document itself (this is, in fact, `how Business Insider represents
comments <http://www.businessinsider.com/how-we-use-mongodb-2009-11>`_.
And this schema is highly performant, since we can get the story, and
all of its comments, in a single query, with no application-side
processing for constructing the tree.

One drawback is that alternative views of the comment tree require some
significant reorganizing.

Comment collections
-------------------

We can also represent comments as their own collection. Relative to the
other options, this incurs a small performance penalty while granting
us the greatest flexibility. The tree structure can be represented by
storing the unique path for each leaf (see `Mathias's original post
<http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/3e10a4
b409dd6cb4/ccc9de1fafafe37e?lnk=gst&q=trees#ccc9de1fafafe37e>`_ on the
idea). Here are the relevant sections of this model:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Comment
     include MongoMapper::Document

     key :body,       String
     key :depth,      Integer, :default => 0
     key :path,       String,  :default => ""

     # Note: we're intentionally storing parent_id as a string
     key :parent_id,  String
     key :story_id,   ObjectId
     timestamps!

     # Relationships.
     belongs_to :story

     # Callbacks.
     after_create :set_path

     private

     # Store the comment's path.
     def set_path
       unless self.parent_id.blank?
         parent        = Comment.find(self.parent_id)
         self.story_id = parent.story_id
         self.depth    = parent.depth + 1
         self.path     = parent.path + ":" + parent.id
       end
       save
     end

The path ends up being a string of object ids. This makes it easier to
display our comments nested, with each level in order of karma or
votes. If we specify an index on ``story_id``, ``path``, and ``votes``, the
database can handle half the work of getting our comments in nested,
sorted order.

The rest of the work can be accomplished with a couple grouping
methods, which can be found in `the newsmonger source code
<http://github.com/banker/newsmonger/blob/master/app/models/comment.rb>`_.

It goes without saying that modeling comments in their own collection
also facilitates various site-wide aggregations, including displaying
the latest, grouping by user, etc.

Unfinished business
-------------------

Document-oriented data modeling is still young. The fact is, many more
applications will need to be built on the document model before we can
say anything definitive about best practices. So the foregoing should
be taken as suggestions, only. As you discover new patterns, we
encourage you to document them, and feel free to let us know about what
works (and what doesn't).

Developers working on object mappers and the like are encouraged to
implement the best document patterns in their code, and to be wary of
recreating relational database models in their apps.
