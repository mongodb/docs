   .. tip::

      When specifying :readconcern:`linearizable read concern
      <"linearizable">`, always use ``maxTimeMS`` in case a majority of
      data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS`` ensures that
      the operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures
      that the operation returns an error if the read
      concern cannot be fulfilled.
