A :term:`replica set` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain
the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high
availability and are the basis for all production deployments.

To learn more about replica sets, see the
:manual:`Replication Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in
the MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set that |mms| manages.
After deployment, use |mms| to manage the replica set, including such
operations as adding, removing, and reconfiguring members.
