  To install the ``.rpm`` package on the upgraded |onprem| host, issue
  the following command, where ``<version>`` is the |onprem| version:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo rpm -Uvh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  .. warning::

     ``rpm`` packages for |onprem| versions 6.0.0, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2 
     contained incorrect version information that could cause standard 
     upgrades to fail. If upgrading from any of these versions to 
     version 6.0.3 or greater, upgrade the package using the 
     ``--force`` flag:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo rpm -Uvh --force mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  When upgrading to |onprem| 5.0.x, |onprem| keeps the current
  :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties` file. |onprem|
  saves the ``conf-mms.properties`` installed with this version as
  :file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties.rpmnew`.

  The following existing files block upgrading an |onprem| 4.2
  installation using RPM:

  - ``/etc/init.d/mongodb-mms``
  - ``/etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon``

  To complete the upgrade:

  a. Issue the following commands to move the old ``init`` files:

     .. tabs::

        .. tab:: Upgrading to 6.0
           :tabid: upgrade-6

           .. code-block:: sh

        .. tab:: Upgrading to 7.0
           :tabid: upgrade-7
     
           .. code-block:: sh

              sudo mv /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-6.0
              sudo mv /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon /etc/init.d/        mongodb-mms-backup-daemon-6.0

  #. Issue the following commands to symbolically link the |onprem|
     files to their ``init`` files:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo ln -s /opt/mongodb/mms/bin/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms
