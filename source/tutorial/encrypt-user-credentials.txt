For configuration settings that store credentials, you can either store
the credentials in plain text or use the |onprem| ``credentialstool``
to encrypt the credentials. If you choose to store credentials in plain
text, reduce the permissions on the :ref:`conf-mms.properties <conf-mms.properties>`
file on each server.

This procedure is valid only for SCRAM username and password authentication and (LDAP) PLAIN authentication.
It doen't apply to `MONGODB-X509` or `GSSAPI` authentication, both of which use usernames but not passwords.

.. note:: Protect Plain Text Passwords

   If you choose to store credentials in plain text, reduce the
   permissions on the :ref:`conf-mms.properties <conf-mms.properties>`
   file on each server.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo chmod 600 <install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties

.. important::

   When installed with ``rpm`` or ``deb`` packages on Linux systems,
   the ``credentialstool`` tool requires root (``sudo``) privileges,
   because it reads the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/gen.key`` file. |onprem|
   uses the ``gen.key`` to encrypt sensitive data in the database and
   configuration files.

Use the ``credentialstool`` to generate encrypted credentials for the MongoDB deployments:
