Blurb about how you can manage alerts in |service|.

Q: Let me know if you prefer we roll up Alerts just into clusters. By
having it out, we're kind of mirroring the left hand side of the UI,
but clearly that doesn't need to be as UI can change.

View Alerts
-----------

View open alerts and acknowledge. Blurb that you can also see and ack
the alerts in the clusters view. and link.
  
Can view closed alerts.

Alert Settings
--------------

Stuff about setting the alerts.

We'll probably have a page on what Alerts are available as well.
