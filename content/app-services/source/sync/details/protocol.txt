Overview
--------

Atlas Device Sync uses a protocol to correctly and efficiently sync data changes in
real time across multiple clients that each maintain their own local
Realm files. The protocol defines a set of pre-defined :ref:`request
types <sync-request-types>` as well as a :ref:`process <sync-session-process>`
by which a client, like a Realm SDK, can connect to an
Atlas App Services application server and sync data.

.. note::
   
   The Realm SDKs internally implement and manage the sync protocol,
   so for most applications you don't need to understand the sync protocol to
   use Device Sync. This page covers the protocol at a high level and is
   not an implementation spec.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _changesets:

Changeset
~~~~~~~~~

A **changeset** is a list of instructions that describe granular modifications
made to a known object state or version by one or more write operations.
Changesets are the base unit of the sync protocol. Synced realm clients send
changesets to the Device Sync server whenever they perform a write
operation. The server sends each connected client the changesets for write
operations executed by other clients.

The Device Sync server accepts changesets from any connected sync
client (including changes in a synced MongoDB cluster) at any time and uses an
operational transformation algorithm to serialize changes into a linear order
and resolve conflicting changesets before sending them to connected clients.

.. _delta-sync:

.. note:: Delta Sync

   When you make a change to a synced object, App Services does not
   re-upload the entire object. Instead, App Services sends only
   the difference ("delta") between before and after. The service
   compresses the deltas with :wikipedia:`zlib <Zlib>` compression. This
   reduces network load, which is especially useful in mobile network
   conditions.

.. _operational-transformations:

Operational Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **operational transformation** is a function that, given two changesets,
produces a third changeset that represents logically applying one of the given
changesets after the other. Device Sync uses operational transformation to
resolve conflicts between changesets from different sync clients that apply to
the same base state.

Realm is an offline-first local database even when sync is enabled, which means
that any device may perform offline writes and upload the corresponding
changesets later when network connectivity is re-established. The operational
transformation algorithm is designed to gracefully handle changesets that arrive
"out of order" with respect to the logical server clock such that every synced
Realm file converges to the same version of each changed object.

.. tip::
   
   An operational transformation on Realm changesets is analogous to
   a :git-scm:`rebase operation <docs/git-rebase>` in Git.

.. _client-file-identifier:

Client File Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **client file identifier** is a value that uniquely identifies a synced client
Realm file and its corresponding server file. The server generates a
client file identifier whenever an SDK requests one during its initial sync of a
Realm file. Each identifier is a 64-bit, non-zero, positive signed
integer strictly less than 2^63.

.. note::
   
   The server guarantees that all identifiers generated on behalf of a
   particular server file are unique with respect to each other. The server is
   free to generate identical identifiers for two client files if they are
   associated with different server files.

.. _network-security: 

Network Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK synchronizes with the application server over a WebSocket connection secured by
HTTPS using `TLS 1.3 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446>`__.


.. _sync-session-process:

Sync Session Process
--------------------

To initiate, execute, and terminate a Device Sync session, a
Realm SDK and application server send and receive a set of
protocol-specific requests.

The SDK negotiates a WebSocket connection over HTTP and then establishes a sync
session by sending :sync-client-message:`BIND` and :sync-client-message:`IDENT`
requests to the server over the WebSocket connection. 
Once the session is established, the SDK and server send synced changesets for a given
Realm file to each other via :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` and
:sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD` messages. To end the session, the SDK sends an
:sync-client-message:`UNBIND` request.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Client Connects to the App Server

      The sync protocol is primarily handled over a WebSocket connection between the
      SDK and the server. To establish a connection, the SDK sends a handshake HTTP
      request that includes the following:

      - a protocol version
      - a WebSocket key
      - a valid access token for an authenticated App Services application user

      The server sends an :mdn:`HTTP 101 Switching Protocols <Web/HTTP/Status/101>`
      response that specifies a WebSocket connection for the SDK. The rest of the
      sync protocol occurs over this connection.


   .. step:: Client Initiates a Sync Session

      To begin a sync session, a Realm SDK sends a :sync-client-message:`BIND`
      request to a Device Sync server. The request identifies a
      specific local Realm Database file to sync and includes a WebSocket connection key that
      the server will use to open a bidirectional connection to the SDK.

      If the SDK is attempting to sync a particular Realm Database file for the first time,
      it does not yet possess a server-generated client identifier for the file. In
      this case, the :sync-client-message:`BIND` request also indicates that the
      Device Sync server should allocate one.


   .. step:: App Services Allocates a New Client File Identifier

      If a :sync-client-message:`BIND` request indicates that the SDK needs a client
      file identifier, the Device Sync server generates a unique value for the specified
      Realm Database file and sends it to the SDK in an :sync-server-message:`IDENT`
      response. When the SDK receives the :sync-client-message:`IDENT`, it stores
      the new client identifier persistently in the local Realm Database file.

      An SDK only needs to request a client file identifier the first time it syncs
      each Realm Database file. For subsequent sync sessions, the SDK can use the persisted
      identifier.


   .. step:: Client Sends a Client Identifier

      Once an SDK has initiated a sync session with a :sync-client-message:`BIND`
      request, it must identify the local Realm Database file that it wants to sync. To do
      this, the SDK sends the application server an :sync-client-message:`IDENT`
      message that contains the client file identifier. If the SDK has previously
      synced the realm with the server, it can specify the most recently synced
      server version to optimize the sync process.

      When it receives the :sync-client-message:`IDENT` message, the server
      establishes the session. The SDK and server can can now freely send upload and
      download sync changesets at any time.


   .. step:: Client Uploads & Downloads Sync Changesets

      Once a sync session is established, the SDK and server can freely send and
      receive :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` and :sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD`
      messages to sync changes whenever they occur.

      The SDK sends an :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` message for every changeset it
      applies except for those that it received in a :sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD`
      message from the server.

      When the server receives an :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` message, it applies
      :ref:`operational transformations <operational-transformations>` to resolve
      any conflicts with other changesets and then applies the transformed changeset
      to the server version of the realm. This triggers the server to send
      :sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD` messages to other connected clients, including
      the synced Atlas cluster which mirrors the server realm. A
      :sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD` message groups one or more transformed
      changesets in chronological order from oldest to most recent according to the
      server's history. The SDK applies the changesets in the same order.


   .. step:: Client Terminates the Sync Session

      Once a sync session is established, Device Sync servers will continue to accept
      :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` messages and send
      :sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD` messages until the SDK terminates the session.
      To terminate a sync session, an SDK sends an :sync-client-message:`UNBIND`
      request to the Device Sync server.


.. _sync-request-types:

Request Types
-------------

.. _sync-request-types-client-to-server:

Client -> Server Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the request types that a sync client can send to a
Device Sync server:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Request
     - Description
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: BIND
     - Starts a new sync session on the server and provides a signed
       authorization token for the current application user. If the client does
       not yet possess a :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>`
       for the Realm file it wants to sync, this also indicates that
       the server should generate one and send it back to the client.
       
       A client must send a BIND before it can send any other requests.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: IDENT
     - Provides the :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>` that
       indicates the following:
       
       - the Realm file to sync
       - the client realm's current version
       - the client realm's most recently synced server version
       
       This request is related to but distinct from the
       :sync-server-message:`IDENT` message sent by the server when a client
       requests a client file identifier.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: UPLOAD
     - Specifies one or more :ref:`changesets <changesets>` for operations that
       occurred on the client. The changesets are listed by client version in
       increasing order.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: TRANSACT
     - Specifies a :ref:`changeset <changesets>` that describes a serialized
       transaction that occurred on the client. The client may not upload any
       other changesets until the server confirms or rejects the transaction.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: UNBIND
     - Ends a running sync session.
       
       A client may not send any other requests for an
       :sync-server-message:`UNBOUND` session.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: MARK
     - Requests that the server notify the client when it has synced the latest
       :ref:`changeset <changesets>` in the server history (at the time of the
       request).
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: REFRESH
     - Re-authorizes a current sync session with a new user token.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: STATE_REQUEST
     - Requests that the server send one or more :sync-server-message:`STATE`
       messages, which the client uses to download the current server version of
       the Realm file. Clients issue state requests when they
       asynchronously open a synced realm.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: CLIENT_VERSION_REQUEST
     - Requests that the server send the client version of the latest changeset
       that was sent by the client and processed by the server. This is most
       commonly used when an SDK executes a client reset.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: PING
     - Indicates that the client is still connected and that the server should
       maintain the sync session. A client must send at least one PING to the
       server every 10 minutes. The server acknowledges to each PING with a
       :sync-server-message:`PONG`.
       
       If the server has not received a PING from a client in more than 10
       minutes, it considers the client to be disconnected and may automatically
       end the session.

.. _sync-request-types-server-to-client:

Server -> Client Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the request types that the Device Sync
server can send to a sync client:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Request
     - Description
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: IDENT
     - Provides a :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>` that
       the server generated in response to a :sync-client-message:`BIND` that
       requested the identifier.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: DOWNLOAD
     - Specifies one or more :ref:`changesets <changesets>` (up to 16MB total)
       for operations that occurred on other clients. The changesets are listed
       by server version in increasing order.
       
       The changesets in a DOWNLOAD may not be the exact changesets uploaded by
       other clients. Instead, they may be equivalent changesets output by
       Device Sync's :ref:`operational transformation
       <operational-transformations>` algorithm.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: UNBOUND
     - Specifies that the server ended a sync session in response to an
       :sync-client-message:`UNBIND`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: TRANSACT
     - Indicates whether or not the server successfully processed a changeset
       specified in a :sync-client-message:`TRANSACT` from the client.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: MARK
     - Indicates that the server has sent the client the latest
       :ref:`changeset <changesets>` that was in the server history when the
       server received a :sync-client-message:`MARK` from the client.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: STATE
     - Contains one or more segments of encoded data that the client can
       concatenate to construct the latest server version of the realm. Sent
       in response to a :sync-client-message:`STATE_REQUEST`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: CLIENT_VERSION
     - Specifies the client version of the latest changeset that was sent by the
       client and processed by the server. Sent in response to a
       :sync-client-message:`CLIENT_VERSION_REQUEST`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: ERROR
     - Indicates that the server encountered an issue that appears to have been
       caused by the connected client. For details, see
       :ref:`sync-client-errors`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: PONG
     - Acknowledges a :sync-client-message:`PING`. If a client does not receive
       a PING acknowledgement, it indicates that the client cannot currently
       communicate with the server over the network and that the server may not
       have received the corresponding :sync-client-message:`PING`.
