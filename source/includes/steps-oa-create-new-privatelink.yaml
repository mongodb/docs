  a. From the :guilabel:`AWS Region` list, select the region where you 
     want to create the private endpoint.

     You can select one of the following regions:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 75 25
        :header-rows: 1

        * - |data-lake| Regions
          - |aws| Regions

        * - Northern Virginia, North America
          - us-east-1

        * - Oregon, North America
          - us-west-2

        * - Ireland, Europe
          - eu-west-1

        * - London, Europe
          - eu-west-2

        * - Frankfurt, Europe
          - eu-central-1
    
        * - Mumbai, Asia
          - ap-south-1

        * - Sydney, Australia
          - ap-southeast-2

     To learn more, see :adl:`Atlas Data Lake Regions 
     </#atlas-data-lake-regions>`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  a. Enter the following details about your |aws| |vpc|:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - :guilabel:`Your VPC ID`
          - Unique identifier of the peer |aws| |vpc|. Find this value 
            on the |vpc| dashboard in your |aws| account.

        * - :guilabel:`Your Subnet IDs`
          - Unique identifiers of the subnets your |aws| |vpc| uses. 
            Find these values on the :guilabel:`Subnet` dashboard in 
            your |aws| account.

            .. important::

               You must specify at least one subnet. If you don't, 
               |aws| won't provision an :term:`interface endpoint` in
               your |vpc|. An interface endpoint is required for 
               clients in your |vpc| to send traffic to the private 
               endpoint.

  #. Copy the command the dialog displays and run it using the |aws| 
     CLI.

     See :aws:`Creating an Interface Endpoint </vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint>` 
     to perform this task using the |aws| CLI.

  #. Enter your :guilabel:`VPC Endpoint ID`. This is a 22-character 
     alphanumeric string that identifies your private endpoint. Find 
     this value on the |aws| VPC Dashboard under :guilabel:`Endpoints` 
     > :guilabel:`VPC ID`.

  .. tip:: 

     Click and expand :guilabel:`Show instruction` for a screenshot of 
     the |aws| VPC dashboard where you can find the necessary 
     information.
