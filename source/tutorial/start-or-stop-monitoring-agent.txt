Overview
--------

You can shut down and restart Monitoring Agents. For proper
operation of |mms| your |mms| group must have at least one Monitoring
Agent running.

Beginning with Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0, you can run multiple agents to
distribute monitoring assignments. If you shut an agent down, |mms|
redistributes the agent's assignments. For more information, see
:ref:`multiple-monitoring-agents`.
