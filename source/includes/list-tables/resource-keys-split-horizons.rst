   * - | ``spec.security.tls``
       | :setting:`.enabled<spec.security.tls.enabled>`
     - boolean
     - Optional
     - Set this value to ``true`` to enable |tls| on the MongoDB
       deployment.

       By default, |k8s-op-short| requires hosts to use and accept
       |tls| encrypted connections.

       .. note::

          To connect to a replica set from outside |k8s|, set this
          value to ``true``.
     - ``true``

   * - | ``spec.connectivity``
       | :setting:`.replicaSetHorizons<spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons>`
     - collection
     - Conditional
     - Add this parameter and values if you need your database to be
       accessed outside of |k8s|. This setting allows you to provide
       different |dns| settings within the |k8s| cluster and to the
       |k8s| cluster. The |k8s-op-short| uses split horizon |dns| for
       replica set members. This feature allows communication both
       within the |k8s| cluster and from outside |k8s|.

       You may add multiple external mappings per host.

          :class: note

          - Make sure that each value in this array is unique.

          - Make sure that the number of entries in this array matches
            the value given in :setting:`spec.members`.

          - Set the :setting:`spec.security.tls.enabled` to ``true`` to
            enable |tls|. This method to use split horizons requires
            the Server Name Indication extension of the |tls| protocol.
     - :setting:`See Setting<spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons>`
