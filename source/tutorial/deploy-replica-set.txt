====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A :term:`replica set` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain the same
data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability and are the
basis for all production deployments. See the :manual:`Replication
Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual for more
information about replica sets.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set managed by MMS. After
deployment, use MMS to manage the replica set, including such operations as
adding, removing, and reconfiguring members.
