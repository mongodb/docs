.. dbcommand:: updateRole

   Updates the role on the database on which you run the command. An
   update to a field **completely replaces** the previous field's
   values.

   .. warning::

      When you update the ``privileges`` or ``roles`` arrays, you
      completely replace the previous array's values. To add roles
      without replacing the existing roles, use the
      :dbcommand:`grantRolesToRole` command.

   To run the :dbcommand:`updateRole` command, you must have the
   :authaction:`revokeAnyRole` action on all databases, as well as the
   action permissions described below:

   To update the ``roles`` array, you must have
   :authaction:`grantAnyRole` on the database for every role in the
   updated array.

   To update the ``privileges`` array, you must have
   :authaction:`grantAnyRole` on the database for each privilege in the
   updated array. If the resource for the privilege is a collection in
   all databases, or all collections and all database, or the
   ``cluster`` resource, you must have :authaction:`grantAnyRole` on the
   ``admin`` database.

   The :dbcommand:`updateRole` command uses the following syntax. To
   update a role, you must provide the ``privileges`` array, ``roles``
   array, or both:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { updateRole: "<role>",
        privileges: [
          { resource: { <resource> }, actions: [ "<action>", ... ] },
          ...
        ],
        roles: [
          { role: "<role>", db: "<database>" },
          ...
        ],
        writeConcern: <write concern document>

   The :dbcommand:`updateRole` command has the following fields:

Example
-------

The following is an example of the :dbcommand:`updateRole` command. All
fields are optional, but you must provide at least one:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { updateRole: "myClusterwideAdmin",
     privileges: [
       { resource: { db: "", collection: "" },
         actions: [ "find" , "update", "insert", "remove" ] }
     ],
     roles: [
       { role: "dbAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }
     ],
     writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
   }
