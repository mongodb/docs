For easier scripting, you can specify configuration settings by using environment variables.

Precedence
----------

- When you run a command, any settings that you specified with    
  environment variables take precedence over the profile stored in the
  configuration file.

- When you run a command using the ``--projectId`` option, the command
  line option takes precedence over both the environment variable and
  the profile stored in the configuration file.

Supported Environment Variables
--------------------------------

The {+mcli+} supports the following environment variables:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Variable
     - Description

   * - ``MCLI_PUBLIC_API_KEY``
     - Sets the public |api| key for commands that interact with your   
       MongoDB service.
   
   * - ``MCLI_PRIVATE_API_KEY``
     - Sets the private |api| key for commands that interact with your 
       MongoDB service.

   * - ``MCLI_ORG_ID``
     - Sets the organization ID for commands that require the 
       ``--orgId`` option.
   
   * - ``MCLI_PROJECT_ID``
     - Sets the project ID for commands that require the ``--projectId``
       option. 
   
   * - ``MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_URL``
     - For |onprem| only, sets the base |url| for |api| calls.

   * - ``MCLI_SERVICE``
     - Sets the MongoDB service type. Valid values are:

       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 40 60
          
          * - Value
            - Service

          * - | ``cloud``
              | *default*
            - |service-fullname|
          
          * - ``cloud-manager``
            - |cloud|

          * - ``ops-manager``
            - |mms-full|

   * - | ``MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_CA_CERTIFICATE``
       | *Ops Manager only*
     - If applicable, the full path on your local
       system to the PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) certificate
       used to sign the client and |onprem| TLS certificates.

   * - | ``MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_SKIP_VERIFY``
       | *Ops Manager only*
     - When set to ``yes``, the
       ``MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_CA_CERTIFICATE`` TLS certificate is not
       verified. This prevents your connections from being rejected due
       to an invalid certificate.

       .. important::

          Setting ``MCLI_OPS_MANAGER_SKIP_VERIFY`` to ``yes`` is
          insecure and is not recommended in production environments.
