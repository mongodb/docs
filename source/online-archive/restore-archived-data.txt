Restore Archived Data
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/serverless-preview-dont-use.rst

You can restore archived data to your |service| cluster. You can use 
the alternate syntax that |data-lake| provides for the  :adl:`$merge 
</reference/pipeline/merge>` pipeline stage to move the data back into 
the same or different |service| cluster, database, or collection within 
the same |service| project.

.. note:: 

   Ensure that your cluster is adequately provisioned for the amount of 
   data that will be restored from your archive so that it doesn't run 
   out of space during or after restoration of archived data. Contact 
   :doc:`/support` for additional technical guidance on setting up the 
   size of the oplog or for troubleshooting any space issues on your 
   |service| cluster.

This page describes how to restore using the :pipeline:`$merge` 
pipeline stage.
