|k8s-op-full| 1.31 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.31.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.31.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2025-02-11*

Bug Fixes
```````````

- Fixes handling proxy environment variables in the |k8s-op-short| Pod. 
  When you set the environment variables ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY``, or ``NO_PROXY``
  on the |k8s-op-short| Pod, you can propagate them to the {+mdbagent+}s by also 
  setting the environment variable :ref:`MDB_PROPAGATE_PROXY_ENV <mdb-propogate-proxy-env>` 
  to ``true``.

.. _ent-op-1.30.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.30 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.30.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.30.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-12-20*

New Features
```````````````

- **MongoDB**: Fixes and improves :ref:`multi-cluster-sharded-cluster` deployments (Public Preview).

- **MongoDB**: Supports :setting:`spec.shardOverrides` field for single-cluster topologies. 
  We recommend using this field for customizing settings for specific shards.

- **MongoDB**: Deprecates ``spec.shardSpecificPodSpec``. Use :setting:`spec.shardOverrides` 
  for customizing specific shards for both single- and multi-cluster topologies. 
  For an example, see the `mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes GitHub repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/samples/sharded_multicluster/shardSpecificPodSpec_migration.yaml>`__.


Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**: Fixes placeholder name for ``mongos`` in single-cluster sharded 
  deployments with an external domain set. This fix changes ``mongodProcessDomain`` 
  and ``mongodProcessFQDN`` to ``mongosProcessDomain`` and ``mongosProcessFQDN`` 
  respectively.

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**: If you lose a member cluster,
  you no longer receive validation errors if the failed cluster still exists in the ``clusterSpecList``. This allows you to more easily reconfigure your deployments 
  during disaster recovery.

.. _ent-op-1.29.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.29 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.29.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.29.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-11-11*

New Features
```````````````

- **AppDb**: Adds support for automated 
  expansion of storage by increasing the capacity of |k8s| 
  ``persistentVolumeClaims``. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-resize-storage`.

  Automated expansion of ``persistentVolumeClaims`` is only supported if the 
  underlying |k8s| ``storageClass`` supports |k8s| ``persistentVolume`` expansion.
  Ensure your ``storageClass`` supports in-place expansion without data loss.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**: Fixes a bug where specifying a 
  fractional number for a storage volume's size, such as ``1.7Gi``, breaks the 
  reconciliation loop for that resource with an error 
  ``Can't execute update on forbidden fields`` even if the underlying Persistent Volume Claim 
  is deployed successfully.
- **MongoDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**, **OpsManager**, **AppDB**: Improves stability of 
  deployments during TLS rotations. In scenarios where the StatefulSet of the deployment 
  was reconciling and a TLS rotation happened, the deployment would reach a broken state. 
  Deployments will now store the previous TLS certificate alongside the new one.

.. _ent-op-1.28.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.28 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.28.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.28.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-10-02*

New Features
```````````````

- (Public Preview) **MongoDB** resource: Introduces support for sharded clusters 
  across |multi-clusters| by setting :setting:`spec.topology=MultiCluster <spec.topology>` 
  when creating a MongoDB resource with ``spec.type=ShardedCluster``. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`multi-cluster-sharded-cluster`.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Adds support for automated 
  expansion of storage by increasing the capacity of |k8s| 
  ``persistentVolumeClaims``. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-resize-storage`.

  - Automated expansion of ``persistentVolumeClaims`` is only supported if the 
    underlying |k8s| ``storageClass`` supports |k8s| ``persistentVolume`` expansion.
    Ensure your ``storageClass`` supports in-place expansion without data loss.

- **OpsManager** resource: Introduces support for Ops Manager 8.0.0.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Introduces support for MongoDB 8.0.0.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** application database resources: Changes
  the default behaviour of :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` for the database:
  
  - When you upgrade your MongoDB version, the |k8s-op-short| sets :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` 
    to the version you are upgrading from to give you the option to downgrade if necessary.

  - If you want the feature compatibility version to match the new MongoDB version, 
    you must manually set ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to either the new MongoDB 
    version, or ``AlwaysMatchVersion``.

- Updates :ref:`container images <k8s-container-images>` to use 
  `Red Hat UBI 9 <https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers>`__ as the base image, 
  except ``mongodb-enterprise-database-ubi``, which remains on ``UBI8`` to support workloads 
  running on MongoDB 6.0.4 and earlier. 
  
  - The UBI8 image is only used for the default non-static architecture. For a full UBI9 setup, 
    use static containers. To learn more, see :ref:`static-containers`.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Fixes a bug where 
  the ``init`` container wasn't getting the default security context, which was then 
  flagged by security policies.

- **MongoDBMultiCluster** resource: Fixes a bug where resource validations weren't 
  performed as part of the reconcile loop.

.. _ent-op-1.27.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.27 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.27.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.27.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-08-27*

New Features
```````````````

- **MongoDB** resource: Adds support for enabling log rotation for MongoDB
  processes, monitoring agent, and backup agent. To learn more, see :ref:`mongodb-crd-logging-specification`.

  Use the following settings to configure logs rotation per component:

  - :setting:`spec.agent.mongod.logRotate` for the mongoDB processes.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.mongod.auditlogRotate` for the mongoDB processes audit logs.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.backupAgent.logRotate` for the backup agent.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.monitoringAgent.logRotate` for the monitoring agent.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.readinessProbe.environmentVariables` for the environment variables
    the readiness probe runs with. This setting also applies to settings
    related to the logs rotation. To learn more about the supported environment
    settings, see `Readiness Probe <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/logging.md#readinessprobe/>`__.

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.<component>.logRotate` for the Application Database.

  For sharded clusters, the |k8s-op-short| supports configuring log rotation
  only under the ``spec.Agent`` settings, and not per process type, such as
  ``mongos`` or ``configsrv``.

- **OpsManager** resource: Adds support for replacing the :ref:`logback.xml configuration file <onprem-own-logs>`,
  which configures general logging settings, such as log rotation for |onprem|
  and |onprem| backups.

  Use the following settings:
  
  - :setting:`spec.logging.logBackAccessRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    access configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. Name the ConfigMap's access key
    ``logback-access.xml``. This file configures access to the logging configuration
    file for |onprem|.
  - :setting:`spec.logging.logBackRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. This file
    configures the general logging behavior for |onprem|,
    including log rotation policies, log levels, and other logging parameters.
    Name the ConfigMap's access key ``logback.xml``.
  - :setting:`spec.backup.logging.logBackAccessRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    access configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. Name the ConfigMap's access key
    ``logback-access.xml``. This file configures access to the logging configuration
    file for |onprem| backups.
  - :setting:`spec.backup.logging.logBackRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. This file
    configures the general logging behavior for |onprem| backups,
    including log rotation policies, log levels, and other logging parameters.
    Name the ConfigMap's access key ``logback.xml``.

Deprecations
```````````````

- The ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate`` setting for the Application Database has been deprecated.
  Use :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.mongod.logRotate <spec.applicationDatabase.agent.<component>.logRotate>` instead.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **Agent** launcher: Fixes an issue where, under some resync scenarios,
  the journal data in ``/journal`` may have been corrupted. The Agent now ensures
  that no conflicting journal data exist and prioritizes the data from ``/data/journal``.
  To deactivate this behavior, set the environment variable ``MDB_CLEAN_JOURNAL``
  in the |k8s-op-short| to any value other than 1.

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMulti** resources: Fixes an issue that ensures
  that external domains are used in the ``connectionString``, if you configure it.

- **MongoDB** resource: Removes panic response if you provide a Horizon
  configuration that is shorter than the number of members. The |k8s-op-short| now
  issues a descriptive error in the status of the MongoDB resource in such cases.

- **MongoDB** resource: Fixes an issue where, when creating a resource in a new
  project named as a prefix of another project would fail, preventing the
  MongoDB resource from being created.

.. _ent-op-1.26.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.26 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.26.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.26.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-06-21*

New Features
```````````````

- Improves CPU utilization and vertical scaling of the |k8s-op-short| and
  achieves faster reconciliation of all managed resources by allowing you
  to control the number of reconciliations the |k8s-op-short| can perform
  in parallel.

  You can set ``MDB_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`` for the |k8s-op-short| deployment
  or ``operator.maxConcurrentReconciles`` in the |k8s-op-short| installation
  Helm chart. If not provided, the default value is 1. The ability to control
  the number of reconciliations might lead to an increased load on the |onprem|
  and the |k8s| API server in the same time window. Observe the |k8s-op-short|
  resource usage and adjust ``operator.resources.requests`` and
  ``operator.resources.limits`` if needed. To learn more,
  see :k8sdocs:`Resource Management for Pods and Containers </concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/>`
  in the |k8s| documentation.

- Adds support for OpenShift 4.15. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-compatibility`.

Helm Chart Installation Changes
```````````````````````````````

- Adds an ``operator.maxConcurrentReconciles`` parameter that allows
  you to control the number of reconciliations the |k8s-op-short| can
  perform in parallel. The default value is 1.
- Adds the :ref:`operator.webhook.installClusterRole
  <webhook-install-cluster-role>` parameter that
  controls whether to install the cluster role allowing the |k8s-op-short|
  to configure admission webhooks. Set this parameter to ``false`` when
  the cluster roles aren't allowed. The default value is ``true``.

Bug Fixes
```````````

* **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where configuring a MongoDB resource
  with multiple entries in :setting:`spec.agent.startupOptions` would cause
  additional unnecessary reconciliation of the underlying ``StatefulSet``.
* **MongoDB, MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Fixes a bug where
  the |k8s-op-short| wouldn't watch for changes in the X-509 certificates
  configured for {+mdbagent+} authentication.
* **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where boolean flags passed to
  the {+mdbagent+} can't be set to ``false`` if their default value is ``true``.

.. _ent-op-1.25.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.25 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.25.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.25.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-04-30*

Breaking Change
`````````````````

- **MongoDBOpsManager** resource. The |k8s-op-short| no longer supports
  |onprem| 5.0. Upgrade to a later version of |onprem|. While |onprem| 5.0
  may continue to work with the |k8s-op-short|, MongoDB won't test the
  |k8s-op-short| against |onprem| 5.0.

New Features
`````````````

- **MongoDBOpsManager** resource: Adds support for deploying the |application|
  on multiple |k8s| clusters. To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-om-multi-cluster`.
- (Public Preview) **MongoDB**, **OpsManager** resources: Introduces
  opt-in :ref:`static-containers` for all types of deployments.

  - In this release, use static containers only for testing purposes.
    Static containers might become the default in a later release.
  - To activate static containers mode, set the ``MDB_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE``
    environment variable at the |k8s-op-short| level to ``static``.
    Alternatively, annotate a specific ``MongoDB`` or ``OpsManager``
    custom resource with ``mongodb.com/v1.architecture: "static"``.
  - The |k8s-op-short| supports seamless migration between the static and
    non-static architectures. To learn more, see:

    - :ref:`Use Static Containers <static-containers>`
    - :ref:`Migrate to Static Containers <migrate-to-static-containers>`

- **OpsManager** resource: Adds the ``spec.internalConnectivity`` field
  to allow overrides for the service used by the |k8s-op-short| to ensure
  internal connectivity to the ``OpsManager`` resource-hosting Pods.

- **MongoDB** resource: You can recover a resource due to a broken
  Automation configuration in sharded clusters. In previous releases,
  you could recover other types of resources but not sharded clusters.
  To learn more, see :ref:`troubleshooting-automatic-recovery`.

- **MongoDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: These resources now
  allow you to add placeholders in external services.

  - You can define |k8s-annotations| for external services managed by the |k8s-op-short|
    that contain placeholders which will be automatically replaced by the proper values.
    Previously, the |k8s-op-short| configured the same annotations for all
    external services created for each Pod. Starting with this release,
    you can add placeholders so that the |k8s-op-short| can customize
    annotations in each service with values that are relevant and unique
    for each particular Pod. To learn more, see:

    - ``MongoDB`` resource: :setting:`spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations`
    - ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` resource :ref:`spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations <multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice-annotations>`

- The |kubectl-mongodb|: Allows you to print build information when
  using the plugin.
- The ``setup`` command of the |kubectl-mongodb|: Adds the
  :ref:`registry.imagePullSecrets <imagePullSecrets>` setting.
  If specified, created service accounts reference the specified secret on
  the ``imagePullSecrets`` field.
- Improves handling of configurations when the |k8s-op-short| watches more
  than one namespace, and when you install the |k8s-op-short| in a namespace
  that differs from the namespace in which the |k8s-op-short| watches resources.

- Optimizes setting up roles and permissions in member |k8s| clusters
  using a single service account per |k8s| cluster with correctly configured
  roles and role bindings (no cluster roles are necessary) for each watched
  namespace.

- Extends the existing event-based reconciliation process by a time-based
  reconciliation that is triggered every 24 hours. This ensures that all
  {+monitoring-agent+}s are always upgraded in a timely manner.

- OpenShift and OLM Operator: Removes the requirement for cluster-wide
  permissions. Previously, the |k8s-op-short| needed these permissions to
  configure admission webhooks. Starting with this release, webhooks are
  automatically configured by `OLM <https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-tasks/adding-admission-and-conversion-webhooks/>`__.

- Adds an optional ``MDB_WEBHOOK_REGISTER_CONFIGURATION`` environment
  variable for the |k8s-op-short|. The variable controls whether the |k8s-op-short|
  should perform automatic admission webhook configuration. The default is ``true``.
  The variable is set to ``false`` for OLM and OpenShift deployments.

Helm Chart Installation Changes
`````````````````````````````````

- Changes the default ``agent.version`` to ``107.0.0.8502-1``. This changes
  the default Agent used in |k8s-op-short| deployments that you install using
  a Helm chart.

- Adds the ``operator.additionalArguments`` variable with the default of
  ``[]`` to allow you to pass additional arguments for the |k8s-op-short| binary.
- Adds the ``operator.createResourcesServiceAccountsAndRoles`` variable
  with the default of ``true`` to control whether to install roles and
  service accounts for ``MongoDB`` and ``OpsManager`` resources. When you
  use the |kubectl-mongodb| to configure the |k8s-op-short| for
  a multi-|k8s| cluster deployment, the plugin installs all necessary
  roles and service accounts. Therefore, to avoid clashes, in some cases
  don't install those roles using the |k8s-op-short| Helm chart.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDBMultiCluster** resource: Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short|
  reported that ``spec.externalAccess.externalDomain`` and
  ``spec.clusterSpecList[*].externalAccess.externalDomains`` fields were
  required even though they weren't used. The |k8s-op-short| prematurely
  triggered a validation for these fields in cases where the custom resources
  contained a defined ``spec.externalAccess`` structure. Starting with this
  release, the |k8s-op-short| checks for uniqueness of external domains only
  when you define the external domains in ``spec.externalAccess.externalDomain``
  or ``spec.clusterSpecList[*].externalAccess.externalDomains`` settings.

- **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where upon deleting a ``MongoDB`` resource,
  the ``controlledFeature`` policies remained set on the related |onprem| or
  |cloud-short| instance, making cleanup in the UI impossible in the case
  of losing the |k8s-op-short|.

- **OpsManager** resource: Fixes an issue where the ``admin-key`` secret
  was deleted when you removed the ``OpsManager`` custom resource.
  Fixing the ``admin-key`` secret deletion enables easier re-installation of |onprem|.

- **MongoDB Readiness Probe**: Fixes a misleading error message for the
  readiness probe: ``"... kubelet  Readiness probe failed:..."``. This affects
  all MongoDB deployments.

- **Operator**: Fixes cases where in some instances, while communicating with
  the ``OpsManager`` custom resource, the |k8s-op-short| skipped TLS verification,
  even if you enabled TLS.

Improvements
```````````````

- **Kubectl plugin**: The released |kubectl-mongodb| binaries are now signed, and the
  signatures are published with the `release assets <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/releases>`__.
  The public key is available at `this address <https://cosign.mongodb.com/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem>`__.
  The released |kubectl-mongodb| binaries are also notarized for MacOS.

- **Released Images signed**: All container images published for the |k8s-op-short|
  are cryptographically signed. This is visible in the MongoDB |quay| registry.
  You can verify the signatures using the MongoDB public key. Released images
  are available at `this address <https://cosign.mongodb.com/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem>`__.

|k8s-op-full| 1.23.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2023-11-13*

Warnings and Breaking Changes
`````````````````````````````

- Aligns the component image version numbers with the |k8s-op-short| release tag so 
  it's clear which images go with which version of the |k8s-op-short|. 
  This affects the following images:

  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-database-ubi``
  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-init-database-ubi``
  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-init-appdb-ubi``
  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-init-ops-manager-ubi``

  To learn more, see :ref:`meko-op-install-settings-kubectl-oc` 
  and :ref:`meko-op-install-settings-helm`.

- Replaces ``spec.exposedExternally`` (deprecated in |k8s-op-short| 1.19) with 
  :setting:`spec.externalAccess`.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Fixes an issue with scaling a replica set in a |multi-cluster| when a member 
  cluster has lost connectivity. The fix addresses both the manual and automated 
  recovery procedures.
- Fixes an issue where changing the names of the Automation Agent and MongoDB 
  audit logs prevented them from being sent to the |k8s| Pod logs. There are no 
  restrictions on the file names of MongoDB audit logs as of |k8s-op-short| 1.22.
- Allows the following new log types from the ``mongodb-enterprise-database`` 
  container to stream directly to |k8s| logs:

  - ``agent-launcher-script``
  - ``monitoring-agent``
  - ``backup-agent``

- Fixes an issue that prevented storing the ``MongoDBUser`` resource in the 
  namespace set in ``spec.mongodbResourceRef.namespace``.

.. _ent-op-1.22.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.22 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.22.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.22.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2023-09-21*

Breaking Changes
````````````````

The |k8s-op-short| no longer uses the ``Reconciling`` state for all custom resources.
In most cases this state has been replaced with ``Pending`` and a corresponding
message. If you use monitoring tools with the custom MongoDB resources deployed
with the |k8s-op-short|, you might need to adjust your dashboards and alerting rules
to use the ``Pending`` state name.

MongoDBOpsManager Resource
``````````````````````````

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Adds support for configuring :opsmgr:`logRotate </reference/cluster-configuration/#mongodb-instances>`
  on the {+mdbagent+} for the {+appdb+} by adding the following new fields
  to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.numTotal``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.numUncompressed``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.percentOfDiskspace``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.sizeThresholdMB``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.timeThresholdHrs``

- You can now configure the :manual:`systemLog </reference/configuration-options/#systemlog-options>`
  to send logs to a custom location other than the default ``/var/log/mongodb-mms-automation`` directory using the following new fields
  in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.path`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.logAppend`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.destination`

- Improves handling of {+appdb+} clusters in |multi-clusters|.
  
  In the last release, to scale down processes, the |k8s-op-short| required
  a connection to the |k8s| cluster. This could block the reconciliation
  process due to a full-cluster outage.

  In this release, the |k8s-op-short| successfully manages the remaining
  healthy clusters as long as they have a majority of votes to elect a primary.
  The |k8s-op-short| doesn't remove associated processes from the automation
  configuration and replica set configuration. The |k8s-op-short| deletes
  these processes only if you delete the corresponding cluster from
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList <spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList>`
  or change the number of the cluster members to zero. When the |k8s-op-short|
  deletes these processes, it scales down the replica set by removing
  processes tied to that cluster one at a time.

``MongoDB`` Resource
````````````````````

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Adds an automatic recovery mechanism for ``MongoDB``
  resources when a custom resource remains in a ``Pending`` 
  or ``Failed`` state for a longer period of time. In addition, 
  introduces the following environment variables:

  - :ref:`MDB_AUTOMATIC_RECOVERY_ENABLE <mdb-automatic-recovery-enable>`
  - :ref:`MDB_AUTOMATIC_RECOVERY_BACKOFF_TIME_S <mdb-automatic-backoff-time-s>`

  To learn more, see :ref:`troubleshooting-automatic-recovery`.

- Allows you to route the audit logs for the ``MongoDB`` resource to the |k8s|
  Pod logs. Ensure that you write the ``MongoDB`` resource's audit logs
  to the ``/var/log/mongodb-mms-automation/mongodb-audit.log`` file.
  The Pod hosting the resource monitors this file and appends its content
  to its |k8s| logs.
  
  To send audit logs to the |k8s| Pod logs, use the following example
  configuration in the ``MongoDB`` resource:

  .. code-block:: yaml
  
     spec:
       additionalMongodConfig:
         auditLog:
           destination: file
           format: JSON
           path: /var/log/mongodb-mms-automation/mongodb-audit.log
  
  The |k8s-op-short| tags audit log entries with the ``mongodb-audit`` key
  in the Pod logs. 

  To extract audit log entries, use a command similar to the following example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     kubectl logs -c mongodb-enterprise-database replica-set-0 | \
     jq -r 'select(.logType == "mongodb-audit") | .contents'

Bug Fixes
++++++++++

Fixes an issue where you couldn't set the :setting:`spec.backup.autoTerminateOnDeletion`
setting to ``true`` for sharded clusters. This setting controls whether the
|k8s-op-short| stops and terminates the backup when you delete a MongoDB
resource. If omitted, the default value is ``false``.

.. _ent-op-1.21.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.21 Series

*Released 2023-08-25*

Breaking Changes
````````````````

- Renames the environment variable ``CURRENT_NAMESPACE`` to ``NAMESPACE``. This variable 
  tracks the namespace of the |k8s-op-short|. If you've set this variable by editing the 
  |k8s-mdbrscs|, update ``CURRENT_NAMESPACE`` to ``NAMESPACE`` while

- Supports configuring backups of the {+appdb+} and MongoDB for the |mongodb-multi|.
- Adds documentation for configuring a |mongodb-multis| deployment in a GitOps environment. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`multi-cluster-gitops`.
- Adds ``MetadataWrapper``, a label and annotations wrapper, to the |k8s-mdbrsc|, 
  |mongodb-multi| and ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources. The wrapper supports 
  overriding ``metadata.Labels`` and ``metadata.Annotations``.

Breaking Changes and Deprecations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The ``appdb-ca`` is not automatically added to the JVM trust store in |onprem|. The 
  ``appdb-ca`` is the |certauth| saved in the ConfigMap specified in 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.security.tls.ca`. This impacts you if:

  - You use the same custom certificate for the ``appdb-ca`` and your |s3| snapshot store.
  - You use a version of |k8s-op-short| earlier than 1.17.0 or you've mounted your own 
    trust store to |onprem|.
  
  If you need to use the same custom certificate for ``appdb-ca`` and the |s3| snapshot 
  store, specify the CA with :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs`.

- Deprecates the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificate` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificate` settings. Use 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificateSecretRefs` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs` instead.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue that prevented setting an arbitrary port number for 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity.port` when using the ``LoadBalancer`` service type 
  to expose |onprem| externally.
- Fixes an issue that caused |onprem| to reject certificates by enabling the |k8s-op-short| 
  to import the ``appdb-ca``, which is a bundle of CAs, into the |onprem| JVM trust store.

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Supports configuring the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource with a highly available 
  {+appdb+} across multiple |k8s| clusters by adding the following new fields
  to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList`
  
  The default value for the new optional :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` 
  field is ``singleCluster``, and it is used if you omit the value. To upgrade to |k8s-op-short| 
  1.21, you don't need to update your ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources. This makes the addition 
  of the :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` setting backward-compatible with 
  single |k8s| cluster deployments of the {+appdb+}. To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-om-container` and 
  the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`.
- Allows you to add a list of custom certificates for backups in the |s3| snapshot store 
  using the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificateSecretRefs` fields in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource.
