If |service| identifies that your cluster's primary node exceeds write-blocking
:ref:`policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`, |service| blocks writes
to the cluster until disk utilization falls below the unblocking thresholds.
When MongoDB receives writes to a cluster, it flushes data to disk in bulk,
which can result in large jumps in disk utilization.
Running out of disk space on the primary node may result in cluster downtime,
especially if disk exhaustion cascades through all replica set nodes.

To prevent this scenario, when |service| observes that the cluster's
primary node disk exceeds critical write-blocking :ref:`policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`,
|service| blocks writes to the cluster's primary node. |service| continues
to blocks writes until disk utilization falls below the unblocking thresholds.

By activating write-blocking behavior on the primary node, |service|:

- Prevents cluster unavailability due to disk exhaustion on the primary node.
- Allows clusters operating close to maximum storage utilization to retain
  read availability in cases of sudden spikes in write volume.

Write-Blocking and Intelligent Workload Management
--------------------------------------------------

Cluster write-blocking behavior is part of Intelligent Workload Management (IWM)
in |service-fullname|. :abbr:`IWM (Intelligent Workload Management)` is
a dynamic resource manager that enables real-time workload monitoring and
automated safeguards to maintain high availability under load.

.. _block-writes-considerations:

Write-Blocking Considerations
------------------------------

Write-blocking behavior has the following considerations:

- |service| currently blocks writes to the primary node on replica sets
  (non-sharded clusters) on dedicated clusters running MongoDB 8.0+.

- |service| doesn't block writes on {+Free-clusters+} and {+Flex-clusters+}.

- |service| monitors disk utilization on the primary node only.
- |service| doesn't monitor disk utilization on secondary, read-only, search,
  or analytics nodes.

.. _howitworks-block-writes:

How |service| Blocks Writes to the Primary Node
-----------------------------------------------

To block writes, |service| uses the following process:

- When the primary node's free disk space exceeds write-blocking
  :ref:`policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`, |service| blocks
  writes to the primary node.

  Even when the MongoDB database is not accepting writes, the cluster
  remains available for reads. You can read from the primary and secondary
  nodes as normal.

- When |service| blocks writes, it sends the following alert: :alert:`Writes have
  been blocked on your cluster due to critically low disk space <Writes have been blocked on your cluster due to critically low disk space>`.
  The :ref:`activity feed <project-activity-feed>` reflects this alert.

  The top of the cluster page in the {+atlas-ui+} shows a banner that states:
  ``"To maintain read availability during critically high disk utilization,
  Atlas has blocked writes to the following clusters: <clusterName>.
  Increase disk space or enable storage auto-scaling to unblock writes."``

- When free disk space increases 50% over the blocking threshold,
  |service| unblocks writes to the primary node. When |service| unblocks
  writes, you receive this alert: :alert:`Writes have been unblocked on your cluster <Writes have been unblocked on your cluster>`.

  The :ref:`activity feed <project-activity-feed>` then reflects this alert. No further action is needed.
  To avoid write-blocking behavior in the future, consider
  :ref:`increasing cluster storage <write-blocking-prevention>`.

- If you manually increase the disk size of the cluster or enable
  storage auto-scaling, |service| automatically adjusts the write-blocking
  thresholds based on the new disk size.

.. _write-blocking-prevention:

Write-Blocking Prevention
--------------------------

To prevent write-blocking behavior from occurring and bring the cluster
below the |service| write-blocking :ref:`policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`,
we recommend that you:

- Enable :ref:`storage auto-scaling <howitworks-scale-cluster-storage>`,
  which automatically scales your cluster storage when disk utilization
  exceeds 90% and ensures consistent workload availability and performance.

  To enable storage auto-scaling in the {+atlas-ui+}, navigate to
  the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` menu and check the :guilabel:`Storage Scaling` 
  checkbox in the :guilabel:`Auto-scale` section.

  - For all new clusters that you create in the {+atlas-ui+},
    |service| enables storage auto-scaling by default.
  - If you :oas-bump-atlas-op:`create clusters with the API <creategroupcluster>`,
    cluster auto-scaling isn't selected by default and you must explicitly enable it,
    using the options in the ``autoScaling`` object of the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Update One Cluster in One Project <updategroupcluster>` endpoint.

- If you choose to opt out of storage auto-scaling and your disk utilization
  is close to 90%, you can release existing disk space before |service|
  activates write-blocking behavior on your cluster:

  - Remove unused data to free up disk space. :ref:`Delete the indexes <drop-an-index>`,
    or :ref:`delete collections or individual documents <delete-documents-atlas-ui>`.
  - Use the :dbcommand:`autoCompact` command on each dedicated cluster node
    to compact disk space.

.. _write-blocking-thresholds:

Write-Blocking Policy Threshold Parameters
------------------------------------------

|service| uses the following  write-blocking thresholds to accommodate
disk utilization scenarios with high write volume:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 15 85

   * - **Disk size < 20 GB** 
     - |service| blocks writes when free disk space drops below 600 MB.
       |service| unblocks writes when disk space exceeds 900 MB.
   * - **Disk size < 1.25 TB** 
     - |service| blocks writes when free disk space drops below 4% of
       total disk size. |service| unblocks writes when disk space
       exceeds 6% of total disk size.
   * - **Disk size ≥ 1.25 TB**
     - |service| blocks writes when free disk space drops below 50 GB.
       |service| unblocks writes when free disk space exceeds 75 GB.

The thresholds are not configurable. If the disk size increases due to
auto-scaling, or if you manually increase the disk size, |service|
automatically adjusts the thresholds based on cluster's disk size.

Once write-blocking behavior is active in your cluster, you:

- Can increase cluster storage manually from the :ref:`Edit Cluster <scale-cluster>`
  page or enable storage auto-scaling in the {+atlas-ui+} to avoid any
  future write-blocking behavior.
- Cannot delete indexes or collections because |service| blocks operations
  that require writing to the database. To delete indexes and collections,
  increase the cluster storage.

.. _write-blocking-and-autoscaling:

Write-Blocking and Storage Auto-Scaling
-----------------------------------------------

|service| blocks writes when free disk space on the primary node reaches
approximately 96% of total disk size, with the caveats for small and large
disks noted in the write-blocking :ref:`policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`.

By comparison, auto-scaling triggers when disk utilization reaches 90%
of total disk size. This means that:

- If you enable auto-scaling, your cluster has the opportunity to scale up
  before write-blocking behavior activates.
- If you disable auto-scaling, you must monitor disk utilization and take
  action to prevent write-blocking behavior from activating.

.. _write-blocking-troubleshooting:

Write-Blocking Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------

When |service| blocks writes to the cluster, the following actions occur:

- The top of the cluster page in the {+atlas-ui+} shows a banner indicating
  that writes have been blocked. See :ref:`howitworks-block-writes`.

- |service| issues :ref:`write-blocking alerts <alert-conditions-write-blocking>`
  that you can resolve by increasing cluster storage. See also :ref:`disk-space-used`.

- The project's :ref:`Activity Feed <view-activity-feed>` reflects these
  alerts.

- |service| logs return a ``MongoServerError`` similar to the following: ``User writes blocked, reason: DiskUseThresholdExceeded``.

- The ``userWriteBlockMode`` parameter in :manual:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus/>`
  command reflects the cluster's current write-blocking status.

.. _unblocking-writes:

Unblocking Writes
----------------------

|service| unblocks writes when free disk space increases 50% over
the blocking threshold. The extra buffer to unblock writes ensures that:

- |service| doesn't enable and disable write-blocking behavior in quick succession.
- The cluster remains in a good state as it begins accepting writes again.

For the exact parameters, see :ref:`write-blocking policy thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`.
