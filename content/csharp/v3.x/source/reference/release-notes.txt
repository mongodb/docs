.. _csharp-version-3.6:

What's New in 3.6
-----------------

The 3.6 driver release includes the following new features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds the ``CreateVectorSearchIndexModel`` class, a strongly typed API for
  creating {+vector-search+} indexes. To learn more about this API, see
  :ref:`csharp-atlas-vector-search`.

- Adds the ``CreateAutoEmbeddingVectorSearchIndexModel`` index model to
  automatically generate vector embeddings for text fields. To learn more, see
  the :ref:`csharp-atlas-search-indexes` guide.

- Adds a backward compatibility mode for the ``TimeOnly`` type to correctly read
  documents serialized by versions of the driver prior to v3.0.

- Uses standard RID paths in ``MongoDB.Driver.Encryption`` packaging.

- Adds support for the static ``String.Compare()`` method in LINQ queries.

- Adds support for using ``Dictionary`` fields as ``IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>`` types.

- Adds support for the ``Dictionary`` ``Keys`` and ``Values`` properties in LINQ queries.

- Adds a ``Decimal128`` constructor overload for ``byte`` and ``short`` types to support
  compatibility with .NET 10.

- Adds support for C# 14 changes that cause some method overloads to bind to
  ``MemoryExtensions`` methods instead of ``Enumerable`` methods.

- Maps ``MemoryExtensions.Contains()`` and ``MemoryExtensions.SequenceEqual()`` methods that have a null
  comparer to ``Enumerable`` methods that don't have a comparer parameter.

- Improves serialization performance and reduces memory allocations through the
  following improvements:

  - Removes ``GetBitArray()`` allocations in ``BsonClassMapSerializer.DeserializeClass()``.

  - Uses ``KeyValuePairSerializer`` consistently for ``KeyValuePair``.

  - Avoids ``RentedBuffer`` boxing in the ``DisposableSegment`` class.

  - Avoids allocations for ``BsonBinaryReaderContext`` and ``BsonBinaryWriterContext``.

  - Switches to a ``for`` loop in ``BsonClassMapSerializer.SerializeClass()`` to reduce
    allocations.

- Optimizes LINQ translation for the ``First()`` and ``FirstOrDefault()`` methods with
  predicates.

- Resolves an issue where the {+driver-short+} stopped working with Unity since v3.2.0.

- Fixes an issue with filtering by derived types.

.. _csharp-version-3.5:

What's New in 3.5
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v3.5

   {+driver-long+} 3.5 contains breaking changes. See :ref:`<csharp-breaking-changes-v3.5>`
   for more information.

The 3.5 driver release includes the following new features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds experimental support for Queryable Encryption prefix, suffix, and substring queries.
  These features are unstable, and their security is not guaranteed until they're
  generally available (GA). Use them in experimental workloads only.
  To learn more about QE, see :ref:`In-Use Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

- Adds the `CsfleSchemaBuilder
  <{+api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver.Encryption/MongoDB.Driver.Encryption.CsfleSchemaBuilder.html>`__
  class to the ``MongoDB.Driver.Encryption`` package. You can use this class to create
  JSON schemas for Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE), as shown in the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     var builder = CsfleSchemaBuilder.Create(schemaBuilder =>
     {
         schemaBuilder.Encrypt<Patient>(_collectionNamespace, builder =>
         {
             builder
                .EncryptMetadata(keyId: _keyId)
                .Property(p => p.MedicalRecords, BsonType.Array,
                    EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Random)
                .Property("bloodType", BsonType.String,
                    algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Random)
                .Property(p => p.Ssn, BsonType.Int32,
                    EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Deterministic)
                .Property(p => p.Insurance, innerBuilder =>
                {
                    innerBuilder
                        .Property(i => i.PolicyNumber, BsonType.Int32,
                            EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Deterministic);
                })
                .PatternProperty("_PIIString$", BsonType.String, EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Deterministic)
                .PatternProperty("_PIIArray$", BsonType.Array, EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Random)
                .PatternProperty(p => p.Insurance, innerBuilder =>
                {
                    innerBuilder
                        .PatternProperty("_PIIString$", BsonType.String,
                            EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Deterministic)
                        .PatternProperty("_PIINumber$", BsonType.Int32,
                            algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithm.AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512_Deterministic);
                });
         });
     });

    var schema = builder.Build();

  To learn more about CSFLE, see :ref:`In-Use Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

- Adds the following LINQ methods:

  - ``Median()``: Computes the median of a sequence of values.
  - ``Percentile()``: Computes multiple percentile of a sequence of values.

  You can use these methods to perform calculations as part of the ``$group`` and
  ``$setWindowFields`` aggregation stages.

- Adds new `Ascending() <{+api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.SortDefinitionBuilder-1.Ascending.html#MongoDB_Driver_SortDefinitionBuilder_1_Ascending>`__
  and `Descending() <{+api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.SortDefinitionBuilder-1.Descending.html#MongoDB_Driver_SortDefinitionBuilder_1_Descending>`__
  method overloads to the ``SortDefinitionBuilder`` class. You can use these methods to
  sort elements by value when using the ``$sort`` update operator.

- Adds support for using a SOCKS5 proxy to connect to MongoDB. You can specify SOCKS5
  connection settings in the connection string or by using the
  `MongoClientSettings.Socks5ProxySettings
  <{+api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.MongoClientSettings.Socks5ProxySettings.html#MongoDB_Driver_MongoClientSettings_Socks5ProxySettings>`__
  property.

- Adds support for the ``IAsyncEnumerable<T>`` interface in cursors and LINQ. You can
  use ``await foreach`` syntax to asynchronously iterate over query results.

- Adds big-endian support to the ``BinaryVectorReader`` and ``BinaryVectorWriter``
  classes.

- Changes internal subsystems in preparation for supporting client-side operations timeout
  (CSOT) in an upcoming release. We expect these changes to be be backward-compatible and
  not to affect existing driver behavior. Please contact MongoDB if you experience any of
  the following issues:
  
  - Operations timing out unexpectedly or not timing out when expected
  - Unusual delays or hangs in database calls
  - Behavior differences when cancelling commands
  
  For the best ways to find support, see the :ref:`Issues & Help <csharp-issues-help>` page.
  Please provide driver logs and a reproduction if possible.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.5 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v3.5.0>` on GitHub.

- Adds the ``GeoNear()`` aggregation builder method to construct a
  ``$geoNear`` aggregation stage. To view examples, see the
  :manual:`$geoNear </reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/#examples>`
  reference in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- Supports casting from an interface to a type that implements that
  interface in LINQ queries.

- Supports the ``Dictionary(IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>>
  collection)`` constructor in LINQ.

- Adds the following options for {+search+} queries:

  - ``MatchCriteria`` in ``SearchTextOptions`` to set match criteria for
    terms passed to the ``Text()`` operator method.

  - ``Synonyms`` in ``SearchPhraseOptions`` to set the name of the
    synonym mapping definition when using the ``Phrase()`` operator
    method.

  To learn more about performing {+search+} queries, see
  the :ref:`csharp-atlas-search` guide.

- Supports LINQ queries after casting ``IQueryable<Derived>`` objects to
  ``IQueryable<Base>``.

- Corrects {+search+} operator behavior to use configured serializers
  instead of predefined serializers. To use the previous
  behavior, set the following option: 

  .. code-block:: csharp

     SearchDefinition.UseConfiguredSerializers(false);

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.4 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v3.4.0>` on GitHub.

.. _csharp-version-3.2:

What's New in 3.2
-----------------

The 3.2 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds a new ``ObjectSerializerAllowedTypesConvention`` convention that
  allows you to specify which types are allowed to be serialized and
  deserialized by the object serializer. To learn more about conventions,
  see the :ref:`csharp-conventions` guide.

- Adds a new constructor for the ``EnumRepresentationConvention`` class that
  allows you use the ``topLevelOnly`` parameter to specify whether the
  convention applies to only enum properties or to all properties that include
  collections of enums.

  You can instantiate the ``EnumRepresentationConvention`` class by using the new
  constructor as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     EnumRepresentationConvention(BsonType representation, bool topLevelOnly);

- Optimizes client-side projections to retrieve only the required fields from
  the server, rather than retrieving all fields and then filtering them.

- Adds the following classes to support binary vector representations in 
  {+vector-search+}:

  - ``BinaryVectorFloat32``
  - ``BinaryVectorInt8``
  - ``BinaryVectorPackedBit``

  To learn more about {+vector-search+} with the {+driver-short+}, see the
  :ref:`csharp-atlas-vector-search` guide.

- Adds the ``DocumentFormat`` property to the ``DateOnlySerializer``.
  This property allows you to customize the way that the driver serializes
  ``DateOnly`` values. This release also adds the
  ``[BsonDateOnlyOptions()]`` attribute to customize serialization
  behavior for ``DateOnly`` values at the property level. To learn more,
  see the :ref:`csharp-poco-dateonly-attr` section of the POCOs guide.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.2 release notes

- Adds new default serializers for immutable collections in the
  `System.Collections.Immutable <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.immutable?view=net-8.0>`__
  namespace. The driver can now serialize ``ImmutableArray`` objects, and serialization
  for other immutable collections is more memory efficient.

- Adds the ``SearchIndexType`` type to support creation of {+vector-search+}
  indexes programmatically. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`csharp-atlas-search-indexes` guide.

- Adds support for the token field type and array field expressions with {+search+}
  builders for the ``equals`` operator. To learn more about using {+search+} with the
  {+driver-short+}, see :ref:`csharp-atlas-search`.

- Adds support for the following {+search+} queries:

  - Using the ``Equals()`` operator method on ``null`` and ``Guid`` values

  - Using the ``In()`` operator method on ``Guid`` values

  To learn more about these methods, see the
  :ref:`csharp-atlas-search-operators` section of the {+search+}
  guide.

- Adds support for sequential pagination in {+search+}.

- Adds support for valid SRV hostnames with fewer than 3 parts.

- Adds support for the ``Exists``, ``IsMissing``, and ``IsNullOrMissing`` methods
  in MongoDB Query API filters.

- Adds support for Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) vector search. To learn more about ENN
  Vector Search, see :atlas:`Run Vector Search Queries </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage>`
  in the {+search+} documentation.

- Adds a sort option for update and replace operations. This change
  allows you to set a sort order if multiple documents match your
  filter when attempting to update or replace a single document. To learn more,
  see the :ref:`csharp-update-one` and :ref:`csharp-update-many` guides.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.1 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v3.1.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-3.0:

What's New in 3.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v3.0

   The v3.0 driver contains breaking changes. See :ref:`<csharp-breaking-changes-v3>`
   for more information.

The 3.0 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds the ``MongoClientSettings.TranslationOptions`` connection option, which specifies
  options for translating LINQ queries to the Query API. See :ref:`csharp-connection-options`
  for more information.

- Adds support for the ``Half`` type, which represents a half-precision floating-point number.
  This type is available in .NET 5 and later.
  To learn more about the ``Half`` type, see the
  `Half Struct <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.half?view=net-8.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- The ``IMongoClient`` interface inherits the ``IDisposable`` interface. As a result, the
  ``MongoClient`` class and other classes that implement the ``IMongoClient`` interface
  contain a ``Disp- Adds support for the ``sort`` option to be passed to update commands.ose()`` method, which disposes of the client. This method does not
  dispose the underlying cluster and connections to the MongoDB server. To
  dispose of the cluster and connections, call the
  ``ClusterRegistry.UnregisterAndDisposeCluster()`` method. 
  The implementation of the ``IDisposable`` interface is experimental.
  
  To learn more about the ``IDisposable`` interface and use of the
  ``Dispose()`` method, see
  `Dispose Pattern <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/dispose-pattern>`__
  on MSDN.

- Adds support for the ``DateOnly`` type, which represents a date value with no
  time component. This type is available in .NET 6 and later. To learn more about the
  ``DateOnly`` type, see the
  `DateOnly Struct. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly?view=net-6.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- Adds support for the ``TimeOnly`` type, which represents a time value with no
  date component. This type is available in .NET 6 and later. To learn more about the
  ``TimeOnly`` type, see the
  `TimeOnly Struct. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timeonly?view=net-6.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- Adds support for implicit client-side projection when using the ``Find()`` method,
  the ``Select()`` method, or the ``Project()`` aggregation stage with the LINQ3 provider.
  In previous versions of the driver, you could perform client-side
  projection with the LINQ3 provider only after calling the ``ToEnumerable()`` or
  ``AsEnumerable()`` method.
  
  To learn how to enable and use client-side projection for a driver method, select the
  corresponding tab:

  .. tabs::

    .. tab:: Find() Method
