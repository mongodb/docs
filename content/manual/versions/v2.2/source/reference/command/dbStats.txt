.. dbcommand:: dbStats

   The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command returns storage statistics for a
   given database. The command takes the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dbStats: 1, scale: 1 }

   The value of the argument (e.g. ``1`` above) to ``dbStats`` does
   not affect the output of the command. The ``scale`` option allows
   you to specify how to scale byte values. For example, a ``scale``
   value of ``1024`` will display the results in kilobytes rather
   than in bytes.

   The time required to run the command depends on the total size of the database.
   Because the command has to touch all data files, the command may take several
   seconds to run.

   In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :method:`db.stats()` function provides
   a wrapper around this functionality. See the
   ":doc:`/reference/database-statistics`" document for an overview of
   this output.
