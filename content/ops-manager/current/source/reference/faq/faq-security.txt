This addresses common questions about |mms| and its security features.

How are |mms| releases scheduled to address JDK security updates?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintenance releases of all supported |mms| versions generally occur 
within one month of each JDK security release. |mms| maintenance 
releases include Java Critical Patch updates released within the last 
month.

MongoDB evaluates Java security issues that arise between maintenance 
releases on a case-by-case basis to determine if the issue requires
an accelerated maintenance release.
