.. note:: Write to a Synced Realm

   The syntax to write to a realm is the same for a local or
   a synced realm. However, there are additional considerations that determine
   whether the write operation in a synced realm is successful. For more 
   information, refer to :ref:`<kotlin-write-synced-realm>`.
