  Start a single 3.0 :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance with
  the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` pointing to the cluster's config servers and with
  the ``--upgrade`` option.

  To run a :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the ``--upgrade`` option, you
  can upgrade an existing :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to 3.0, or if you
  need to avoid reconfiguring a production :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance,
  you can use a new 3.0 :binary:`~bin.mongos` that can reach all the config
  servers.

  The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
  during the upgrade process. If the data files have many sharded
  collections or if failed processes hold stale locks,
  acquiring the locks for all collections can take
  seconds or minutes. Watch the log for progress updates.

  After a successful upgrade, restart the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
  If :binary:`~bin.mongos` fails to start, check the log for more

  If the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance loses its connection to the config
