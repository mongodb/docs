User Roles
==========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. index:: users; roles

.. only:: hosted

   If you use LDAP authentication for MMS, you must create LDAP groups for each
   available role described below then assign users to LDAP groups. There is no
   round trip synchronization between your LDAP server and MMS.

Available Roles
---------------

You can assign roles and privileges for a group or all groups within MMS.
Available roles within a group include:

- Read Only

- User Admin

- Monitoring Admin

- Backup Admin

- Owner

.. only:: hosted

   For the entire MMS deployment, available roles also include:

   - Global Read Only

   - Global User Admin

   - Global Monitoring Admin

   - Global Backup Admin

   - Global Owner.

   Each role provides privileges to access a combination of Core, Backup, and
   Monitoring functionality.

The Read Only user role is a good option for users who require visibility into
your MongoDB deployments, but who do not need access to edit group settings or
modify your MMS configuration, group settings, or modifying your MMS
configuration.
