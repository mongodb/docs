Provision Cloud Servers
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure so
that you can provision servers directly from the |mms| interface. When you
provision servers from |mms|, |mms| automatically installs the Automation
Agent to each server and is ready to deploy managed MongoDB instances on
them.

In general, provision one machine per :program:`mongod` instance. For
MongoDB deployment architectures, see :manual:`Replica Set Architectures
</core/replica-set-architectures>` and :manual:`Sharded Cluster
Architectures </core/sharded-cluster-architectures>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Prerequisites
-------------

You or an administrator must configure |mms| for integration with the
cloud service. You can do so when provisioning your first server or do so
ahead of time, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-cloud-server-settings`.

You must have at least one public key stored in your |mms|
:ref:`Provisioning Settings <provisioning-settings-page>`. You will use
the key when logging in to the provisioned servers.

AWS Considerations
------------------

If you use AWS and attempt to provision larger-sized AWS instances, be aware that
Amazon often has a limited number of larger instances in any given region,
which may prevent provisioning.

AWS accounts have restrictions that limit the number of instances you can
deploy. If you reach this limit, you must contact AWS support to raise
this limit.
