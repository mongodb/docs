   :description:  Learn about the limitations of Atlas Search in free and shared-tier MongoDB clusters.

The following limitations apply to |fts| on ``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5`` {+clusters+} only:

- .. include:: /includes/search-shared/fact-fts-shared-tier-limitations.rst
  
- When you reach the maximum number of indexes allowed for the {+cluster+} 
  tier, you can upgrade your {+cluster+} tier to create additional indexes. 
  If you upgrade your {+cluster+} tier, the indexes are rebuilt on the new 
  {+cluster+} tier, which triggers an 
  :ref:`initial sync <troubleshoot-initial-sync>`.

- An index definition JSON object cannot exceed 3KB in size.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-synonym-mapping-limitation.rst
 
- Index builds with more than 300 fields fail.

- Lucene's default clause limit of 1024 applies to any ``BooleanQuery``
  created for searches.

- The :ref:`synonyms collection <synonyms-coll-spec>` can't exceed
  10,000 documents.

- |fts| doesn't capture or display :ref:`query analytics for tracked 
  queries <fts-tracking-ref>`. 

- |fts| doesn't support encrypting |fts| indexes with 
  :ref:`encryption keys using Customer Key Management 
  <security-kms-encryption>` in the {+atlas-ui+}.
