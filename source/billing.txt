.. _billing-overview:

Billing settings are configured at the organization level and apply to
all projects within that organization. You can examine costs at the
organization level or the project level.

To configure the payment method and billing profile for an
organization, or to view the most recent and pending charges for
an organization, access the organization's :guilabel:`Billing` section
through |service|.

|service|:

- charges by the hour for your MongoDB clusters
- tabulates costs daily
- displays your current monthly costs on the
  :ref:`Invoices page <view-current-invoice>`

To view line-item charges,
:ref:`view all of your invoices <view-past-invoices>`.

As you create or modify a cluster, you can compare the costs of
different options before applying them. |service| displays the costs,
except for data transfer, in a :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` card.

  :ref:`subscription <activate-subscription>`.

.. _retry-failed-payment:

Retry a Failed Payment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retry a failed payment:

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-payments-retry.rst

.. _activate-subscription:

Activate a Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you buy a subscription from
:website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`,
MongoDB sends you an email containing an activation code.
To apply this subscription to your |service| organization:

.. note::
   You must be an :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
   or :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` to activate a subscription.

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-apply-credit.rst

With an active subscription, |service| displays a confirmation icon
and message in the :guilabel:`Payment Method` card.

.. figure:: /images/active-subscription-confirmation.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: While your organization has an active subscription, all charges are deducted from your available credits.

.. note::

   - If you do not add your subscription activation code within the
     first 30 days of use, MongoDB charges the credit card associated
     with the account. Credit card charges are non-refundable.

   - If you lost your activation code,
     :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

.. _subscription-level:

Subscription Level
``````````````````

If you have an upgraded MongoDB |service| subscription entitling you to
:doc:`support </support>` or other capabilities, the total cost for
the month is listed in the :guilabel:`Summary` section of your
invoice. Line items are listed in the :guilabel:`Details` section.

.. _annual-commitment-invoicing:

Annual Commitment with Monthly Invoicing
````````````````````````````````````````

If your subscription includes an annual commitment, you can view your
month's spending against your commitment in your organization's
:guilabel:`Billing Overview`.

.. figure:: /images/monthly-commitment.png
   :figwidth: 60%
   :alt: You can view your monthly commitment information at the bottom of your organization's Billing Overview.

At the end of the month, if your usage is lower than your prorated
monthly commitment, you will be charged for the full commitment. Unused
credits can be applied at a later date to cover overages.

.. _cross-org-billing:

Cross-Organization Billing
--------------------------

*Cross-organization billing* is an |service| subscription feature that 
enables you to share a billing subscription across multiple 
:doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations/>` and to pay a 
single invoice for them. After 
:ref:`configuring a paying organization <configure-paying-org>`, you 
pay invoices for the paying organization that include a list of charges 
incurred for all linked organizations.

A paying organization's invoice displays:

- the :guilabel:`Running Total` of the paying organization's charges, 
  and

- the :guilabel:`Combined Total` of the paying and linked 
  organizations' charges.

.. figure:: /images/paying-org-invoice.png
   :alt: The paying organization invoice shows costs incurred for that 
         organization and a list of costs for linked organizations
   :figwidth: 100%

Linked organizations are subject to the subscription agreement of the 
paying organization, including the level of support, the charges 
associated with the subscription, discounts, and payment terms.

.. note::
   To learn more or to purchase a subscription that enables
   cross-organization billing, contact 
   :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Cross-organization billing can be useful for establishing broad levels 
of authorization using |service| organizations, and for exceeding the 
250-project limit on |service| organizations.

.. example::

   A company with sales and engineering teams might need 
   significantly different organization-level authorization for each, 
   but still want to receive a single invoice for the company's 
   database use. That company could create and link sales and 
   engineering organizations to a paying organization to pay all costs 
   through that paying organization, while maintaining control over the 
   authorizations of each team organization.

   A company with over 250 projects might create new organizations for 
   new projects, then link them all to a paying organization to 
   maintain a single source of invoicing.

.. _configure-paying-org:

Configure a Paying Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites
`````````````

- A paying organization must have an |service| subscription that 
  includes cross-organization billing.
  
- To configure a paying organization, you must have
  :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` privileges.

To configure a paying organization and link other organizations to it:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-paying-organization.rst

The :guilabel:`Linked Organizations` tab displays your linked 
organizations. To link additional organizations, click 
:guilabel:`Link More Organizations`.

Billing Quota Management
------------------------

You can use :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to help manage your
billing quotas. Billing alerts notify a designated person when a bill
has exceeded a |usd| limit, or when a credit card is about to expire.

To :ref:`configure billing alerts <configure-alert-settings-tabs>`,
click Organization :guilabel:`Alerts` in the :guilabel:`Organization`
view.
