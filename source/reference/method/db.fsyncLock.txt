db.fsyncLock()
==============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Forces the :program:`mongod` to flush all pending write operations
   to the disk and locks the *entire* :program:`mongod` instance to
   prevent additional writes until the user releases the lock with the
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` command. :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an
   administrative command.

   This command provides a simple wrapper around a
   :dbcommand:`fsync` database command with the following
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   This function locks the database and create a window for
   :doc:`backup operations </core/backups>`.

   .. important::

      :method:`db.fsyncLock()` *may* block reads, including those necessary to
      verify authentication.
      Such reads are necessary to establish new connections to a
      :program:`mongod` that enforces authorization checks.

   .. warning::

      When calling :method:`db.fsyncLock()`, ensure that the connection
      is kept open to allow a subsequent call to :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.

      Closing the connection may make it difficult to release the
      lock.
