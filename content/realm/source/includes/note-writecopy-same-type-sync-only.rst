.. note:: Same-Type Sync Only

   This method only supports copying a Partition-Based Sync configuration for 
   another Partition-Based Sync user, or a Flexible Sync configuration for another
   Flexible Sync user. You cannot use this method to convert between a 
   Partition-Based Sync realm and a Flexible Sync realm or vice-versa.
