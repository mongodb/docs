       ``movies`` collection."
content: |
  
  The following example uses the ``compound`` operator with subqueries 
  to search for movies between the years ``2010`` to ``2015``. The 
  query uses the following clauses:

  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-clauses.rst

  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-stages.rst

  To run this query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the following 
     pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the dropdown and adding
     the query for that stage. Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add 
     additional stages.

  .. include:: /includes/fts/date-range/tutorial.rst

  If you enabled :guilabel:`Auto Preview`, |compass| displays the 
  following documents next to the ``$project`` pipeline stage:
