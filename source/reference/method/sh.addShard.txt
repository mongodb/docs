Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.addShard(host)

   Adds a database instance or replica set to a :term:`sharded cluster`.
   The optimal configuration is to deploy shards across :term:`replica
   sets <replica set>`. This method must be run on a :program:`mongos`
   instance.

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /reference/method/sh.addShard-param.rst

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShard("<host>")

   The ``host`` parameter can be in any
   of the following forms:

   .. code-block:: none

      [hostname]
      [hostname]:[port]
      [replica-set-name]/[hostname]
      [replica-set-name]/[hostname]:port

   .. warning::

      Do not use ``localhost`` for the hostname unless your
      :term:`configuration server <config database>`
      is also running on ``localhost``.

The :method:`sh.addShard()` method is a helper for the
:dbcommand:`addShard` command.
The :dbcommand:`addShard` command has additional options which are
not available with this helper.

Example
-------

To add a shard on a replica set, specify the name of the replica set and
the hostname of at least one member of the replica set, as a seed. If
you specify additional hostnames, all must be members of the same
replica set.

The following example adds a replica set named ``repl0`` and specifies
one member of the replica set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard("repl0/mongodb3.example.net:27327")
