====================================
Downgrade 3.6 Sharded Cluster to 3.4
====================================

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-path.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Considerations
--------------

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modify the cluster metadata.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features :ref:`incompatible
<3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion| or earlier versions as outlined
below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

.. _3.6-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-fcv.rst

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica set
member and each config server replica set member and check the
``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }


If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` that includes
either a ``version`` value of ``"3.6"`` or a ``targetVersion`` field,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"3.4"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/remove-3.6-fcv-features.rst

Procedure
---------

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
