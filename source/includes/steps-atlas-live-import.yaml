  Skip this step if you already have an |service| cluster as the destination
  of the live migration process.

  Create a new |service| cluster, configuring it as needed. For complete
  documentation on creating an |service| cluster, see
  :doc:`/create-new-cluster`.

  Once |service| has deployed your new cluster, proceed to the next step.

  #. Click the ellipsis :guilabel:`...` button for the destination
     |service| cluster. On the Cluster list, the ellipsis
     :guilabel:`...` button appears beneath the cluster name, as shown
     below. When you view a cluster's details, the ellipsis :guilabel:`...`
     appears on the right-hand side of the screen, next to the
     :guilabel:`Connect` and :guilabel:`Configuration` buttons.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`.

  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen with instructions on
     how to proceed with the live migration. The process
     copies the data from your source cluster to the new target
     cluster. After you complete the walk-through, you can point your
     application to the new cluster.

     You will need the following details for your source cluster to
     facilitate the migration:

     - The hostname and port of the source cluster's
       :manual:`primary member </core/replica-set-primary/>`

     - The username and password used to connect to the source
       cluster

     - If the source cluster uses ``TLS/SSL`` and is not using a
       public Certificate Authority (CA), you will need the
       source cluster's :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file.

     Prepare the information as stated in the walk-through screen,
     then click :guilabel:`I'm Ready To Migrate`.

  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen that collects information
     required to connect to the source cluster.

     - |service| displays the IP address of the MongoDB
       application server responsible for your live migration at the
       top of the walk-through screen. Configure your source cluster
       firewall to grant access to the displayed IP address.

     - Enter the hostname and port of the primary member of the source cluster
       into the provided text box. For example,
       ``mongoPrimary.example.net:27017``.

     - If the source cluster enforces authentication, enter a username and
       password into the provided text boxes.

       See :ref:`live-import-security` for guidance on the
       user permissions required by |service| live migration.

     - If the source cluster uses ``TLS/SSL``, toggle the ``SSL`` button.

     - If the source replica set uses ``TLS/SSL`` *and* is not using a public
       Certificate Authority (CA), copy the contents of the source cluster's
       :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file into the provided text box.

     - If you wish to drop all collections on the target cluster
       before beginning the migration process, toggle the switch
       marked :guilabel:`Clear any existing data on your target
       cluster?` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm that |service| can connect to the
     source replica set.

     If validation fails, check that:

     - You have :ref:`whitelisted <live-import-ip-whitelist>` |service|
       on your source cluster.

     - The provided user credentials, if any, exist on the source cluster
       and have the required permissions.

     - The :guilabel:`SSL` toggle is enabled only if the source cluster
       requires it.

     - The CA file provided, if any, is valid and correct.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Start Migration` to start the migration process.

     Once the migration process begins, the |service| UI displays the
     :guilabel:`Migrating Data` walk-through screen for the destination
     |service| cluster. This walk-through screen updates as destination
     cluster proceeds through the migration process, as well as the time
     remaining for the destination cluster to sync with the source cluster.

  When the migration timer and the :guilabel:`Start Cutover` button turn
  green, proceed to the next step.

title: "Perform the cutover."
ref: live-import-prepare-cutover
level: 4
content: |

  When |service| detects that the source and destination clusters are nearly
  in sync, it starts an extendable 72 hour timer to begin the cutover
  procedure. If the 72 hour period passes, |service| stops synchronizing with
  the source cluster. You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by
  clicking the :guilabel:`Extend time` hyperlink below the :guilabel:`<time>
  left to cut over` timer.

  #. Once you are prepared to cut your applications over to the
     destination |service| cluster, click :guilabel:`Start Cutover`.

  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen with instructions
     on how to proceed with the cutover.

     Perform the steps described in the walk-through screen to cut over your
     applications to the |service| cluster. The walk-through screen provides
     the cluster connection string your applications use for connectivity.

  #. Once you have completed the cutover procedure and confirmed
     your applications are working normally with the |service| cluster, click
     :guilabel:`I'm Done` to complete the migration procedure.
