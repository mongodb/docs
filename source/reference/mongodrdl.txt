Description
-----------

.. only:: (not man)

   .. binary:: mongodrdl

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

:program:`mongodrdl` produces a schema based on contents of one or more
:program:`mongod` :term:`collections <collection>` and writes them out into
``.drdl`` files understood by :program:`mongosqld`.

See :doc:`/schema-configuration` for details on this format.

Custom Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a special field to your schema that allows you to pass a custom
MongoDB :pipeline:`$match` query string to your MongoDB instance.

:program:`mongodrdl` offers the ``--customFilterField`` flag you can use to
name such a custom filter field. Alternatively you can manually editing the DRDL
file before importing it with :program:`mongobischema`.

This custom filter field allows you to pass a native MongoDB query string down
to MongoDB as the first :pipeline:`$match` stage of the aggregation pipeline,
before any additional filters pushed down from SQL. The MongoDB query must be
legal syntax, and can refer to any field in the collection, even if the fields
were not exposed in the relational schema.

For an example, see :ref:`mongodrdl-custom-filters-example`.

Usage
-----

Generate a Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodrdl-example.rst

.. _mongodrdl-custom-filters-example:

Custom Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use this field, specify the ``--customFilterField`` flag with the name you
want this field to have:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodrdl [ other options ] --customFilterField "_MONGOFILTER" -o schema.drdl

Your DRDL file ``schema.drdl`` will include the following field in every generated table:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: _MONGOFILTER
     mongotype: mongo.Filter
     sqltype: varchar

To add the special MongoDB query stage to your standard SQL, use the following
SQL syntax:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT <normal>
      FROM <tablename>
      WHERE <normal conditions> AND
          "_MONGOFILTER"='{ <json string that represents query to use> }'

   SELECT name,age
     FROM users
     WHERE active='t' AND
       "_MONGOFILTER"='{"addr":{"$elemMatch":{"city":"Springfield","state":"CA"}}}'

The |bi| will translate the above SQL into the following MongoDB
:ref:`aggregation <aggregation-framework>` expression:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate([
      {$match:{"addr":{"$elemMatch":{"city":"Springfield","state":"CA"}}},
      {$match:{"active":true}},
      {$project:{"name":1, "age":1}}
   ]);

You can use this custom filter in any Business Intelligence tool by filtering
on your special field and providing the value to match as a single quoted string
representing valid :term:`JSON`. All quotes inside the JSON must be double
quotes.
