    To generate pseudo-random data to use for a
    :setting:`keyfile`, issue the following ``openssl`` command:
  language: sh
  code: |
    openssl rand -base64 741 > mongodb-keyfile
    chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile

  You may generate a key file using any method you choose. Always
  ensure that the password stored in the key file is both long and

# the name of this file is referenced later on
