If MongoDB does not shutdown cleanly [#clean-shutdown]_ the on-disk
representation of the data files will likely reflect an inconsistent
state which could lead to data corruption. [#validation]_

To prevent data inconsistency and corruption, always shut down the
database cleanly and use the :ref:`durability journaling
<setting-journal>`. MongoDB writes data to the journal, by default,
every 100 milliseconds, such that MongoDB can always recover to a
consistent state even in the case of an unclean shutdown due to power
loss or other system failure.

If you are *not* running as part of a :term:`replica set` **and** do
*not* have journaling enabled, use the following procedure to recover
data that may be in an inconsistent state. If you are running as part
of a replica set, you should *always* restore from a backup or restart
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with an empty :setting:`dbpath` and
allow MongoDB to perform an initial sync to restore the data.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/administration` documents, including
   :ref:`Replica Set Syncing <replica-set-syncing>`, and the
   documentation on the :setting:`repair`, :setting:`repairpath`, and
   :setting:`journal` settings.

.. [#clean-shutdown] To ensure a clean shut down, use the
   :option:`mongod --shutdown` option, your control script,
   "Control-C" (when running :binary:`~bin.mongod` in interactive mode,)
   or ``kill $(pidof mongod)`` or ``kill -2 $(pidof mongod)``.

.. [#validation] You can also use the :method:`db.collection.validate()`
   method to test the integrity of a single collection. However, this
   process is time consuming, and without journaling you can safely
   assume that the data is in an invalid state and you should either
   run the repair operation or resync from an intact member of the
   replica set.

Process
-------

Indications
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are aware of a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running without
journaling that stops unexpectedly **and** you're not running with
replication, you should always run the repair operation before
starting MongoDB again. If you're using replication, then restore from
a backup and allow replication to perform an initial :ref:`sync <replica-set-syncing>` to restore data.

If the ``mongod.lock`` file in the data directory specified by
:setting:`dbpath`, ``/data/db`` by default, is *not* a zero-byte file,
then :binary:`~bin.mongod` will refuse to start, and you will find a
message that contains the following line in your MongoDB log our
output:

.. code-block:: none

   Unclean shutdown detected.

This indicates that you need to remove the lockfile and run repair. If
you run repair when the ``mongodb.lock`` file exists without the
:option:`mongod --repairpath` option, you will see a message that
contains the following line:

.. code-block:: none

   old lock file: /data/db/mongod.lock. probably means unclean shutdown

You must remove the lockfile **and** run the repair operation before
starting the database normally using the following procedure:

Overview
~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Recovering a member of a replica set.

   Do not use this procedure to recover a member of a :term:`replica set`.
   Instead you should either restore from a :doc:`backup </administration/backups>`
   or perform an initial sync using data from an intact member of the set, as described in :ref:`replica-set-resync-stale-member`.

There are two processes to repair data files that result from an
unexpected shutdown:

#. Use the :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>` option in
   conjunction with the :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
   option. :binary:`~bin.mongod` will read the existing data files, and
   write the existing data to new data files. This does not modify or
   alter the existing data files.

   You do not need to remove the ``mongod.lock`` file before using
   this procedure.

#. Use the :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>` option.
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` will read the existing data files, write the
   existing data to new files and replace the existing, possibly
   corrupt, files with new files.

   You must remove the ``mongod.lock`` file before using this
   procedure.

.. note::

   :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>` functionality is also
   available in the shell with the :method:`db.repairDatabase()`
   helper for the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command.

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~

To repair your data files using the :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
option to preserve the original data files unmodified:

#. Start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>`
   to read the existing data files.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db --repair --repairpath /data/db0

   When this completes, the new repaired data files will be in the
   ``/data/db0`` directory.

#. Start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using the following invocation to point the
   :setting:`dbpath` at ``/data/db0``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db0

   Once you confirm that the data files are operational you may delete
   or archive the data files in the ``/data/db`` directory.

To repair your data files without preserving the original files, do
not use the :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>` option, as in
the following procedure:

#. Remove the stale lock file:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rm /data/db/mongod.lock

   Replace ``/data/db`` with your :setting:`dbpath` where your MongoDB
   instance's data files reside.

   .. warning::

      After you remove the ``mongod.lock`` file you *must* run the
      :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>` process before using your
      database.

#. Start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using :option:`--repair <mongod --repair>`
   to read the existing data files.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db --repair

   When this completes, the repaired data files will replace the
   original data files in the ``/data/db`` directory.

#. Start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using the following invocation to point the
   :setting:`dbpath` at ``/data/db``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db

``mongod.lock``
---------------

In normal operation, you should **never** remove the ``mongod.lock``
file and start :binary:`~bin.mongod`. Instead consider the one of the above methods
to recover the database and remove the lock files. In dire
situations you can remove the lockfile, and start the database using the
possibly corrupt files, and attempt to recover data from the database;
however, it's impossible to predict the state of the database in these
situations.

If you are not running with journaling, and your database shuts down
unexpectedly for *any* reason, you should always proceed *as if* your database
is in an inconsistent and likely corrupt state. If at all possible restore
from :doc:`backup </administration/backups>` or, if running as a :term:`replica
set`, restore by performing an initial sync using data from an intact
member of the set, as described in :ref:`replica-set-resync-stale-member`.
