.. default-domain:: mongodb

To allow LLMs to consume our content easily, don't nest the following 
components:

- Callouts inside callouts
- Callouts inside tables
- Examples inside callouts
 
Use the following guidance to fix existing published nested components 
or replace nested components in your pull requests.

Callouts Inside Callouts
------------------------

Remove the nested callout and make its contents part of the parent 
callout, or remove it from callouts altogether. The text may 
follow directly after the preceding text, or you may include a line 
break if appropriate. If the nested callout is an example, see 
:ref:`examples-in-callouts`. If the nested callout is an 
Important or Warning callout, see :ref:`important-or-warning`
in the :ref:`examples-in-callouts` section.

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. important:: AWS Only

          Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering
          connections are region-specific. Clusters utilizing an 
          existing VPC peering connection to an AWS VPC in a given AWS 
          region lose access to that peering connection if moved to a 
          different AWS region. The moved cluster may use an existing 
          peering connection in the new region.

          .. seealso:: 
   
             :atlas:`Set Up a Network Peering Connection 
             </security-vpc-peering>`.

.. _notes:

Notes
~~~~~

Remove the nested note directive and make the note's content plain 
text. The note text can follow directly after the preceding text, or 
you can include a line break if appropriate.

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 20 60
          
          * - id
            - string
            - Unique identifier of this Agent API Key.

          * - key
            - string
            - Agent API Key.

              .. note::

                 After creating this Agent API Key, subsequent requests 
                 return the last four characters of Agent API Keys.

          * - desc
            - string
            - Label for this Agent API Key. Limited to 1,000 characters.

     - .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 20 60
          
          * - id
            - string
            - Unique identifier of this Agent API Key.

          * - key
            - string
            - Agent API Key.

              After creating this Agent API Key, subsequent requests 
              return the last four characters of Agent API Keys.

          * - desc
            - string
            - Label for this Agent API Key. Limited to 1,000 characters.

.. _important-or-warning:

Important or Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assess the content and determine whether it really belongs in an 
Important or Warning callout. If it's merely noteworthy, remove the 
content from the callout. For guidance, see :ref:`callouts`.

If the content could be a note, follow the instructions for 
:ref:`notes`.

If users must notice the Important or Warning information (for 
example, when ignoring the information results in data loss or other 
serious considerations):

- For important information, remove the nested directive and make its 
  contents part of the parent callout. Precede the important 
  information with a line break and add  ``IMPORTANT:`` in bold, gold 
  text. To do this, use the following gold directive: 
  
  .. code-block::
    
     :gold:`IMPORTANT:`

- For warning information, remove the nested directive and add the 
  content to the parent callout. Precede the warning information 
  with a line break and add  ``WARNING:`` in bold, red text. To do 
  this, use the following red directive:
  
  .. code-block::
    
     :red:`WARNING:`

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. list-table::
          :widths: 30 40 30
          
          * - Restore from Backup
            - The time required to restore your serverless instance.

              .. important::

                 Data transfer as part of the backup and restore 
                 process is charged separately.

            - Range from $2.50 to $6.00 per restore hour.

.. _examples-in-callouts:

Examples Inside Callouts
------------------------

Remove the nested example and do one of the following steps:

- If the example is a statement with full sentences, add the contents 
  to the parent callout, preceding the example with a line break and 
  the text, "For example,".

- If the example is a value in a code block, introduce the code block 
  with "For example:". If more context follows the example, add "In the 
  previous example," to the context.

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. important::

          There must be enough disk space to accommodate all of the 
          source oplog entries that occur during the initial 
          ``mongomirror`` sync.

          .. example::
   
             If the source oplog is 10 GB and covers 24 hours of 
             changes, and ``mongomirror``'s sync is estimated to 
             take 48 hours, there must be at least 20 GB of free disk 
             space in the specified directory.

Examples Inside Tables
----------------------

Remove the nested example and do one of the following steps:

- If the example is in a statement with full sentences, add its 
  contents in plain text, preceding the example with a line break and 
  the text, "For example,".

- If the example is a value in a code block, introduce the code block 
  with "For example:". If more context follows the example, add "In the 
  previous example,"" to the context.

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 20 60
          
          * - 404
            - Not Found
            - The requested resource does not exist.

          * - 405
            - Method Not Allowed
            - The HTTP method is not supported for the specified 
              resource. Keep in mind that each resource may only 
              support a subset of HTTP methods.

              .. example::

                 You are not allowed to ``DELETE`` the
                 :opsmgr:`root </reference/api/root>` resource.

     - .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 30 30
          
          * - 404
            - Not Found
            - The requested resource does not exist.

              resource. Keep in mind that each resource may only 
              support a subset of HTTP methods.

              For example, you are not allowed to ``DELETE`` the
              :opsmgr:`root </reference/api/root>` resource.

Procedures Inside Procedures
----------------------------

Remove the nested procedure and add its contents to an ordered list. 
Start with a., b., c., d., and use i., ii., iii. for levels below that. 
Do not nest steps more than that.

**Example:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Before
     - After

   * - .. procedure::
          :style: normal

          .. step:: Open the Atlas Search index you want to update.
      
             .. procedure::
                :style: connected
         
                .. step:: Navigate to your Atlas Search tab.
         
                .. step:: On the index you want to copy, click ``...`` in the :guilabel:`Action` column. 
         
                .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit With JSON Editor`.
   
          .. step:: Copy the index.
     - .. procedure::
          :style: normal

          .. step:: Open the Atlas Search index you want to update.
      
             a. Navigate to your Atlas Search tab.
             b. On the index you want to copy, click 
                :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` in the :guilabel:`Action` column.
             c. Click :guilabel:`Edit With JSON Editor`.
   
          .. step:: Copy the index.
