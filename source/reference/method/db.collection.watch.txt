Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.watch( pipeline, options )

   Opens a :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` on the 
   collection. 

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.collection.watch-param.rst

   The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.collection.watch-options.rst

   :returns:
      A :term:`cursor` that remains open as long as a connection to the
      MongoDB deployment remains open *and* the collection exists.
      See :doc:`/reference/change-events` for examples of change
      event documents.

Behavior
--------

:method:`~db.collection.watch()` requires that the target MongoDB
deployment is either a :term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`
with replica set :term:`shards <shard>`. You cannot use
change streams on a standalone MongoDB deployment.

You can only use :method:`~db.collection.watch()` on replica sets or
sharded clusters where each data bearing :binary:`~bin.mongod` runs with
the :ref:`Wired Tiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

:method:`~db.collection.watch()` only notifies on data changes that
have persisted to a majority of data-bearing members in the replica
set or shard replica set.

Resumability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
change stream cursor after an error as the MongoDB 
:ecosystem:`3.6-series drivers </drivers>` do. The MongoDB 3.6-series 
drivers make *one* attempt to automatically resume  a change stream 
cursor after certain errors.

If the operation identified by the resume token passed to the
``resumeAfter`` option has already dropped off the cluster's
:term:`oplog`, :method:`~db.collection.watch()` cannot resume the
change stream.

:method:`~db.collection.watch()` uses information stored in the oplog
related to a given data changing operation to produce the change event
description and generate a resume token associated to that operation. If
enough time has passed such that the data changing operation which
generated the resume token is no longer present in the oplog, you cannot
use that token to resume the change stream.

Attempting to resume a change stream against a dropped collection
results in an error.

See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for complete documentation on
resuming a change stream.

Full Document Lookup of Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result of a full document lookup may differ from the delta
of fields changed by the update operation if other majority-committed
operations modified the document between the original update operation
and the full document lookup.

Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
cursor and returns an error.

Examples
--------

Open a Change Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation opens a change stream cursor against the 
``data.sensors`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("data").sensors.watch()

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         watchCursor.next();
      }
   }

For complete documentation on change stream output, see
:ref:`change-stream-output`.

Change Stream with Full Document Update Lookup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the ``fullDocument`` option to ``"updateLookup"`` to direct the
change stream cursor to lookup the most current majority-committed
version of the document associated to an update change stream event.

The following operation opens a change stream cursor against
the ``data.sensors`` collection using the 
``fullDocument : "updateLookup"`` option.

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("data").sensors.watch(
      [],
      { fullDocument : "updateLookup" }
   )

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         watchCursor.next();
      }
   }

For any update operation, the change event returns the result of the
document lookup in the ``fullDocument`` field.

For an example of the full document update output, see  :ref:`change
stream update event <change-streams-update-event>`.

For complete documentation on change stream output, see
:ref:`change-stream-output`.

Change Stream with Aggregation Pipeline Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation opens a change stream cursor against the 
``data.sensors`` collection using an aggregation pipeline to
filter only ``insert`` events:

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("data").sensors.watch(
      [
         { $match : {"operationType" : "insert" } }
      ]
   )

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         watchCursor.next();
      }
   }

The change stream cursor only returns change events where the 
``operationType`` is ``insert``. For complete documentation on
change stream output, see :ref:`change-stream-output`. 

Resuming a Change Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every  document returned by a change stream cursor includes a resume
token as the ``_id`` field. To resume a change stream, pass the entire
``_id`` document of the change event you want to resume from to
the ``resumeAfter`` option of :method:`~db.collection.watch()`. 

The following operation resumes a change stream cursor against the 
``data.sensors`` collection using a resume token. This
assumes that the operation that generated the resume token has not
rolled off the cluster's oplog. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   let watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("data").sensors.watch();
   let firstChange;

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()) {
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()) {
        firstChange = watchCursor.next();
        break;
      }
   }

   watchCursor.close();

   let resumeToken = firstChange._id;

   resumedWatchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("data").sensors.watch(
   [],
      { resumeAfter : resumeToken }
   )

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!resumedWatchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (resumedWatchCursor.hasNext()){
         resumedWatchCursor.next();
      }
   }

See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for complete documentation on
resuming a change stream.
