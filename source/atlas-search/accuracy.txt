How do I improve the accuracy of my search results?
---------------------------------------------------

To improve the accuracy of your search results, you can use |fts|
support for the following features. 

Customize the Score 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fts| assigns a score to every document in the result set based on
relevance and returns the results in order from highest to the 
lowest score. To learn more, see :ref:`scoring-ref`.

When you run your |fts| query, you can tune the relevance of the
documents in the results to ensure that the most pertinent documents are
ranked and returned higher in the results. 

To learn more, see :ref:`fts-customize-score`.

Hybrid Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hybrid search combines full-text search
and semantic search to ensure synonymous and contextually similar
matches are included in the combined results of both
search methods for the same criteria in the same query. 

Use hybrid search for the following scenarios:

- Use |fts| (full-text search) to handle keyword queries and ranking documents based on 
  relevance by measuring how frequently a keyword appears in a document and across the 
  documents in the collection. 
- Use {+avs+} (semantic search) to retrieve semantically similar documents.
- Combine the scores of both search methods to retrieve more
  accurate and relevant results.

To learn more, see :ref:`as_hybrid-search`.

Synonyms Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synonyms search ensures that your query results contain relevant results
even when the exact keywords aren't present in the documents that you
search. 

When you perform a synonyms search, you use the synonyms mapping
collection that you indexed and apply at query-time.

To learn more, see :ref:`synonyms-ref`.

Explain Your Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB ``explain`` provides information about how queries execute and
why certain documents return over others. 

Use ``explain`` in your query for the following reasons:

- Understand how |fts| computes scores for your search queries and the
  factors that contribute to the relevance of the documents in the
  results.
- Improve your index and query based on the performance of your search
  and ranking. 

To learn more, see :ref:`explain-ref`.

.. _fts-tune-relevance:

How can I improve the relevancy of my search results? 
-----------------------------------------------------

You can tune the relevance in |fts| to ensure that the more pertinent
documents return in your |fts| query results. Consider the following to
optimize the relevance of your |fts| results. 

Assess Your Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To structure and format your data to return optimal results
for your search:

- Review the schema of your documents to determine which fields to
  index. For polymorphic data, |fts| indexes only documents
  that correspond to the mappings specified in the index definition for
  that field and ignores documents that contain values that aren't the
  data type specified in the index definition for that field. To learn
  more about supported field types and field mappings, see
  :ref:`fts-field-mappings`. 
- Normalize the data, if needed, to ensure consistency for fields
  used in filtering and sorting. For example, convert date and time
  values to a standard format, such as ISO-8601.
- Analyze the frequency of common terms in key fields to determine the
  analyzer and tokenization strategy to apply. For example, some terms
  might require special handling like stemming or synonym mapping. To
  learn more about creating tokens for your data with |fts| analyzers,
  see :ref:`analyzers-ref`. 
- Analyze the volume of data and plan for scale. Large datasets might
  require strategic indexing and partitioning. 

Configure Your |fts| Index 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure your |fts| index to return optimal results for your
search:

- Select the appropriate analyzer for each field that you want to
  index. Analyzers combine filters with tokenizers to create indexable
  terms that correct for differences in punctuation, capitalization,
  filler words, and more. You can choose built-in analyzers or build
  custom analyzers. To learn more, see :ref:`analyzers-ref`.
- Create a source synonym collection and define synonym mappings that
  reference the synonym source collection in your |fts| index. You can use synonyms
  to expand the scope of your search and to return related
  terms in the results. To learn more, see :ref:`synonyms-ref`.

Define Your |fts| Query 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build your query to return optimal results:

- Select the appropriate aggregation pipeline stage. For example, use
  :pipeline:`$searchMeta` if you want to only retrieve metadata. To
  learn more, see :ref:`query-syntax-ref`.
- Choose an operator that is optimal for retrieving the relevant
  results. For example, consider the :ref:`compound operator <compound-ref>` if you want to
  combine multiple clauses such as ``must``, ``should``, ``mustnot`` in
  you query. To learn more, see :ref:`operators-ref`.
- Apply more processes on your search results by using |fts|
  support for :ref:`sorting <sort-ref>`, :ref:`scoring <scoring-ref>`,
  :ref:`grouping <fts-facet-ref>`, and more.
