title: Upgrade secondary members of the replica set.
level: 5
stepnum: 1
ref: upgrade-secondaries
content: |
  Upgrade the :term:`secondary` members of the set one at a time by
  shutting down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and replacing the 2.6 binary
  with the 3.0 binary. After upgrading a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance,
  wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
  before upgrading the next instance.
  To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
  ``mongo`` shell.

title: Step down the replica set primary.
level: 5
ref: step-down-primary
content: |
  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the ``mongo`` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the set to :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>`. :method:`rs.stepDown()`
  expedites the failover procedure and is preferable to shutting down
  the primary directly.

title: Upgrade the primary.
level: 5
ref: upgrade-primary
content: |
  When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
  and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
  previous primary and replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the
  3.0 binary and start the new instance.
