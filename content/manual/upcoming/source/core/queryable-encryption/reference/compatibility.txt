{+qe+} Compatibility
------------------------------------

The following sections describe the compatibility requirements for using
{+qe+} with MongoDB Server and your selected driver.

MongoDB Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+qe+} on a MongoDB Server 7.0 or later replica set or sharded
cluster, but not a standalone instance. The following table shows which
MongoDB Server products support which {+qe+} mechanisms:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 30 30

   * - Product Name
     - Minimum Version
     - Supports {+qe+} with Automatic Encryption
     - Supports {+qe+} with {+manual-enc-title+}

   * - MongoDB Atlas [1]_
     - 7.0
     - Yes
     - Yes

   * - MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
     - 7.0
     - Yes
     - Yes

   * - MongoDB Community Edition
