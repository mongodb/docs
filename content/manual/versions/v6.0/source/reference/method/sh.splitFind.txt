Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.splitFind(namespace, query)

   Splits the chunk that contains the shard key value specified by the
   ``query`` at the chunk's median point. :method:`sh.splitFind()`
   creates two roughly equal chunks. To split a chunk at a specific
   point instead, see :method:`sh.splitAt()`.

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`split` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt.rst

   The method takes the following arguments:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``namespace``
   
        - string
   
        - The namespace (i.e. ``<database>.<collection>``) of the sharded
          collection that contains the chunk to split.
          
          
   
      * - ``query``
   
        - document
   
        - A query document that specifies the :term:`shard key` value 
          that determines the chunk to split.
          
          
   


   The :method:`sh.splitFind()` method wraps the :dbcommand:`split`
   command.

Compatibility
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

Consideration
-------------

In most circumstances, you should leave chunk splitting to the
automated processes within MongoDB.

To use :method:`sh.splitFind()`, the sharded collection must be
populated.

Example
-------

For the sharded collection ``test.foo``, the following example splits,
at the median point, a chunk that contains the shard key value ``x:
70``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.splitFind( "test.foo", { x: 70 } )
