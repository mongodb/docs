  For a given region, click the currently selected :guilabel:`Region` 
  and pick a new region from the drop-down list. If you modify the
  :guilabel:`Preferred` region, the |service| cluster calls for one or
  more elections to select a new :term:`primary` in the selected
  region. See :doc:`/tutorial/test-failover` for instructions on 
  testing your application response to a replica set election before
  changing the :guilabel:`Preferred` cluster.

  To change the number of nodes |service| deploys to a given region, 
  increase or decrease the :guilabel:`Number of Nodes` value. 
  the total number of nodes across the :guilabel:`Preferred` region
  and all :guilabel:`Electable` regions must be an odd number.
