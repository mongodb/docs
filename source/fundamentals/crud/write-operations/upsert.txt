Overview
--------

If your application stores and modifies data in MongoDB, you probably use
insert and update operations. In certain workflows, whether you perform
an insert or update operation depends on whether the document exists.
In these cases, you can streamline your application logic by using the
``upsert`` option available in the following methods:

- :doc:`updateOne() </usage-examples/updateOne>`
- :doc:`replaceOne() </usage-examples/replaceOne>`
- :doc:`updateMany() </usage-examples/updateMany>`

If the query filter passed to these methods does not find any matches and
you set the ``upsert`` option to ``true``, MongoDB inserts the update
document. Let's go through an example.

Performing an Update
--------------------

Suppose your application tracks the current location of food trucks,
storing the nearest address data in the ``myDB.foodTrucks`` collection,
which resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     { name: "Haute Skillet", address: "42 Avenue B" },
     { name: "Lady of the Latke", address: "35 Fulton Rd" },
     ...
   ]


As an application user, you read about a food truck changing its regular
location and want to apply the update. This update might resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   const myDB = client.db("myDB");
   const myColl = myDB.collection("foodTrucks");

   const query = { name: "Deli Llama" };
   const update = { $set: { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" }};
   const options = {};
   myColl.updateOne(query, update, options);

If a food truck named "Deli Llama" exists, the method call above updates
the document in the collection. However, if there are no food trucks named
"Deli Llama" in your collection, no changes are made.

Performing an Upsert
--------------------

Consider the case in which you want to add information about the food
truck even if it does not yet exist in your collection. Rather than
first querying whether it exists to determine whether to insert or
update the document, we can set ``upsert`` to ``true`` in our call to
``updateOne()`` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   const query = { name: "Deli Llama" };
   const update = { $set: { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" }};
   const options = { upsert: true };
   myColl.updateOne(query, update, options);
   
After you run the operation above, your collection looks similar to the
following, even if the ``"Deli Llama"`` document did not exist in your collection
before the operation:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   [
     { name: "Haute Skillet", address: "42 Avenue B" },
     { name: "Lady of the Latke", address: "35 Fulton Rd" },
     { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" },
     ...
   ]
