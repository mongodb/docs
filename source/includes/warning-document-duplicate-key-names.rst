.. warning:: MongoDB does not support duplicate field names


   The MongoDB Query Language is undefined over documents with
   duplicate field names. BSON builders may support creating a BSON 
   document with duplicate field names. While the BSON builder may not
   throw an error, inserting these documents into MongoDB is not
   supported *even if* the insert succeeds. For example, inserting a
   BSON document with duplicate field names through a MongoDB driver
   may result in the driver silently dropping the duplicate values
   prior to insertion.
