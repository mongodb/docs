Overview
--------

Aggregation tutorials provide detailed explanations of common
aggregation tasks in a step-by-step format. The tutorials are adapted
from examples in the `Practical MongoDB Aggregations book
<https://www.practical-mongodb-aggregations.com/>`__ by Paul Done.

Each tutorial includes the following sections:

- **Introduction**, which describes the purpose and common use cases of the
  aggregation type. This section also describes the example and desired
  outcome that the tutorial demonstrates.

- **Before You Get Started**, which describes the necessary databases,
  collections, and sample data that you must have before building the
  aggregation pipeline and performing the aggregation.

- **Tutorial**, which describes how to build and run the aggregation
  pipeline. This section describes each stage of the completed
  aggregation tutorial, and then explains how to run and interpret the
  output of the aggregation.

At the end of each aggregation tutorial, you can find a link to a fully
runnable Python code file that you can run in your environment.

Aggregation Template App
------------------------

Before you begin following an aggregation tutorial, you must set up a
new Python app. You can use this app to connect to a MongoDB
deployment, insert sample data into MongoDB, and run the aggregation
pipeline in each tutorial.

.. tip:: 
   
   To learn how to install the driver and connect to MongoDB,
   see :ref:`pymongo-get-started`

Once you install the driver, create a file called
``agg_tutorial.py``. Paste the following code in this file to create an
app template for the aggregation tutorials:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/template-app.py
   :language: python
   :copyable: true

.. important::

   In the preceding code, read the code comments to find the sections of
   the code that you must modify for the tutorial you are following.

   If you attempt to run the code without making any changes, you will
   encounter a connection error.

For every tutorial, you must replace the connection string placeholder with
your deployment's connection string. To learn how to locate your deployment's connection
string, see :ref:`pymongo-get-started-connection-string`.

For example, if your connection string is
``"mongodb+srv://mongodb-example:27017"``, your connection string assignment resembles
the following:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: false

   uri = "mongodb+srv://mongodb-example:27017";

To run the completed file after you modify the template for a
tutorial, run the following command in your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 agg_tutorial.py
