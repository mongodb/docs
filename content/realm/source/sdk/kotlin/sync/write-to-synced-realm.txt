Write Data to a Synced Realm - Kotlin SDK
=========================================

When writing data to a synced realm using :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`, you can 
use the same APIs as :ref:`writing to a local realm <kotlin-read-write-data>`. However, 
there are some differences in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.

When you write to a synced realm, your write operations must match *both*
of the following:

- The sync subscription query
- The permissions in your App Services App 

If you try to write data that doesn't match either the query subscription or
the user's permissions, Realm reverts the write with a non-fatal error operation
called a :ref:`compensating write <kotlin-compensating-writes>`.

To learn more about configuring permissions for your app, see
:ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide` in the
App Services documentation.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors,
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

Determining What Data Syncs
---------------------------

The data that you can write to a synced realm is determined by the following: 

- Your Device Sync configuration
- Permissions in your App 
- The Flexible Sync subscription query used when you open the realm

The examples on this page use an Atlas App Services App with the following 
Device Sync configuration and a client app with the following Realm SDK 
data model and subscriptions.

.. _kotlin-sync-example-object-model:

In this example, the client app uses the following object model:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.flexible-sync-crud-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-app-services-configuration:

App Services Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on the above example :ref:`object model <kotlin-sync-example-object-model>`, 
Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``complexity``
- ``ownerId``

The App Services App has permissions configured to let users read and write only 
their own data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "roles": [
         {
            "name": "readOwnWriteOwn",
            "apply_when": {},
            "document_filters": {
               "write": {
                  "ownerId": "%%user.id"
               },
               "read": {
                  "ownerId": "%%user.id"
               }
            },
            "read": true,
            "write": true,
            "insert": true,
            "delete": true,
            "search": true
         }
      ]
   }

Any object in the Atlas collection where the ``ownerId`` does not match 
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user cannot sync to this realm.

.. _kotlin-client-data-model-and-configuration:

Client Data Model and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the :ref:`object model <kotlin-sync-example-object-model>`, the examples 
configure the synced realm to synchronize objects matching this subscription query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.flexible-sync-subscription-setup.kt
   :language: kotlin

Any object in the Atlas collection where the ``complexity`` property's 
value is greater than ``4`` cannot sync to this realm.

Write to a Synced Realm
-----------------------

Writes to Flexible Sync realms may broadly fall into one of two categories, depending on 
whether the write matches the :ref:`permissions <permissions>` and the
:ref:`Flexible Sync subscription query <kotlin-subscriptions>`: 

- Successful writes: The written object matches both the query subscription
  and the user's permissions. The object writes successfully to the realm,
  and syncs successfully to the App Services backend and other devices.
- Compensating writes: The written object does not match
  the subscription query or the user does not have sufficient
  permissions to perform the write. Realm reverts the illegal write with a 
  compensating write operation.

.. tip:: 

   If you want to write an object that does not match the query subscription,
   you can open a different realm where the object matches the query 
   subscription. Alternately, you could write the object to a non-synced 
   realm that does not enforce permissions or subscription queries.

.. _kotlin-successful-writes:

Successful Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the write matches both user permissions *and* the query subscription in the client, 
the Realm Kotlin SDK can successfully write the object to the synced realm. 
This object syncs with the App Services backend when the device has a network connection.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.successful-write.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the write doesn't match *either* the query subscription or user 
permissions, Realm reverts the write and throws a 
`CompensatingWriteException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-compensating-write-exception/index.html>`__. 

In more detail, when you write data that is outside the bounds of a query
subscription or does not match the user's permissions, the following occurs:

#. Because the client realm has no concept of "illegal" writes, the write initially succeeds until Realm resolves the changeset with the App Services backend.
#. Upon sync, the server applies the rules and permissions. The server determines that the user does not have authorization to perform the write.
#. The server sends a revert operation, called a "compensating write", back to the client.
#. The client's realm reverts the illegal write operation.

Any client-side writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost. 
In practice, this may look like the write succeeding, but then the 
object "disappears" when Realm syncs with the App Services backend and 
performs the compensating write. 

When this occurs, you can refer to the :ref:`App Services logs <logs-sync>` or use the 
:ref:`CompensatingWriteInfo <kotlin-compensating-write-info>` object in the 
client to get additional information on the error. 

.. _kotlin-writes-outside-subscription:

Write Doesn't Match the Query Subscription
``````````````````````````````````````````

Given the :ref:`configuration <kotlin-client-data-model-and-configuration>` for the Flexible 
Sync realm detailed above, attempting to write this object results in a compensating write error because the object does not match the query 
subscription:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.write-outside-flexible-sync-query.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      [Session][CompensatingWrite(231)] Client attempted a write that is disallowed by permissions, or modifies an object outside the current query, and the server undid the change.

You will see the following error message in the App Services logs: 

.. code-block:: console

   Error:

   Client attempted a write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been reverted (ProtocolErrorCode=231)

   Details: 
   {
      "Item": {
         "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7\" 
         in table \"Item\" not allowed; object is outside of 
         the current query view"
      }
   }

.. _kotlin-writes-outside-permissions:

Write Doesn't Match Permissions
```````````````````````````````

Given the :ref:`permissions <kotlin-app-services-configuration>` in the Device Sync configuration detailed above, 
attempting to write this object results in a compensating write error because the ``ownerId`` property does not match
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.write-outside-permissions.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      [Session][CompensatingWrite(231)] Client attempted a write that is disallowed by permissions, or modifies an object outside the current query, and the server undid the change.

You will see the following error message in the App Services logs: 

.. code-block:: console
   
   Error:

   Client attempted a write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been reverted (ProtocolErrorCode=231)

   Details: 
   {
      "Item": {
         "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7\" 
         in table \"Item\" was denied by write filter in role \"readOwnWriteOwn\""
      }
   }

.. _kotlin-compensating-write-info:

Compensating Write Error Information
````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.9.0

You can get additional information in the client about why a compensating 
write occurs using the `CompensatingWriteInfo 
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-compensating-write-exception/-compensating-write-info/index.html>`__ 
object, which provides:

- The ``objectType`` of the object the client attempted to write
- The ``primaryKey`` of the specific object
- The ``reason`` for the compensating write error

This information is the same information you can find in the :ref:`App Services logs <logs-sync>`.
The Kotlin SDK exposes this object on the client for convenience and 
debugging purposes.

The following shows an example of how you might log information 
about compensating write errors:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.access-compensating-write.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      A write was rejected with a compensating write error
      The write to object type: Item
      With primary key of: RealmAny{type=OBJECT_ID, value=BsonObjectId(649f2c38835cc0346b861b74)}
      Was rejected because: write to "649f2c38835cc0346b861b74" in table "Item" not allowed; object is outside of the current query view

- The ``Item`` in this message is ``Item`` object used in the :ref:`object model <kotlin-client-data-model-and-configuration>` on this page.
- The primary key is the ``objectId`` of the specific object the client attempted to write. 
- The ``table "Item"`` refers to the Atlas collection where this object would sync.
- The reason ``object is outside of the current query view`` in this example is because the query subscription was set to require the object's ``complexity`` property to be less than or equal to ``4``, and the client attempted to write an object outside of this boundary.
