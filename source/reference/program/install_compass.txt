Synopsis
--------

:binary:`~bin.install_compass` (``Install-Compass`` in Windows) is a
platform-specific installation script for
:ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`.

If downloaded as a part of the
`MongoDB Enterprise Server <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`_
package, the ``install_compass`` script installs the standard edition
of :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`.

If downloaded as part of the
`MongoDB Community Server <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server>`_
package, the ``install_compass`` script installs
:ref:`MongoDB Compass Community edition <compass-index>`.

Installation
------------

.. note::

   The ``install_compass`` script first removes and replaces any
   previously installed versions of the same |compass| edition (either
   |compass| or |compass| Community).

   .. example::

       If you run the ``install_compass`` script installed as part of
       MongoDB Community Server 3.6, the script removes any installed
       versions of |compass| Community and installs a compatible
       version of Compass Community.

Linux / macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux and macOS platforms the ``install_compass`` script is a Unix
executable script included in the MongoDB Server download. The script
is packaged with the download for each platform.

1. Change to the ``bin`` directory under the MongoDB Server
   download directory:

      .. code-block:: sh

      cd <installDirectory>/bin

2. Install |compass| using the ``install_compass`` script:

      .. code-block:: sh

      ./install_compass

Windows
~~~~~~~

On Windows platforms the ``Install-Compass`` script is a PowerShell
script included in both the MongoDB Server ``.zip`` archive and
``.msi`` installer downloads.

From the Windows Command Prompt:

1. Change to the ``bin`` directory under the MongoDB Server
   download directory:

      .. code-block:: none

      cd <installDirectory>\bin

2. Install |compass| using the ``install_compass`` script:

      .. code-block:: none

      powershell .\Install-Compass.ps1

Alternatively, if using the ``.msi`` installer for MongoDB Server for
Windows, during installation you are presented with a checkbox
indicating whether to install |compass| with MongoDB server. If
checked, the installer automatically executes the ``install_compass``
script.
