  You must grant |service| the
  following permissions on the virtual network. You can revoke
  these permissions after the VNet peering has been
  established.

  - ``Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/read``

  - ``Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write``

  - ``Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/delete``

  - ``Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer/action``

  To grant |service| permission to create a peering
  connection with your Azure virtual network:

  a. Launch the Azure console.

  #. Run the commands from the :guilabel:`Peering Connection`
     modal to create a service principal, create a new custom
     role, and assign the custom role to the service
     principal.

     .. note::

        Run the first command to create a service principal
        only once for all Azure VNets from the same Azure
        subscription.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Validate`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Initiate Peering`.
