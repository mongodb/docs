program: _shared
name: quiet
args: null
directive: option
description: |

args: <hostname><:port>
default: |
  localhost:27017
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :program:`mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the replica set seed name and the
  seed list of set members. Use the following format:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     <replica_set_name>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2:<port>,...

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.
optional: false

program: _shared
name: port
args: <port>
default: 27017
directive: option
description: |
   Specifies the TCP port on which the MongoDB instance listens for
   client connections.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: ipv6
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  Enables IPv6 support and allows the {{program}} to connect to the
  MongoDB instance using an IPv6 network. All MongoDB programs and
  processes disable IPv6 support by default.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: ssl
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Enables connection to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  SSL support enabled.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslCAFile
args: <filename>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
  from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslPEMKeyFile
args: <filename>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect
  to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  :setting:`sslCAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`sslWeakCertificateValidation`.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

args: <value>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Use the {{role}} option only if the
  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a passphrase. See
  :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: sslCRLFile
args: <filename>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the Certificate Revocation
  List. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or
  absolute paths.

optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslAllowInvalidCertificates
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the
  :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB logs as a
  warning the use of the invalid certificate.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslFIPSMode
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Directs the {{program}} to use the FIPS mode of the installed OpenSSL
  library. Your system must have a FIPS compliant OpenSSL library to use
  the {{role}} option.

  The default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: authenticationDatabase
args: <dbname>
directive: option
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Specifies the database that holds the user's credentials. If you do not
  specify an authentication database, the {{program}} assumes that the
  database specified as the argument to the :option:`--db` option holds
  the user's credentials.
optional: true

  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6
     Added support for the ``PLAIN`` and ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication
     mechanisms.

  Specifies the authentication mechanism the {{program}} instance uses to
  authenticate to the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - MONGODB-CR

       - MongoDB challenge/response authentication.

     * - MONGODB-X509

       - MongoDB SSL certificate authentication.

     * - PLAIN

       - External authentication using LDAP. You can also use ``PLAIN``
         for authenticating in-database users. ``PLAIN`` transmits
         passwords in plain text. This mechanism is available only in
         `MongoDB Enterprise
         <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise>`_.

     * - GSSAPI

program: _shared
name: dbpath
args: <path>
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies the directory of the MongoDB data files. The {{role}} option
  lets the {{program}} attach directly to the local data files without
  going through a running :program:`mongod`. When run with {{role}}, the
  {{program}} locks access to the data files. No :program:`mongod` can
  access the files while the {{program}} process runs.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: directoryperdb
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  When used in conjunction with the corresponding option in
  :program:`mongod`, allows the {{program}} to access data from MongoDB
  instances that use an on-disk format where every database has a distinct
  directory. This option is only relevant when specifying the
  :option:`--dbpath` option.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: journal
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  Enables the durability :term:`journal` to ensure data files remain valid
  and recoverable. This option applies only when you specify the
  :option:`--dbpath` option. The {{program}} enables journaling by default
  on 64-bit builds of versions after 2.0.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: db
aliases: -d
args: <database>
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies the name of the database on which to run the {{program}}.
