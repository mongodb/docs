Overview
--------

Restoring a single shard from backup with other unaffected shards
requires a number of special considerations and practices. This
document outlines the additional tasks you must perform when restoring
a single shard.

Consider the following resources on backups in general as well as
backup and restoration of sharded clusters specifically:

- :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster`
- :doc:`/administration/backups`

Procedure
---------

Always restore :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
as a whole. When you restore a single shard, keep in mind that the
:term:`balancer` process might have moved :term:`chunks <chunk>` to or
from this shard since the last backup. If that's the case, you must
manually move those chunks, as described in this procedure.

1. Restore the shard as you would any other :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance. See :doc:`/administration/backups` for overviews of these
   procedures.

#. For all chunks that migrate away from this shard, you do not need
   to do anything at this time. You do not need to delete these
   documents from the shard because the chunks are automatically
   filtered out from queries by :binary:`~bin.mongos`. You can remove
   these documents from the shard, if you like, at your leisure.

#. For chunks that migrate to this shard after the most recent backup,
   you must manually recover the chunks using backups of other shards,
   or some other source.  To determine what chunks have moved, view the
   ``changelog`` collection in the :ref:`config-database`.
