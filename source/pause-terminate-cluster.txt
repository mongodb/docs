Pause a Cluster
---------------

.. admonition:: Paused Clusters
   :class: note

   - Available for M10+ Clusters

   - Paused clusters are billed at a different rate.

   - You cannot modify a paused cluster.

   - You cannot read/write from a paused cluster.

   - Configured alerts will not trigger.

   - Backups will be stopped, but your existing snapshots will be
     available until they expire.

You can pause a cluster for 7 days. If you do not resume the cluster
within 7 days, |service| automatically resumes the cluster.

To pause a cluster:

1. Click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

#. For the cluster you wish to terminate, click on the :guilabel:`...`
   button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Pause Cluster`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Pause Cluster` to confirm.


Resume a Cluster
----------------

To resume a paused cluster:

1. Click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

#. For the paused cluster, click on the :guilabel:`Resume` button.

   Alternatively, for the paused cluster, click on the :guilabel:`...`
   button, and click :guilabel:`Resume Cluster`.

If you do not resume a paused cluster within 7 days, |service|
automatically resumes the cluster.

Terminate a Cluster
-------------------

To terminate an |service| cluster:

1. Click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

#. For the cluster you wish to terminate, click on the :guilabel:`...`
   button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Terminate`.

|service| executes the terminate operation after completing any in-progress
deployment changes.

|service| bills for the hours that the cluster was active. See :doc:`/billing`
for more information on |service| billing.

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that cluster.
   See :ref:`retention-policy`.
