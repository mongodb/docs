Field Names with Periods and Dollar Signs
=========================================

MongoDB allows field names that contain dollar signs (``$``) or periods (``.``). 
However, use of these characters within field names is discouraged, because
MongoDB does not support some features with these fields. 

In most cases data that has been stored using field names like these
is not directly accessible. You need to use helper methods like
:expression:`$getField`, :expression:`$setField`, and
:expression:`$literal` in queries that access those fields.

The field name validation rules are not the same for all types of
storage operations.
