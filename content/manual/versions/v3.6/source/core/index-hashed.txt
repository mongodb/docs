Hashed indexes maintain entries with hashes of the values of the
indexed field. 

Hashed indexes support :doc:`sharding </sharding>`
using hashed shard keys. :ref:`Hashed based sharding
<sharding-hashed-sharding>` uses a hashed index of a field as the shard
key to partition data across your sharded cluster.

Using a hashed shard key to shard a collection results in a more random
distribution of data. See :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding` for more
details.

Hashing Function
----------------

Hashed indexes use a hashing function to compute the
hash of the value of the index field. The hashing function collapses
embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire value but does
not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes.

Create a Hashed Index
---------------------

To create a :ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>`, specify
``hashed`` as the value of the index key, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { _id: "hashed" } )


Considerations
--------------

MongoDB supports ``hashed`` indexes of any single field. The hashing
function collapses embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire
value, but does not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes.

You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields
or specify a unique constraint on a ``hashed`` index; however, you can
create both a ``hashed`` index and an ascending/descending (i.e.
non-hashed) index on the same field: MongoDB will use the scalar index
for range queries.
