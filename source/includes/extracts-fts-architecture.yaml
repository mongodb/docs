  In this deployment model, the search ``mongot`` process runs alongside
  ``mongod`` on each node in the |service| {+cluster+}. The ``mongod`` 
  process routes queries to the ``mongot`` on the same node and they share
  the same resources.

  By default, |service| enables the |fts| ``mongot`` process on the same
  node that runs the ``mongod``   process when you create your first
  |fts| index. The ``mongot`` process   performs the actions described
  in :ref:`about-mongot`.

  When you enable |fts|, you can easily build search on top of your data
  with an integrated, fully managed search engine that automatically
  syncs to your database. |fts| provides a rich query language that uses
  |fts| aggregation pipeline stages like :pipeline:`$search` and
  :pipeline:`$searchMeta` for full-text search and
  :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` for semantic search in conjunction with 
  other MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages, and score-based results
  ranking.

  Deploying both the processes on the same node provides the following
  benefits.

  Reduced Latency 
    The communication between the MongoDB database ``mongod`` and the
    |fts| ``mongot`` processes happens locally, on the same node. This
    means that indexing and data retrieval operations for your search
    queries might be fast. Therefore, this significantly reduces
    latency. 
    
  Cost Efficiency 
    Running both processes on the same node might be more cost-efficient,
    depending on the resources provisioned for your {+cluster+}, than
    running the search process on a separate, dedicated node.

ref: fts-architecture-decoupled

  In this deployment model, the ``mongot`` process runs on Search Nodes,
  which are separate from the {+cluster+} nodes on which the ``mongod``
  process runs. |service| deploys Search Nodes with each {+cluster+} or
  with each shard on the {+cluster+}. 

  For example, if you deploy 2 Search Nodes for a {+cluster+} with 3
  shards, |service| deploys 6 Search Nodes, 2 per shard. You can also
  configure the number of Search Nodes and the amount of resources
  provisioned for each search node. 

  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, |service| automatically assigns a
  ``mongod`` for each ``mongot`` for indexing. The ``mongot`` communicates
  with the ``mongod`` to listen for and sync index changes for the indexes
  that it stores. |fts| indexes and processes your queries similar to when
  both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes run on the same node. To
  learn more, see :ref:`fts-about-indexing` and
  :ref:`fts-about-queries`. To learn more about deploying Search Nodes
  separately, see :ref:`configure-search-nodes`.

  .. note:: 

     You can't deploy Search Nodes separately for :ref:`serverless
     <create-new-serverless-instance>` {+clusters+}.
  
  When you migrate to Search Nodes, |service| deploys the Search Nodes,
  but doesn't serve queries on the nodes until it successfully builds
  all the indexes on the {+cluster+} on the Search Nodes. While
  |service| builds the indexes on the new nodes, it continues to serve
  queries using the indexes on the {+cluster+} nodes. |service| starts
  serving queries from the Search Nodes only after it successfully
  builds the indexes on the Search Nodes and removes the indexes on the
  {+cluster+} nodes. 

  If you delete all the Search Nodes on your {+cluster+}, there will be an 
  interruption in processing your search query results. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Modify a Cluster <scale-cluster-cloud-provider>`. If you delete
  your |service| {+cluster+}, |service| pauses and then deletes all
  associated |fts| deployments (``mongot`` processes).

  MongoDB supports separate Search Nodes on dedicated (``M10`` or higher)
  {+clusters+}. Search Nodes are deployed on compute-intensive NVMe
  instances. You must deploy a minimum of two nodes. You will be billed
  daily for hourly resource usage per node. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Search Node Costs <fts-search-node-costs>`.

ref: fts-stored-source-architecture
content: | 
  You can define :ref:`stored source <fts-stored-source-definition>` 
  fields in your |fts| index so that the ``mongot`` process can store the 
  specified fields on ``mongot``. You can then use the
  :ref:`returnStoredSource Option <fts-return-stored-source-option>` in 
  your |fts| query to retrieve the stored fields for matching documents
  directly from ``mongot`` instead of doing a full document lookup on the 
  database.
