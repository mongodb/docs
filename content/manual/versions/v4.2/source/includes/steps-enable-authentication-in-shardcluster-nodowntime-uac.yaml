   Use the :method:`db.createUser()` method to create an administrator
   user and assign it the following roles:

   - :authrole:`clusterAdmin` on the ``admin`` database
   - :authrole:`userAdmin` roles on the ``admin`` database

   Clients performing maintenance operations or user administrative
   operations on the {{CLUSTER}} must authenticate as this user
   at the completion of this tutorial. Create this user now to ensure
   that you have access to the cluster after enforcing authentication.

action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin");
    admin.createUser(
      {
        user: "admin",
        pwd: "<password>",
        roles: [
          { role: "clusterAdmin", db: "admin" },
          { role: "userAdmin", db: "admin" }
        ]
      }
    );

     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to prevent or hinder
     malicious access.

  In addition to the administrator user, you can create additional
  users before enforcing authentication.. This ensures access to the
  sharded cluster once you fully enforce authentication.

  .. example::

     The following operation creates the user ``joe`` on the
     ``marketing`` database, assigning to this user the
     :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``marketing`` database`.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.getSiblingDB("marketing").createUser(
          {
            "user": "joe",
            "pwd": "<password>",
            "roles": [ { "role" : "readWrite", "db" : "marketing" } ]
          }
        )

     Clients authenticating as ``"joe"`` can perform read and write
     operations on the ``marketing`` database.

  See :ref:`database-user-roles` for roles provided by MongoDB.

  See the :ref:`Add Users <add-new-user>` tutorial for more information on
  adding users. Consider :ref:`security best practices

title: "Update client applications to specify authentication credentials."
optional: true
ref: update-client-apps
pre: |

  While the sharded cluster does not currently enforce authentication, you can
  still update client applications to specify authentication credentials when
  connecting to the sharded cluster. This may prevent loss of connectivity at
  the completion of this tutorial.

  .. example::

     The following operation connects to the sharded cluster using the
     :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, authenticating as the user ``joe`` on the
     ``marketing`` database.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        mongo  --username "joe" --password "<password>" \
          --authenticationDatabase "marketing" --host mongos1.example.net:27017

     If your application uses a MongoDB driver, see the associated
     :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>` documentation for instructions on creating
     an authenticated connection.
