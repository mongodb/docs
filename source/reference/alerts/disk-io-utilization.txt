:ref:`System and disk alert <system-disk-alerts>` conditions can 
indicate IOPS issues.

Alert Conditions
----------------

:alert:`System: CPU (User) % is` measures the CPU usage of the 
processes on the node, normalized by the number of CPUs. This value is 
scaled to a range of 0-100%.

Common Triggers
---------------

A few common events may trigger these alerts:

- :manual:`Unoptimized queries </core/query-optimization/>`

- A one-time event, such as an :manual:`index build 
  </core/index-creation/>`.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider the following resolutions:

- :manual:`Optimize your queries </core/query-optimization/>`.

- Use the |service| :doc:`Performance Advisor
  </tutorial/performance-advisor/>` to view slow queries and suggested
  :manual:`indexes </indexes>`.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

- Review :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>` for
  possible further indexing improvements.

  .. note::

     A temporary spike in disk utilization may result when creating new
     indexes.

- :manual:`Analyze Query Performance </tutorial/analyze-query-plan/>`
  to review how your queries are using your indexes.

- Use a faster disk drive with more hardware resources.

- Move operations from disks with large workloads to different disks.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

To observe a high percentage of Disk I/O utilization, open the
:guilabel:`Hardware Metrics` section of the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab and 
find the following metrics:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Graph
     - Indicator
   * - Disk IOPS
     - |iops| value greater than the provisioned |iops| value
   * - Normalized System CPU
     - High :guilabel:`IOWait` curve

       IOWait measures the percentage of time the CPU runs idle waiting
       for an I/O operation to complete.
