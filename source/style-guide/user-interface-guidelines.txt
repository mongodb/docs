Helix is a MongoDB-chartered effort to unify the look, feel, and
functionality of MongoDB interfaces.

Helix is one system that includes the following components:

- A `design library <http://helix.rax.io/getting-started/design.html>`__
  that includes guidance on `text conventions for user interfaces <http://helix.rax.io/style/text-conventions.html>`__

  The text conventions include the following information:

  - `Alert and message guidelines <http://helix.rax.io/style/alert-messages.html>`__
  - `Capitalization <http://helix.rax.io/style/capitalization.html>`__
  - `Date and time <http://helix.rax.io/style/date-time.html>`__
  - `Punctuation <http://helix.rax.io/style/punctuation.html>`__
  - `Voice and tone <http://helix.rax.io/style/voice-and-tone.html>`__
  - `Writing guidelines <http://helix.rax.io/style/writing-guidelines.html>`__

- A `UI toolkit for developers
  <https://rackerlabs.github.io/helix-ui/>`__ that includes all the
  component templates for a user interface

You can access all Helix documentation and code,
including the Quick Start Guide, the Installation Guide, and the code
