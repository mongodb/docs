  configuration servers, in a comma separated list. **Always** use 3
  config servers in production environments.

  All :program:`mongos` instances **must** specify the exact same value for
  {{role}}

  If your configuration databases reside in more that one data center,
  order the hosts so that first config sever in the list is the closest to the
  majority of your :program:`mongos` instances.

     server is not available or offline.

  {{intro}} size in megabytes of each :term:`chunk` in the
  :term:`sharded cluster`. A size of 64 megabytes is ideal in most
  deployments: larger chunk size can lead to uneven data distribution;
  smaller chunk size can lead to inefficient movement of chunks between
  nodes.

  {{role}} affects chunk size *only* when you initialize the cluster
  for the first time. If you later modify the option, the new value has no
  effect. See the :doc:`/tutorial/modify-chunk-size-in-sharded-cluster`
  procedure if you need to change the chunk size on an existing sharded
  cluster.

program: mongos

args: null
default: 15
directive: option
description: |
  {{intro}} ping time, in milliseconds, that :program:`mongos` uses
  to determine which secondary replica set members to pass read
  operations from clients. The default value of ``15`` corresponds to
  the default value in all of the client :doc:`drivers
  </applications/drivers>`.

  When :program:`mongos` receives a request that permits reads to
  :term:`secondary` members, the :program:`mongos` will:

  - Find the member of the set with the lowest ping time.

  - Construct a list of replica set members that is within a ping time of
    15 milliseconds of the nearest suitable member of the set.

    If you specify a value for the {{role}} option, :program:`mongos` will
    construct the list of replica members that are within the latency
    allowed by this value.

  - Select a member to read from at random from this list.

  The ping time used for a member compared by the {{role}} setting is a
  moving average of recent ping times, calculated at most every 10
  seconds. As a result, some queries may reach members above the threshold
  until the :program:`mongos` recalculates the average.

  See the :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection`
  section of the :doc:`read preference </core/read-preference>`
  documentation for more information.

name: noAutoSplit
args: null
directive: option
description: |
  Disables :program:`mongos` from automatically splitting chunks for
  :term:`sharded collections <sharding>`. If set on all
  :program:`mongos` instances, this prevents MongoDB from creating new
  chunks as the data in a collection grows.

  Because any :program:`mongos` in a cluster can create a split, to
  totally disable splitting in a cluster you must set {{role}} on all
  :program:`mongos`.

  .. warning::

     With {{role}} specified, the data in your sharded
     cluster may become imbalanced over time. Use the option with caution.
