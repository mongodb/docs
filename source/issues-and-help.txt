We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Ruby community that
includes users with varying levels of experience using the
{+driver-short+}. The quickest way to get support for general questions
is through the :community-forum:`MongoDB Community Forums </tag/ruby>`.

Feedback Engine <https://feedback.mongodb.com/>`__ and select

your screen. You can propose improvements, report issues, and provide
other types of feedback by using this site.

You can also open a case in Jira, our issue management tool, to identify
bugs or propose improvements. The following steps describe how to create
a Jira issue:
