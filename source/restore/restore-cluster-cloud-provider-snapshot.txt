|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled cloud provider
snapshot. For information on cloud provider snapshot backups, see
:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`.

For instructions on restoring data from a
:doc:`continuous backup snapshot </backup/continuous-backups>`, see
:doc:`/restore-cluster`.

Restore Restrictions
--------------------

- .. include:: /includes/facts/no-pit-on-mongodb-42.rst

- |service| can only restore to a :term:`replica set` or
  :term:`sharded cluster` that uses the same encryption provider as
  the source snapshot cluster.

- The target cluster must run the same or newer release version of
  MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version.

Fallback Snapshots
------------------

If a scheduled snapshot fails for any reason, |service| attempts to
repeat the snapshot process. If necessary, you may use the resulting
fallback snapshot to :ref:`restore the cluster
<restoration-cloud-provider-snapshot>`. This isn't recommended:
fallback snapshots use a different process from regular snapshots. They
may contain inconsistent data.

Fallback snapshots are marked in the UI with a warning icon, and a
warning message appears in the restore modal window if the restore uses
a fallback snapshot.

.. warning::

   Restoring your cluster from a fallback snapshot may result in
   inconsistent data across your cluster, and should be considered an
   option of last resort.

Prerequisites

Procedure
---------

.. admonition:: Restoring Snapshots for Clusters using Encryption at Rest
   :class: important

   |service| automatically encrypts
   :ref:`Cloud Provider Snapshots <backup-cloud-provider>` for
   clusters using :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`, in addition to the
   existing encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot
   volumes. For documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, see
   :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`

   The following instructions only apply to snapshots for
   clusters not using Encryption at Rest.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Restore
      :tabid: snapshot-restore

      #. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
         are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
         You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Select a cluster's snapshot to restore.

         Click :guilabel:`Restore` or :guilabel:`Download`.

      #. Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

         - :ref:`Download your snapshot via HTTPS <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>`.

         - :ref:`Restore your snapshot to an Atlas cluster <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-atlas>`.

         - :ref:`Restore your snapshot to a Cloud Manager project <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-mms>`.

   .. tab:: Point-in-Time Restore
      :tabid: pit-restore

      You can enable Point-in-Time Restores when you :ref:`create
      <create-new-cluster>` or :ref:`scale <scale-cluster-backups>` a
      cluster.

      #. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service|
         backups are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are
         available. You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore` button on the far
         right side of the screen.

      #. Select either the :guilabel:`Date & Time` or :guilabel:`Oplog
         Timestamp` tab.

         .. note::

            If you select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` option, you can
            specify the time of restore with one minute of granularity.
            If you select the :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp` option, you
            can specify the time of restore with one second of
            granularity.

      #. Enter the desired point in time to restore from.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

      #. Choose a project and cluster to restore to from the dropdown
         menus.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.

.. _restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-atlas:

Restore your Snapshot to an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning.rst

You can restore to any |service| cluster in a project for which you
have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

1. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target cluster to
   which you want to restore.

   .. note::

      Restores improve their performance if the target cluster:

      - Exists in the same project as the snapshot.
      - Exists in the same cloud provider region as the snapshot.
      - Doesn't use |nvme| storage.
      - Equals or exceeds the disk size of the snapshotâ€™s original
        total, not used, disk size.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target cluster.

.. _restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-mms:

Restore your Snapshot to a Cloud Manager Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning.rst

1. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the
   target |mms| project to which you want to restore.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target
   cluster.

|mms| can only restore to a :term:`replica set` or
:term:`sharded cluster`. The target cluster must run the same or newer
version of MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version.

You can restore to any |mms| project for which the authenticated
|service| user has any of the following roles:

- :cloudmgr:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles#Organization-Owner>`
- :cloudmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles#Project-Owner>`
- :cloudmgr:`Project Backup Admin </reference/user-roles#Project-Backup-Admin>`

You must add the |ipaddr| or |cidr| addresses of the target |mms|
project to your |service| project :ref:`whitelist <whitelist>`. The
:guilabel:`Restore` prompt displays your
:guilabel:`Existing IP Whitelist`.

If the current project whitelist ranges do not cover the target |mms|
project |ipaddr| or |cidr| addresses, click
:guilabel:`Add or Modify your IP Addresses` to make changes to your
|service| project whitelist.

.. _restore-encrypted-snapshot:

Restore a Snapshot of a Cluster with Encryption at Rest
-------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   Snapshots of clusters using
   :doc:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management </security-kms-encryption>`
   can only restore to other clusters that use Encryption at Rest. You
   cannot restore a snapshot with Encryption at Rest to a |mms|
   project, nor can you download the snapshot.

   If the target project does not have a cluster with Encryption at
   Rest enabled, you can either
   :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a cluster with 
   Encryption at Rest, or :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
   in an existing cluster.

#. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click on the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

   If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
   are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
   You can enable backups when
   :ref:`modifying the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target |service|
   :guilabel:`Project` to which you want to restore. You can restore to
   any |service| project for which the authenticated |service| user has
   the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Cluster` to restore to. You can only restore
   to an |service| replica set running Encryption at Rest. The target
   cluster must run the same or greater version of MongoDB as the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Version` of the snapshot.


   After the restoration procedure, |service| triggers a key rotation
   for MongoDB encryption key. |service| then encrypts the new MongoDB
   encryption keys based on the configured Encryption at Rest provider
   for the target cluster.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target
   cluster.

.. topic:: Troubleshooting Encryption at Rest

   If |service| has an issue with the encryption of either the snapshot
   or the target cluster, it displays one of the following errors:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 60
      :stub-columns: 1
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Error

        - Result

      * - Cannot restore a non-encrypted snapshot to a cluster with
          Encryption at Rest enabled.

        - The snapshot cannot be restored to |service|.

      * - Target cluster does not have encryption enabled.

        - You can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
          a new target cluster with Encryption at Rest, or
          :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
          on your desired target cluster.

      * - Encryption provider of target cluster does not match selected
          snapshot's encryption provider.

        - The encryption provider for the snapshot and target cluster
          do not match. You can either:

          1. Create a new snapshot with the same encryption provider.
          #. Change the encryption provider for the target cluster.

      * - Encryption credentials on snapshot are not present.

        - |service| cannot restore a snapshot whose encryption key was
          deleted.

View Status of Snapshot Restorations
------------------------------------

|service| provides a detailed list of completed and in-progress
snapshot restorations, including when |service| took the snapshot and
the snapshot's delivery type. To view this list, from a cluster's
:guilabel:`Backup` tab, click the :guilabel:`Restore History` tab.

The :guilabel:`Status` column of the table displays the results of
completed snapshots, and the progress of snapshots currently
being restored.

- For manually downloaded snapshots, the :guilabel:`Status` column
  displays progress while |service| prepares the download link. Once
  the download is ready, the column displays the link to download the
  snapshot.

- For automated restores and Point-in-Time restores, the
  :guilabel:`Status` column updates as the restoration progresses on
  each node in the cluster. When the restoration completes, the column
  displays the time of completion and the cluster to which |service|
  restored the snapshot.
