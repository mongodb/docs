#: ../source/includes/warning-splitting-chunks.rst:3
msgid "Be careful when splitting data in a sharded collection to create new chunks. When you shard a collection that has existing data, MongoDB automatically creates chunks to evenly distribute the collection. To split data effectively in a sharded cluster you must consider the number of documents in a chunk and the average document size to create a uniform chunk size. When chunks have irregular sizes, shards may have an equal number of chunks but have very different data sizes. Avoid creating splits that lead to a collection with differently sized chunks."

msgid "To split chunks manually, use the :dbcommand:`split` command with either fields ``middle`` or ``find``. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the helper methods :method:`sh.splitFind()` and :method:`sh.splitAt()`."

msgid ":method:`~sh.splitFind()` splits the chunk that contains the *first* document returned that matches this query into two equally sized chunks. You must specify the full namespace (i.e. \"``<database>.<collection>``\") of the sharded collection to :method:`~sh.splitFind()`. The query in :method:`~sh.splitFind()` does not need to use the shard key, though it nearly always makes sense to do so."
