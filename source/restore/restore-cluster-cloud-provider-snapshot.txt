|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled cloud provider 
snapshot. For information on cloud provider snapshot backups, 
:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`.

For instructions on restoring data from a 
:doc:`continuous backup snapshot </backup/continuous-backups>`, see 
:doc:`/restore-cluster`.

Restore a Cluster
-----------------

To restore a cluster from a cloud provider snapshot: 

#. Click :guilabel:`Backup` in the left-hand navigation.

   The :guilabel:`Overview` lists the project's clusters. If the cluster
   has backup enabled, its :guilabel:`Status` is :guilabel:`Active`. If
   the cluster has backup disabled, its :guilabel:`Status` is
   :guilabel:`Inactive`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Cluster` to open the cluster view.

#. Click :guilabel:`Backup` to view the available snapshots for the 
   cluster.

#. Select your preferred restoration method

   You may choose to:

   - Click :guilabel:`Download` to retrieve your backup data via HTTPS 
     and restore manually. |service| generates a one-time use download 
     link that expires within 4 hours.

     \- or - 

   - Click :guilabel:`Restore` to have |service| restore to a selected 
     cluster. |service| can only restore to a replica set cluster.
     The target cluster must run the same or newer version of
     MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version.

     .. important::

        The restore process requires **downtime** for the target 
        cluster.

     You can choose to restore to a replica set cluster of a different 
     project: 
     
     - To restore to another |service| project, you must have 
       :authrole:`Project Owner <Owner>`
       role for the destination project.

     In the prompt for destination, specify the project and select one of
     its clusters.
