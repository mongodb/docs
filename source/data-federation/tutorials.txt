  Query data from multiple sources and write the results of those 
  queries to an |aws| |s3| bucket using {+adf+} :ref:`adf-out-stage` 
  syntax.

- `Copy data automatically from MongoDB to an AWS S3 bucket <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/automated-continuous-data-copying-from-mongodb-to-s3/>`__ -

  data from your |service| Cluster to your |aws| |s3| bucket 
  continuously on a schedule.
