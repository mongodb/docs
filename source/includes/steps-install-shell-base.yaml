   Run the following command from the directory containing the
   ``mongosh`` ``.tgz`` package:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongosh-{+version+}-linux.tgz

   The extracted ``bin`` folder contains two binaries: ``mongosh`` and
   ``mongocryptd-mongosh``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download or you extract the archive without the ``tar`` command,
   you may need to make the binaries executable. Run the following
   commands from the directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh
      chmod +x bin/mongocryptd-mongosh

   You can either:

   - Copy the ``mongosh`` binary into a directory listed in your
     ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Run the following
     commands from the directory where you extracted the download file:

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp mongosh /usr/local/bin/
       sudo cp mongocryptd-mongosh /usr/local/bin/

   - Create a symbolic link to the ``mongosh`` binary from a directory
     listed in your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Run
     the following commands from the directory where you extracted the
     download file:

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo ln -s bin/mongosh /usr/local/bin/
       sudo ln -s bin/mongocryptd-mongosh /usr/local/bin/
...
