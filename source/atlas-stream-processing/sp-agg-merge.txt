Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`$merge <streams-agg-pipeline-merge>` stage specifies a 
connection in the :ref:`Connection Registry <manage-spi-connection-add>` 
to write messages to. The connection must be an {+service+} connection.

A ``$merge`` pipeline stage has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "$merge": {
      "into": {
        "connectionName": "<registered-atlas-connection>",
        "db": "<registered-database-name>" | <expression>,
        "coll": "<atlas-collection-name>" | <expression>
      },
      "on": "<identifier field>" | [ "<identifier field1>", ...],
      "let": { 
        <var_1>: <expression>, 
        <var_2>: <expression>, 
        …, 
        <var_n>: <expression> 
      },
      "whenMatched": "replace | keepExisting | merge",
      "whenNotMatched": "insert | discard",
      "parallelism": <integer>
    }  
  }

.. _atlas-sp-agg-merge-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The {+atlas-sp+} version of :ref:`$merge <streams-agg-pipeline-merge>`
uses most of the same fields as the {+adf+} version. {+atlas-sp+} also
uses the following fields that are either unique to its implementation
of ``$merge``, or modified to suit it. To learn more about the fields
shared with {+adf+} ``$merge``, see :manual:`$merge syntax
</reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#merge-on>`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50 
   
   * - Field
     - Necessity
     - Description
      
   * - ``into``
     - Required
     - Simplified to reflect {+atlas-sp+} supporting ``$merge`` only
       into {+service+} connections.
      
       To learn more, see :ref:`this description <adf-merge-fields>`
       of the {+adf+} ``$merge`` fields.
        
   * - ``parallelism``
     - Conditional
     - Number of threads to which to distribute write operations.
       Must be an integer value between ``1``  and ``16``.
       Higher parallelism values increase throughput. However, higher
       values also require the stream processor and the cluster to which
       it writes to use more computational resources.

       If you use a dynamic expression value for ``into.coll`` or
       ``into.db``, you cannot set this value greater than ``1``.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-merge-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Limitations
```````````

``$merge`` must be the last stage of any pipeline it appears in. You can
use only one ``$merge`` stage per pipeline.

The ``on`` field has special requirements for ``$merge`` against
sharded collections. To learn more, see 
:manual:`$merge syntax </reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#merge-on>`.

If you use a dynamic expression value for ``into.coll`` or ``into.db``,
you cannot set a ``parallelism`` value greater than ``1``.

Dynamic Expressions
```````````````````

You can use a :manual:`dynamic expression 
</reference/operator/aggregation/#expression-operators>` as
the value of the following fields: 

- ``into.db``
- ``into.coll``

This enables your stream processor to write messages to different 
target {+service+} collections on a message-by-message basis.

.. example::

   You have a stream of transaction events that generates messages of 
   the following form:

   .. code-block:: json

      { 
        "customer": "Very Important Industries",
        "customerStatus": "VIP",
        "tenantId": 1,
        "transactionType": "subscription"
      }

      { 
        "customer": "N. E. Buddy",
        "customerStatus": "employee",
        "tenantId": 5,
        "transactionType": "requisition"
      }

      { 
        "customer": "Khan Traktor",
        "customerStatus": "contractor",
        "tenantId": 11,
        "transactionType": "billableHours"
      }

   To sort each of these into a distinct {+service+} database and 
   collection, you can write the following ``$merge`` stage:

   .. code-block:: json

      $merge: {
        into: {
          connectionName: "db1",
          db: "$customerStatus",
          coll: "$transactionType"
	}
      }

   This ``$merge`` stage:

   - Writes the ``Very Important Industries`` message to a {+service+} 
     collection named ``VIP.subscription``. 
   - Writes the ``N. E. Buddy`` message to a {+service+} 
     collection named ``employee.requisition``. 
   - Writes the ``Khan Traktor`` message to a {+service+} 
     collection named ``contractor.billableHours``. 

You can only use dynamic expressions that evaluate to strings. For more 
information on dynamic expressions, see :manual:`expression operators 
</reference/operator/aggregation/#expression-operators>`.

If you specify a database or collection with a dynamic expression, but 
{+atlas-sp+} cannot evaluate the expression for a given message, 
{+atlas-sp+} sends that message to the :term:`dead letter queue` if configured 
and processes subsequent messages. If there is no :term:`dead letter queue` 
configured, then {+atlas-sp+} skips the message completely and processes 
subsequent messages.

Saving Data from Kafka Topics
`````````````````````````````

To save streaming data from multiple {+kafka-topics+} into collections 
in your |service| {+cluster+}, use the ``$merge`` stage with 
the :pipeline:`$source` stage. The ``$source`` stage 
specifies the topics from which to read data. The ``$merge``
stage writes the data to the target collection. 

Use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 1-6

   {
     "$source": {
       "connectionName": "<registered-kafka-connection>",
       "topic": [ "<topic-name-1>", "<topic-name-2>", ... ]
     }
   },  
   {
     "$merge": {
       "into": {
         "connectionName": "<registered-atlas-connection>",
         "db": "<registered-database-name>" | <expression>,
         "coll": "<atlas-collection-name>" | <expression>
         }
       },
       ...
   }

.. _atlas-sp-agg-merge-examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A streaming data source generates detailed weather reports from
various locations, conformant to the schema of the :ref:`Sample
Weather Dataset <sample-weather>`. The following aggregation has three
stages:

1. The :pipeline:`$source` stage establishes a connection with the
   {+kafka+} broker collecting these reports in a topic named
   ``my_weatherdata``, exposing each record as it is ingested to the
   subsequent aggregation stages. This stage also overrides the name
   of the timestamp field it projects, setting it to
   ``ingestionTime``.

2. The :pipeline:`$match` stage excludes documents that have a
   ``dewPoint.value`` of less than or equal to ``5.0`` and passes
   along the documents with ``dewPoint.value`` greater than ``5.0`` to
   the next stage.

3. The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output to an {+service+}
   collection named ``stream`` in the ``sample_weatherstream``
   database. If no such database or collection exist, {+service+}
   creates them.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true
   
   {
     '$source': {
       connectionName: 'sample_weatherdata',
       topic: 'my_weatherdata',
       tsFieldName: 'ingestionTime'
     }
   },
   { '$match': { 'dewPoint.value': { '$gt': 5 } } },
   {
     '$merge': {
       into: {
	 connectionName: 'weatherStreamOutput',
	 db: 'sample_weatherstream',
	 coll: 'stream'
       }
     }
   }

To view the documents in the resulting ``sample_weatherstream.stream``
collection, connect to your {+service+} cluster and run the following command:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: json

      db.getSiblingDB("sample_weatherstream").stream.find()

   .. output::
      :language: json

.. note::

   The preceding is a representative example. Streaming data are
   not static, and each user sees distinct documents.
