==========================================
Update the MongoDB Version of a Deployment
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This tutorial describes how to use the :doc:`API </api>` to migrate a
MongoDB deployment to a new version of MongoDB. These steps assume you
have an existing deployment that uses a ``2.4.x`` version of MongoDB, as
would be the case if you used the tutorial to
:doc:`/tutorial/create-cluster-with-api`, that you will migrate to a
``2.6``-or-later deployment.

Beginning with version ``2.6``, MongoDB implemented a new format for
:manual:`MongoDB configuration options
</reference/configuration-options>`. These steps describe how to modify an
existing ``2.4`` sharded cluster to conform to the ``2.6`` configuration
format.

Prerequisite
