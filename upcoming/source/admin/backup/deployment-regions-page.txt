|onprem| supports backup regionalization, which allows each cluster or
shard to read from and write to snapshot stores in a region you
choose. To enable regionalized backup, you must configure deployment
regions. You then bind backup resources such as :ref:`snapshot stores
<blockstores-page>` or :opsmgr:`backup daemons
</reference/glossary/#std-term-Backup-Daemon>` to these deployment
regions.

.. note:: 

   You can't delete deployment regions that are currently bound to
   backup resources. 

The deployment region page lists all available deployment regions, and
allows you to define new deployment regions.

.. important::

   Regional backups ensure storage isolation of cluster data
   backup. Backup metadata, monitoring, and other |onprem| data not
   related to the specific cluster backup data can still move across
   regions depending on your |onprem| deployment configuration.

   To ensure data isolation during restore procedures, you must
   execute restores only against endpoints in that deployment's
   configured deployment region. This requirement applies when you
   restore replica sets and sharded clusters, as well as queryable
   restores.

   To fulfill backup data sovereignty requirements, you must ensure
   that you configure all backup and restore endpoints correctly and a
   user doesn't request an operation that causes backup data to move
   across regions.

   To further protect against unintentional cross-region backup or
   restore, consider configuring network restrictions for your data
   centers.

Add New Deployment Regions 
--------------------------

To define a new deployment region:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add New Deployment Region`.

   .. step:: Configure the deployment region.

      In the :guilabel:`Set up a Deployment Region`
      window, provide values for the following fields:

      .. include:: /includes/list-tables/deployment-regions/deployment-regions-with-id-ui.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. _deployment-regions-edit:

Edit a Deployment Region 
------------------------

To make changes to a deployment region, perform the following steps: 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Open the modal to edit a deployment region.

      For the deployment region that you want to modify: 

      a. Click the :icon:`ellipsis-h` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column.
      #. Select :guilabel:`Edit` from the dropdown.

         The :guilabel:`Set up a Deployment Region` modal displays.

   .. step:: Modify the deployment region.

      In the :guilabel:`Set up a Deployment Region`
      modal, make changes to any of the following fields:

      .. include:: /includes/list-tables/deployment-regions/deployment-regions-ui.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. _deployment-regions-assign:

Assign a Deployment Region for a Shard 
--------------------------------------

To assign a deployment region to a new shard, perform the following
steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Assign` button.

      You can find the :guilabel:`Assign` button in the
      :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` dashboard the following ways: 

      - Hover over the cluster status :guilabel:`Misconfigured`.
      - Click the :icon:`ellipsis-h` in the :guilabel:`Options` column. 

      The :guilabel:`Start Backup` modal displays.

   .. step:: Configure the deployment region.

      Select a deployment region from the :guilabel:`Select region`
      dropdown. You can't modify deployment regions configured for
      existing members. 

      .. note:: 

         To change the deployment region for a member, you must first
         stop and terminate the current backup job, and then start a new
         backup job in the new region.

      Ensure that the deployment region that you select has snapshot,
      oplog, and sync stores configured for that region. |mms| displays
      an error if there are no daemons bound to any of the selected
      deployment regions. 

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Start`.

      When you assign a deployment region to a shard, |mms| does the
      following: 
      
      - Assigns snapshot, oplog, and sync stores and daemons to the
        backup jobs.
      - Resumes oplog tailing and takes snapshots
      - Resolves project alarms.
