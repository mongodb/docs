You may choose to live migrate a source replica set running MongoDB
{+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+ to a sharded destination MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+
or {+c2c-version-7+}+ {+cluster+}.
In this case, you might specify the sharding configuration, similar to the
following example, in the live migration {+atlas-ui+}. 

MongoDB shards only those collections that you include into the ``shardingEntries``
array. The array specifies which collections to shard. To learn more,
see :manual:`Sharding </sharding>`.

If you choose to omit the sharding configuration during the migration,
you can shard collections on the destination {+cluster+} after you migrate
your {+cluster+} to |service|.

.. code-block:: json

   {
    "shardingEntries": [
               {
                   "database": "database-name",
                   "collection": "collection-name",
                   "shardCollection": {
                      "key": [
                         { "location": 1 },
                         { "region": 1 }
                      ]
                   }
               }
            ]
   }

In addition to this configuration, the |service| destination {+cluster+}
also needs a compatible index for the specified sharding keys. When starting
the migration via the {+atlas-ui+}, you can configure MongoDB to create
these supporting indexes automatically.
