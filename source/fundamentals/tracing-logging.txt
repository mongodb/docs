Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to configure
**tracing** and **logging** for your application. Tracing and logging
are two frameworks for observing your application. Logging allows you to
view a discrete, event-based log of driver activities, while tracing
provides a continuous view. Logs might help you identify an issue in
your application, while a trace might help you locate the reason for the
issue.

In the {+driver-short+}, the functionalities of tracing and logging do not
differ greatly. However, when you enable tracing, the driver emits messages in a
more structured format, which can make it easier for your application to
consume event messages programmatically.

Tracers and loggers log messages at a severity, or verbosity, level that you
can specify. By enabling one of these components in your application,
you can receive information about your application's activities at a
high level, a detailed level, or somewhere in between.

.. tip::

   To learn more about logging severity levels, see the Wikipedia entry on
   the :wikipedia:`Syslog standard for message logging <Syslog#Severity_level>`.

Enable Tracing and Logging
--------------------------

The driver implements the `tracing <https://crates.io/crates/tracing>`__
crate to enable the driver to emit messages for driver events.

.. important:: tracing Crate is Unstable
   
   Since the ``tracing`` crate currently does not have a 1.0 version
   release, you should consider the functionality to be unstable.

To enable tracing, logging, or both, you must add the ``tracing``
dependency and the ``tracing-unstable`` feature flag to your ``mongodb``
dependency in your ``Cargo.toml`` file:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 6

   [dependencies]
   tracing = "{+tracing-version+}"

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = ["tracing-unstable"]

The following table describes components that you can emit events
against and their corresponding targets:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Target
     - Description

   * - Command
     - ``mongodb::command``
     - Events describe commands sent to the database and whether they
       succeed or fail.

   * - Server selection
     - ``mongodb::server_selection``
     - Events describe the driver's process of selecting a server in a
       MongoDB deployment.

   * - Connection
     - ``mongodb::connection``
     - Events describe the behavior of driver connection pools and the
       connections they contain.

To specify the logging component and severity level, you can set the
``RUST_LOG`` environment variable when you compile and run your
application. Specify the logging component by setting the value of
``RUST_LOG`` to one of the targets provided in the preceding table,
along with a severity level.

The following code shows a command to execute a program that records
connection events at the ``debug`` level:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ RUST_LOG='mongodb::connection=debug' cargo run

The following sections describe how to consume events using either
:ref:`tracing <rust-tracing>` or :ref:`logging <rust-logging>`.

.. _rust-tracing:

Implement Tracing
-----------------

To enable tracing, you must also add the ``tracing-subscriber``
dependency to your ``Cargo.toml`` file. The following code shows a
sample dependencies list that contains the driver dependencies and the
``tracing-subscriber`` crate:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   [dependencies]
   tracing = "{+tracing-version+}"
   tracing-subscriber = "{+tracing-sub-version+}"

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = ["tracing-unstable"]

Then, in your application, you must register a type implementing the
``tracing::Subscriber`` trait to consume events with tracing. The
following code shows how to register a tracing subscriber that uses the
specifications of the ``RUST_LOG`` environment variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/tracing.rs
   :start-after: begin-subscriber
   :end-before: end-subscriber
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about registering a subscriber, see the ``tracing``
   `documentation <https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#in-executables>`__.

If you run your application and trace against commands at the ``debug``
level, the driver emits messages whenever you execute an operation. The
following code shows the command for this tracing specification:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ RUST_LOG='mongodb::command=debug' cargo run

With ``debug`` level tracing specified, when you perform a write
operation, the driver generates trace messages:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: false

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/tracing.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-operation
      :end-before: end-operation

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      2023-07-21T17:37:13.587794Z DEBUG mongodb::command: Command started topologyId="..." command="{\"insert\":\"test_coll\", ...}" databaseName="test" commandName="insert" requestId=12 driverConnectionId=1 serverConnectionId=133839 serverHost="..." serverPort=27017
      2023-07-21T17:37:13.630401Z DEBUG mongodb::command: Command succeeded topologyId="..." reply="{\"n\":1, ...}" commandName="insert" requestId=12 driverConnectionId=1 serverConnectionId=133839 serverHost="..." serverPort=27017 durationMS=42

.. _rust-logging:

Implement Logging
-----------------

To enable logging, you must also add the ``log`` or ``log-always`` feature
flag to the ``tracing`` dependency in your ``Cargo.toml`` file. You also
need to add a dependency for a logging crate, such as ``env_logger``:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3
   
   [dependencies]
   tracing = { version = "{+tracing-version+}", features = ["log"] }
   env_logger = "0.10.0"

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = ["tracing-unstable"]

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``log`` and ``log-always`` flags, see the
   ``tracing`` `documentation <https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#emitting-log-records>`__.

   To learn more about the third-party logging crate ``env_logger``, see
   its `documentation <https://crates.io/crates/env_logger>`__.

Then, in your application, you must register a global logger to consume
events with logging. The following code shows how to register a logger
that uses the specifications of the ``RUST_LOG`` environment variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.rs
   :start-after: begin-logger
   :end-before: end-logger
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. tip:: Alternative Logging Configurations

   To see examples of other ways to configure the logger,
   visit the ``env_logger`` :github:`GitHub repository <rust-cli/env_logger/tree/main/examples>`.

If you run your application and log against connections at the ``debug``
level, the driver emits messages whenever you open, use, and close a
connection. The following code shows the command for this logging
specification:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ RUST_LOG='mongodb::connection=debug' cargo run

With ``debug`` level tracing specified, when you open and use a connection,
the driver generates log messages:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: false

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/logging.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-operation
      :end-before: end-operation

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      [2023-07-21T18:13:00Z DEBUG mongodb::connection] Connection pool created topologyId="..." serverHost="..." serverPort=27017
      [2023-07-21T18:13:00Z DEBUG mongodb::connection] Connection pool created topologyId="..." serverHost="..." serverPort=27017
      [2023-07-21T18:13:00Z DEBUG mongodb::connection] Connection pool created topologyId="..." serverHost="..." serverPort=27017
