Overview
--------

In this section, you can find complete tutorials that provide detailed
explanations of common aggregation tasks in a step-by-step format. The
tutorials are adapted from examples in the book `Practical MongoDB
Aggregations <https://www.practical-mongodb-aggregations.com/>`__
by Paul Done.

The tutorials include examples for each of the :driver:`official
MongoDB drivers </>`. Use the :guilabel:`Select your language` drop-down
menu in the upper-right of each tutorial to set the programming language
for the examples.

Each tutorial includes the following sections:

- **About This Task**: Describes the purpose and common use cases of the
  aggregation type. This section also describes the example and desired
  outcome that the tutorial demonstrates.

- **Before You Begin**: Provides the template app for each
  language that explains where to add the aggregation
  stages. This section also shows sample code to create the necessary databases,
  collections, and sample data on which you run the aggregation pipeline.

- **Steps**: Walks you through how to build and run the aggregation
  pipeline. This section describes each stage of the completed
  aggregation tutorial, and then explains how to run and interpret the
  output of the aggregation.
