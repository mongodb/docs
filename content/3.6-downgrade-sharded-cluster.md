# Downgrade 3.6 Sharded Cluster to 3.4

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.


## Downgrade Path

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


## Create Backup

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


## Considerations

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

* [``sh.enableSharding()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.enableSharding/#sh.enableSharding) 

* [``sh.shardCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#sh.shardCollection) 

* [``sh.addShard()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.addShard/#sh.addShard) 

* [``db.createCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/#db.createCollection) 

* [``db.collection.drop()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.drop/#db.collection.drop) 

* [``db.dropDatabase()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.dropDatabase/#db.dropDatabase) 

* any operation that creates a database 

* any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way. See [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) for a complete list of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) page modify the cluster metadata. 


## Prerequisites

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any 3.6 features [incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4 or earlier versions as outlined
below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

<span id="downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster"></span>


### 1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version

1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance. 

2. Downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.4"``. 

   ```javascript

   db.adminCommand({setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"})

   ```

   The [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command performs writes
   to an internal system collection and is idempotent. If for any reason
   the command does not complete successfully, retry the command on the
   [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance.

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica set
member and each config server replica set member and check the
``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

Tip: For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
following command against a shard replica set member, you must
connect to the member as a [shard local user](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#shard-local-users).

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

```

All members should return a result that includes:

```javascript

"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }

```

If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` that includes
either a ``version`` value of ``"3.6"`` or a ``targetVersion`` field,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"3.4"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see [View FeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#view-fcv).


### 2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features

Remove all persisted features that are [incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4. For example, if you have defined
any any view definitions, document validators, and partial index
filters that use 3.6 query features such as [``$jsonSchema``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/#op._S_jsonSchema) or
[``$expr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/expr/#op._S_expr), you must remove them.


## Procedure


### Downgrade a Sharded Cluster

Warning: Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible features for each node before downgrading. 


#### Step 1: Download the latest 3.4 binaries.

Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
release in the 3.4 series. If using a package manager, add a new
repository for the 3.4 binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
process.

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


#### Step 2: Disable the Balancer.

Turn off the balancer as described in
[Disable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily).


#### Step 3: Downgrade the ``mongos`` instances.

Downgrade the binaries and restart.


#### Step 4: Downgrade each shard, one at a time.

Downgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

1. Downgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time: 

   1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.6 binary with the 3.4 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g. ``--bind_ip``. 

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      Or if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      include [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole), [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port), and any other
      configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp), and start:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before downgrading the next secondary member. To check the memberâ€™s state, you can issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell. 

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary. 

   Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use
   [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an
   election of a new primary:

   ```javascript

   rs.stepDown()

   ```

3. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, downgrade the stepped-down primary: 

   1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.4 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g. ``--bind_ip``. 

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>  --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      Or if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      include [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole), [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port), and any other
      configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp), and start the 3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```


#### Step 5: Downgrade the config servers.

If the config servers are replica sets:

1. Downgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time: 

   1. Shut down the secondary [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.6 binary with the 3.4 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and ``--port`` options. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g. ``--bind_ip``. 

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>  --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole), [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port), and any other
      configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp), and start the 3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before downgrading the next secondary member. To check the memberâ€™s state, issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell. 

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary. 

   1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an election of a new primary: 

      ```javascript

      rs.stepDown()

      ```

   2. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.4 binary. 

   3. Start the 3.4 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and ``--port`` options. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g. ``--bind_ip``. 

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole), [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port), and any other
      configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp), and start the 3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```


#### Step 6: Re-enable the balancer.

Once the downgrade of sharded cluster components is
complete, [re-enable the balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-enable).
