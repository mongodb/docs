Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about configuring your application to use a
forking web server.

When using {+odm+} with a forking web server, adhere to the following
guidelines:

- If possible, do not perform any MongoDB operations in the parent
  process before forking. To learn more about how the {+ruby-driver+}
  handles forking, see :ruby:`Usage with Forking Servers
  </reference/create-client/#usage-with-forking-servers>` in the driver
  documentation.

- You can avoid connection errors such as ``Mongo::Error::SocketError``
  and ``Mongo::Error::NoServerAvailable`` by performing the following actions:

  1. Disconnect MongoDB clients in the parent {+language+} process
     immediately *before* forking by using the
     ``Mongoid.disconnect_clients`` method. This ensures that the parent and
     child processes do not accidentally reuse the same sockets and have
     I/O conflicts. ``Mongoid.disconnect_clients`` does not disrupt any
     in-flight MongoDB operations, and automatically reconnects when you
     perform new operations.

  #. Reconnect your MongoDB clients in the child {+language+} process
     immediately *after* forking by using the
     ``Mongoid.reconnect_clients`` method. This is required to respawn
     the driver's monitoring threads in the child process.

Most web servers provide hooks that your application can use to
perform actions when the worker processes are forked. The following
sections provide configuration examples for some common {+language+} web
servers.

Puma
----

Use the ``on_worker_boot`` hook to reconnect clients in the workers. Use
the ``before_fork`` and ``on_refork`` hooks to close clients in the
parent process. To learn more about these hooks, see `Clustered mode
hooks <https://puma.io/puma/#clustered-mode-hooks>`__ in the Puma
API documentation.

The following code uses the ``on_worker_boot``, ``before_fork``, and
``on_refork`` hooks in a sample Puma configuration file:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :caption: config/puma.rb

   # Runs in the Puma master process before it forks a child worker.
   before_fork do
     Mongoid.disconnect_clients
   end
 
   # Required when using Puma's fork_worker option. Runs in the
   # child worker 0 process before it forks grandchild workers.
   on_refork do
     Mongoid.disconnect_clients
   end
 
   # Runs in each Puma child process after it forks from its parent.
   on_worker_boot do
     Mongoid.reconnect_clients
   end

Unicorn
-------

Use the ``before_fork`` hook to close clients in the parent process. Use
the ``after_fork`` hook to reconnect clients in the workers. To
learn more about these hooks, see `Configurator
<https://yhbt.net/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html>`__ in the Unicorn
API documentation.

The following code uses the ``before_fork`` and ``after_fork``
hooks in a sample Unicorn configuration file:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :caption: config/unicorn.rb

   before_fork do |_server, _worker|
     Mongoid.disconnect_clients
   end
 
   after_fork do |_server, _worker|
     Mongoid.reconnect_clients
   end

Passenger
---------

Use the ``starting_worker_process`` hook to reconnect clients in the
workers. To learn more about this hook, see `Smart spawning hooks
<https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/indepth/ruby/spawn_methods/#smart-spawning-hooks>`__
in the Passenger documentation.

.. note::

   Passenger does have a hook that is invoked in the
   parent process before the workers are forked.

The following code uses the ``starting_worker_process`` hook to
reconnect clients:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
     PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
       Mongoid.reconnect_clients if forked
     end
   end
