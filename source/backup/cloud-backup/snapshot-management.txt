While most {+service+} snapshot operations are automated according to
your :ref:`backup policies <configure-backup-policy>`, you can also:

- View snapshots
- Manually delete snapshots
- Initiate on-demand snapshots between planned backups.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view backup snapshots, you must have at least
:authrole:`Project Read Only` access to the project. Users with 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a 
:authrole:`Project Read Only` access to the project before they can 
view backup policies.

To take or delete a backup snapshot, you must have
:authrole:`Project Backup manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` 
access to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
access must add themselves as a :authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or 
:authrole:`Project Owner` to the project before they can take or delete 
a backup snapshot.

.. _delete-snapshot:

Delete a Backup Snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, you 
   can't delete a backup snapshot.

You can delete a snapshot using either the {+atlas-cli+} or the
{+atlas-ui+}. To delete all copies of a snapshot affected by a 
multi-region :ref:`Snapshot Distribution <snapshot-distribution>` 
policy without deleting the policy itself, delete the snapshot from its
original region.

      - For non-sharded clusters, delete the snapshot programmatically
        with `Remove One Replica Set Cloud Backup 
        <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Cloud-Backups/operation/deleteReplicaSetBackup>`__.
      - For sharded clusters, delete the snapshot programmatically with
        `Remove One Sharded Cluster Cloud Backup 
        <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Cloud-Backups/operation/deleteShardedClusterBackup>`__.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To delete a snapshot from the {+atlas-ui+}, perform the following procedure:

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-page.rst
         
         .. step:: Select the snapshot to delete.
            
            Select the snapshot you wish to delete from the list under 
            the :guilabel:`Snapshots` tab and click :icon:`trash-alt`.

Deleting the original snapshot by any of these methods will propagate
the deletion to all copies of that snapshot.

View Backup Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

By default, |service| displays both on-demand and policy-based
snapshots. To view only policy-based snapshots:

1. Click :guilabel:`Policy` under :guilabel:`View Snapshots by`.

   Alternatively, click :guilabel:`On-demand` to display only snapshots
   taken by clicking :guilabel:`Take Snapshot Now`.

Snapshots taken according to your backup policy display the frequency of
the policy item that generated the snapshot in the
:guilabel:`Frequency` column: ``Yearly``, ``Monthly``, ``Weekly``, 
``Daily``, or ``Hourly``.

.. _on-demand-snapshots:

Take On-Demand Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| takes on-demand snapshots immediately, unlike scheduled
snapshots which occur at
:oas-atlas-op:`regular intervals 
</getBackupSchedule>`. If there is already an on-demand snapshot with 
a status of ``queued`` or ``inProgress``, you must wait until |service| 
has completed the on-demand snapshot before taking another. If there is
already a scheduled snapshot with a status of ``queued`` or 
``inProgress``, you may queue an on-demand snapshot.

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>` with 
   a specified retention time for on-demand snapshots, you can't 
   decrease the retention time for an on-demand snapshot after 
   it's taken.
