Select a Connection Method
--------------------------

When you connect to an existing |service| account from the 
{+atlas-cli+}, you can authenticate with one of the following options for the ``atlas auth login`` command:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-atlas-cli-auth.rst

.. important::

   For {+atlas-cli+} versions before 1.47, |api| keys are stored in 
   plaintext in the {+atlas-cli+} configuration file. Your |api| keys 
   are like passwords. Ensure that you secure the configuration file 
   appropriately. {+atlas-cli+} 1.47+ attempts to store credentials 
   securely. 

To create a new |service| account or onboard an existing account that
doesn't have any {+clusters+}, see :ref:`atlas-cli-onboarding`.

Select a use case below to learn more about the available connection
options:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Non-programmatic Use
      :tabid: user-account

      Use the ``atlas auth login`` command with the ``UserAccount`` 
      option to authenticate with your |service| login credentials and 
      a one-time authentication token. The ``UserAccount`` option 
      requires manual login and verification of an authentication 
      token, which is valid for 12 hours. |api| keys are
      optional when connecting with the ``UserAccount`` option.

      After you run ``atlas auth login`` with the ``UserAccount`` 
      option, you can:

      - :ref:`Connect with minimum required settings <skip-profile-setup>` and specify
        the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags with each command. This is the
        quickest way to get started for first-time login.
      - Save your connection settings in a :ref:`profile <atlas-cli-profiles>`. 
        :ref:`Profiles <atlas-cli-profiles>` store the project IDs, organization
        IDs, and, optionally, |api| keys to use in future {+atlas-cli+}
        sessions. To save time, you can specify a profile instead of using the
        ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags with each command.

   .. tab:: Service Account
      :tabid: service-account
      
      When you run the ``atlas auth login`` command with the 
      ``ServiceAccounts`` option, the {+atlas-cli+} prompts you to 
      provide your client ID and secret. The ``ServiceAccounts`` option 
      is good for programmatic use because it allows you to automate 
      and manage MongoDB resources. Service Accounts, also referred to 
      as OAuth applications, allows programmatic access through the 
      specified secure client ID and secret. This method works well for 
      scripting use cases and continuous integration or delivery 
      workflows.

      .. note::

         This process is interactive. For programmatic authentication, 
         set the ``MONGODB_ATLAS_CLIENT_ID`` and 
         ``MONGODB_ATLAS_CLIENT_SECRET`` environment variables before 
         you use the {atlas-cli+}. To learn more about all the 
         supported environment variables, see :ref:`atlas-cli-env-vars`.
   
   .. tab:: API Keys
      :tabid: api-keys

      You must :ref:`configure API keys <atlas-admin-api-access>` to
      authenticate with this command. 
      
      When you run the ``atlas auth login`` command with the 
      ``APIKeys`` option, the {+atlas-cli+} prompts you to provide
      your |api| keys and automatically creates a profile that
      stores the |api| keys. The ``APIKeys`` option is good for 
      programmatic use because it doesn't require manual login or
      token verification.

      When you use connect using the ``atlas auth login`` command with the ``APIKeys`` option, you can:

      - :ref:`Connect with minimum required settings <skip-profile-setup>` and
        specify the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags with each command. This
        is the quickest way to get started for first-time login.
      - Save additional connection settings in a :ref:`profile <atlas-cli-profiles>`. 
        :ref:`Profiles <atlas-cli-profiles>` store the project IDs, organization
        IDs, and, optionally, |api| keys to use in future {+atlas-cli+}
        sessions. To save time, you can specify a profile instead of using the
        ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags with each command.

Connect With Minimum Required Settings
--------------------------------------

Select a use case and follow the steps to connect from the {+atlas-cli+} with
minimum required settings.


Complete the Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Non-programmatic Use
      :tabid: user-account

      - :ref:`Install the {+atlas-cli+} <install-atlas-cli>`.
      - Add your host's IP address to the :ref:`IP access list <access-list>`.
  
        If you authenticate with your |service| user credentials
        and your organization's owners enable :atlas:`IP access list for the Atlas UI for an organization
        </tutorial/manage-organizations/#require-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-ui>`,
        your IP address must be added to the IP access list to run commands
        in this organization. To learn more, see :atlas:`Require IP Access List for the Atlas UI
        </tutorial/manage-organizations/#require-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-ui>`.


   .. tab:: Service Account
      :tabid: service-account

      Before you start, ensure you have:
      
      - The :ref:`{+atlas-cli+} installed <install-atlas-cli>`.
      - An active |service| organization.
      - A Service Account created and configured. To learn more, see 
        :atlas:`Grant Programmatic Access to an Organization 
        </configure-api-access/#grant-programmatic-access-to-an-organization>`.
      - The client ID and secret of your Service Account.

   .. tab:: API Keys
      :tabid: api-keys

      - :ref:`Install the {+atlas-cli+} <install-atlas-cli>`.
      - :ref:`Configure API keys <atlas-admin-api-access>`.


Follow These Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select a use case and follow the procedure to quickly connect
from the {+atlas-cli+}.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Non-programmatic Use
      :tabid: user-account

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-cli-auth-nonprog-default.rst

         .. step:: Select the ``UserAccount`` option and press ``Enter``.
         
         .. step:: Sign into |service|.

            If you aren't signed in already, sign into your |service| account
            in the browser.

         .. step:: Enter the authorization code.

            Paste your activation code into the browser and click
            :guilabel:`Confirm Authorization`.

         .. step:: Return to the {+atlas-cli+} and accept the default profile options.

            Return to the terminal. If you connect successfully, you see a
            message:

            ``Successfully logged in as {Your Email Address}.``

            Accept the default profile configuration by pressing :guilabel:`Enter` if the following options display:

            - ``Default Org ID``
            - ``Default Project ID``
            - ``Default Output Format``
            - ``Default MongoDB Shell Path``

            .. important:: 

               If you previously set up any profiles with |api| keys for
               MongoCLI, your profiles :ref:`migrate automatically <migrate-to-atlas-cli>`. 
               Some migrated profiles might cause {+atlas-cli+} commands to fail
               when authenticating
               with ``atlas auth login``. The following message displays
               when you run ``atlas auth login`` if there is a conflict:

               .. code-block:: text

                  There was an error fetching your organizations: Global user is
                  from outside access listed subnets.
               
               To fix the conflict, open the :ref:`configuration file
               <config-toml-location>`, remove the default profile, and
               run ``atlas auth login`` again.

         .. step:: Issue commands using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            When you run :ref:`{+atlas-cli+} commands <atlas>` for
            the duration of your {+atlas-cli+} session, specify your Project ID and Org ID
            using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh

                  atlas alerts list --projectId 60b3c81153cf986293e2608b

   .. tab:: Service Account
      :tabid: service-account

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-cli-auth-prog-default.rst

         .. step:: Select the ``ServiceAccount`` option and press ``Enter``.

         .. step:: Enter the Service Account Credentials.

            Provide the client ID and secret of the Service Account you created and press ``Enter``.

         .. step:: Select the default project and output format.

            a. If your Service Account is at organization level, the 
               CLI prompts you to select a default project to run 
               commands on.

            #. Select the output format.

         .. step:: Issue commands using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            When you run :ref:`{+atlas-cli+} commands <atlas>` for
            the duration of your {+atlas-cli+} session, specify your Project ID and Org ID
            using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh

                  atlas alerts list --projectId 60b3c81153cf986293e2608b

   .. tab:: API Keys
      :tabid: api-keys

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-cli-auth-prog-default.rst

         .. step:: Select the ``APIKeys`` option and press ``Enter``.

         .. step:: Enter your |api| keys.

            Enter your public and private keys when prompted.

         .. step:: Accept the default profile options.

            Accept the remaining default profile options by pressing :guilabel:`Enter`
            when the following options display:

            - ``Default Org ID``
            - ``Default Project ID``
            - ``Default Output Format``
            - ``Default MongoDB Shell Path``

         .. step:: Issue commands using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            When you run :ref:`{+atlas-cli+} commands <atlas>` for
            the duration of your {+atlas-cli+} session, specify your Project ID and Org ID
            using the ``--projectId`` and ``--orgId`` flags.

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh

                  atlas alerts list --projectId 60b3c81153cf986293e2608b
