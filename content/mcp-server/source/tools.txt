Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting large language
models to external software, services, and data sources.

The MongoDB MCP Server allows you to interact with MongoDB clusters
using natural language queries from AI clients that support MCP. The
MCP Server provides tools that perform cluster operations.

This page describes the MCP Server tools.

Details
-------

MCP Server tool categories:

- Atlas tools, which perform operations on Atlas system resources, like
  organizations, projects, clusters, database user accounts, and others.
- Database tools, which perform operations such as inserting, updating,
  and deleting documents, and running queries and aggregation pipelines.

MCP Server Atlas Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Atlas tools are only available if you have set up Atlas API
credentials as shown in :ref:`mcp-server-configuration`.

The following table describes the Atlas tools:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - MCP Server Atlas Tool Name
     - Description

   * - ``atlas-list-orgs``
     - Returns a list of Atlas organizations.

   * - ``atlas-list-projects``
     - Returns a list of Atlas projects.

   * - ``atlas-create-project``
     - Creates a new Atlas project.

   * - ``atlas-list-clusters``
     - Returns list of Atlas clusters.

   * - ``atlas-inspect-cluster``
     - Returns information about a specific Atlas cluster.

   * - ``atlas-create-free-cluster``
     - Creates a free Atlas cluster.

   * - ``atlas-connect-cluster``
     - Connects to an Atlas cluster using the configured service account.

       If you configured the MCP server without specifying a connection string, 
       this tool creates a temporary database user with a random password to establish
       the connection. For details, see :ref:`mcp-tools-considerations`.

   * - ``atlas-inspect-access-list`` 
     - Returns information about the :abbr:`IP (Internet Protocol)` and
       :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` ranges that can
       access an Atlas cluster.

   * - ``atlas-create-access-list``
     - Configures the :abbr:`IP (Internet Protocol)` and :abbr:`CIDR
       (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` access list for an Atlas
       cluster.

   * - ``atlas-list-db-users``
     - Returns a list of Atlas database users.

   * - ``atlas-create-db-user``
     - Creates an Atlas database user.

   * - ``atlas-list-alerts``
     - Returns a list of alerts for an Atlas project.

MCP Server Database Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the database tools:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - MCP Server Database Tool Name
     - Description

   * - ``connect``
     - Connects to a cluster.

   * - ``find``
     - Runs a database query.

   * - ``aggregate``
     - Runs an aggregation pipeline.

   * - ``count``
     - Returns the number of documents in a collection.

   * - ``insert-one``
     - Adds a single document to a collection.

   * - ``insert-many``
     - Adds multiple documents to a collection.

   * - ``create-index``
     - Adds an index to a collection.

   * - ``update-one``
     - Modifies a single document in a collection.

   * - ``update-many``
     - Modifies multiple documents in a collection.

   * - ``rename-collection``
     - Changes the name of a collection.

   * - ``delete-one``
     - Removes a single document from a collection.

   * - ``delete-many``
     - Removes multiple documents from a collection.

   * - ``drop-collection``
     - Deletes a collection from a database.

   * - ``drop-database``
     - Deletes a database.

   * - ``list-databases``
     - Returns a list of all databases available through the current
       connection.

   * - ``list-collections``
     - Returns a list of collections in a database.

   * - ``collection-indexes``
     - Returns information about collection indexes.

   * - ``collection-schema``
     - Returns collection :ref:`schema <schema-validation-overview>`
       information.

   * - ``collection-storage-size``
     - Returns collection size in megabytes.

   * - ``db-stats``
     - Returns database statistics.

   * - ``export``
     - Saves the results of a query or aggregation pipeline in JSON
       format to a file on the computer that runs the MCP Server.
       The results are also accessible through the ``exported-data``
       resource in the AI client application.

.. _mcp-tools-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

If you configured the MCP server without specifying a connection string
to an Atlas cluster, the ``atlas-connect-cluster`` tool
creates a temporary :ref:`database user <mongodb-users>` 
to establish connection to the cluster
by using the configured Atlas API service account credentials.

The temporary database user has the following characteristics:

- Randomly generated username and password.
- Automatically expires after 12 hours.
- Role assigned based on how you configured the MCP Server:

  - :atlasrole:`readAnyDatabase` if you enabled :ref:`read-only mode 
    <mcp-server-configuration-read-only-mode>`
    or disabled the ``create``, ``delete``, and ``update`` tool categories.
  - :atlasrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` if the server has full permissions.

.. note:: 

   User credentials are stored only in the MCP Server's
   memory and are never returned to or exposed in the LLM context.
