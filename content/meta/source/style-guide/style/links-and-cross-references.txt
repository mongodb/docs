Links and Cross-References
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

Documentation writers use links to direct users to related material
outside of the current page or section. Links may be:

- Inline textual references to different sections. For example:

  "Partial indexes include more details about indexed documents compared
  to :manual:`Sparse Indexes </core/index-sparse/>`."

- Explicit references to different sections. For example:

  "To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see:

  - :ref:`aggregation-expression-operators`
  - :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`
  - `Practical MongoDB Aggregations
    <https://www.practical-mongodb-aggregations.com/>`__"

- Explicit hyperlinks to specific URLs. For example, a link to a GitHub
  repository.

Best Practices
--------------

Use the following guidelines to create clear and specific
links and cross-references.

Link with Care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you link to a separate page or section, consider whether that
link actually aids user understanding. To minimize reader disruption,
aim to keep users on the page they're currently reading as much as
possible. If you are considering adding a link, see if the content would
be better served by providing a brief definition or key concept on the
page the reader is currently reading, rather than making the user do
additional navigation on their own.

Be aware that providing a brief definition or attempting to explain a
concept on the current page may introduce maintenance issues. If the
behavior of the topic we're describing changes, it may become more
difficult to track down each place that topic is mentioned and know what
needs to be updated. When possible, use an include to single-source
content and reduce future maintenance.

Consider Link Placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, an explicit reference at the end of a page or section is less
disruptive than an inline textual reference, especially when there are
several inline references in succession. If you introduce a few concepts
you'd like to provide links to, consider grouping links to concepts into
either:

- A "Learn More" section with a consolidated list of links.
- A ``..seealso`` directive at the end of the section.

By using one of these approaches, users who just want to complete a task
aren't distracted by additional links, and users who want to learn more
about MongoDB concepts can click through and explore the linked content.

Avoid Inline References in Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid adding inline textual references in tutorials or stepped procedures. 
If users follow inline references while in the middle of a procedure,
they might have difficulty navigating back and reorienting themselves.
Inline textual references may be appropriate for more reference-heavy pages.

Minimize Repeated Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't link to the same target multiple times in the same section.
  You may link to the same target multiple times on the same page, but
  think carefully about whether it's absolutely necessary. For example,
  if a page is particularly long and contains many sections, then it might
  help to link to a target an additional time or two. Users might immediately
  navigate to a section far down on a page and miss the initial reference.

- If you add repeated links, use the same style for each link.
  Consider whether a plaintext link or a monospace link is appropriate.
  Plaintext links might be less visually distracting than monospace links,
  which have a surrounding block.

Make Link Text Clear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strive to be clear about where exactly a link will take a reader. Follow
these guidelines for link text to ensure readers know the purpose of a
link and where it will take them:

- Use descriptive text indicating where the URL will take the reader.
- Avoid jargon in link text. Using technical terms as needed, such as
  the name of an operator or method, is appropriate.
- Use normal English words as opposed to URLs.
- If a link will take a user away from the MongoDB documentation, such
  as to GitHub or Wikipedia, make the target site clear in the link
  text.
- Avoid "Click here." It's bad for search engine optimization, screen readers, and
  doesn't adequately describe the target.

Link text should begin with the purpose of the cross-reference. For
example:

- "To learn more, see..."
- "To see examples..."

The linked text should correspond to the title of the page or section
you are linking to. For example, consider the following sentence which
provides a cross-reference:

.. blockquote::

   To learn more, see the guide on Finding Multiple Documents in the
   Node.js Driver Documentation.

The linked text should correspond to the title of the guide. In this
example, the title of the guide is "Finding Multiple Documents". The
complete link sentence should look like this:

.. blockquote::

   To learn more, see the guide on :driver:`Finding Multiple Documents
   </node/current/usage-examples/find/>` in the Node.js Driver
   Documentation.

Use MongoDB-Domain Links When Possible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link to the MongoDB domain whenever possible instead of directing users
to external domains. Some topics described in our documentation are also
covered by other products' documentation, external tutorials, or
Wikipedia. By keeping users in the MongoDB domain, we ensure that we are
in full control of the content presented, and maintain trust with users.

Directing users outside of the MongoDB domain is acceptable when it is
critical to provide additional context on a topic and we don't have
sufficient context in our documentation to cover user needs.

Use ``:ref:`` Links Instead of ``:doc:`` Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When linking to content within the MongoDB documentation, use ``:ref:``
links instead of ``:doc:`` links. ``:ref:`` links make maintenance
easier in the event that a section is refactored or consolidated into a
new page because we can simply bring the reference along with the
paragraph or section we're pointing to. When using ``:doc:`` links, a
refactor can potentially break links if the page is renamed or removed.
