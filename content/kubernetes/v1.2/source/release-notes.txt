|k8s-op-short| v1.2.0
---------------------

*Released 10 July 2025*

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) user authentication**
   - Adds support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) user authentication.
   - You can configure OIDC authentication with the 
     :setting:`spec.security.authentication.modes` and 
     :setting:`spec.security.authentication.oidcProviderConfigs` 
     settings.
   - Requires MongoDB Enterprise Server 7.0.11+ or 8.0.0+.
   - For more information, see:
      - :ref:`Enable Authentication <k8s-authentication>`
      - :ref:`Manage Database Users Using OIDC Authentication 
        <k8s-manage-db-users-oidc>`

- **New ClusterMongoDBRole CRD**
   - Adds new :ref:`ClusterMongoDBRole <mongodbrole-specification>` CRD 
     to support reusable roles across multiple MongoDB clusters. This 
     allows users to define roles once and reuse them in multiple 
     MongoDB or MongoDBMultiCluster resources.
   - You can reference this role using the 
     :setting:`spec.security.roleRefs` 
     field. Note that only one of 
     :setting:`spec.security.roles` and 
     :setting:`spec.security.roleRefs` 
     can be used at a time.
   - The operator treats ClusterMongoDBRole resources as custom role 
     templates that are only used when referenced by the database 
     resources.
   - The operator watches the new resource by default. This means 
     that the operator requires you to create a new ClusterRole and 
     ClusterRoleBinding. The helm chart or the kubectl mongodb plugin 
     create these ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding by default. You 
     must create them manually if you use a different installation 
     method.
   - To disable this behavior in the helm chart, set the 
     ``operator.enableClusterMongoDBRoles`` value to ``false``. This 
     disables the creation of the necessary RBAC resources for the 
     ClusterMongoDBRole resource, as well as disables the watch for 
     this resource.
   - To skip installing necessary ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding 
     with the kubectl mongodb plugin, set the 
     ``--create-mongodb-roles-cluster-role`` to ``false``.
   - The new ClusterMongoDBRole resource is designed to be read-only, 
     meaning it can be used by MongoDB deployments managed by 
     different operators.
   - You can delete the ClusterMongoDBRole resource at any time, but 
     the operator does not delete any roles that were created using 
     this resource. To properly remove access, you must manually 
     remove the reference to the ClusterMongoDBRole in the MongoDB or 
     MongoDBMultiCluster resources.
   - The reference documentation for this resource can be found in 
     the :ref:`ClusterMongoDBRole Resource Specification 
     <mongodbrole-specification>`.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue where moving a MongoDBMultiCluster resource to a new project (or a new |mms| instance) would leave the deployment in a failed state.

.. _mck-1.1.0-rn:

|k8s-op-short| v1.1.0
---------------------

*Released 23 May 2025*

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **MongoDBSearch (Community Private Preview)**
   - Adds support for deploying MongoDB Search (Community Private Preview Edition).
   - Enables full-text and vector search capabilities for MongoDBCommunity deployments.
   - Adds new MongoDB CRD which is watched by default by the |k8s-op-short|. For more information see the `Quick Start <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/blob/1.1.0/docs/community-search/quick-start/README.md>`__.
   - MongoDBSearch Private Preview phase comes with the following limitations
      - Minimum MongoDB Community version: 8.0.
      - TLS must be disabled in MongoDB (communication between ``mongot`` and ``mongod`` is in plaintext for now).

.. _mck-1.0.1-rn:

|k8s-op-short| v1.0.1
---------------------

*Released 13 May 2025*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Adds missing {+mdbagent+} images in the |k8s-op-short| bundle in the OpenShift catalog and the `operatorhub.io <https://operatorhub.io/>`__ catalog.
* Adds the missing ``mongodbcommunity`` CRD from the watched list in the `Helm chart 
  <https://github.com/mongodb/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/mongodb-kubernetes>`__.  

.. _mck-1.0.0-rn:

|k8s-op-short| v1.0.0
---------------------

*Released 9 May 2025*

MongoDB is unifying its Kubernetes offerings with the introduction of |k8s-op-short|. 
This new operator is an open-source project and represents a merge of the previous 
`MongoDB Community Operator <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/tree/master/docs/mongodbcommunity>`__ 
and the `MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator <https://wwww.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/>`__. This makes it 
easier to manage, scale, and upgrade your deployments. Future changes will build on this 
to more closely align how Community and Enterprise are managed 
in Kubernetes, to offer an even more seamless and streamlined experience. 

As an open-source project, it now allows for community contributions, helping drive quicker bug 
fixes and ongoing innovation.

License
-------

Users with contracts that allowed use of the Enterprise Operator can still leverage the new replacement, 
allowing customers to adopt it without contract changes. |k8s-op-short| itself is licensed under the 
Apache 2.0 license, and a `license file <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/tree/master>`__ 
included in the repository provides further detail. 

License entitlements for all other MongoDB products and tools, such as 
MongoDB Enterprise Server and Ops Manager, remain unchanged. If you have
licensing questions regarding these products or tools, please contact your 
MongoDB account team.

Migration
---------

Migration from the Community Kubernetes Operator and the Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to 
|k8s-op-short| is seamless: your MongoDB deployments are not impacted by the upgrade and 
require no changes. Simply follow the instructions in the :ref:`migration guide <migrate-to-mck>`.

Legacy Operator Deprecation and EOL
-----------------------------------

We will continue best-effort support of the Community Kubernetes Operator for 6 months,
until November, 2025. Each Enterprise Kubernetes Operator release will remain supported 
according to the current `guidance <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/v1.33/reference/support-lifecycle/>`__.

All future bug fixes and improvements will be released in new versions of |k8s-op-short|. 
We encourage all users to plan their migration to |k8s-op-short| within these timelines.

Older Release Notes
-------------------

To see the release notes for the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator, see the `MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/release-notes/>`__.
