*Time to Complete: 5 minutes*

Next we will add a chart where you can quickly see which types of items
the company is selling the most of. This information will be helpful
for the company marketing team to know how effectively direct
advertising.

In this scenario, your manager has expressed interest specifically
in items sold from the ``Denver`` and ``New York`` store locations.
Additionally, they have requested to only visualize sales which
contain an item costing ``$1200`` or more, in an effort to more closely
examine the new line of laptops being sold at these locations and what
types of items are being bought with them. You can accomplish this
using a :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` in your
:ref:`donut chart <donut-chart-ref>`, as shown in the following
procedure.

Next Steps
----------

Now that we have a chart showing the tags of the items sold, it would
be helpful to know which specific items are most commonly sold at the
various store locations. To do so, refer to the next section to see how
to implement a :ref:`grouped column chart <order-data-grouped-column>`
showing the most common items sold by store location.
