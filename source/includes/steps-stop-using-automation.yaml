  To create the init scripts, run the
  ``mongodb-mms-automation-make-init-scripts`` tool with superuser
  access. It is recommended that you use the ``-boot`` option so that
  you configure the scripts to start the MongoDB processes on system
  boot. Otherwise, you will be responsible to manually start each script.

      To run the tool with superuser access and with the ``-boot`` option,
      issue:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo /opt/mongodb-mms-automation/bin/mongodb-mms-automation-make-init-scripts -boot

      The tool places the init scripts in the ``/etc/init.d`` directory
      and names each one using the following form:
    language: sh
    code: |
      (mongod|mongos)-<process-name>
    post: |
      ``<process-name>`` is the name given to the :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
      :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process in the cluster configuration.
