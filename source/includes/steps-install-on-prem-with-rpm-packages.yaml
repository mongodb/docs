  Install the ``.rpm`` package by issuing the following command, where
  ``<version>`` is the version of the ``.rpm`` package:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo rpm -ivh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  When installed, the base directory for the |onprem| software is
  ``/opt/mongodb/mms/``. The ``.rpm`` package creates a new system user
  ``mongodb-mms`` under which the server runs.

  As a result of `RHEL Bug 1285492 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1285492>`_,
  the version of ``systemd`` found in RHEL 7.1 and 7.2 |onprem| will not start automatically
  on boot up.

  To work around this:

  a. Replace the symbolic links to the scripts with the scripts themselves.
     Copy the scripts from ``/opt/mongodb/mms/bin/mongodb-mms`` to
     ``/etc/init.d``.

  b. In the copied scripts, change the line:

     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: ini

        ABS_PATH="$( resolvepath $0 )"

     to:

     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: ini

        SCRIPTPATH=/opt/mongodb/mms/bin/mongodb-mms
        ABS_PATH="$( resolvepath $SCRIPTPATH )"
