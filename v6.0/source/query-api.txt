The MongoDB |query-api| is the mechanism that you use to interact with 
your data.

The |query-api| comprises two ways to query data in MongoDB:

- :doc:`CRUD Operations </crud>`
- :doc:`Aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline>`

You can use the |query-api| to perform:

- **Adhoc queries**. Explore your MongoDB data with :binary:`~bin.mongosh`,
  :compass:`Compass </>` , 
  `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/mongodb>`_ 
  or a MongoDB :driver:`driver </>`.

- **Data transformations**. Use 
  :doc:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline>` to 
  reshape your data and perform calculations. 

- **Document join support** Use :pipeline:`$lookup` and 
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` to combine data from different collections.

- **Graph and geospatial queries**. Use operators such as 
  :query:`$geoWithin` and :pipeline:`$geoNear` to analyze geospatial 
  data and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` for graph data.

- **Full-text search**. Use the :pipeline:`$search` stage to 
  perform efficient text search on your data.

- **Semantic search**. Use the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to
  perform semantic search on your data.

- **Indexing**. Improve your MongoDB query performance by using the correct
  :ref:`index type <indexes>` for your data architecture.

- **On-demand materialized views**. Use :pipeline:`$out` and 
  :pipeline:`$merge` to :doc:`create materialized views 
  </core/materialized-views>`
  on common queries.

- **Time series analysis**. Query and aggregate your time-stamped data 
  with :ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection-create>`.

Document Model
--------------

A document in MongoDB is a data structure composed of field and value 
pairs. Documents are stored as BSON which is the binary representation of 
:term:`JSON`. This low level of abstraction helps you develop quicker 
and reduces the efforts around querying and data modeling. The document
model provides several advantages, including:

- Documents correspond to native data types in many programming 
  languages.

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

- Flexible schema. Documents do not need to have the same set of fields 
  and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a 
  collection.

Data as Code
------------

The MongoDB |query-api| supports :driver:`drivers</>` for major 
programming languages. These drivers allow you to make calls to the 
database and generate queries using the syntax native to your 
application.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, visit the MongoDB 
:doc:`Getting Started Guide </tutorial/getting-started>`. Here you can
find resources, code examples and tutorials that demonstrate the MongoDB
|query-api|.
