"The :expression:`$strLenBytes` operator counts the number of UTF-8 "
"encoded bytes in a string where each character may use between one and "
"four bytes."

msgid ""
"For example, US-ASCII characters are encoded using one byte. Characters "
"with diacritic markings and additional Latin alphabetical characters "
"(i.e. Latin characters outside of the English alphabet) are encoded using"
" two bytes. Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters typically require "
"three bytes, and other planes of unicode (emoji, mathematical symbols, "
"etc.) require four bytes."

"The :expression:`$strLenBytes` operator differs from "
":expression:`$strLenCP` operator which counts the `code points "
"<http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ in the specified string "
"regardless of how many bytes each character uses."
