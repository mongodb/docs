.. important:: Access List Replaces Whitelist


   |service| now refers to its cluster firewall management as *IP
   Access Lists*. |service| has deprecated the whitelist resource and
   will disable it in June 2021. Revise your whitelist endpoints to use
   the :ref:`IP Access List <security-access-list>` resource.
