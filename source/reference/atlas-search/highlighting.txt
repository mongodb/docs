The |fts| ``highlight`` option adds fields to the result set
that display search terms in their original context.
You can use it in conjunction with :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>`
operators to display search terms as they appear in the returned
documents, along with the adjacent text content (if any). ``highlight``
results are returned as part of the ``$meta`` field.

Definition
----------

``highlight`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 13 

   {
     $search: {  
       "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
       "<operator>": { // may be ``search``, ``term``, ``compound``, or ``span``
         "query": "<search-string>",
         "path": "<field-to-search>"
       },
       "highlight": { "path": "<field-to-search>" }
     }
   }, 
   { 
     $project: { 
       "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" } }
     }
   }

The ``path`` field may contain:

- A string
- An array of strings
- A :ref:`multi analyzer <ref-multi-analyzer>` specification
- An array containing a combination of strings and multi analyzer
  specifications

See :ref:`ref-path` for more information.

The ``"$meta": "searchHighlights"`` field contains the highlighted
results. That field isn't part of the original document, so it is
necessary to use a :manual:`$project
</reference/operator/aggregation/project>` pipeline stage to add it to
the query output.

Example
-------

The following example uses a collection called ``fruit`` that contains
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   }

.. note::

   One useful aspect of highlighting is that it reveals the original text returned
   by the search query, which may not be exactly the same as the search term.
   For example, if you use a :ref:`language-specific analyzer
   <ref-language-analyzers>`, your text searches return all the `stemmed
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming>`__ variations of your search
   terms.

The ``fruit`` collection has an :ref:`index definition
<ref-index-definitions>` that uses the :ref:`english
<ref-language-analyzers>` analyzer and dynamic field mappings.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "analyzer": "lucene.english",
     "searchAnalyzer": "lucene.english",
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": true
     }
   }

The following query searches for ``variety`` and ``bunch`` in the
``description`` field of the ``fruit`` collection, with the
``highlight`` option enabled.

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` pipeline
stage restricts the output to the ``description`` field and adds a new
field called ``highlights``, which contains highlighting information.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "text": {
           "path": "description",
           "query": ["variety", "bunch"]
         },
         "highlight": { 
           "path": "description"
         }
       }
     }, 
     { 
       $project: {
         "description": 1,
         "_id": 0,
         "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
       }
     }
   ])

The query returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { 
     "description": "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six.",
     "highlights" : [
       { 
         "path" : "description",
         "texts" : [ 
           { 
             "value" : "Bananas are usually sold in ",
             "type" : "text"
           },
           { 
             "value" : "bunches",
             "type" : "hit"
           }, 
           { 
             "value" : " of five or six.",
             "type" : "text"
           }
         ], 
         "score" : 1.2841906547546387
       }
     ]
   }
   { 
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp.",
     "highlights" : [ 
       {
         "path" : "description",
         "texts" : [
           {
             "value" : "Apples come in several ",
             "type" : "text"
           },
           {
             "value" : "varieties",
             "type" : "hit"
           },
           { 
             "value" : ", including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp.",
             "type" : "text" 
           } 
         ],
         "score" : 1.2178014516830444
       }
     ] 
   }

The ``highlights`` field is an array containing the following
output fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Document field which returned a match.

   * - ``texts``
     - array of objects
     - Each search match returns one or more objects, containing
       the matching text and the surrounding text (if any).

   * - ``texts.value``
     - string
     - Text from the field which returned a match.

   * - ``texts.type``
     - string
     - Returned value is either ``hit`` or ``text``. Results of type
       ``hit`` contain the string which returned a match. Results of type
       ``text`` contain the text content adjacent to the matching string. 

   * - ``score``
     - float
     - The :ref:`score <scoring-ref>` assigned to the ``highlights`` object. The 
       ``highlights`` score is a measure of the relevance of the ``highlights`` 
       object to the query. If multiple ``highlights`` objects are returned, the 
       most relevant ``highlights`` object has the highest score.

The search term ``bunch`` returns a match on the document with ``_id: 2``,
because the ``description`` field contains the word ``bunches``. The search
term ``variety`` returns a match on the document with ``_id: 2``, because the
``description`` field contains the word ``varieties``. See `stemming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming>`__.
