Before the introduction of the {+mdbagent+}, each function --
Automation, Backup, and Monitoring -- ran as a separate agent binary in
your project.

The {+mdbagent+} runs as a single binary that can perform any -- or all
-- of the three functions depending upon what you need.

- Activate the monitoring and/or backup functions using |mms| UI.
- Activate automation when you create a new cluster or import an
  existing one.
