We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB {+language+} community that includes users
with varying levels of experience using {+odm+} and the {+ruby-driver+}.
The quickest way to get support for general questions is through the
:community-forum:`MongoDB Community Forums <tag/ruby>`.

Feedback Engine <https://feedback.mongodb.com/>`__ and select
:guilabel:`Drivers` from the list of products on the right side of
your screen. You can propose improvements, report issues, and provide
other types of feedback by using this site.

You can also open a case in Jira, our issue management tool, to identify
bugs or propose improvements. The following steps describe how to create
a Jira issue:
