Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform **compound operations**.

Compound operations combine a read and write operation into
a single operation. If you perform a read and write operation
separately, there's a chance someone else may alter the document between
both operations. MongoDB prevents this by placing a write lock on the
document you are modifying for the duration of your compound operation.

MongoDB supports the following compound operations:

- :ref:`Find and delete one document <golang-find-and-delete>`
- :ref:`Find and update one document <golang-find-and-update>`
- :ref:`Find and replace one document <golang-find-and-replace>`

.. tip::
    
   To learn how to perform compound operations on more than one document
   at a time, see the :ref:`Transactions <golang-transactions>` guide.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the following ``Course`` struct as a model for documents
in the ``courses`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :start-after: start-course-struct
   :end-before: end-course-struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the
``db.courses`` collection with the following
snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

Each document contains a description of a university course that
includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to
the ``title`` and ``enrollment`` fields in each document.

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-db-coll-creation.rst

.. _golang-find-and-delete:

Find and Delete
---------------

The ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method finds the first document that matches
the specified query filter and deletes it. The method returns a
``SingleResult`` containing the deleted document.

.. note:: 

   The ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method is an atomic operation, which means it prevents
   any other write operations from changing the matching document until it
   completes. The ``deleteOne()`` method is also an atomic operation, but differs from
   ``FindOneAndDelete()`` in that you cannot specify a sort order for the
   matched documents. 

   To find a document and delete it in separate operations, call the
	 ``findOne()`` method followed by the ``deleteOne()`` method.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndDeleteOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndDeleteOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndDeleteOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example uses the ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method 
to match and delete the first document where the ``enrollment`` 
field value is less than 20:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      filter := bson.D{{"enrollment", bson.D{{"$lt", 20}}}}

      var deletedDoc Course
      err := coll.FindOneAndDelete(context.TODO(), filter).Decode(&deletedDoc)
      if err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }

      res, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(deletedDoc, false, false)
      fmt.Println(string(res))

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"title":"Animal Communication","enrollment":18}

.. _golang-find-and-update:

Find and Update
---------------

The ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method finds the first document that matches
the specified query filter and updates it according to the update
document. The method returns a ``SingleResult`` containing the matched
document.

.. note:: 

   The ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method is an atomic operation, which means it prevents
   any other write operations from changing the matching document until it
   completes. The ``updateOne()`` method is also an atomic operation, but differs from
   ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` in that you cannot specify a sort order for the
   matched documents. 

   To find a document and update it in separate operations, call 
   the ``findOne()`` method followed by the ``updateOne()`` method. 
 
Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndUpdateOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndUpdateOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndUpdateOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetArrayFilters()``
     - | The array elements the update applies to.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Whether to allow the write operation to opt-out of :manual:`document level validation </core/schema-validation>`.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetReturnDocument()``
     - | Whether to return the original or updated document in the ``SingleResult``. 
       | Default: ``options.Before``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetUpsert()``
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents. 
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example uses the ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method to 
perform the following actions in order:

- Matches the first document where the ``title`` field value includes "Modern"
- Updates the matched document's ``enrollment`` field value to ``32``
- Returns the updated document

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      filter := bson.D{{"title", bson.D{{"$regex", "Modern"}}}}
      update := bson.D{{"$set", bson.D{{"enrollment", 32}}}}
      opts := options.FindOneAndUpdate().SetReturnDocument(options.After)
      
      var updatedDoc Course
      err := coll.FindOneAndUpdate(context.TODO(), filter, update, opts).Decode(&updatedDoc)
      if err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }
      
      res, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(updatedDoc, false, false)
      fmt.Println(string(res))

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"title":"Early Modern Philosophy","enrollment":32}

.. _golang-find-and-replace:

Find and Replace
----------------

The ``FindOneAndReplace()`` method finds the first document that
matches the specified query filter and replaces it with the replacement
document. The method returns a ``SingleResult`` containing the matched
document.

.. note:: 

   This method differs from the ``ReplaceOne()`` method.
   ``FindOneAndReplace()`` performs a find and replace as a single
   operation, and eliminates the possibility of someone altering a
   document between both operations.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndReplace()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndReplaceOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndReplaceOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndReplaceOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Whether to allow the write operation to opt-out of :manual:`document level validation </core/schema-validation>`.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetReturnDocument()``
     - | Whether to return the original or replaced document in the ``SingleResult``. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetUpsert()``
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents. 
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example uses the ``FindOneAndReplace()`` method to 
perform the following actions in order:

- Matches the first document where the ``title`` is "Representation Theory"
- Replaces the matched document with a new document where the ``title``
  is "Combinatorial Theory" and the ``enrollment`` is ``35``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      filter := bson.D{{"title", "Representation Theory"}}
      replacement := Course{Title: "Combinatorial Theory", Enrollment: 35}
      
      var outdatedDoc Course
      err := coll.FindOneAndReplace(context.TODO(), filter, replacement).Decode(&previousDoc)
      if err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }
      
      res, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(outdatedDoc, false, false)
      fmt.Println(string(res))
      
   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"title":"Representation Theory","enrollment":40}
