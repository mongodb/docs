  Target categories refer to the monitored target and include: hosts,
  replica set, agents and backups.

  If you select :guilabel:`Host`, choose the host type and then the condition or
  metric. Conditions include defining alert thresholds above or below
  metrics tracked in charts displayed when you click a hostname on the
  :guilabel:`Hosts` page, for example, ``Asserts``, ``Opcounter``, and ``Queues``.

  Alerts are sensitive to changes in host state. When a host
  changes state, MMS will automatically close alerts that are no
  longer relevant. For example, if a secondary becomes primary,
  replication lag alerts for that host will close automatically
  since the host is no longer required to replicate.

     If you select :guilabel:`Replica Set`, select the Primary Elected
     condition to send an alert when a new primary is elected.

  If you select :guilabel:`Agent`, choose the agent to monitor.

     If you select :guilabel:`Backup`, choose which condition to use for the
     alert.

     :guilabel:`Alerts` window. MMS removes all punctuation and letters and
     only uses the digits for the telephone number.
