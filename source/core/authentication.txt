Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client.
When access control (:ref:`authorization <authorization>`) is
enabled, MongoDB requires all clients to authenticate themselves in
order to determine their access.

Although authentication and :ref:`authorization <authorization>`
are closely connected, authentication is distinct from authorization:

- **Authentication** verifies the identity of a :ref:`user <users>`.
- **Authorization** determines the verified user's access to resources
  and operations.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started using access control, follow these tutorials:

- :ref:`enable-access-control`
- :ref:`create-users`
- :ref:`authentication-auth-as-user`

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

.. _authentication-mechanism-default:

SCRAM Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)
</core/security-scram>` is the default authentication mechanism for
MongoDB.

For more information on SCRAM and MongoDB, see:

- :ref:`SCRAM Authentication <authentication-scram>`
- :ref:`scram-client-authentication`

.. _authentication-mechanism-x509:

X.509 Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports :doc:`X.509 certificate authentication
</core/security-x.509>` for client authentication and internal
authentication of the members of replica sets and sharded clusters.
X.509 certificate authentication requires a secure :doc:`TLS/SSL
connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

To use MongoDB with X.509, you must use valid certificates generated and
signed by a certificate authority. The client X.509 certificates
must meet the :ref:`client certificate requirements
<client-x509-certificates-requirements>`.

For more information on X.509 and MongoDB, see:

- :ref:`X.509 Certificate Authentication <security-auth-x509>`
- :ref:`x509-client-authentication`

.. _security-auth-kerberos:

Kerberos Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`_
supports :ref:`Kerberos Authentication <security-kerberos>`. Kerberos is
an industry standard authentication protocol for large client/server
systems that provides authentication using short-lived tokens that are
called tickets.

To use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must have a properly configured
Kerberos deployment, configured :ref:`Kerberos service principals
<kerberos-service-principal>` for MongoDB, and a :ref:`Kerberos user
principal <kerberos-user-principal>` added to MongoDB.

For more information on Kerberos and MongoDB, see:

- :ref:`Kerberos Authentication <security-kerberos>`
- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-windows-with-kerberos-authentication`

.. _security-auth-ldap:

LDAP Proxy Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`_
and `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server>`__ support
:ref:`LDAP Proxy Authentication <security-ldap>` proxy
authentication through a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
service.

For more information on Kerberos and MongoDB, see:

- :ref:`LDAP Proxy Authentication <security-ldap>`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-activedirectory`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-openldap`
- :doc:`/tutorial/authenticate-nativeldap-activedirectory`

These mechanisms allow MongoDB to integrate into your
existing authentication system.

OpenID Connect Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-oidc-authentication.rst 

For more information on OpenID Connect and MongoDB, see:

- :ref:`OpenID Connect Authentication <authentication-oidc>`

- :ref:`Configure MongoDB with OpenID Connect <configure-oidc>` 

- `OpenID Connect <https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol>`_  


Internal / Membership Authentication
------------------------------------

In addition to verifying the identity of a client, MongoDB can require
members of replica sets and sharded clusters to :ref:`authenticate
their membership <inter-process-auth>` to their respective
replica set or sharded cluster. See :ref:`inter-process-auth`
for more information.
