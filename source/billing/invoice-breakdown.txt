Your |service-fullname| bill includes key sections such as the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Section
     - Description
   
   * - :guilabel:`Summary by Project`
     - Shows the total monthly cost for each project.
   
   * - :guilabel:`Summary by Service`
     - Breaks down your total costs by the types of |service| services
       you use across all your projects. 

While invoices vary depending on consumption and feature usage, you can
see how you incur costs for all of the possible |service| services
listed in the :guilabel:`Summary by Service` section.

{+Clusters+}
------------

|service| charges {+dedicated-clusters+} on an hourly basis and
you pay only for the time your {+cluster+} is active. The cost depends on
factors like the region, cloud provider, and utilization (CPU, memory
and storage). This estimated price of your {+cluster+} is available
when you create or edit a {+cluster+}.

For example, if you run a ``M30`` {+cluster+} on |aws| with default
settings at $0.54/hour for 24 hours a day for 30 days, you can expect 
to pay roughly $388/month. If you increase your base storage to 200 GB,
your price changes to $0.65/hour, or roughly $468/month. If you switch
to a more expensive region like Sao Paulo and do not change any other
settings, your price changes to $0.98/hour, or around $705 monthly. To
learn more, see :ref:`cluster-config-costs`.

|service| charges shared {+clusters+} monthly at fixed base rates.
{+Flex-clusters+} scale with your usage, with a maximum charge of $30
per month. For more information, see :ref:`atlas-flex-costs`.

Storage
-------

|service| includes the cost of default storage in the {+cluster+}\'s hourly
rate. However, if you :ref:`customize storage capacity
<create-cluster-storage>`, |service| charges for the full amount of
storage without deducting the cost of the default storage capacity. 
If you enable :ref:`Cluster Auto-Scaling <cluster-autoscaling>`,
|service| charges you based on the actual storage usage after you apply
auto-scaling.

Backups
-------

For :ref:`Cloud Backups <billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots>`,
|service| charges for storage of data in your replica set, configuration
server, and  network transfer during snapshot restoration. If you
enable :ref:`Continuous Cloud Backups <billing-backup-cps-pit>`, |service|
charges you according to the continuous cloud backup rates.

To learn more, see :ref:`Backups <cluster-config-costs-backup>`.

Data Transfer
-------------

|service| calculates and updates data transfer costs daily based on the
cloud service provider hosting your {+cluster+} and if you transfer data
within the same region or different regions.

To learn more, see :ref:`data-transfer-costs` and
:ref:`billing-optimizations-cluster-costs`.

|bic-short-no-link|
-------------------

If you enable the {+abic+}, |service| charges as a daily uplift on the
{+cluster+}\'s cost, which you can view in the {+cluster+} console. The
daily rate follows sustained-usage pricing, meaning it is charged only up
to a monthly maximum.

Premium Features
----------------

The Premium Features section of your |service| bill includes
additional features such as :ref:`Advanced Security
<advanced-security>`, :ref:`Private Endpoints <privatelink-billing>`,
:ref:`Database Auditing <database-auditing>`, and :ref:`Online Archive
<oa-for-atlas>`, with the costs based on usage, subscription,
or resource consumption.

To learn more, see :ref:`additional-services`.

{+df+}
---------------

{+adf+} costs include data that your {+fdi+}\s process and return.

To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-data-federation-billing`.


|charts-short|
--------------

|service| bills |charts-short| based on the data you transfer from the
|charts-short| web server to web browser clients, with the first 1 GB
per month free, and additional data transfers beyond this limit at a
fixed rate.

To learn more, see :ref:`charts-billing`.

Support
-------

|service| charges for support based on the selected support tier.
Pricing details are available through the UI on the `support plan page
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%23%2Forg%2F%3Corganization%3E%2Fsupport>`__.
