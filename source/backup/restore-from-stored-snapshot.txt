Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. start-content

With MongoDB Backup Service, you can restore from a stored snapshot or
from any :doc:`point-in-time </backup/restore-from-point-in-time>`
within the last 24 hours. Restoring from a stored snapshot is faster
than restoring from a point-in-time in the last 24 hours.

MongoDB Backup Service takes and stores a snapshot every 6 hours. These
snapshots are available for restores following the snapshot
retention policy. [#snapshot-retention]_
