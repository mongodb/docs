Change the Oplog Size of Self-Managed Replica Set Members
=========================================================

.. warning::

   You cannot drop the ``local.oplog.rs`` collection. For more information on 
   this restriction, see :ref:`oplog-coll-behavior`.

This procedure changes the size of the oplog [#oplog]_ on each member of a
replica set using the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command, starting
with the :term:`secondary` members before proceeding to the
:term:`primary`.

Perform these steps on each :term:`secondary` replica set member
*first*. Once you have changed the oplog size for all secondary
members, perform these steps on the :term:`primary`.

A. Connect to the replica set member
------------------------------------

Connect to the replica set member using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh --host <hostname>:<port>

.. note::

   If the replica set enforces :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
   you must authenticate as a user with privileges to modify the 
   ``local`` database, such as the :authrole:`clusterManager` or
   :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role.

B. (Optional) Verify the current size of the oplog
--------------------------------------------------

To view the current size of the oplog, switch to the ``local``
database and run :method:`db.collection.stats()` against the 
``oplog.rs`` collection. :method:`~db.collection.stats()` displays the 
oplog size as :data:`~collStats.maxSize`.


.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The ``maxSize`` field displays the collection size in bytes.

C. Change the oplog size of the replica set member
--------------------------------------------------

Resize the oplog with the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command. The
``size`` is a double and must be greater than ``990`` megabytes. To
explicitly cast the oplog ``size`` in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use the
``Double()`` constructor.

The following operation changes the oplog size of the replica set
member to 16 gigabytes, or 16000 megabytes.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({replSetResizeOplog: 1, size: Double(16000)})

.. compact-oplog-rs:

D. (Optional) Compact ``oplog.rs`` to reclaim disk space
--------------------------------------------------------

Reducing the size of the oplog does *not* automatically reclaim
the disk space allocated to the original oplog size. You must run
:dbcommand:`compact` against the ``oplog.rs`` collection in the
``local`` database to reclaim disk space. There are no benefits to 
running ``compact`` on the ``oplog.rs`` collection after increasing the 
oplog size.

.. important::

   A replica set member can replicate oplog entries while the ``compact`` 
   operation is ongoing. As a result, it is no longer necessary to limit 
   compaction operations on the oplog to maintenance windows, as oplog 
   replication can continue as normal during compaction.

Do **not** run ``compact`` against the primary replica set member.
Connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell directly to the primary
(not the replica set) and run :method:`rs.stepDown()`. If successful,
the primary steps down. From the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell, run
the ``compact`` command on the now-secondary member.

The following operation runs the ``compact`` command against the
``oplog.rs`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.runCommand({ "compact" : "oplog.rs" } )

For clusters enforcing :ref:`authentication <authentication>`, 
authenticate as a user with the :authaction:`compact` privilege
action on the ``local`` database and the ``oplog.rs`` collection.
For complete documentation on :dbcommand:`compact` authentication
requirements, see :ref:`compact-authentication`.
