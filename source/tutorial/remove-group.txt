   Overview
   --------

   Removing a project deletes all the project's artifacts, including all user
   and monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the project in selection
   lists.

   You can remove a project if:

   - You have the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the project.

   - The project has no outstanding invoices.

   - The project has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to removing
     the project, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.
