msgid "The MongoDB server supports listening for both SSL encrypted and unencrypted connections on the same TCP port. This allows upgrades of MongoDB clusters to use SSL encrypted connections. To upgrade from a MongoDB cluster using no SSL encryption to one using *only* SSL encryption, use the following rolling upgrade process:"
