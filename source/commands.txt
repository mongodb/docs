Connection Commands
-------------------

Run these commands from the Command Palette to create new connections or
manage existing connections to your MongoDB deployments.

Configuring a new connection adds a new entry to your
:guilabel:`Connections` list in the |vsce| view. Select a connection
from the list to activate that connection.

To learn more about connecting to a deployment, see :ref:`vsce-connect`.

.. note::

   You can configure multiple connections, but only have one *active*
   connection open at a time.

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Connect <vsce-cmd-connect>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-connect:

     - Connect to your MongoDB deployment by filling in your connection
       information in the connection dialog.

   * - :ref:`Connect with Connection String <vsce-cmd-connect-string>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-connect-string:

     - Connect to your MongoDB deployment by pasting your 
       :manual:`connection string URI </reference/connection-string/>`
       directly into the command palette. Connecting to a deployment
       adds a new entry to your :guilabel:`Connections` list in the
       |vsce| view.

       |service| provides a connection string for your clusters which
       you can pass into this command.

   * - :ref:`Disconnect <vsce-cmd-disconnect>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-disconnect:

     - Disconnect from your active deployment connection.

   * - :ref:`Remove Connection <vsce-cmd-remove-connection>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-remove-connection:

     - Select and remove a connection from your list of connections
       in |vsce|.

       .. note::

          Removing your current active connection also closes that
          connection.

Shell Commands
--------------

Run this command from the Command Palette to open a MongoDB Shell
connected to your deployment.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

          This command is not supported on Windows.
     
       Open the VS Code :guilabel:`Terminal` and automatically connect a
       MongoDB shell to the deployment specified in your active
       connection.
       
       Specify the MongoDB shell to use in the ``mdb.shell``
       :ref:`setting <vsce-settings>`. |vsce| supports the following
       shells:

       - Legacy :binary:`~mongo` shell
       - ``mongosh`` shell.

       To learn how to install the legacy :binary:`~mongo` shell, see

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Create MongoDB Playground <vsce-cmd-playground-create>`

       .. _vsce-command-playground-create:

     - Create a new playground to run against your MongoDB deployment.

       :guilabel:`Output` view in VS Code.
