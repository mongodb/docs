   Looking for ``$searchBeta``? Use ``$search`` instead, the official 
   aggregation stage for running search queries. 

|fts| queries take the form of an :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage 
</aggregation>`. This page describes the following pipeline stages: 

- :pipeline:`$search`
- :pipeline:`$searchMeta`

``$search``
-----------

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$search` stage performs a full-text search on the 
specified field or fields which must be covered by an |fts| index.

.. pipeline:: $search

   A ``$search`` pipeline stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        $search: {
          "index": "<index-name>",
          "<operator-name>"|"<collector-name>": {
            <operator-specification>|<collector-specification>
          },
          "highlight": {
            <highlight-options>
          },
          "count": {
            <count-options>
          },
          "returnStoredSource": true | false 
        }
      }

Fields
~~~~~~

The ``$search`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``<collector-name>``
     - document 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`collector <collectors-ref>` to use with the 
       query. You can provide a document that contains the 
       collector-specific options as the value for this field. Either 
       this or ``<operator-name>`` is required. 

   * - ``count``
     - document 
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies the :ref:`count <count-ref>` options for 
       retrieving a count of the results. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`count-ref`.

   * - ``highlight`` 
     - document 
     - Optional 
     - Document that specifies the :ref:`highlight-ref` options for 
       displaying search terms in their original context.

   * - ``index`` 
     - string 
     - Optional 
     - Name of the |fts| index to use. If omitted, defaults to 
       ``default``.

       .. include:: /includes/default-fts-index-name.rst

       |fts| doesn't returns results if you misspell the index name or 
       if the specified index doesn't already exist on the cluster.

   * - ``<operator-name>``
     - document 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`operator <operators-ref>` to search with. You 
       can provide a document that contains the operator-specific 
       options as the value for this field. Either this or 
       ``<collector-name>`` is required.

   * - ``returnStoredSource``
     - boolean 
     - Optional
     - Flag that specifies whether to perform a full document lookup
       on the backend database or return only stored source fields  
       directly from |fts|. If omitted, defaults to ``false``. To learn 
       more, see :ref:`fts-return-stored-source-option`. 

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$search` must be the first stage of any pipeline it appears 
in. :pipeline:`$search` cannot be used in:

- a :manual:`view definition</core/views>`
- a :pipeline:`$facet` pipeline stage

Aggregation Variable 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$search` returns only the results of your query. The 
metadata results of your :pipeline:`$search` query are saved in the 
``$$SEARCH_META`` aggregation variable. You can use the 
``$$SEARCH_META`` variable to view the metadata results for your 
:pipeline:`$search` query. The ``$$SEARCH_META`` aggregation variable 
can be used anywhere after a :pipeline:`$search` stage in any pipeline, 
but it can't be used after the :pipeline:`$lookup` or 
:pipeline:`$unionWith` stage in any pipeline. The ``$$SEARCH_META`` 
aggregation variable can't be used in any subsequent stage after a 
:pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage.
   
.. example:: 

   Suppose the following index on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` 
   collection.

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "mappings": {
          "dynamic": false,
          "fields": {
            "released": {
              "type": "date"
            }
          }
        }
      }

   The following query searches for movies released near September 
   01, 2011 using the :pipeline:`$search` stage. The query includes 
   a:
   
   - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields in the documents 
     except ``title`` and ``released``. 
   - :pipeline:`$facet` stage that outputs a: 
   
     - ``docs`` field with an array of the top ``5`` search results
     - ``meta`` field with the value of ``$$SEARCH_META`` variable

   .. code-block:: json

      db.movies.aggregate([
        {
          "$search": {
            "near": {
              "path": "released",
              "origin": ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00.000+00:00"),
              "pivot": 7776000000
            }
          }
        },
        {
          $project: {
            "_id": 0,
            "title": 1,
            "released": 1
          }
        },
        { 
          "$facet": {
            "docs": [
              {"$limit": 5}
            ],
            "meta": [
              {"$replaceWith": "$$SEARCH_META"}, 
              {"$limit": 1}
            ] 
          }
        } 
      ])

   The query returns the following results:

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false 

      { 
        "docs" : [ 
          { 
            "title" : "Submarino", 
            "released" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z") 
          }, 
          { 
            "title" : "Devil's Playground", 
            "released" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z") 
          }, 
          { 
            "title" : "Bag It", 
            "released" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z") 
          }, 
          { 
            "title" : "Dos", 
            "released" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z") 
          }, 
          { 
            "title" : "We Were Here", 
            "released" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z") 
          }
        ], 
        "meta" : [ 
          { "count" : { "lowerBound" : NumberLong(17373) } } 
        ] 
      }

``$searchMeta``
---------------

.. important:: 

   The |fts| :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage is available only on 
   clusters running one of the following MongoDB versions: 

   - MongoDB 4.4.11+
   - MongoDB 5.0.4+
   - MongoDB 6.0+

   .. note:: 

      To run :pipeline:`$searchMeta` queries over sharded collections, 
      your cluster must run MongoDB v6.0 or later.

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage returns different :ref:`types of 
metadata result <fts-metadata-results>` documents. 

.. pipeline:: $searchMeta

   A ``$searchMeta`` pipeline stage has the following prototype form: 

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        $searchMeta: {
          "index": "<index-name>",
          "<collector-name>"|"<operator-name>": {
            <collector-specification>|<operator-specification>
          },
          "count": {
            <count-options>
          }
        }
      }
  
Fields
~~~~~~

The ``$searchMeta`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``<collector-name>``
     - document 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`collector <collectors-ref>` to use with the 
       query. You can provide a document that contains the 
       collector-specific options as the value for this field. Value 
       must be ``facet`` to retrieve a mapping of the defined facet 
       names to an array of buckets for that facet. To learn more, see  
       :ref:`fts-facet-ref`. You must specify this or 
       ``<operator-name>``.

   * - ``count``
     - document 
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies the :ref:`count <count-ref>` options for 
       retrieving a count of the results. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`count-ref`.

   * - ``index`` 
     - string 
     - Optional 
     - Name of the |fts| index to use. If omitted, defaults to 
       ``default``. 
       
       |fts| doesn't return results if you misspell the index name or 
       if the specified index doesn't already exist on the cluster.

   * - ``<operator-name>``
     - document 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`operator <operators-ref>` to search with. You 
       can provide a document that contains the operator-specific 
       options as the value for this field. You must specify 
       this or ``<collector-name>``. :pipeline:`$searchMeta` 
       returns the default ``count`` metadata only.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage must be the first stage in any 
pipeline.

.. _fts-metadata-results:

Metadata Result Types 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The structure of the metadata results document that is returned by 
the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage varies based on the type of 
results. |fts| supports the following result types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 80
   
   * - Type
     - Result Structure

   * - ``count``
     - The count result included in the results indicate whether the 
       count returned in the results is a total count of the search 
       results, or a lower bound. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`count-results`.

   * - ``facet``
     - The result to a facet query is a mapping of the defined facet 
       names to an array of buckets for that facet. To learn more, 
       see :ref:`fts-facet-results`.
