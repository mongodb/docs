msgid "MongoDB employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to govern access to a MongoDB system. A user is granted one or more :ref:`roles <roles>` that determine the user's access to database resources and operations. Outside of role assignments, the user has no access to the system."

#: ../source/core/authorization.txt:23
msgid "MongoDB does not enable access control by default. You can enable authorization using the :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` or the :setting:`security.authorization` setting. Enabling :doc:`internal authentication </core/security-internal-authentication>` also enables client authorization."

#: ../source/core/authorization.txt:37
msgid "A role grants privileges to perform the specified :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>` on :doc:`resource </reference/resource-document>`. Each privilege is either specified explicitly in the role or inherited from another role or both."

#: ../source/core/authorization.txt:50
msgid "A :doc:`resource </reference/resource-document>` is a database, collection, set of collections, or the cluster. If the resource is the cluster, the affiliated actions affect the state of the system rather than a specific database or collection. For information on the resource documents, see :doc:`/reference/resource-document`."
