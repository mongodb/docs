   :description: Configure mapping rules to migrate tables with datetime columns to time series collections, optimizing storage and query efficiency for time-based data.

You can configure mapping rules to migrate a table that contains a 
datetime column to a :ref:`time series collection <manual-timeseries-collection>`. 
Time series collections efficiently store time series data. In time 
series collections, writes are organized so that data from the same 
source is stored alongside other data points from a similar point in time.

About this Task
---------------

- You can use :ref:`field customizations <rm-field-customizations>` to 
  convert string columns to datetime fields in Relational Migrator.

- :abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)` jobs that have time series 
  configurations do not create the time series collections until the 
  CDC job completes. 

- Compared to normal collections, storing time series data in time series
  collections improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for
  time series data and :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`.

- Use cases for time series collections include 
  :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)`, forecasting, and time based analysis.

Before you Begin
----------------

- For full details on each time series field component, see 
  :ref:`time-series-fields`.

- If the time series data in your migration job does not require any 
  complex transformations you may benefit from migrating your time 
  series data as a separate migration job. This can make it easier to 
  preload a large time series collection and migrate the rest of your data after the initial job completes.

- If you're migrating large amounts of data, you might want to use 
  :ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>` to divide your migration jobs into 
  batches. For example, you might import one year of historical data at 
  a time. This allows you to break down a large job into more manageable 
  segments.

- If a long-running migration job fails unexpectedly (for example, due to a 
  database outage) and is not able to automatically recover, you may 
  be able to use :ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>` to create a 
  new migration job that picks up from where the previous one left off. This 
  approach lets you avoid having to repeat the entire migration job.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Select a collection with a datetime field 

      a. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen.
      #. On the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane under the 
         :guilabel:`MongoDB` header, click on a collection that has a 
         datetime field.

   .. step:: Configure the time series collection

      a. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, click the :icon-lg:`Edit` 
         :guilabel:`Configure` button.
      #. Select the :guilabel:`Time Series Collection` radio button.
      #. Select a :guilabel:`Time Field`.

         ``Time Field`` is the name of the field which contains the 
         datetime field in each time series document. Documents in a 
         time series collection must have a valid BSON date data type. 
         For details on converting a field to a datetime type in 
         Relational Migrator, see 
         :ref:`field customizations <rm-field-customizations>`.

         .. note::

            If you have multiple datetime columns must select a 
            single field per timeseries collection.

      #. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Meta Field`

         ``Meta Field`` is the name of the field that contains metadata
         in each time series document. The metadata in the specified 
         field is used to label a unique series of
         documents. The metadata should rarely change.

      #. Select a :guilabel:`Granularity`.

         Specify a ``Granularity`` value that most closely matches 
         the time between consecutive incoming timestamps. Setting the correct granularity
         improves performance by optimizing how MongoDB stores data in the 
         collection. Possible values are ``seconds``, ``minutes``, and 
         ``hours``.

      #. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Expire After Seconds`.

         ``Expire After Seconds`` enables the automatic deletion 
         of documents in a time series collection by specifying the 
         number of seconds after which documents expire. MongoDB 
         deletes expired documents automatically.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save And Close`.

         .. note::

            When a collection is configured with a time series field, 
            the time series icon :icon-lg:`TimeSeries` displays next to the collection
            name on the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane.

Example
-------

The following example converts the ``rental_date`` column into a time
series field in MongoDB:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Relational Input
      :tabid: new-document-in

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - rental_id
           - rental_date
           - inventory_id
           - customer_id
           - return_date
           - staff_id
           - last_updated

         * - 1
           - 2005-05-24 22:53:30
           - 367
           - 130
           - 2005-05-26 22:04:30
           - 1
           - 2006-02-15 20:30:53

   .. tab:: MongoDB Output
      :tabid: Embedded-array-out

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {
         rental_date: {
            $date: "2005-05-24T22:53:30.000Z",
         },
         last_updated: "2006-02-16T01:30:53Z",
         customerId: 130,
         rental_date: {
            $date: "2005-05-26T22:04:30.000Z",
         },
         _id: {
            $oid: "661597470a883992d56d60d6",
         },
         inventory_id: 367,
         staff_id: 1,
         rental_id: 1,
         }
