===========================
Create a User Administrator
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

User administrators create users and create and assigns roles. A
user administrator can grant any privilege in the database and can create
new ones. In a MongoDB deployment, create the user administrator as the
first user. Then let this user create all other users.

To provide user administrators, MongoDB has
:authrole:`userAdmin` and :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` roles,
which grant access to :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>` that support user and
role management. Following the policy of :term:`least privilege`
:authrole:`userAdmin` and :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`  confer no
additional privileges.

Carefully control access to these roles. A user with either of these roles can grant
*itself* unlimited additional privileges. Specifically, a user with the
:authrole:`userAdmin` role can grant itself any privilege in the database.
A user assigned either the :authrole:`userAdmin` role on the ``admin``
database or the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` can grant itself any
privilege *in the system*.

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :doc:`/core/authentication` and
:doc:`/core/security-introduction`  documents as well as the

As you configure authentication you may also want to consider the
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` tutorial and the other
:doc:`/administration/security-access-control` tutorials.
