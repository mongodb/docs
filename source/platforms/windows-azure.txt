MongoDB on Azure brings the power of the leading next-generation
database to Microsoft’s flexible, open, and scalable cloud.

`Windows Azure <http://www.windowsazure.com/>`_ is the cloud services
operating system that serves as the development, service hosting, and
service management environment for the Azure Services Platform. Windows
Azure provides developers on-demand compute & storage to create, host
and manage scalable and available web applications through Microsoft
data centers.

Together, MongoDB and Azure provide customers the tools to build
limitlessly scalable applications in the cloud.

Users deploying MongoDB on Azure may be interested in the following
presentations, as well:

Deployment Recommendations
--------------------------

For all MongoDB deployments using Azure, you **must** mount volume
that hosts the :program:`mongod` instance's :setting:`~storage.dbPath`
with the *Host Cache Preference* ``READ/WRITE``.

This applies to all Azure deployments, using any guest operating
system.

If your volumes have inappropriate cache settings, MongoDB may
eventually shut down with the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   [DataFileSync] FlushViewOfFile for <data file> failed with error 1 ...
   [DataFileSync] Fatal Assertion 16387

These shut downs do not produce data loss if when
:setting:`storage.journal.enabled` is set to ``true``. You can safely
restart :program:`mongod` at any time following this event.

The performance characteristics of MongoDB may change with
``READ/WRITE`` caching enabled.

The TCP keepalive on the Azure load balancer is 240 seconds by
default, which can cause it to silently drop connections if the TCP
keepalive on your Azure systems is greater than this value.  You
should set ``tcp_keepalive_time`` to 120 to ameliorate this problem.

On Linux systems you can use the following operation to check the
value of ``tcp_keepalive_time``:

.. code-block:: sh

   cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

The value is measured in seconds. You can change the
``tcp_keepalive_time`` value with the following operation:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo <value> > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

.. this block copied from core docs /includes/fact-tcp-keepalive-windows.rst

For Windows systems, issue the following command to view the keep alive
setting:

.. code-block:: powershell

   reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters /v KeepAliveTime

The registry value is not present by default. The system default used
if the value is absent, is 7200000 *milliseconds*, or ``0x6ddd00`` in
hexadecimal. To set a shorter keep alive period use the following
invocation in an Administrator :guilabel:`Command Prompt`, where
``<value>`` is expressed in hexadecimal (e.g. ``0x0124c0`` is 120000):

.. code-block:: powershell

   reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\ /v KeepAliveTime /d <value>

Windows users should consider the `Windows Server Technet Article on
KeepAliveTime
<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc957549.aspx>`_
for more information on setting keep alive for MongoDB deployments on
Windows systems.
