You can use a configuration file to customize |compass| settings at startup. 
You cannot override any settings that have been set with a configuration file on 
the |compass-short| interface.

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

- For macOS and Linux, the configuration file is located at 
  ``/etc/mongodb-compass.conf``.

- For Windows, the configuration file is located at 
  ``<path\to\compass>\..\mongodb-compass.cfg``.

Syntax
------

You can configure |compass-short| configuration file settings in either EJSON or 
YAML format. 

EJSON
`````

.. code-block:: json

    { 
      "setting": value,
      "setting": value,
      ...
    }

YAML
````

.. code-block:: yaml

    setting option: value
    setting option: value
    ...

Settings
--------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Setting 
     - Definition

   * - autoUpdates
     - Allow |compass-short| to periodically check for new updates.

   * - :ref:`enableGenAIFeatures <compass-enable-natural-language-querying>`
     - Allow |compass-short| to use generative AI for natural language querying.
       This feature requires an Atlas login and a deployed Atlas cluster.

   * - enableGenAISampleDocumentPassing
     - Allow |compass| to send sample field values with query and
       aggregation generation requests. These values can improve
       the results from the AI.

       If ``true``, this setting implicitly sets the
       ``enableGenAIFeatures`` setting to ``true``. 

   * - :ref:`enableDevTools <compass-enable-dev-tools>`
     - Enable Chrome DevTools in |compass-short|.

       To learn more, see :ref:`compass-enable-dev-tools`.

   * - enableMaps
     - Allow |compass-short| to make requests to third-party mapping services.

   * - :ref:`enableShell <disable-shell>`
     - Enable or disable the embedded MongoDB Shell on |compass-short|.

       To learn more, see :ref:`disable-shell`.

   * - :ref:`forceConnectionOptions <compass-force-connection-options>`
     - .. include:: /includes/fact-force-connection-options.rst
    
   * - ignoreAdditionalCommandLineFlags 
     - Allow or disallow additional command-line option flags.

   * - installURLHandlers 
     - Register |compass-short| as a handler for mongodb:// and mongodb+srv:// 
       URLs. 

       If :guilabel:`Install Compass as URL Protocol Handler` is enabled, 
       you can open |compass-short| by navigating to a mongodb:// or 
       mongodb+srv:// URL in your internet browser.

       *Available on macOS and Windows.*

   * - maxTimeMS 
     - Specify an upper time limit for all |compass-short| database operations.

   * - :ref:`networkTraffic <compass-configure-network-traffic>`
     - Prevent |compass| from performing outgoing network operations other 
       than those to the database.
   
   * - :ref:`protectConnectionStrings <compass-protect-connection-strings>`
     - .. include:: /includes/fact-protect-connection-strings.rst 

   * - protectConnectionStringsForNewConnections
     - Sets connection strings for new connections as read-only by
       default. Passwords in new connection strings display as
       ``*****``.
     
       If ``protectConnctionStringsForNewConnections`` is enabled,
       |compass-short| disables the :guilabel:`Edit connection string`
       option but doesn't prevent users from manually enabling the
       option with the :guilabel:`Edit connection string` toggle. 

   * - proxy
     - Enables you to specify or enforce the use of a proxy to connect
       to your deployment. For more information on connecting to your 
       deployment with a proxy, see :ref:`ssh-connection`.

       You must pass either a URL or the following format: 

       .. code-block::
          
          {
            "proxy": "string",
            "noProxyHosts": "string"
          }
       
       If you set ``proxy`` to an empty string, Compass does not use a proxy.

   * - :ref:`readOnly <compass-read-only>`
     - Prevent users from performing write operations to your MongoDB deployment 
       through |compass-short|.

       To learn more, see :ref:`compass-read-only`.

   * - :ref:`showKerberosPasswordField <compass-kerberos-password>`
     - Show or hide the Kerberos password field on the |compass-short| 
       connection form.

       To learn more, see :ref:`compass-kerberos-password`.
    
   * - theme
     - Specify the |compass| UI theme. The supported themes are ``DARK``,
       ``LIGHT``, and ``OS_THEME``.

   * - trackUsageStatistics
     - Allow |compass-short| to send anonymous usage statistics.

       To learn more, see :ref:`compass-telemetry`.

Example 
-------

To view a sample |compass-short| configuration file, run the following command: 

.. code-block:: sh

     <path-to-Compass-executable> --show-example-config

If you do not already have a configuration file, run the following command to 
create a configuration file that uses the sample configuration settings:

.. code-block:: sh 

     <path-to-Compass-executable> --show-example-config > /etc/mongodb-compass.conf
