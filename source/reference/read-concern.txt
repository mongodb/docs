MongoDB 3.2 introduces the ``readConcern`` query option for replica
sets and replica set shards. By default, MongoDB uses a read concern of
``"local"`` to return the most recent data available to the MongoDB
instance at the time of the query, even if the data has not been
persisted to a majority of replica set members and may be rolled back.

Storage Engine and Drivers Support
----------------------------------


For the :doc:`WiredTiger storage engine </core/wiredtiger>`, the
``readConcern`` option allows clients to choose a level of isolation
for their reads. You can specify a read concern of ``"majority"`` to
read data that has been written to a majority of replica set members
and thus cannot be rolled back.

With the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine </core/mmapv1>`, you can only
specify a ``readConcern`` option of ``"local"``.

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

``readConcern`` requires MongoDB drivers updated for 3.2.

Read Concern Levels
-------------------

By default, MongoDB uses a ``readConcern`` of ``"local"`` which
does not guarantee that the read data would not be rolled back.

You can specify a ``readConcern`` of ``"majority"`` to read data that
has been written to a majority of replica set members and thus cannot be
rolled back.

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - .. readconcern:: "local"

     - Default. The query returns the instance's most recent copy of
       data. Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
       majority of the replica set members.

   * - .. readconcern:: "majority"

     - The query returns the instance's most recent copy of data
       confirmed as written to a majority of members in the replica set.

``readConcern`` Option
----------------------

Use the ``readConcern`` option to specify the read concern level.

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"> }

For the ``level`` field, specify either the string ``"majority"`` or
``"local"``.

The ``readConcern`` option is available for the following operations:

- :dbcommand:`find` command

- :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method

- :dbcommand:`distinct` command

- :dbcommand:`count` command

- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan` command

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command

- :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command

To specify the read concern for the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
:method:`db.collection.find()`, use the :method:`cursor.readConcern()`
method.
