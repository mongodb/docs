|mms-full| can automate, monitor, and back up your MongoDB
infrastructure.

Automation
----------

|mms| Automation enables you to configure and maintain MongoDB nodes
and clusters.

   :align: center

MongoDB Agents using Automation on each MongoDB host can maintain your
MongoDB deployments. You can
:doc:`install </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` the
:doc:`MongoDB Agent </tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent>`. Automation can
:doc:`add hosts </tutorial/nav/add-servers>` and
:doc:`deploy and upgrade new or existing clusters </tutorial/nav/manage-hosts>`.

Monitoring
----------

|mms| Monitoring provides real-time reporting, visualization, and
alerting on key database and hardware indicators.

How Monitoring Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Monitoring on a MongoDB host, Monitoring collects
statistics from the nodes in your MongoDB deployment. The Agent
transmits database statistics back to |mms| to report deployment status
in real time. You can :doc:`set alerts </tutorial/nav/alerts>` on
indicators you choose.

Backup
------

|mms| Backup provides scheduled
:doc:`snapshots </tutorial/nav/backup-use-operations>` and
point-in-time
:doc:`recovery </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>`
of your MongoDB :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and
:manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

How Backup Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Backup for a MongoDB deployment, Backup takes
snapshots of data from the MongoDB processes you have specified.

Backup Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups rely upon the :manual:`MongoDB version compatibility</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of your database. This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the
current version to one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.4, the |fcv| can be
``4.2`` or ``4.4``.

The {+mdbagent+} uses WiredTiger's incremental backup cursor to capture
the incremental changes. 

The backup process works in this manner regardless of how snapshots are
stored.

Backup uses a MongoDB instance version equal to or greater than the
version of the replica set it backs up.

Backup takes and stores snapshots based on a user-defined
:ref:`snapshot retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.
Sharded cluster snapshots temporarily stop the balancer. The snapshots
then can insert a marker token into all shards and config servers in
the cluster. |mms| takes a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` when the marker tokens
appear in the snapshot data.

|mms| can back up data as a full or incremental backup. |mms| requires a full backup:

- For your first backup.
- After a snapshot has been deleted.
- If the blockstore block size has been changed.

Incremental backups reduce network transfer and storage costs.

To learn more about how to configure backups, see
:doc:`Backup Configuration Options </core/backup-preparations>`.

Restore Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup can restore data from a complete scheduled snapshot or from
a selected point between snapshots.

You can restore :manual:`sharded clusters
</reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` and :manual:`replica
sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` from selected points
in time.

When you restore from a :manual:`snapshot
</reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`, |mms| reads directly from 
the snapshot storage. You can restore the snapshot:

- To another cluster.
- To download the snapshot files from an |https| link.

When you restore from a point in time, |mms| does the following:
      
1. Restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage.
#. Applies stored :manual:`oplogs </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` until it reaches the 
   specified point.
#. Delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same
   |https| mechanisms.

You can configure how much of the oplog you want to keep per
backup. This affects the amount of time a point-in-time restore
can cover.
