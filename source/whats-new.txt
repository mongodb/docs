.. _version-4.2:

What's New in 4.2
-----------------
New features of the 4.2 Java driver release include:

- Added Azure and GCP key stores to client-side field level encryption
- Added Kerberos caching tickets for reuse in multiple authentication requests
- Added `MongoClients <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html>`_ instances with ``MongoClientSettings`` or ``ConnectionString`` as the configuration
-  The ``explain()`` method can now be used on `find <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html#explain()>`_ and `aggregate <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/AggregateIterable.html#explain()>`_ commands
- Added a `JsonObject <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/bson/org/bson/json/JsonObject.html>`_ class to make encoding from and decoding to JSON more efficient by avoiding an intermediate Map representation
- Added a `BsonRepresentation <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/pojo/annotations/BsonRepresentation.html>`_ annotation that allows ``ObjectId`` BSON values to be represented as a ``String`` in `POJO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object>`_ classes
- Added a `Filters.empty() <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html#empty()>`_ method

What's New in 4.1
-----------------
New features of the 4.1 Java driver release include:

- Significant reduction in client-perceived failover times during planned maintenance events
- The `update() <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.1/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOptions.html#hint(org.bson.conversions.Bson)>`_ and `delete() <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.1/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteOptions.html#hint(org.bson.conversions.Bson)>`_ methods now support index hints
- The ``find()`` method supports `allowDiskUse() <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.1/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html#allowDiskUse(java.lang.Boolean)>`_ for sorts that require too much memory to execute in RAM
- Added support for the MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials
- Authentication requires fewer round trips to the server, resulting in faster connection setup
