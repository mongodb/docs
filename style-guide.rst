10gen Documentation Style and Conventions
=========================================

**2011-09-27**: Document created with a (very) rough list of style
guidelines, and conventions that would be helpful to setup sooner
rather than later to help us create high quality unified
documentation. 

- File naming convention (and related URL naming convention.)

- Headlines and document titles should describe the content
  sufficiently that people can figure out what's in the section
  without needing to read the content (for better search and more
  efficient question answering.)

- Titles (e.g. "Using foo" vs. "How to Foo")
  
- Some basic overview on how to structure documents and use headlines.
  
- Conventional style points. Including, oxford commas (yes,)
  double-spaced terminal punctuation (no,) logical or American style
  for the interaction between enclosing punctuation and terminal
  punctuation (American with an exception,) title case for headings
  (yes,) and so forth.

- Tense (e.g "this will do foo" vs. "this does foo")

- RST specific styles/habits: e.g. (h1: =; h2: -; h3: ~; h4: +; h5: ^), 
  (hr: ------; ul-li: -;) link/ref formats; etc.

- Commit message style/requirements and other processes (e.g. trailing
  white space, column wrapping, etc.) 

- Policies regarding build errors. 

- Some sort of policy and system for describing the objectives for a
  document's content. (i.e. This document needs to address xyz.)

- Develop a fixed nomenclature for describing interface elements,
  architectural components (daemons, databases, processes, drivers,
  hosts, mongos' etc.)

  - Referring to proper nouns and capitalization/quoting
    rules. (i.e. "the "Hosts" page," or "the Hosts page," or "the
    hosts page")
