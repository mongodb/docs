$skip (aggregation)
===================

.. default-domain:: agg

.. pipeline:: $skip

   Skips over the specified number of :term:`documents <document>`
   that pass through the :pipeline:`$skip` in the :term:`pipeline`
   before passing all of the remaining input.

   :pipeline:`$skip` takes a single numeric (positive whole number)
   value as a parameter. Once the operation has skipped the specified
   number of documents, it passes all the remaining documents along the
   :term:`pipeline` without alteration. Consider the following
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $skip : 5 }
      );

   This operation skips the first 5 documents passed to it by the
   pipeline. :pipeline:`$skip` has no effect on the content of the
   documents it passes along the pipeline.
