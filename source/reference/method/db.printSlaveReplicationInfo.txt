.. method:: db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()

   Returns a formatted report of the status of a :term:`replica set`
   from the perspective of the :term:`secondary` member of the set. The

   :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`.

The following is example output from the
:method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` method issued on a replica set
with two secondary members:

A :ref:`delayed member <replica-set-delayed-members>` may show as ``0``
seconds behind the primary when the inactivity period on the primary is
greater than the :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].slaveDelay`
value.
