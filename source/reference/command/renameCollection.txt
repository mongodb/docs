Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: renameCollection

   Changes the name of an existing collection. Specify collection names
   to :dbcommand:`renameCollection` in the form of a complete
   :term:`namespace` (``<database>.<collection>``).

   Issue the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command against the
   :term:`admin database`.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { 
        renameCollection: "<source_namespace>", 
        to: "<target_namespace>", 
        dropTarget: <true|false>,
        txnNumber: <long>,
        lsid: { id: <UUID> }
      }

   The command contains the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-renameCollection-field.rst

Behavior
--------

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` is **not** compatible with sharded collections.

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` fails if ``target`` is the name of an existing
collection *and* you do not specify ``dropTarget: true``.

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` has different performance implications depending
on the target :term:`namespace`.

If the target database is the same as the source database,
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` simply changes the namespace. This is a quick
operation.

If the target database differs from the source database,
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` copies all documents from the source collection
to the target collection. Depending on the size of the collection, this
may take longer to complete. Other operations which require exclusive
access to the affected databases will be blocked until the rename completes.
See :ref:`faq-concurrency-operations-locks` for operations which require
exclusive access to all databases.

Example
-------

The following example renames a collection named ``orders`` in the
``test`` database to ``orders2014`` in the ``test`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { renameCollection: "test.orders", to: "test.orders2014" } )

The :program:`mongo` shell provides the
:method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` helper for the command to
rename collections within the *same* database. The following is
equivalent to the previous example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test
   db.orders.renameCollection( "orders2014" )

Exceptions
----------

:exception 10026:
   Raised if the ``source`` namespace does not exist.

:exception 10027:
   Raised if the ``target`` namespace exists and ``dropTarget`` is
   either ``false`` or unspecified.

:exception 15967:
   Raised if the ``target`` namespace is an invalid collection
   name.
