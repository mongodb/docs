   Run Backups with |fcv| 4.2 or Later with MongoDB Community
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   MongoDB has a special license to use MongoDB Enterprise for backups.

   To learn more about this license, see
   :doc:`/reference/legal/cloud-manager-backup-changes`

   Logs Display ``MongodVersionException``
   ---------------------------------------

   The ``MongodVersionException`` can occur if the
   :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>`\'s host cannot access the
   internet to download the version or versions of MongoDB required
   for the backed-up databases. Each database requires a version of
   MongoDB that matches the database's version. Specifically, for each
   instance you must run the latest stable release of that release
   series.

   If the Daemon runs without access to the internet, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-local-mode` to install the appropriate
   binaries.

   .. _troubleshoot-insufficient-oplog-size-error:

   Insufficient Oplog Size Error
   -----------------------------

   If you have set the :setting:`mms.backup.minimumOplogWindowHours`, |mms| checks to see if the cluster's oplogs can store a given number of hours of data. It bases on recent oplog usage patterns from the last 24 hours.

   If the oplogs lack capacity, the oplogs may have turned over
   multiple times. This creates a gap between where a backup
   ends and an oplog starts.

   If this oplog size check fails:

   - You cannot enable backups
   - |mms| displays the following:

     .. warning::

        Insufficient oplog size: The oplog window must be at least
        <duration> hours over the last 24 hours for all members of
        replica set <deploymentName>. Please increase the oplog.

   If possible, wait to start a backup until the oplog has had
   sufficient time to meet the size requirement.

   .. warning::
      Do not change the minimum oplog size unless you are certain
      smaller backups still provide useful backups.

      MongoDB recommends only changing this value temporarily to permit
      a test backup job to execute. The minimum oplog size value should
      be reset to the default as soon as possible.

      Understanding the risks given, you can start backups using this
      changed minimum value. Once you pass the 24 hour mark, you should
      reset this minimum value to preserve the sanity check for the
      global Ops Manager installation going forward.
