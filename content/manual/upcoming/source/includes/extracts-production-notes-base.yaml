  MongoDB is compatible with {{software}}.

  {{software}} supports *memory overcommitment*, where you can assign more memory
  to your virtual machines than the physical machine has available. When
  memory is overcommitted, the hypervisor reallocates memory between the
  virtual machines. {{software}}'s balloon driver {{balloonDriverLiteral}} reclaims the
  pages that are considered least valuable.

  The balloon driver resides inside the guest operating system. Under
  certain configurations, when the balloon driver expands, it can
  interfere with MongoDB's memory management and affect MongoDB's
  performance.

  To prevent negative performance impact from the balloon driver and
  memory overcommitment features, reserve the full amount of memory for
  the virtual machine running MongoDB. Reserving the appropriate amount
  of memory for the virtual machine prevents the balloon from inflating
  in the local operating system when there is memory pressure in the
  hypervisor.

  Even though the balloon driver and memory overcommitment features can
  negatively affect MongoDB performance under certain configurations,
  **do not disable these features**. If you disable these features, the
  hypervisor may use its swap space to fulfill memory requests, which
  negatively affects performance.
