Release Notes for MongoDB 2.6 (Release Candidate)
=================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. COMMENT The following 2 paragraphs will go away with the actual
   release.

MongoDB 2.6 is currently in development. While 2.6-release-candidates
are currently available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing
only and not for production use**.

This document will eventually contain the full release notes for
MongoDB 2.6; before its release this document covers the 2.6
release candidate series as a work-in-progress.

Downloading
-----------

You can download the current 2.6 release candidate on the `downloads
page`_ in the :guilabel:`Development Release (Unstable)`
section. There are no distribution packages for development releases,
but you can use the binaries provided for testing purposes. See
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`,
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows`, or
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x` for the basic installation
process.

.. _`downloads page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. important:: The MongoDB 2.6 release candidate series, which will
   become MongoDB 2.6, is for testing and development **only**.
   All identifiers, names, interfaces are subject to change. Do
   **not** use a MongoDB 2.6 release candidate in production situations.

Major New Features
------------------

The following changes in MongoDB affect both standard and Enterprise
editions:

.. _rn-2.6-aggregation-cursor:

Aggregation Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` now returns a cursor, which
  enables the aggregation pipeline to return result sets of any size.
  The method can also accept a second parameter, which allows for the
  specification of options, such as ``explain`` and ``allowDiskUse``.
  See :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` for details.

- New pipeline stages and new or modified operators:

  - :pipeline:`$out` stage to output to a collection

  - :pipeline:`$redact` stage to allow additional control to accessing
    the data

  - :doc:`set expression operators
    </reference/operator/aggregation-set>`

  - :expression:`$let` and :expression:`$map` operators to allow for
    the use of variables

  - :expression:`$literal` operator and :expression:`$size` operator

  - :expression:`$cond` expression can now accept either an object or
    an array

.. seealso:: :dbcommand:`aggregate` command

.. _rel-notes-text-query-operator:

Text Search Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MongoDB 2.6 enables text search by default, provides an updated
  version of the :doc:`text index </core/index-text>`, and introduces
  the :query:`$text` query operator to incorporate text search into the
  query framework and the aggregation pipeline. See
  :doc:`/core/index-text` and :query:`$text` query operator for details.

  MongoDB does not support the use of the :query:`$text` query operator
  in mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4
  and version 2.6 shards. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for
  upgrade instructions.

- MongoDB 2.6 deprecates the :dbcommand:`text` command.

.. _rel-notes-write-operations:

Write Operation Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- .. include:: /includes/fact-update-field-order.rst
     :start-after: order-of-document-fields
     :end-before: .. versionchanged

- :program:`mongo` shell provides new methods to perform bulk write
  operations. See :method:`Bulk()`.

- New :dbcommand:`insert`, :dbcommand:`update`, and :dbcommand:`delete`
  commands for write operations. All officially supported MongoDB
  drivers will support the new write commands before the official 2.6
  release.

- New or enhanced update operators:

  - :update:`$mul` operator for multiplication.

  - :update:`$bit` operator supports bitwise ``xor`` operation.

  - :update:`$min` and :update:`$max` operators that perform
    conditional update depending on the relative size of the specified
    value and the current value of a field.

  - :update:`$currentDate` operator to set the value of a field to the
    current date.

  - :update:`$push` operator has enhanced support for the
    :update:`$sort`, :update:`$slice`, and :update:`$each` modifiers
    and supports a new :update:`$position` modifier.

.. seealso:: :ref:`update-operations-incompatibility`

Enhanced Sharding and Replication Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command to remove :term:`orphaned
  documents <orphaned document>` from a shard.

- New :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` command to combine contiguous chunks
  located on a single shard. See :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` and
  :doc:`/tutorial/merge-chunks-in-sharded-cluster`.

- New :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` and
  :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` methods to provide a
  formatted report of the status of a replica set from the perspective
  of the primary and the secondary, respectively.

Geospatial Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduce version 2 of :ref:`2dsphere indexes
  <2dsphere-v2>`.

- Support for :ref:`geojson-multipoint`,
  :ref:`geojson-multilinestring`, :ref:`geojson-multipolygon`, and
  :ref:`geojson-geometrycollection`.

- Support for geospatial query clauses in :query:`$or` expressions.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`2.6-2dsphere-version-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-geo-maxDistance-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-uniqueDocs-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-geospatial-validation-incompatibility`,

MSI Package for MongoDB Available for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB now distributes MSI packages for Microsoft Windows. This is the
recommended method for MongoDB installation under Windows.

.. _2.6-relnotes-security:

Security Improvements
---------------------

- New :ref:`authorization model <authorization>` which provides the
  ability to create custom :ref:`user-defined-roles` and the ability to
  specify user privileges at a collection-level granularity.

- A global user management, storing all user and
  user-defined role data in the ``admin`` database and providing a new
  set of commands for managing users and roles.

- Enhanced SSL Support:

  - :doc:`x.509 certificate authentication </tutorial/configure-x509>`
    for client authentication as well as for internal authentication of
    sharded and/or replica set cluster members.

  - :doc:`Support rolling upgrades of clusters
    </tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl>` to use SSL.

  - :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl` support connections to
    :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using SSL
    connection.

  - :ref:`Can prompt for passphrase <ssl-certificate-password>`
    by :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` at startup.

  - Require the use of strong SSL ciphers, with a minimum 128-bit key
    length for all connections. The strong-cipher requirement prevents
    an old or malicious client from forcing use of a weak cipher.

- MongoDB disables the http interface by default, limiting
  :doc:`network exposure </core/security-network>`. To enable the
  interface, see :setting:`httpinterface`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`authentication-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`ssl-hostname-validation`

Query Engine Improvements
-------------------------

- :doc:`/core/index-intersection` to fulfill queries.

- :ref:`index-filters` to limit which indexes can become the winning
  plan for a query.

- :doc:`/reference/method/js-plan-cache` methods to view and clear the
  :doc:`query plans </core/query-plans>` cached by the query optimizer.

Index Build Enhancements
------------------------

- :ref:`Background index build
  <index-creation-building-indexes-on-secondaries>` allowed on
  secondaries; i.e. if you initiate a background index build on a
  :term:`primary`, the secondaries will replicate the index build in
  the background.

- Automatic rebuild of interrupted index builds after a restart.

  - If a standalone or a primary instance terminates during an index
    build *without a clean shutdown*, :program:`mongod` now restarts
    the index build when the instance restarts. If the instance shut
    down cleanly or if a user killed the index build, the interrupted
    index builds do not automatically restart upon the restart of the
    server.

  - If a secondary instance terminates during an index build, the
    :program:`mongod` instance will now restart the interrupted index
    build when the instance restarts.

  To disable this behavior, use the :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry`
  command line option.

.. seealso:: :ref:`2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility`

Operational Changes
-------------------

- :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` is the default allocation strategy for
  all new collections. The new allocation strategy uses more storage
  relative to total document size, but results in lower levels of
  storage fragmentation and more predictable storage capacity planning
  over time.

  To use the previous *exact fit allocation strategy*:

  - For a specific collection, use :dbcommand:`collMod` with
    :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` set to ``false``.

  - For all new collections on an entire :program:`mongod` instance,
    set :parameter:`newCollectionsUsePowerOf2Sizes` to ``false``.

- Remove upward limit for the :setting:`maxConns` for :program:`mongod`
  and :program:`mongos`. Previous versions capped the maximum possible
  :setting:`maxConns` setting at ``20,000`` connections.

- Connection pools for :program:`mongos` instance may be used by multiple
  MongoDB servers. This can reduce the number of connections needed
  for high volume workloads and reduce resource consumption in
  sharded clusters.

- New :method:`cursor.maxTimeMS()` and corresponding ``maxTimeMS``
  option for commands to specify a time limit.

- The :setting:`diaglog` and :option:`--diaglog` is deprecated. Using
  :setting:`diaglog` produces a startup warning.

- The C++ driver now monitors :term:`replica set` health with the
  :dbcommand:`isMaster` command instead of
  :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`. This allows the C++ driver to support
  systems that have access control enabled.

- :dbcommand:`isMaster` contains two new fields,
  :data:`~isMaster.minWireVersion` and :data:`~isMaster.maxWireVersion`
  that report respectively the earliest and latest version of the wire
  protocol that this :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance
  supports.

Tool Improvements
-----------------

- :program:`mongo` shell supports a global :ref:`/etc/mongorc.js
  <mongo-global-mongorc-file>`.

- All MongoDB :doc:`executable files </reference/program>` now support
  the ``--quiet`` option to suppress all logging output except for
  error messages.

- :program:`mongoimport` uses the input filename, without the file
  extension if any, as the collection name if run without the ``-c`` or
  ``--collection`` specification.

- :program:`mongoexport` can now constrain export data using
  :option:`--skip` and :option:`--limit` as well as order the documents
  in an export using the :option:`--sort` option.

- :program:`mongostat` can support the use of :option:`--rowcount`
  (:option:`-n`) with the :option:`--discover` option to produce the
  specified number of output lines.

- Add strict mode representation for :bsontype:`data_numberlong` for
  use by :program:`mongoexport` and :program:`mongoimport`.

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

The following changes are specific to MongoDB Enterprise Editions:

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`MongoDB Enterprise for Windows
</tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows>` is now available. It
includes support for Kerberos, SSL, and SNMP.

.. include:: /includes/admonition-mongodb-enterprise-windows-ldap.rst

Auditing
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise adds :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` capability for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. See :ref:`auditing`
for details.

.. _relnotes-ldap-authentication:

LDAP Support for Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise provides support for proxy authentication of users.
This allows administrators to configure a MongoDB cluster to
authenticate users via Linux PAM or by proxying authentication requests
to a specified Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service.
See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication-with-active-directory`
and :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication-with-open-ldap`.

.. include:: /includes/admonition-mongodb-enterprise-windows-ldap.rst

MongoDB does **not** support LDAP authentication in mixed sharded
cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4 and version 2.6
shards. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for upgrade instructions.

Expanded SNMP Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise has greatly expanded its SNMP support to provide
SNMP access to nearly the full range of metrics provided by
:method:`db.serverStatus()`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`2.6-snmp-iana-mib-incompatibility`
