MongoDB runs as a standard program. You can start MongoDB from a command
line by issuing the :binary:`~bin.mongod` command and specifying options.
For a list of options, see :doc:`/reference/mongod`. MongoDB can also run
as a Windows service. For details, see
:ref:`tutorial-mongod-as-windows-service`. To install MongoDB, see
:doc:`/installation`.

The following examples assume the directory containing the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process is in your system paths. The
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process is the primary database process that runs on
an individual server. :binary:`~bin.mongos` provides a coherent MongoDB
interface equivalent to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the perspective of a
client. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` binary provides the administrative
shell.

This document  page discusses the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process; however,
some portions of this document may be applicable to :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/administration/configuration`,
   :doc:`/reference/mongod`, :doc:`/reference/mongos`, and
   :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

Start ``mongod``
----------------

By default, MongoDB stores data in the ``/data/db`` directory. On
Windows, MongoDB stores data in ``C:\data\db``. On all platforms,
MongoDB listens for connections from clients on port ``27017``.

To start MongoDB using all defaults, issue the following command at
the system shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

Specify a Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want :binary:`~bin.mongod` to store data files at a path *other
than* ``/data/db`` you can specify a :setting:`dbpath`. The
:setting:`dbpath` must exist before you start :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If it
does not exist, create the directory and the permissions so that
:binary:`~bin.mongod` can read and write data to this path. For more
information on permissions, see the :ref:`security operations
documentation <security-operations>`.

To specify a :setting:`dbpath` for :binary:`~bin.mongod` to use as a data
directory, use the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option. The
following invocation will start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and store
data in the ``/srv/mongodb`` path

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb/

Specify a TCP Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a single process can listen for connections on a network
interface at a time. If you run multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes
on a single machine, or have other processes that must use this port,
you must assign each a different port to listen on for client
connections.

To specify a port to :binary:`~bin.mongod`, use the :option:`--port
<mongod --port>` option on the command line. The following command
starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` listening on port ``12345``:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 12345

Use the default port number when possible, to avoid confusion.

Start ``mongod`` as a Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a :binary:`~bin.mongod` process as a daemon (i.e. :setting:`fork`,)
*and* write its output to a log file, use the :option:`--fork
<mongod --fork>` and :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`
options. You must create the log directory; however, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
will create the log file if it does not exist.

The following command starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a daemon and records log
output to ``/var/log/mongodb.log``.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongodb.log

Additional Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an overview of common configurations and common configuration deployments.
configurations for common use cases, see
:doc:`/administration/configuration`.

Stop ``mongod``
---------------

To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance not running as a daemon,
press ``Control+C``. MongoDB stops when all ongoing operations are
complete and does a clean exit, flushing and closing all data files.

To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running in the background or
foreground, issue the :method:`~db.shutdownServer()` helper in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. Use the following sequence:

1. To open the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell for a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
   running on the default port of ``27017``, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. To switch to the ``admin`` database and shutdown the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance, issue the following commands:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.shutdownServer()

You may only use :method:`db.shutdownServer()` when connected to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` when authenticated to the ``admin`` database or on
systems without authentication connected via the localhost interface.

Alternately, you can shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

- using the :option:`--shutdown <mongod --shutdown>` option

- from a driver using the :dbcommand:`shutdown`. For details, see the
  :doc:`drivers documentation </applications/drivers>` for your driver.

``mongod`` Shutdown and Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is the :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica
set`, the shutdown process for these :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances has
the following steps:

1. Check how up-to-date the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` are.

#. If no secondary is within 10 seconds of the primary,
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` will return a message that it will not shut down.
   You can pass the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command a ``timeoutSecs``
   argument to wait for a secondary to catch up.

#. If there is a secondary within 10 seconds of the primary, the primary
   will step down and wait for the secondary to catch up.

#. After 60 seconds or once the secondary has caught up, the primary
   will shut down.

If there is no up-to-date secondary and you want the primary to shut
down, issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command with the ``force``
argument, as in the following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, force : true})

To keep checking the secondaries for a specified number of seconds if
none are immediately up-to-date, issue :dbcommand:`shutdown` with the
``timeoutSecs`` argument. MongoDB will keep checking the secondaries for
the specified number of seconds if none are immediately up-to-date. If
any of the secondaries catch up within the allotted time, the primary
will shut down. If no secondaries catch up, it will not shut down.

The following command issues :dbcommand:`shutdown` with ``timeoutSecs``
set to ``5``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, timeoutSecs : 5})

Alternately you can use the ``timeoutSecs`` argument with the
:method:`shutdownServer() <db.shutdownServer()>` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shutdownServer({timeoutSecs : 5})

Sending a UNIX INT or TERM Signal
---------------------------------

You can cleanly stop :binary:`~bin.mongod` using a ``SIGINT`` or ``SIGTERM``
signal on UNIX-like systems. Either ``^C`` for a non-daemon
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, ``kill -2 <pid>``, or ``kill -15 <pid>`` will
cleanly terminate the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

Terminating a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is **not** running with
:term:`journaling <journal>` with ``kill -9 <pid>`` (i.e. ``SIGKILL``)
will probably cause data corruption.

To recover data in situations where :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances have
not terminated cleanly *without* :term:`journaling <journal>` see
:doc:`/tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown`.
