Overview
--------

You can use {+vector-search+} to perform vector search on your data stored in
Atlas. Vector search allows you to query your data based on semantic meaning
rather than just keyword matches, which helps you retrieve more relevant search
results. It enables your AI-powered applications to support use cases such as
semantic search, hybrid search, and generative search, including
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

By using Atlas as a vector database, you can seamlessly index vector data along
with your other data in Atlas. This allows you to filter on fields in your
collection and perform vector search queries against vector data. You can also
combine vector search with full-text search queries to return the most relevant
results for your use case. You can integrate {+vector-search+} with popular AI
frameworks and services to easily implement vector search in your applications.

To learn more about {+vector-search+}, see the :atlas:`{+vector-search+}
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` guide in the MongoDB Atlas
documentation.

Supported Vector Embedding Types
--------------------------------

:atlas:`Vector embeddings
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/#std-term-vector-embeddings>`
are vectors you use to represent your data. These embeddings
capture meaningful relationships in your data and enable tasks like semantic
search and retrieval.

The {+driver-short+} supports vector embeddings of several types. The following
sections describe the supported vector embedding types.


.. _csharp-vector-array-representation:

Array Representations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} supports the following representations of the array
type in vector embeddings:

- ``BsonArray``
- ``Memory``
- ``ReadOnlyMemory``
- ``float[]`` and ``double[]``

The following example shows a class with properties of the preceding types:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchExamples.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-bson-arrays
   :end-before: end-bson-arrays

.. _csharp-binary-vector-representation:

Binary Vector Representations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} supports the following binary vector representations in
vector embeddings:

- ``BinaryVectorFloat32`` (not supported on big-endian architectures)
- ``BinaryVectorInt8``
- ``BinaryVectorPackedBit``
- ``Memory<float>``, ``Memory<byte>``, ``Memory<sbyte>``
- ``ReadOnlyMemory<float>``, ``ReadOnlyMemory<byte>``, ``ReadOnlyMemory<sbyte>``
- ``float[]``, ``byte[]``, ``sbyte[]``

.. note::

   You must use the ``BinaryVector`` attribute when specifying binary vector
   representations of the ``Memory<T>``, ``ReadOnlyMemory<T>``, or array
   types.

The following example shows a class with properties of the preceding types:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchExamples.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-binary-vectors
   :end-before: end-binary-vectors

Binary Vector Data Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can serialize ``Int8`` binary vector typed data as ``byte`` or ``sbyte``.
You can also serialize ``Float32`` binary vector typed data as ``float``. The
following example serializes ``Int8`` and ``Float32`` binary vector data:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchExamples.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-binary-int-float-serialize
   :end-before: end-binary-int-float-serialize

You can deserialize ``PackedBit`` vector data to a :ref:`binary vector
represented <csharp-binary-vector-representation>` ``byte`` data type only if the
vector data has a padding value of ``0``. If the vector data has a padding value not
equal to ``0``, you can deserialize it only to a ``BsonVectorPackedBit``.

Vector Search Query Example
---------------------------

You can perform a vector search query by calling the ``VectorSearch()`` method
in an :ref:`aggregation pipeline <csharp-aggregation>`. To perform a vector
search on a collection, you must first have a collection with a field that contains
vector data and a vector search index that covers that field.

.. tip::

   To learn more about configuring a collection for vector search, see the :atlas:`{+vector-search+}
   </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` guide in the MongoDB Atlas
   documentation.

You can convert ``BinaryVectorFloat32``, ``BinaryVectorInt8``, and
``BinaryVectorPackedBit`` data to the ``BsonBinaryData`` type to use in a vector
search query by using the ``ToQueryVector()`` method. The following example
converts ``BinaryVectorInt8`` into a ``BsonBinaryData`` object:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchExamples.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-to-query-vector
   :end-before: end-to-query-vector

You can specify your :ref:`array-represented
<csharp-vector-array-representation>` vector data as an instance of the
``QueryVector`` class to use in a vector search query. The following example 
creates an array of ``ReadOnlyMemory<float>`` values as a ``QueryVector`` object
to use in a vector search query:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchExamples.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-array-query-vector
   :end-before: end-array-query-vector

Example
~~~~~~~

This example performs the following steps to run an {+vector-search+} query on a collection that
contains vector data and a vector search index on the ``PlotEmbedding`` field:

1. Creates an array that contains the :ref:`array-represented
   <csharp-vector-array-representation>` vector data to search for
#. Specifies a ``VectorSearchOptions`` object that contains the name of the index
   and the number of nearest neighbors to use during the search
#. Creates an aggregation pipeline that uses the ``VectorSearch()`` stage to
   perform the vector search query and a ``Project()`` stage to filter the
   results
#. Prints the results of the query

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-vector-search/VectorSearchQueryExample.cs
   :language: csharp
   :start-after: start-search-example
   :end-before: end-search-example
