=========================
Restore a Sharded Cluster
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The procedure outlined in this document addresses how to restore an
entire sharded cluster. For information on related backup procedures
consider the following tutorials which describe backup procedures in
greater detail:

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots`
- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps`

The exact procedure used to restore a database depends on the method
used to capture the backup. See the :doc:`/core/backups`
document for an overview of backups with MongoDB and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for a complete
information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded clusters in
particular.

Procedure
---------

1. Stop all :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes.

#. If shard hostnames have changed, you must manually update the
   ``shards`` collection in the :ref:`config-database` to use the new
   hostnames. Do the following:

   a. Start the three :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` by
      issuing commands similar to the following, using values appropriate
      to your configuration:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --configsvr --dbpath /data/configdb --port 27019

   #. Restore the :ref:`config-database` on each config server.

   #. Start one :program:`mongos` instance.

   #. Update the :ref:`config-database` collection named ``shards`` to reflect the
      new hostnames.

#. Restore the following:

   - Data files for each server in each :term:`shard`. Because replica
     sets provide each production shard, restore all the members of
     the replica set or use the other standard approaches for
     restoring a replica set from backup. See the
     :ref:`backup-restore-snapshot` and :ref:`backup-restore-dump`
     sections for details on these procedures.

   - Data files for each :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`,
     if you have not already done so in the previous step.

#. Restart all the :program:`mongos` instances.

#. Restart all the :program:`mongod` instances.

#. Connect to a :program:`mongos` instance from a :program:`mongo` shell
   and use the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` method to ensure
   that the cluster is operational, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.printShardingStatus()
      show collections
