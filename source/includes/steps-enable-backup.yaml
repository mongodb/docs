          Using a secondary is preferred because it minimizes

          - :guilabel:`WiredTiger`.

            If you select this option, |mms|
            can only back up deployments with fewer than
            100,000 collections.

          See the considerations in :ref:`Storage Engines
          <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.

        - Same storage engine as the primary node of the database being
          backed up.
