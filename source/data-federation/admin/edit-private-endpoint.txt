MongoDB supports |aws| private endpoints using the `{+aws-pl+}
<https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature only for your 
{+fdi+}\s. You can edit the comment associated with a private endpoint 
for {+fdi+}\s from the {+atlas-cli+}, |service| User Interface, and |api|. 

Required Access
---------------

To edit a private endpoint, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.
Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner``
to the project before setting up a private endpoint.

Edit Private Endpoint Through the User Interface 
------------------------------------------------

To edit the comment associated with a private endpoint from your 
|service| UI: 

.. include:: /includes/steps/adf-edit-privatelink.rst

Edit Private Endpoint Through the API 
-------------------------------------

To edit a private endpoint through the |api|, send a ``POST`` request 
to the ``privateNetworkSettings`` endpoint with the unique ID of the 
private endpoint to edit. If there is no change to the 
comment associated with the specified endpoint, |service| makes no 
change to the endpoint ID list. If there is a change to the comment 
associated with the specified endpoint, |service| updates the 
``comment`` value only in the endpoint ID list.

To learn more about the syntax and options, see :oas-atlas-op:`API
