Collation allows users to specify language-specific rules for string
comparison, such as rules for lettercase and accent marks.

You can specify collation for a collection or a view, an index, or
specific operations that support collation.

.. _collation-document-fields:

Collation Document
------------------

A collation document has the following fields:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-document.rst

Default collation parameter values vary depending on which
locale you specify. For a complete list of default collation
parameters and the locales they are associated with, see
:ref:`Collation Default Parameters<collation-default-params>`.


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``locale``

     - string

     - The ICU locale. See :ref:`collation-languages-locales` for a
       list of supported locales.
       
       To specify simple binary comparison, specify ``locale`` value of
       ``"simple"``.
       
       

   * - ``strength``

     - integer

     - Optional. The level of comparison to perform.
       Corresponds to `ICU Comparison Levels
       <http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-Comparison-Levels>`_.
       Possible values are:
       
       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 15 90
       
          * - Value
            - Description
       
          * - 1
       
            - Primary level of comparison. Collation performs
              comparisons of the base characters only, ignoring other
              differences such as diacritics and case.
       
          * - 2
       
            - Secondary level of comparison. Collation performs comparisons
              up to secondary differences, such as diacritics.
              That is, collation performs comparisons of base characters
              (primary differences) and diacritics (secondary differences).
              Differences between base characters takes precedence over
              secondary differences.
       
          * - 3
       
            - Tertiary level of comparison. Collation performs comparisons
              up to tertiary differences, such as case and letter variants.
              That is, collation performs comparisons of base characters
              (primary differences), diacritics (secondary differences), and
              case and variants (tertiary differences). Differences between
              base characters takes precedence over secondary differences,
              which takes precedence over tertiary differences.
       
              This is the default level.
       
          * - 4
       
            - Quaternary Level. Limited for specific use case to
              consider punctuation when levels 1-3 ignore punctuation
              or for processing Japanese text.
       
          * - 5
       
            - Identical Level. Limited for specific use case of tie
              breaker.
       
       See `ICU Collation: Comparison Levels
       <http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-Comparison-Levels>`_
       for details.
       
       

   * - ``caseLevel``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Flag that determines whether to include case comparison 
       at ``strength`` level ``1`` or ``2``.
       
       If ``true``, include case comparison:
       
       - When used with ``strength:1``, collation compares base characters
         and case.
       
       - When used with ``strength:2``, collation compares base characters,
         diacritics (and possible other secondary differences) and case.
       
       If ``false``, do not include case comparison at level ``1`` or
       ``2``. The default is ``false``.
       
       For more information, see `ICU Collation: Case Level
       <http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-CaseLevel>`_.
       
       

   * - ``caseFirst``

     - string

     - Optional. A field that determines sort order of case differences during
       tertiary level comparisons.
       
       Possible values are: 
           
       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 30 90
       
          * - Value
            - Description

          * - ``"upper"``
            - Uppercase sorts before lowercase.
       
          * - ``"lower"``
            - Lowercase sorts before uppercase.
       
          * - ``"off"``
       
            - Default value. Similar to ``"lower"`` with slight
              differences. See
              `<http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/customization>`_
              for details of differences.
       
       

   * - ``numericOrdering``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Flag that determines whether to compare numeric strings as numbers
       or as strings.
       
       If ``true``, compare as numbers. For example,
       ``"10"`` is greater than ``"2"``.
       
       If ``false``, compare as strings. For example,
       ``"10"`` is less than ``"2"``.
       
       Default is ``false``.

       See :ref:`numericOrdering Restrictions <numeric-order-restrictions>`.
       
       

   * - ``alternate``

     - string

     - Optional. Field that determines whether collation should consider whitespace
       and punctuation as base characters for purposes of comparison.
       
       Possible values are:
       
       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 30 90
       
          * - Value
            - Description
       
          * - ``"non-ignorable"``
       
            - Whitespace and punctuation are considered base characters.
       
          * - ``"shifted"``
       
            - Whitespace and punctuation are not considered base characters
              and are only distinguished at strength levels greater than 3.
       
       See `ICU Collation: Comparison Levels
       <http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-Comparison-Levels>`_
       for more information.
       
       Default is ``"non-ignorable"``.
       
       

   * - ``maxVariable``

     - string

     - Optional. Field that determines up to which characters are considered
       ignorable when ``alternate: "shifted"``. Has no effect if
       ``alternate: "non-ignorable"``
       
       Possible values are:
       
       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 30 90
       
          * - Value
            - Description
       
          * - ``"punct"``
       
            - Both whitespace and punctuation are ignorable and not
              considered base characters.
       
          * - ``"space"``
       
            - Whitespace is ignorable and not considered to be base
              characters.
       
       

   * - ``backwards``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Flag that determines whether strings with diacritics sort from back
       of the string, such as with some French dictionary ordering.
       
       If ``true``, compare from back to front.
       
       If ``false``, compare from front to back.
       
       The default value is ``false``.
       
       

   * - ``normalization``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Flag that determines whether to check if text require normalization
       and to perform normalization. Generally, majority of text does not
       require this normalization processing.
       
       If ``true``, check if fully normalized and perform normalization to
       compare text.
       
       If ``false``, does not check.
       
       The default value is ``false``.
       
       See
       `<http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-Normalization>`_ for details.
       
          
   


Operations that Support Collation
---------------------------------

You can specify collation for the following operations:

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-single-per-operation.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-operations-table.rst

.. [#index-restriction] 

   Some index types do not support collation. See
   :ref:`collation-unsupported-index-types` for details.

Restrictions
------------

.. _numeric-order-restrictions:

numericOrdering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When specifying the ``numericOrdering`` as ``true`` the following 
restrictions apply:

- Only contiguous non-negative integer substrings of digits are 
  considered in the comparisons. 

  ``numericOrdering`` does not support:

  - ``+``
  - ``-``
  - decimal separators, like decimal points and decimal commas
  - exponents

- Only Unicode code points in the Number or Decimal Digit (Nd) category 
  are treated as digits.

- If a digit length exceeds 254 characters, the excess characters are 
  treated as a separate number.

Consider a collection with the following string number and decimal 
values:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 6,10

   db.c.insertMany(
     [
         { "n" : "1" },
         { "n" : "2" },
         { "n" : "2.1" },
         { "n" : "-2.1" },
         { "n" : "2.2" },
         { "n" : "2.10" },
         { "n" : "2.20" },
         { "n" : "-10" },
         { "n" : "10" },
         { "n" : "20" },
         { "n" : "20.1" }
     ]
   )

The following :method:`find <db.collection.find()>` query uses a 
collation document containing the ``numericOrdering`` parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.c.find(
      { }, { _id: 0 }
   ).sort(
     { n: 1 }
   ).collation( {
     locale: 'en_US',
     numericOrdering: true
   } )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3,7-8
   :copyable: false
   
   [
       { n: '-2.1' },
       { n: '-10' },
       { n: '1' },
       { n: '2' },
       { n: '2.1' },
       { n: '2.2' },
       { n: '2.10' },
       { n: '2.20' },
       { n: '10' },
       { n: '20' },
       { n: '20.1' }
   ]

- ``numericOrdering: true`` sorts the string values in ascending 
  order as if they were numeric values.
- The two negative values ``-2.1`` and ``-10`` are not sorted in the 
  expected sort order because they have unsupported ``-`` characters.
- The value ``2.2`` is sorted before the value ``2.10``, due to the fact
  that the ``numericOrdering`` parameter does not support decimal 
  values.
- As a result, ``2.2`` and ``2.10`` are sorted in lexicographic order.
