  The maximum size for the capped collection. Once a capped collection
  reaches its maximum size, MongoDB drops old documents from the
  collection to make way for new documents. The ``size`` field is
  required for capped collections.

  The maximum number of documents to keep in the capped collection. The
  ``size`` limit takes precedence over this limit. If a capped
  collection reaches its maximum size before it reaches the maximum
  number of documents, MongoDB removes old documents. If you use this
  limit, ensure that the ``size`` limit is sufficient to contain the
  documents limit.
