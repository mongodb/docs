Java Driver Concurrency
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Java MongoDB driver is thread safe. If you are using in a web
serving environment, for example, you should create a single ``MongoClient``
instance, and you can use it in every request. The ``MongoClient`` object
maintains an internal pool of connections to the database (default
maximum pool
size of 100). For every request to the DB (``find``, ``insert``, etc) the Java
thread will obtain a connection from the pool, execute the operation,
and release the connection. This means the connection (socket) used may
be different each time.

Additionally in the case of a replica set and a read preference of secondary, 
the read operations will be distributed evenly across all
secondaries. This means that within the same thread, a write followed by a
read may be sent to different servers (master then slave). In turn the
read operation may not see the data just written since replication is
asynchronous. 

``DB`` and ``DBCollection`` are completely thread safe. In fact, they are
cached so you get the same instance no matter what.

WriteConcern Option for Single Write Operation
----------------------------------------------

Since by default a connection is given back to the pool after each
request, you may wonder how calling ``getLastError()`` works after a
write. You should actually use a write concern like
``WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`` instead of calling ``getLastError()`` manually.
The driver will then call ``getLastError()`` before putting the
connection back in the pool.

.. code-block:: java

   DBCollection coll...;
   coll.insert(..., WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED);

   // is equivalent to

   DB db...;
   DBCollection coll...;
   db.requestStart();
   try {
      coll.insert(...);
      DBObject err = db.getLastError();
   } finally {
      db.requestDone();
   }
