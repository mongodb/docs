This page describes the ``$text`` operator for self-managed deployments.

Definition
----------

.. query:: $text

   ``$text`` performs a text query on the content of the fields
   indexed with a :ref:`text index <index-type-text>`. 

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``$text``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------
   
A ``$text`` expression has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $text: {
       $search: <string>,
       $language: <string>,
       $caseSensitive: <boolean>,
       $diacriticSensitive: <boolean>
     }
   }

The ``$text`` operator accepts a text query document with the
following fields:

.. |object-behavior| replace:: :ref:`text-query-operator-behavior`
.. |text-obj| replace:: text search

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``$search``
     - string
     - A string of terms that MongoDB parses and uses to query the text
       index. MongoDB performs a logical ``OR`` query on the terms
       unless you specify the terms as an :ref:`exact string
       <text-operator-exact-string>`. For more information on the field, see
       |object-behavior|.        

   * - ``$language``
     - string

     - .. _language-field:

       Optional. The language that determines the list of stop words for
       the query and the rules for the stemmer and tokenizer. If
       unspecified, MongoDB uses the default language of the index. For
       supported languages, see :ref:`text-search-languages`.
          
       .. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-language-none.rst

   * - ``$caseSensitive``
     - boolean
     - Optional. A boolean flag to enable or disable case sensitivity.
       Defaults to ``false``. If unspecified, MongoDB defers to the case
       insensitivity of the :ref:`text <index-type-text>` index.
          
       For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`.

   * - ``$diacriticSensitive``
     - boolean
     - Optional. A boolean flag to enable or disable diacritic
       sensitivity against :ref:`version 3 text indexes
       <index-type-text>`. Defaults to ``false``. If unspecified,
       MongoDB defers to the diacritic insensitivity of the :ref:`text
       <index-type-text>` index.

       Text queries against earlier versions of the text index are
       inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive.
       As such, the ``$diacriticSensitive`` option has no effect with
       earlier versions of the ``text`` index.

       For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity`.

The ``$text`` operator, by default, does *not* return results sorted in
terms of the results' scores. For more information on sorting by the
results' scores, see the :ref:`text-operator-text-score` documentation.

.. _text-query-operator-behavior:

Behavior
--------

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A query can specify, at most, one ``$text`` expression.

- ``$text`` cannot appear in :query:`$nor` expressions.

- ``$text`` cannot appear in :query:`$elemMatch` query
  expressions or :projection:`$elemMatch` projection expressions.

- To use ``$text`` in an :query:`$or` expression, all
  clauses in the :query:`$or` array must be indexed.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-hint-text-query-restriction.rst

- You cannot specify the :operator:`$natural` sort order if the query
  includes a ``$text`` expression.

  .. |operation| replace:: ``$text`` expression

- .. include:: /includes/fact-special-indexes-and-text.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-text-search.rst

- ``$text`` is unsupported for creating indexes using the
  :ref:`Stable API <stable-api>` V1.

If using the ``$text`` operator in aggregation, the following
restrictions also apply.

.. include:: /includes/list-text-search-restrictions-in-agg.rst

.. |text-object| replace:: ``$text``
.. |meta-object| replace:: :expression:`$meta` projection operator
.. |sort-object| replace:: :method:`~cursor.sort()` method

``$search`` Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``$search`` field, specify a string of words that the
``$text`` operator parses and uses to query the :ref:`text index
<index-type-text>`.

The ``$text`` operator treats most punctuation
in the string as delimiters, except a hyphen-minus (``-``) that negates term or
an escaped double quotes ``\"`` that specifies an exact string.

.. note::

   The ``$search`` field for the ``$text`` expression is different than
   the :atlas:`$search aggregation stage
   </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/>` provided by :atlas:`Atlas
   Search </atlas-search>`. The ``$search`` aggregation stage performs a
   full-text search on specified fields and is only available on MongoDB
   Atlas.

.. _text-operator-exact-string:

Exact Strings
`````````````

To match on an exact multi-word string, as opposed to individual terms, enclose
the string in escaped double quotes (``\"``), as in:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "\"ssl certificate\""

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-multiword-and-term.rst

For example, the following ``$search`` string returns documents that include the
exact string ``"ssl certificate"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "\"ssl certificate\" authority key"

.. _text-operator-term-negation:

Negations
`````````

Prefixing a word with a hyphen-minus (``-``) negates a word:

- The negated word excludes documents that contain the
  negated word from the result set.

- When passed a string that only contains negated words, ``$text`` does
  not match any documents.

- A hyphenated word, such as ``pre-market``, is not a negation. If used
  in a hyphenated word, the ``$text`` operator treats the hyphen-minus
  (``-``) as a delimiter. To negate the word ``market`` in this
  instance, include a space between ``pre`` and ``-market``, i.e.,
  ``pre -market``.

The ``$text`` operator adds all negations to the operation with the
logical ``AND`` operator.

Match Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop Words
``````````

The ``$text`` operator ignores language-specific stop words, such
as ``the`` and ``and`` in English.

.. _match-operation-stemmed-words:

Stemmed Words
`````````````

When you use case insensitivity and diacritic insensitivity, the
``$text`` operator matches on the complete *stemmed* word. If a document
field contains the word ``blueberry``, a ``$text`` operation with a
``$search`` term of ``blue`` does not match. However, ``blueberry`` or
``blueberries`` match.

.. _case-sensitivity-and-stemming:

Case Sensitivity and Stemmed Words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you use :ref:`case sensitivity <text-operator-case-sensitivity>`
(``$caseSensitive: true``), if the suffix stem contains uppercase
letters, the ``$text`` operator matches on the exact word.

.. _diacritic-sensitivity-and-stemming:

Diacritic Sensitivity and Stemmed Words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you use :ref:`diacritic sensitivity
<text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity>` (``$diacriticSensitive: true``),
if the suffix stem contains the diacritic mark or marks, the ``$text``
operator matches on the exact word.

.. _text-operator-case-sensitivity:

Case Insensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$text`` operator defaults to the case insensitivity of the
:ref:`text <index-type-text>` index:

- The version 3 :ref:`text index <text-index-case-insensitivity>` is
  case insensitive for Latin characters with or without diacritics and
  characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as the Cyrillic alphabet.
  See :ref:`text <text-index-case-insensitivity>` index for details.

- Earlier versions of the ``text`` index are case insensitive for Latin
  characters without diacritic marks; i.e. for ``[A-z]``.

``$caseSensitive`` Option
`````````````````````````

To support case sensitivity where the ``text`` index is case
insensitive, specify ``$caseSensitive: true``.

Case Sensitivity Process
````````````````````````

If ``$caseSensitive: true`` and the ``text`` index is case insensitive,
the ``$text`` operator:

- First queries the ``text`` index for case insensitive and diacritic
  matches.

- Then, to return just the documents that match the case of the
  specified terms, the ``$text`` operation includes an additional stage to
  filter out the documents that do not match the specified case.

If ``$caseSensitive: true`` and if the suffix stem contains uppercase
letters, the ``$text`` operator matches on the exact word.

Specifying ``$caseSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

.. _text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity:

Diacritic Insensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$text`` operator defaults to the diacritic insensitivity of
the :ref:`text <index-type-text>` index:

- The version 3 :ref:`text index <text-index-diacritic-insensitivity>` is
  diacritic insensitive. That is, the index does not distinguish
  between characters that contain diacritical marks and their
  non-marked counterpart, such as ``é``, ``ê``, and ``e``.

- Earlier versions of the ``text`` index are diacritic sensitive.

``$diacriticSensitive`` Option
``````````````````````````````

To support diacritic sensitivity with the ``text`` index, specify
``$diacriticSensitive: true``.

Text queries against earlier versions of the ``text`` index are
inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive.  As
such, the ``$diacriticSensitive`` option for the ``$text``
operator has no effect with earlier versions of the ``text`` index.

Diacritic Sensitivity Process
`````````````````````````````

To use diacritic sensitivity (``$diacriticSensitive: true``) with a
version 3 ``text`` index, the ``$text`` operator:

- First queries the ``text`` index, which is diacritic insensitive.

- Then, to return just the documents that match the diacritic marked
  characters of the specified terms, the ``$text`` operation includes an
  additional stage to filter out the documents that do not match.

Specifying ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

If you use ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` with an earlier version of the
``text`` index, the ``$text`` operator queries the ``text`` index, which
is diacritic sensitive.

If ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` and if the suffix stem contains the
diacritic mark or marks, the ``$text`` operator matches on the exact
word.

Text Score
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-score.rst

.. _text-query-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples assume a collection ``articles`` that has a
:ref:`version 3 text <index-type-text>` index on the field ``subject``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.createIndex( { subject: "text" } )

Populate the collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.insertMany( [
        { _id: 1, subject: "coffee", author: "xyz", views: 50 },
        { _id: 2, subject: "Coffee Shopping", author: "efg", views: 5 },
        { _id: 3, subject: "Baking a cake", author: "abc", views: 90  },
        { _id: 4, subject: "baking", author: "xyz", views: 100 },
        { _id: 5, subject: "Café Con Leche", author: "abc", views: 200 },
        { _id: 6, subject: "Сырники", author: "jkl", views: 80 },
        { _id: 7, subject: "coffee and cream", author: "efg", views: 10 },
        { _id: 8, subject: "Cafe con Leche", author: "xyz", views: 10 }
   ] )


``$text`` with a Single Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example specifies a ``$search`` string of ``coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "coffee" } } )

This operation returns the documents that contain the term ``coffee`` in the
indexed ``subject`` field, or more precisely, the stemmed version of
the word:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, subject: 'coffee', author: 'xyz', views: 50 },
   { _id: 7, subject: 'coffee and cream', author: 'efg', views: 10 },
   { _id: 2, subject: 'Coffee Shopping', author: 'efg', views: 5 }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`
   - :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

Match Any of the ``$search`` Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``$search`` string is a space-delimited string, ``$text``
performs a logical ``OR`` operation on each term and returns documents
that contain any of the terms.

The following example specifies a ``$search`` string of three terms
delimited by space, ``"bake coffee cake"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "bake coffee cake" } } )

This operation returns documents that contain either ``bake`` **or**
``coffee`` **or** ``cake`` in the indexed ``subject`` field, or more
precisely, the stemmed version of these words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }
   { "_id" : 7, "subject" : "coffee and cream", "author" : "efg", "views" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "coffee", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 50 }
   { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "Baking a cake", "author" : "abc", "views" : 90 }
   { "_id" : 4, "subject" : "baking", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 100 }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`
   - :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

``$text`` with an Exact String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To match an exact multi-word string as a single term, escape the quotes.

The following example matches the exact string ``coffee shop``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "\"coffee shop\"" } } )

This operation returns documents that contain the string ``coffee shop``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }

The following example matches the strings ``coffee shop`` and ``Cafe
con Leche``. This is a logical OR of the two strings.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "\'coffee shop\' \'Cafe con Leche\'" } } )
   
This operation returns documents that contain both the strings, including
documents that contain terms from both the strings: 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false 

   [
     { _id: 8, subject: 'Cafe con Leche', author: 'xyz', views: 10 },
     { _id: 5, subject: 'Café Con Leche', author: 'abc', views: 200 },
     { _id: 1, subject: 'coffee', author: 'xyz', views: 50 },
     { _id: 7, subject: 'coffee and cream', author: 'efg', views: 10 },
     { _id: 2, subject: 'Coffee Shopping', author: 'efg', views: 5 }
   ]

.. seealso::

   :ref:`text-operator-exact-string`

Exclude Documents That Contain a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *negated* term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If
you negate a term, the ``$text`` operator excludes the documents that
contain those terms from the results.

The following example matches documents that contain the word ``coffee``
but do **not** contain the term ``shop``, or more precisely the stemmed
version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "coffee -shop" } } )

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 7, "subject" : "coffee and cream", "author" : "efg", "views" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "coffee", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 50 }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`text-operator-term-negation`
   - :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

Query a Different Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the optional ``$language`` field in the ``$text`` expression
to specify a language that determines the list of stop words and the
rules for the stemmer and tokenizer for the ``$search`` string.

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-language-none.rst

The following example specifies ``es``, i.e. Spanish, as the language
that determines the tokenization, stemming, and stop words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { $text: { $search: "leche", $language: "es" } }
   )

The example returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }
   { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 10 }

The ``$text`` expression can also accept the language by name,
``spanish``. See :ref:`text-search-languages` for the supported
languages.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`

Case and Diacritic Insensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$text`` operator defers to the case and diacritic
insensitivity of the ``text`` index. The version 3 ``text`` index is
diacritic insensitive and expands its case insensitivity to include the
Cyrillic alphabet as well as characters with diacritics. For details,
see :ref:`text Index Case Insensitivity
<text-index-case-insensitivity>` and :ref:`text Index Diacritic
Insensitivity <text-index-diacritic-insensitivity>`.

The following example performs a case and diacritic insensitive text
query for the terms ``сы́рники`` or ``CAFÉS``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "сы́рники CAFÉS" } } )

Using the version 3 ``text`` index, the operation matches the following
documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 6, "subject" : "Сырники", "author" : "jkl", "views" : 80 }
   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }
   { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 10 }

With previous versions of the ``text`` index, the query would not
match any document.

   - :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`
   - :ref:`<index-type-text>`

.. _text-operator-case-sensitive-search:

Case Sensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable case sensitivity, specify ``$caseSensitive: true``. Specifying
``$caseSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

Case Sensitivity with a Term
````````````````````````````

The following example performs a case sensitive query for the term
``Coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "Coffee", $caseSensitive: true } } )

The operation matches just the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`
   - :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`

Case Sensitivity with an Exact String
`````````````````````````````````````

The following example performs a case sensitive query for the exact multi-word
string ``Café Con Leche``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( {
      $text: { $search: "\"Café Con Leche\"", $caseSensitive: true }
   } )

The operation matches just the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`
   - :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`

Case Sensitivity with Negated Term
``````````````````````````````````

A *negated* term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If
you negate a term, the ``$text`` operator will exclude the
documents that contain those terms from the results. You can also
specify case sensitivity for negated terms.

The following example performs a case sensitive query for documents
that contain the word ``Coffee`` but do **not** contain the lower-case
term ``shop``, or more precisely the stemmed version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "Coffee -shop", $caseSensitive: true } } )

The operation matches the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg" }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`
   - :ref:`text-operator-term-negation`

Diacritic Sensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable diacritic sensitivity with a version 3 :ref:`text
<index-type-text>` index, specify ``$diacriticSensitive: true``.
Specifying ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

Diacritic Sensitivity with a Term
`````````````````````````````````

The following example performs a diacritic sensitive text query on the
term ``CAFÉ``, or more precisely the stemmed version of the word:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "CAFÉ", $diacriticSensitive: true } } )

The operation only matches the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc" }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`diacritic-sensitivity-and-stemming`
   - :ref:`text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity`
   - :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`


Diacritic Sensitivity with Negated Term
```````````````````````````````````````

The ``$diacriticSensitive`` option applies also to negated terms. A
negated term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If you
negate a term, the ``$text`` operator will exclude the documents that
contain those terms from the results.

The following example performs a diacritic sensitive text query for
documents that contain the term ``leches`` but not the term ``cafés``,
or more precisely the stemmed version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
     { $text: { $search: "leches -cafés", $diacriticSensitive: true } }
   )

The operation matches the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz" }

.. _ex-text-search-score:

Relevance Score Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _ex-return-text-search-score:

Return the Relevance Score
``````````````````````````

The following example performs a text query for the term ``cake`` and
uses the :expression:`$meta` operator in the projection document to
append the relevance score to each matching document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
   )

The returned document includes an *additional* field ``score`` that
contains the document's relevance score:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "Baking a cake", "author" : "abc", "views" : 90, "score" : 0.75 }

.. seealso::

   :expression:`$meta`

.. _ex-sort-limit-two:

Return Top 2 Matching Documents
```````````````````````````````

Use the :method:`~cursor.limit()` method in conjunction with a
:method:`~cursor.sort()` to return the top ``n`` matching documents.

The following example queries for the term ``coffee`` and sorts the
results by the descending score, limiting the results to the top two
matching documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { $text: { $search: "coffee" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } ).limit(2)

.. seealso::

   :expression:`$meta`

$text with Additional Query and Sort Expressions
````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following example matches documents where the ``author`` equals
``"xyz"`` and the indexed field ``subject`` contains the terms
``coffee`` or ``bake``. The operation also specifies a sort order of
ascending ``date``, then descending relevance score:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { author: "xyz", $text: { $search: "coffee bake" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } 
   ).sort( { date: 1, score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )
