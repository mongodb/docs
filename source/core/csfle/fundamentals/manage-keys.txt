In this guide, you can learn how to manage your encryption keys with a
{+kms-long+} ({+kms-abbr+}) in your {+csfle+} ({+csfle-abbrev+})-enabled
application.

Encryption Components
---------------------

MongoDB uses the following components to perform {+csfle+}:

- {+dek-long+}s ({+dek-abbr+})s
- {+cmk-long+}s ({+cmk-abbr+})s
- {+key-vault-long+}s
- {+kms-long+} ({+kms-abbr+})

To learn more about keys and key vaults, see
:ref:`qe-reference-keys-key-vaults`.

Supported Key Management Services
---------------------------------

{+csfle+} supports the following {+kms-long+} providers:

- {+aws-long+} KMS
- {+azure-kv+}
- {+gcp-kms-abbr+}
- Any KMIP Compliant {+kms-long+}
- Local Key Provider

.. include:: /includes/reference/fact-kmip-version.rst

To learn more about these providers, including diagrams that show how
your application uses them to perform {+csfle+}, see
:ref:`qe-fundamentals-kms-providers`.

Manage a {+dek-long+}'s Alternate Name
---------------------------------------------

You can assign a {+dek-long+} alternate names to make the
key easier to reference. Assigning alternate names allows you to perform
the following actions:

- Reference a {+dek-abbr+} by different means than the ``_id`` field.

- Dynamically assign DEKs at runtime.

Create a {+dek-long+} with an Alternate Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Prerequisite

   Prior to adding a new key alternate name, you must create a partial
   unique index on the ``keyAltNames`` field. This index should have a 
   ``partialFilterExpression`` for documents where ``keyAltNames`` exists.
   
   {+csfle+} depends on server-enforced uniqueness of key alternate names.

   To learn how to create a partial index, refer to :ref:`index-type-partial`.

The following example creates a {+dek-long+} with an alternate name.

.. _key_alt_names:

Use Key Alternate Names in an Automatic Encryption Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption schemas contain user-specified rules that identify which
fields must be encrypted and how to encrypt those fields. In your
encryption rules, you can specify alternate key names name for the
{+dek-long+} which encrypts your field.

You must refer to a key alternate name with a :term:`JSON pointer`. Use
JSON pointers to reference a field in your query or update document
which contains the value of your key alternate name.

.. important:: Cannot Use Alternate Name for Deterministically Encrypted Field

   You cannot reference a {+dek-abbr+} by it's alternate name when
   encrypting a field with the :ref:`deterministic encryption algorithm
   <csfle-deterministic-encryption>`. To encrypt your field
   deterministically, you must specify the ``_id`` of the key you would
   like to use to encrypt your field.
   
.. _csfle-reference-key-alt-name-in-schema:

Reference Key Alternate Name in an Encryption Schema
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Consider the following encryption schema which encrypts the ``salary``
field:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 8

   {
     "<database>.<collection>": {
       "bsonType": "object",
       "properties": {
         "salary": {
           "encrypt": {
             "bsonType": "int",
             "keyId": "/fieldWithAltName",
             "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

The schema's ``keyId`` field contains a JSON pointer to reference the
``fieldWithAltName`` field within the documents being encrypted.

The following document's ``fieldWithAltName`` value is ``my-alt-name``:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "Jon Doe",
     "salary": 45000,
     "fieldWithAltName": "my-alt-name"
   }

The ``salary`` field is encrypted by the {+dek-abbr+} that has the
alternate name ``my-alt-name``.

.. _csfle-alt-names-dynamic-keys:

Dynamically Assign Keys at Runtime
``````````````````````````````````

You can use alternate key names to dynamically set the {+dek-long+} for
a field at runtime. Use this functionality to encrypt individual
documents with different DEKs using the same encryption schema.

For example, consider the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 4,9

   {
       "name": "Jon Doe",
       "salary": 45000,
       "fieldWithAltName": "my-alt-name"
   },
   {
       "name": "Jane Smith",
       "salary": 70000,
       "fieldWithAltName": "my-other-alt-name"
   }

You insert the preceding documents using a {+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled
client configured with the encryption schema from the :ref:`previous
example <csfle-reference-key-alt-name-in-schema>`.

In the encryption schema, the ``salary.encrypt.keyId`` field contains a
JSON pointer to the ``fieldWithAltName`` field of the inserted document.
As a result, the ``salary`` fields in the two example documents are
each encrypted using a {+dek-abbr+} specific to the individual
document. The keys are assigned dynamically at runtime.

.. _csfle_fundamentals_rotate_keys:
.. _csfle-rotate-keys-mongo-shell:

Procedure: Rotate Encryption Keys Using Mongo Shell
---------------------------------------------------

With version 1.5 and later of the Mongo Shell, you can rotate encryption keys 
using the ``rewrapManyDataKey`` method. The ``rewrapManyDataKey`` method 
automatically decrypts multiple data keys and re-encrypts them using a specified 
{+cmk-long+}. It then updates the rotated keys in the key vault collection.
This method allows you to rotate encryption keys based on two optional arguments:

- A filter used to specify which keys to rotate. If no data key matches
  the given filter, no keys are rotated. Omit the filter to rotate all keys 
  in your key vault collection.

- An object that represents a new {+cmk-abbr+}. Omit this object to rotate
  the data keys using their current CMKs.

The ``rewrapManyDataKey`` uses the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json

   keyVault = db.getKeyVault()

   keyVault.rewrapManyDataKey(
      { 
         "<Your custom filter>" 
      },
      {
         provider: "<KMS provider>",
         masterKey: {
            "<dataKeyOpts Key>" : "<dataKeyOpts Value>"
         }
      }
   )

To learn more about the ``dataKeyOpts`` object for your KMS provider, see 
:ref:`qe-fundamentals-kms-providers-supported-kms`.

.. _field-level-encryption-data-key-delete:

Delete a {+dek-long+}
----------------------------

You can delete a {+dek-long+} from your {+key-vault-long+} using standard CRUD
:ref:`delete operations <write-op-delete>`. If you delete a {+dek-abbr+}, all fields encrypted with that
{+dek-abbr+} become permanently unreadable.

.. tip:: MongoDB Shell Specific Feature
   
   The MongoDB shell allows you to delete a {+dek-abbr+} by ``UUID`` using
   the ``keyVault.deleteKey()`` method as follows:

   .. code-block:: none

      keyVault = db.getKeyVault()
      keyVault.deleteKey(UUID("<UUID String>"))

To learn more about {+key-vault-long+}s see :ref:`qe-reference-keys-key-vaults`.
