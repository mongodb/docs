   |mms| provides a new organizations and projects hierarchy to
   facilitate the management of your |mms| deployments. Groups are now
   known as Projects. You can put multiple Projects under an
   Organization.

.. _organizations:

Organizations
-------------

In the organizations and projects hierarchy, an organization can
contain multiple projects (previously referred to as groups). Under
this structure, you can:

.. cond:: cloud
   
   - Use the same billing settings across multiple projects in your
     organization.

- View all projects within an organization.

- Create teams of users and assign teams to projects.

Previously, users managed deployments by groups, where each group was
managed separately even if a user belonged multiple groups.

.. _projects:

Projects
--------

Groups are now projects.

Existing Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have existing groups, organizations have been automatically
created for your groups (now projects), and your groups have been
placed under these organizations.

If your groups share the same billing settings, they have been placed
in the same organization.

Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments are now associated with projects. As before, deployments
must have unique names within projects.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/manage-projects` and :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`

.. _teams:

Teams
-----

In |mms|, you can create teams of users. With teams, you can bulk
assign users to projects.
