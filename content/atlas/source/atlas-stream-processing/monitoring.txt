{+atlas-sp+} provides monitoring and alerts so that users can leverage
performance and status insights to refine their workflows.

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-ui:

Monitor Stream Processor Workspaces in the {+atlas-ui+}
------------------------------------------------------

For each of your {+spw+}s you can monitor your stream processors in the |service| UI:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-stream-processing.rst

   .. step:: Select the {+spw+} you want to monitor.

      In the pane of the {+spw+} you want to monitor, click
      :guilabel:`Manage`.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Monitoring` tab.

      The :guilabel:`Monitoring` tab displays a variety of runtime
      statistics about a stream processor of your choosing, including, but
      not limited to:

      - Number of messages ingested
      - Number of messages successfully processed
      - Number of messages sent to your :ref:`Dead Letter Queue <atlas-sp-dlq>`

      If your source connection is {+kafka+}, you can monitor the 
      lag between the current offset and the latest offset at the broker for a topic's
      partition and the sum of all the partition lags.

   .. step:: Filter the monitoring charts as needed.

      You can filter the charts by stream processor name, time range, and granularity.

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-proc-methods:

Stream Processor Monitoring Methods
-----------------------------------

{+atlas-sp+} provides the following methods for on-demand reporting
about your stream processors:

- :method:`sp.processor.sample()`
- :method:`sp.processor.stats()`

The ``sp.processor.sample()`` method allows you to see a small sample of
the documents output by a currently running stream processor of your
choosing. Users can compare the sampled results against their expected
results to diagnose any errors in their aggregation pipeline design.

The ``sp.processor.stats()`` method returns a variety of runtime
statistics about a stream processor of your choosing, including, but
not limited to:

- Number of messages ingested
- Number of messages successfully processed
- Number of messages sent to your :ref:`Dead Letter Queue <atlas-sp-dlq>`
- In-memory size of your pipeline state
- Pipeline definition

If your source connection is {+kafka+}, you can monitor the 
following optional metrics:

- ``partitionOffsetLag`` indicates the lag between the 
  current offset and the latest offset at the broker for a topic's
  partition.

- ``kafkaTotalOffsetLag`` indicates the sum of all the partition lags.

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-logs:

Stream Processing Logs
----------------------

{+atlas-sp+} provides two types of {+spw+} activity logs:

- **Operational logs**, which primarily track the behavior of
    individual stream processors.
- **Audit logs**, which primarily track authentication and security
    activity at the {+spw+} level.

To download {+atlas-sp+} operational or audit logs:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-stream-processing

   .. step:: Navigate to the pane of the {+spw+} from which to
      download logs and click the ellipsis.

   .. step:: In the dropdown menu, select :guilabel:`Download Logs`.

   .. step:: In the modal window, select the type of log you want to
      download.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Stream processor` field, provide the
      name of the stream processor for which you want to download
      logs. Leave this field blank to download logs for all stream
      processors.

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Time Period` dropdown, select the
      interval for which you want to download logs.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Download Logs` button.

.. note::

   Logs take up to five minutes after creation to become queryable.

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-datadog:

Stream Processor Metrics in Datadog
-----------------------------------

You can send metrics to Datadog to monitor your stream
processors. To learn how to configure the integration and 
which metrics are available, see :ref:`datadog-integration`.

.. _atlas-sp-monitoring-proc-alerts:

Stream Processor Alerts
-----------------------

{+atlas-sp+} triggers alerts when processors change state, or a
processor meets various ingestion or output thresholds. For a
list of available {+atlas-sp+} alerts, see :ref:`atlas-sp-alerts`. To
learn more about alert configuration, see :ref:`configure-alerts`.

You can target {+atlas-sp+} alerts in the following ways:

- All stream processors within a project
- All stream processors within a {+spw+} matching the configured
  predicate
- All stream processors the names of which match the configured
  predicate

For targets other than all stream processors, you can configure
multiple targets for the same alert.

{+atlas-sp+} configures a :alert:`Strean Processor State is failed
<Stream Processor State is failed>` alert by default. As this is a
project-level alert, it applies to any stream processor running in any
{+spw+} within the project for which it is configured.
