Handle Sync Errors
------------------

While developing an application that uses Device Sync, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls. 

.. seealso::

   For a complete example app with a working Sync error handler implementation,
   :ref:`create a template app <create-template-app>` and check out 
   :ref:`the SwiftUI client <get-template-app-client>`. The error handler 
   implementation is in the :file:`App.swift` file.

For a SwiftUI-friendly implementation of a Sync error handler, create 
an ``ObservableObject`` with an optional ``@Published`` variable to contain
a potential error. This handler uses the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager 
<Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` to listen for errors.
The ``SyncManager`` reports errors of the type ``SyncError``, and it also
reports other connection issues.

For more information, refer to the underlying Objective-C :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncError 
<Enums/RLMSyncError.html>`.

Initialize the error handler as a ``@StateObject``. Inject it into the 
view hierarchy as an environment object. In this example, we display an 
``.alert`` to the user when a Sync error occurs.

   :language: swift

Then, in the view where you are observing the Realm ``App``, you can use the 
error handler as an ``@EnvironmentObject`` to react to Sync errors. An 
error that occurs here pops up an alert for the user, using the ``.alert``
set in the view above.
