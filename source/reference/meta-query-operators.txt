====================
Meta Query Operators
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
------------

In addition to the :doc:`MongoDB Query Operators
</reference/operators>`, there are a number of "meta" operators that
you may use to modify the output or behavior of a query. On the server,
MongoDB treats the query and the options as a single object. The
:program:`mongo` shell may provide :ref:`cursor methods
<js-query-cursor-methods>` for these options. When possible, use these
methods; otherwise, you can add these options using either of the
following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <query> } )._addSpecial( <option> )
   db.collection.find( { $query: { <query> }, <option> } )

Modifiers
---------

Many of these operators have corresponding :ref:`methods in the shell
<js-query-cursor-methods>`. These methods provide a straightforward and
user-friendly interface and are the preferred way to add these options.
