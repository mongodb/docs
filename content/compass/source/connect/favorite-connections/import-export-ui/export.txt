Procedure
---------

To export encrypted saved connections with |compass-short|:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: On the Connect screen, hover over :guilabel:`Saved Connections` in 
      the left-side navigation and click the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` button.

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Export saved connections`. 
    
   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Export saved connections` dialog box, select the 
      connection names you want to export. 
        
   .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Target File`, click :guilabel:`Select a file...` 
      to specify the output file destination.

   .. step:: *Optional*. Toggle :guilabel:`Remove secrets` to omit passwords, 
      access tokens, and other sensitive information from the exported file.

      If you select :guilabel:`Remove secrets`, you cannot specify an encryption 
      password.
    
   .. step:: *Optional*. Specify an :guilabel:`Encryption Password` to encrypt 
      passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information.
        
      If you do not encrypt the export file, passwords are exported in 
      plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other users will have 
      access to the exported file.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Export` to export your saved connections to 
      a JSON file.
