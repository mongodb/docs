Read Operations
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Read operations determine how MongoDB returns collection data when you
issue a query. This document describes how MongoDB performs read
operations and how different factors affect the efficiency of reads.

In :doc:`crud operations </crud>`, read operations are all operations
that return data from the database without modifying the database. In
MongoDB, all read operations or *queries* return a cursor object that
iterates over the result set of matching :term:`documents` in a collection.

.. note::

   All of the examples in this document use the :program:`mongo`
   shell interface. All of these operations are available in an
   idiomatic interface for each language by way of the :doc:`MongoDB
   Driver </drivers>`. See your :api:`driver documentation <>` for
   full API documentation.

Queries in MongoDB
------------------

In the :program:`mongo` shell the :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` and :method:`findOne()
<db.collection.findOne()>` methods perform read operations. The
:method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method is has the following
syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( <query>, <projection> )

- The ``db.collection`` object, describes the database and collection
  to query. All queries in MongoDB address a *single* collection.

  You can enter ``db`` in the :program:`mongo` shell to return the
  name of the current database. Use the ``show collections`` operation
  in the :program:`mongo` shell to list the current collections in the
  database.

- Queries in MongoDB have a JSON-like syntax, and take the form of a
  :term:`document` using a collection of :doc:`/reference/operators`
  query operators to describe query parameters.

  The ``<query>`` argument of the :method:`find()
  <db.collection.find()>` method holds this query document. A query,
  without a query document will return all documents in the
  collection.

- The ``<projection>`` argument describes describes the result or
  return set in the form of a document. Projections specify or limit
  the fields to return.

  Without a projection the operation will return all
  fields of all documents, specify a projection if your documents are
  larger, or when your application only needs a subset of available
  fields.

For example, the following operation on the ``inventory`` collection,
selects all documents where the ``type`` field equals ``'food'`` and
the ``price`` field has a value less than ``9.95``. The projection
limits the response to the ``item`` and ``qty``, and ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food', price: { $lt: 9.95 } },
                      { item: 1, qty: 1 } )

The :method:`findOne() <db.collection.findOne()>` method is similar to
the :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method except the
:method:`findOne() <db.collection.findOne()>` method returns a single
document from a collection rather than a cursor. The method has the
syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.findOne( <query>, <projection> )

For additional documentation and examples of the main MongoDB read
operators, refer to the :doc:`/applications/read` page of the
:doc:`/crud` section.

Query Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides an overview of query document for MongoDB
queries. See the preceding section for more information on
:ref:`queries in MongoDB <read-operations-query-operations>`. 

The following examples demonstrate the key properties of the query
document in MongoDB queries, using the :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` method from the :program:`mongo` shell, and a
collection of documents named ``inventory``:

- An empty query document (``{}``) selects all documents in the
  collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( {} )

  Not specifying a query document to the :method:`find()
  <db.collection.find()>` is equivalent to specifying an empty query
  document. Therefore the following operation is equivelent to the
  previous operation: 
  
  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find()

- A single-clause query selects all documents in a collection where a
  field has a certain value. These are simple "equality" queries.
  
  In the following example, the query selects all documents in the
  collection where the ``type`` field has the value ``snacks``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: "snacks" } )

  When the field holds an array, these equality matches select
  documents if only *one* of the elements in the array match the
  specified value. In the following example, the query will match all
  documents where the array in the ``tags`` field contains the element
  ``fruit``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { tags: "fruit" } )

- A single-clause query document can also select all documents in a
  collection given a condition or set of conditions for one field
  in the collection's documents. Specify conditions in a MongoDB
  query, using the :ref:`query operators <query-operators>`.

  In the following example, the query selects all documents in the
  collection where the value of the ``type`` field is either
  ``'food'`` or ``'snacks'``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: { $in: [ 'food', 'snacks' ] } } )

  .. note::

     Although you can express this query using the :operator:`$or`
     operator, choose the :operator:`$in` operator rather than the
     :operator:`$or` operator when performing equality checks on the
     same field.

- A compound query can specify conditions for more than one field in
  the collection's documents. Implicitly, a logical ``AND``
  conjunction connects the clauses of a compound query so that all
  specified conditions for a query must be true for the query to
  select a document.

  In the following example, the query document specifies an equality
  match on a single field, followed by a range of values for a second
  field using a :ref:`comparison operator <query-selectors-comparison>`. 

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food', price: { $lt: 9.95 } } )

  This query selects all documents where the ``type`` field has the
  value ``food`` **and** the value of the ``price`` field is less than
  (i.e. :operator:`$lt`) ``9.95``.

- Using the :operator:`$or` you can specify a compound query that
  joins each clause with a logical ``OR`` conjunction so that the
  query will select documents that match only one of the query's
  clauses.

  In the following example, the query document selects all documents
  in the collection where the field ``qty`` has a value greater than
  (i.e. :operator:`$gt`) ``100`` **or** the value of the ``price``
  field is less than (i.e. :operator:`$lt`) ``9.95``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { $or: [ { qty: { $gt: 100 } },
                                 { price: { $lt: 9.95 } } ]
                        } )

- With additional clauses, you can specify precise conditions for
  matching documents. In the following example, the compound query
  document selects all documents in the collection where the value of
  the ``type`` field is ``'food'`` **and** *either* the ``qty`` has a
  value greater than (i.e. :operator:`$gt`) ``100`` *or* the value of
  the ``price`` field is less than (i.e. :operator:`$lt`) ``9.95``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food', $or: [ { qty: { $gt: 100 } },
                                               { price: { $lt: 9.95 } } ]
                         } )

Refer to the :doc:`/reference/operator` document for the complete
list of query operators and :doc:`/reference/operators` for complete
documentation of all query operators.

.. _read-operations-projection:
.. _projection:

Result Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`projection` specification, limits the fields to return for
all matching documents. Constraining the result set by restricting the
fields to return, can minimize network transit costs and the costs of
deserializing documents in the application layer. 

The second argument to the :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`
method is a projection, and it takes the form a :term:`document` with
a list of fields for inclusion or exclusion from the result set. You
can either specify the fields to include (e.g. ``{ field: 1 }``) or specify the
fields to exclude (e.g. ``{ field: 0 }``). The ``_id`` field is implicitly
included, unless explicitly excluded.

.. note::

   You cannot combine inclusion and exclusion semantics in a single
   projection with the *exception* of the ``_id`` field.

Consider the following projection specifications, in :method:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` operations:

- If you specify no projection, the :method:`find()
  <db.collection.find()>` method returns all fields of all documents
  that match the query.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } )

  This operation will return all documents in the ``inventory``
  collection where the value of the ``type`` field is ``food``.

- A project can explicitly include several fields. In the following
  operation, :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method returns
  all documents that match the query as well as ``item`` and ``qty``
  fields. The results also include the ``_id``, implicitly:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' }, { item: 1, qty: 1 } )

- You can remove the ``_id`` field by excluding it from the
  projection, as in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' }, { item: 1, qty: 1, _id:0 } )

  This operation returns all documents that match the query, and
  *only* includes the ``item`` and ``qty`` fields in the result set.

- To exclude a single field or group of fields you can use a
  projection in the following form: 

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' }, { type:0 } )

  This operation returns all documents where the value of the ``type``
  field is ``food``, but does not include the ``type`` field in the
  output. 
  
  With the exception of the ``_id`` field you cannot combine inclusion
  and exclusion statements in projection documents.

MongoDB also provides the greater flexibility for projecting data from
fields that hold arrays. Refer to the operator documentation for the
:projection:`$elemMatch` and :projection:`$slice` operators for more
information.

.. _read-operations-indexing:

Indexes
-------

Indexes improve the efficiency of read operations by reducing the
amount of data that query operations need to process and thereby
simplifying the work associated with fulfilling queries within
MongoDB. The indexes themselves are a special data structure that
MongoDB maintains when inserting or modifying documents, and any given
index can: support and optimize specific queries, sort operations, and
allow for more efficient storage utilization. For more information
about indexes in MongoDB see: :doc:`/indexes` and :doc:`/core/indexes`.

You can create indexes using the :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex{)` method
in the :program:`mongo` shell, as in the following prototype
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <field1>: <order>, <field2>: <order>, ... } )

- The ``field`` specifies the field to index. 
  
  You can create an index on a single field or a :ref:`compound index
  <index-type-compound>` that includes multiple fields in the index.

- The ``order`` option is specifies either ascending ( ``1`` ) or
  descending ( ``-1`` ).

  MongoDB can read the index in either direction. In most cases, you
  only need to specify :ref:`indexing order
  <index-ascending-and-descending>` to support sort operations in
  compound queries.

Measuring Index Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` cursor method allows you to
introspect the operation of the query system, and is useful for
analyzing the efficiency of queries, and for determining how the query
uses the index. Call the :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` method
on another method that returns a cursor, as in the following example: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } ).explain()

.. note:: 
   
   Only use :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` to test the query
   operation, and *not* the timing of query performance. Because
   :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` attempts multiple query
   plans, it does not reflect accurate query performance.

If the above operation could not use an index, the output of
:method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>`, would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "cursor" : "BasicCursor",
     "isMultiKey" : false,
     "n" : 5,
     "nscannedObjects" : 4000006,
     "nscanned" : 4000006,
     "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 4000006,
     "nscannedAllPlans" : 4000006,
     "scanAndOrder" : false,
     "indexOnly" : false,
     "nYields" : 2,
     "nChunkSkips" : 0,
     "millis" : 1591,
     "indexBounds" : { },
     "server" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
   }

The ``BasicCursor`` value in the :data:`cursor` field confirms that
this query does not use an index. The :data:`nscannedObjects` value shows that
MongoDB must scan 4,000,006 documents to return only 5 documents. To
increase the efficiency of the query, create an index on the ``type``
field, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.ensureIndex( { type: 1 } )

Run the :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` operation, as follows,
to test the use of the index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } ).explain()

Consider the results: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "cursor" : "BtreeCursor type_1",
     "isMultiKey" : false,
     "n" : 5,
     "nscannedObjects" : 5,
     "nscanned" : 5,
     "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 5,
     "nscannedAllPlans" : 5,
     "scanAndOrder" : false,
     "indexOnly" : false,
     "nYields" : 0,
     "nChunkSkips" : 0,
     "millis" : 0,
     "indexBounds" : { "type" : [
                                   [ "food",
                                     "food" ]
                                ] },
     "server" : "mongodbo0.example.net:27017" }

The ``BtreeCursor`` value of the :data:`cursor` field indicates that
the query used an index. This query: 

- returned 5 documents, as indicated by the :data:`n` field; 

- scanned 5 documents from the index, as indicated by the
  :data:`nscanned`` field;

- then read 5 full documents from the collection, as indicated by
  the :data:`nscannedObjects` field.

  This indicates that the query was not "covered," or able to complete
  only using the index, as reflected in the :data:`indexOnly` See
  :ref:`indexes-covered-queries` for more information.

.. index:: query optimizer
.. _read-operations-query-optimization:

Query Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB query optimizer processes queries and chooses the most
efficient query plan for a query given the available indexes. The
query system then uses this query plan each time the query runs. The
query optimizer occasionally reevaluates query plans as the content of
the collection changes to ensure optimal query plans. 

To create a new query plan, the query optimizer:

1. runs the query against several indexes in parallel.

#. records the matches in a single common buffer, as though the
   results all come from the same index.

   If an index returns a result already returned by another index, the
   optimizer skips the duplicate match.

#. determines a "winning" index when either of the following occur:

   - The optimizer exhausts an index, which means that the index has
     provided the full result set. At this point, the optimizer stops
     querying.

   - The optimizer reaches 101 results. At this point, the optimizer
     chooses the index that has provided the most results *first* and
     continues reading only from that index.

The "winning" index becomes the index specified in the query plan:
future iterations of this query will use this index.

To manually compare the performance of a query using more than one
index, you can use the :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` method
and the :method:`hint() <cursor.hint()>` method appended, as in the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.colection.find().explain().hint()

The following operations each run the same query but will reflect the
use of the different indexes: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { type: 'food' } ).explain().hint( { type: 1 } )
   db.collection.find( { type: 'food' } ).explain().hint( { type: 1, name: 1 })

This returns the statistics regarding the execution of the query. For
more information on the output of :method:`explain()
<cursor.explain()>` see the :ref:`method documentation
<explain-output>`.

.. note::

   If you run :method:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` without including
   :method:`hint() <cursor.hint()>` the query optimizer re-evaluates
   the query and runs against multiple indexes before returning the query
   statistics.

As collections change over time, the query optimizer deletes a query
plan and re-evaluates the after any of the following events: 

- the collection recieves 1,000 write operations.

- the :dbcommand:`reIndex` rebuilds the index.

- the :program:`mongod` process restarts.

The order that MongoDB returns documents depend on the index used to
support the query. If you issue a query successive times and the data
hasn't changed, the query will return the same results in the same
order. However, in some cases MongoDB may return results in a
different order as the optimizer retrieves results using several
indexes during re-evaluation.

For more information, see :doc:`/applications/indexes`.

Query Operations that Cannot Use Indexes Effectively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some query operations cannot use indexes effectively, or cannot use
indexes at all. Consider the following situations: 

- The inequality operators :operator:`$nin` and :operator:`$ne`, are
  not very selective, as they often match a large portion of the
  index.
  
  As a result, in most cases a :operator:`$nin` or :operator:`$ne`
  query with an index may perform no better than a :operator:`$nin` or
  :operator:`$ne` query that must scan all documents in a collection.

- Queries that use specify regular expressions, with inline JavaScript
  regular expressions or :operator:`$regex` operations cannot use an
  index *unless* the regular expression is anchored to the beginning
  or end of a string.

.. _read-operations-aggregation:

Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.2

MongoDB can perform some basic data aggregation operations on results
before returning data to the application. Running aggregation
operations on the database sides can be more efficient than running
them in the application layer and can reduce the amount of data
MongoDB needs to send to the application. These aggregation operations
include basic grouping, counting, and even processing data using a map
reduce framework. Additionally, in 2.2 MongoDB provides a complete
aggregation framework for more rich aggregation operations.

The aggregation framework provides users with a "pipeline" like
framework: documents enter from a collection and then pass through a
series of steps by a sequence of :ref:`pipeline operators
<aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` that manipulate and
transform the documents until they're output at the end. The
aggregation framework is accessible via the :dbcommand:`aggregate`
command or the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper in the
:program:`mongo` shell.

For more information on the aggregation framework see
:doc:`/aggregation`. 

Additionally, MongoDB provides a number of simple data aggregation
operations for more basic data aggregation operations: 

- :method:`count() <cursor.count()>`

- :dbcommand:`distinct() <distinct>`

- :method:`group()`

- :dbcommand:`mapReduce() <mapreduce>` (See also :wiki:`MapReduce`.)

.. index:: read operation; architecture
.. _read-operations-architecture:

Architecture
------------

.. index:: read operation; connection pooling
.. index:: connection pooling; read operations
.. _read-operations-connection-pooling:

Connection Pooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most MongoDB client libraries (i.e. :doc:`drivers </drivers>`,)
including :program:`mongos` implement connection between the
application and the database as a connection pool. These connection
pools make it possible for the application to reuse connections for
multiple requests without needing to create new connections to the
database for every operation. In most cases the connection pools are
transparent to the user and the application.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` allow you to partition a
data set among a cluster of program:`mongod` in a way that is nearly
transparent to the application. See the :doc:`/sharding` section of
this manual for additional information about these deployments.

For a sharded clusters, issue all operations to one of the
:program:`mongos` instances associated with the
cluster. :program:`mongos` instances route operations to the
:program:`mongod` in the cluster and behave like :program:`mongod`
instances to the application. Read operations to a sharded collection
in a sharded are largely the same as operations to a :term:`replica
set` or :term:`standalone` instances. See the section on :ref:`Read
Operations in Sharded Clusters <sharding-read-operations>` for more
information.

In sharded deployments, the :program:`mongos` instance routes routes
the queries from the clients to the :program:`mongod` instnaces that
hold the data, using the cluster metadata stored in the :ref:`config
database <sharding-config-server>`.

For sharded collections, if queries do not include the :ref:`shard key
<sharding-shard-key>`, the :program:`mongos` must direct the query to
all shards in a collection. These *scatter gather* queries can be
inefficient, particularly on larger clusters, and are unfeasible for
routine operations.

For more information on read operations in sharded clusters, consider
the following resources:

- :ref:`An Introduction to Shard Keys <sharding-shard-key>`
- :ref:`Shard Key Internals and Operations <sharding-internals-shard-keys>`
- :ref:`Querying Sharded Clusters <sharding-internals-querying>`
- :ref:`sharding-mongos`

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use :term:`read preferences <read
preference>` to determine where and how to route read operations to
members of the replica set. By default, MongoDB always reads data from
a replica set's :term:`primary`. You can modify that behavior by
changing the :ref:`read preference mode
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>`. 

You can configure the :ref:`read preference mode
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>` on a per-connection or
per-operation basis to allow reads from :term:`secondaries
<secondary>` for backup operations, or to allow reads during
:ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` situations. If the majority of
database use are read operations and, then using read preferences to
distribute reads can improve read throughput.

Read operations from secondary members of replica sets are not
guaranteed to reflect the current state of the primary, and the state
of secondaries will trail the primary by some amount of time. Often,
applications don't rely on this kind of strict consistency, but
application developers should always consider the needs of their
application before setting read preference.

For more information on :ref:`read preferences <read-preference>` or
on the read preference modes, see :ref:`read-preference` and
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.
