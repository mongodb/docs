         Check that you have an Atlas account and have deployed a MongoDB database
         cluster. See :doc:`/cloud/atlas` for information on how to
         login and create a cluster in Atlas.

                  To make sure that your MongoDB instance is running on Windows,
                  run the following command from the Windows command prompt:
                  
                  .. code-block:: bat
                  
                     tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq mongod.exe"
                  
                  If a :binary:`mongod.exe <bin.mongod.exe>` instance is running, you will
                  see something like:
                  
                  .. code-block:: bat

                  To make sure your MongoDB instance is running on Linux, run the
                  following command from your terminal:
                    
                  .. code-block:: sh

                     ps -e| grep 'mongod'

                  If a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is running, you will see
                  something like:

                  .. code-block:: sh

                     89780 ttys026    0:53.48 ./mongod

                  To make sure your MongoDB instance is running on Mac, run the
                  following command from your terminal:
                    
                  .. code-block:: sh

                     ps -e | grep 'mongod'

                  If a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is running, you will see
                  something like:

                  .. code-block:: sh

                     89780 ttys026    0:53.48 ./mongod
