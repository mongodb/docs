The `Aggregates <{+api+}/org/mongodb/scala/model/Aggregates$.html>`__ class provides static factory methods that build
:manual:`aggregation pipeline stages
</reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>`. Each method returns an
instance of the ``Bson`` type, which can in turn be passed to the
``MongoCollection.aggregate()`` method.

You can import the methods of the ``Aggregates``
class statically, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: scala

   import org.mongodb.scala.model.Aggregates._

The examples in this guide assume this static import.

Match
-----

The ``$match`` pipeline stage passes all documents matching the
specified filter to the next stage. Though the filter can be an instance
of any class that implements ``Bson``, it’s convenient to use methods from
the :ref:`scala-builders-filters` class.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that matches all
documents where the ``author`` field value is ``"Dave"``:

.. code-block:: scala

   `match`(equal("author", "Dave"))

.. note::

   As ``match`` is a reserved word in Scala and has to be escaped by
   backticks, you might prefer to use the ``filter()`` alias:
   
   .. code-block:: scala

      filter(equal("author", "Dave"))

Project
-------

The ``$project`` pipeline stage passes the projected fields of all
documents to the next stage. Though the projection can be an instance of
any class that implements ``Bson``, it’s convenient to use methods from the
:ref:`scala-builders-projections` class.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that excludes the ``_id``
field but includes the ``title`` and ``author`` fields:

.. code-block:: scala

   project(fields(include("title", "author"), excludeId()))

Computed Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$project`` stage can project computed fields as well.

The following example projects the ``qty`` field into a new field called
``quantity``. In other words, it renames the field:

.. code-block:: scala

   project(computed("quantity", "$qty"))

Sample
------

The ``$sample`` pipeline stage randomly select ``N`` documents from
input documents. The following example uses the ``sample()`` method to randomly select ``5``
documents from the collection:

.. code-block:: scala

   sample(5)

Sort
----

The ``$sort`` pipeline stage passes all documents to the next stage, sorted
by the specified sort criteria. Though the sort criteria can be an
instance of any class that implements ``Bson``, it’s convenient to use methods
from the :ref:`scala-builders-sorts` class.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that sorts in descending order
according to the value of the ``age`` field and then in ascending order
according to the value of the ``posts`` field:

.. code-block:: scala

   sort(orderBy(descending("age"), ascending("posts")))

Skip
----

The ``$skip`` pipeline stage skips over the specified number of documents
that pass into the stage and passes the remaining documents to the next
stage.

The following example skips the first ``5`` documents:

.. code-block:: scala

   skip(5)

Limit
-----

The ``$limit`` pipeline stage limits the number of documents passed to
the next stage.

The following example limits the number of documents to 10:

.. code-block:: scala

   limit(10)

Lookup
------

The ``$lookup`` pipeline stage performs a left outer join with another
collection to filter in documents from the joined collection for
processing.

The following example performs a left outer join on the ``fromCollection``
collection, joining the ``local`` field to the ``from`` field and outputted
in the ``joinedOutput`` field:

.. code-block:: scala

   lookup("fromCollection", "local", "from", "joinedOutput")

Group
-----

The ``$group`` pipeline stage groups documents by some specified expression
and outputs a document for each distinct grouping to the next stage. A
group consists of an ``_id`` which specifies the expression on which to
group, and zero or more accumulators which are evaluated for each
grouping.

To simplify the expression of accumulators, the driver
includes an ``Accumulators`` singleton object with factory methods for each
of the supported accumulators.

The following example groups documents by the value of the ``customerId`` field, and
for each group accumulates the sum and average of the values of the
quantity field into the ``totalQuantity`` and ``averageQuantity`` fields,
respectively:

.. code-block:: scala

   group("$customerId", sum("totalQuantity", "$quantity"), avg("averageQuantity", "$quantity"))

Unwind
------

The ``$unwind`` pipeline stage deconstructs an array field from the
input documents to output a document for each element.

The following example outputs, for each document, a document for each element in
the ``sizes`` array:

.. code-block:: scala

   unwind("$sizes")

The following example also includes any documents that have missing or null
values for the ``sizes`` field or where the ``sizes`` list is empty:

.. code-block:: scala

   unwind("$sizes", UnwindOptions().preserveNullAndEmptyArrays(true))

The following example unwinds the ``sizes`` array and also outputs the array
index into the ``position`` field:

.. code-block:: scala

   unwind("$sizes", UnwindOptions().includeArrayIndex("$position"))

Set Window Fields
-----------------

The ``$setWindowFields`` pipeline stage allows using window operators. This
stage partitions the input documents similarly to the ``$group`` pipeline
stage, optionally sorts them, computes fields in the documents by
computing window functions over windows specified per function, and
outputs the documents. A window is a subset of a partition.

The important difference from the ``$group`` pipeline stage is that documents belonging to
the same partition or window are not folded into a single document.

The driver includes the ``WindowedComputations`` singleton object with
factory methods for supported window operators. 

The following example computes the accumulated rainfall and the average
temperature over the past month per each locality from more fine-grained
measurements presented in the ``rainfall`` and ``temperature`` fields:

.. code-block:: scala
   
   val pastMonth: Window = Windows.timeRange(-1, MongoTimeUnit.MONTH, Windows.Bound.CURRENT)

   setWindowFields(Some("$localityId"), Some(Sorts.ascending("measurementDateTime")),
     WindowedComputations.sum("monthlyRainfall", "$rainfall", Some(pastMonth)),
     WindowedComputations.avg("monthlyAvgTemp", "$temperature", Some(pastMonth)))

Assembling a Pipeline
---------------------

Pipeline operators are typically combined into a list and passed to the
``aggregate()`` method of a ``MongoCollection``:

.. code-block:: scala
   
   collection.aggregate(List(filter(equal("author", "Dave")),
       group("$customerId", sum("totalQuantity", "$quantity"), 
                            avg("averageQuantity", "$quantity")),
       out("authors")))
