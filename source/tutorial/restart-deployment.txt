=========================
Restart a MongoDB Process
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If an |mms|-managed MongoDB process is not currently running, you
can restart it directly from the |mms| console.

Considerations
--------------

If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
process, |mms| deactivates the process in the Monitoring Agent and in
the console. |mms| deactivates a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable
for 24 hours and a :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

Procedure
---------

To restart a process:
