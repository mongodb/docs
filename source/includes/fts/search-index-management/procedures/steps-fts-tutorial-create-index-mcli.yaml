ref: fts-mongocli-copy-command-sample
level: 4

  Paste the following sample {+atlas-cli+} request into your favorite text 
  editor and replace the variables.

  .. code-block :: sh

     atlas clusters search index create \
         --clusterName CLUSTER_NAME \
         --file FILE_PATH \
         --projectId PROJECT_ID
         --profile PROFILE_NAME

  The sample {+atlas-cli+} requests use these variables. Replace these 
  variables with your desired values before running the command to 
  create an |fts| index.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1
     :widths: 30 20 50

     * - Name
       - Type
       - Description
     * - PROJECT_ID
       - string
       - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
         project that contains the cluster. The cluster contains the collection
         for which you want to create an |fts| index.
     * - CLUSTER_NAME
       - string
       - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
         cluster. The cluster contains the collection for which you want to
         create an |fts| index.
     * - FILE_PATH
       - string
       - Path to the JSON index file that you created and saved in the previous
         steps, including the ``.json`` file extension.
     * - PROFILE_NAME
       - string
       - **Optional**. Name of the profile that sets the public and private keys for the 
         project. See :atlascli:`Save Connection Settings
         </atlas-cli-save-connection-settings/>` for more information. If you remove the ``--profile``
         flag, the {+atlas-cli+} uses the default profile.
