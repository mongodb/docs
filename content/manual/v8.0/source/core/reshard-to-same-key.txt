   :description: Reshard to the Same Shard Key to Shard a Collection, Add or Remove Shards Concept 

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can reshard to the same shard key to move 
data with no downtime or impact on workload. This enables you to:

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, resharding reads data using natural order scan. 
Resharding first clones all the data and then builds relevant indexes,
resulting in orders of magnitude speed improvement of the resharding 
process.

Command Syntax
--------------

You can reshard to the same key using the ``reshardCollection`` command
with ``forceRedistribution`` set to ``true``. 

The ``reshardCollection`` command has the following syntax:

For details, see :dbcommand:`reshardCollection`.

Use Cases
---------

Resharding is a strategy to move data with no downtime or impact on 
workload. Use the :ref:`<reshard-to-shard-def>` technique to shard a 
collection and distribute data across all shards.

Use resharding to distribute your collections across all relevant shards 
faster than :ref:`chunk migrations <migrate-chunks-sharded-cluster>`. 
Resharding writes to all shards in parallel while each shard can only 
participate in one chunk migration at a time. Resharding drops the old 
collection at the end of the process. There are no orphan documents at 
the end of resharding.

Reshard to Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Reshard to Shard** technique lets you use resharding to shard a
collection and distribute the data to all of the shards in a cluster.

Consider using **Reshard to Shard** when you are initially sharding a 
collection of any size across any number of shards. If your deployment
meets the :ref:`resource requirements <reshard-to-same-key-behavior>`, 
use **Reshard to Shard** no matter how large the collection you want to
shard.
