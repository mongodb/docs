.. _ts-quick-start-sample-data:

Sample Data
------------

This quick start creates a ``stocks`` time series collection with the
following document structure.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :category: example configuration object

   {
      _id: ObjectId(...),
      ticker: <string>,
      date: ISODate(...),
      close: <double>,
      volume: <double>
   }


Learning Summary
----------------

This quick start focused on creating a new time series collection. Because time
series collections are optimized for time data, their performance depends
heavily on how you configure them at creation. For more information, see
:ref:`Time Series Collection Considerations
<manual-timeseries-considerations>`.


Next Steps
----------

* To migrate existing data into a time series collection, see :ref:`Migrate
  Data into a Time Series Collection
  <migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

* To shard a time series collection, see :ref:`Shard a Time Series Collection
  <manual-timeseries-shard-collection>`.

* For aggregation and query behaviors specific to time series
  collections, see :ref:`Aggregation and Operator Considerations
  <manual-timeseries-aggregations-operators>`.
