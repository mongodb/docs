   desire

     another word or phrase instead.

   destroy
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` Use *remove* or *delete* instead.

   dialog
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` See :term:`dialog box`.

   dialog box
     Don't use *dialog*, *dialogue*, *window*, *pop-up*, *screen*, or
     *display* to mean dialog box. Capitalize *dialog box* only if
     it's part of a name that's shown in the software. Use lowercase
     letters for generic references (the filter dialog box).

     .. note::
        A dialog box is usually modal, which means that you can't
        minimize it and must respond to it before proceeding. In
        contrast, you can keep a window open but minimized while
        working on another task.

   different than
     :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` Use *different from* instead.

   dimmed
     Use *dimmed* to describe the appearance of an unavailable command,
     option, or button. Don't use :term:`disabled`, :term:`grayed`, or
     :term:`grayed out <grayed>`.

     .. seealso:: 
       
        :term:`unavailable`

        * - If the button is dimmed, it's unavailable.
          -

   disabled
     :icon-fa4:`exclamation-triangle` Use *inactive* to describe
     commands, options, toggles, or buttons in the interface. Use
     *dimmed* to describe the appearance of an inactive command,
     option, or button; use *unavailable* to refer to its state. Don't
     use *disabled* to refer to individuals with disabilities.

     Use of *disabled* is acceptable in other contexts. For example, a
     feature might be disabled through configuration.

   display
     The verb *display* requires a direct object. You can use the
     passive *is displayed*, or you can use *appears* or *opens* in
     the appropriate context.

     Don't use *display* as a noun to mean pane, window, or dialog box.

     When documenting instructions for mobile devices, use *double-tap*
     to express the action of quickly touching and releasing an item on
     the device screen twice in quick succession. Always hyphenate.

   downtime
     Use *downtime* as one word.

   drag
     **drag-and-drop**
     The verb form is *drag*; *drag-and-drop* is an adjective.
     In UI environments, *drag* refers to using the mouse to "pull" an
     item from one area of the screen to another area. Because the
     action of dropping (releasing the mouse button) is intrinsic to
     the action of dragging items in a UI, don't use *drag and drop* as
     a verb.

          - Drag and drop the video and image file to the container
            window.

   drill down
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` Because *drill down* is idiomatic,
     avoid using it. Use *navigate* instead to mean to follow a path to
     lower-level items in a hierarchy.

     element. Include the hyphen.
