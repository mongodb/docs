  The TDC file is a convenient way to enable the cleartext plugin and
  specify all of :program:`mongosqld`'s TLS/SSL certificates and keys.

  To create a TDC file that can connect to the |bi| with authentication
  over TLS/SSL, modify the following TDC file template. Substitute
  ``SSLKEY``, ``SSLCERT``, and ``SSLCA`` appropriately:

  .. code-block:: xml

     <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
     <connection-customization class='mysql' version='7.7' enabled='true'>
         <vendor name='mysql' />
         <driver name='mysql' />
         <customizations>
           <customization
             name='odbc-connect-string-extras'
             value='SSLKEY={C:\path_to_key\mysql.key};SSLCERT={C:\path_to_cert\mysql.crt};SSLCA={C:\path_to_CAcert\ca.crt};ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN=1;SSL_ENFORCE=1' />
           </customizations>
     </connection-customization>

  Save this XML as a ``.tdc`` file in the ``Datasources`` directory of
  your Tableau Repository. On Windows this is typically
  ``C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Datasources``. On
  OS X, this is ``~/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Datasources``.

  .. important::
     You must restart Tableau to apply the TDC.

     Tableau will apply the TLS/SSL, certificate, and cleartext plugin
     settings in the TDC file to **every** connection matching the named
     database vendor and driver.

   Click on the :guilabel:`MySQL` named connection in Tableau's left
   hand column. Enter the host and port on which :program:`mongosqld` is
   listening, along with the username and password with which to
   authenticate. Click :guilabel:`Sign In` to connect.

   By default, :program:`mongosqld` binds to port ``3307``.
