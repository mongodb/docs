Restart a Deployment
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If an MMS managed MongoDB deployment is not currently running, you
can restart it directly from the MMS console. Use this procedure to
restart all the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` components in
a deployment, for all :term:`sharded cluster`, :term:`replica set`, or
:term:`standalone deployment <standalone>` deployments.

Considerations
--------------

If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
instance, MMS deactivates the instance in the Monitoring Agent and in
the console. MMS deactivates a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable
for 24 hours and a :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

Procedure
---------

To restart a deployment:
