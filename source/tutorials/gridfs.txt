GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving files that
exceed the BSON document size limit of 16 MB. Instead of storing a large
file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and
stores each of those chunks as separate documents.

When you query a GridFS store for a file, the driver reassembles the
chunks as needed.

The code examples in this guide come from the `GridFSTour.scala
<{+driver-source-gh+}/blob/master/driver-scala/src/integration/scala/tour/GridFSTour.scala>`__
file in the driver source code GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must include the following import statements in your program to run the
code examples in this guide:

.. code-block:: scala

   import java.nio.ByteBuffer
   import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets
   
   import org.mongodb.scala._
   import org.mongodb.scala.bson.BsonObjectId
   import org.mongodb.scala.gridfs._
   import org.mongodb.scala.model.Filters
   
   import tour.Helpers._
   
   import scala.util.Success

.. include:: /includes/obs-note.rst

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

First, connect to a MongoDB deployment and declare and define
a ``MongoDatabase`` instance.

The following code connects to a standalone
MongoDB deployment running on ``localhost`` on port ``27017``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val mongoClient: MongoClient = MongoClient()

To learn more about connecting to MongoDB deployments,
see the :ref:`scala-connect` guide.

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

GridFS stores files in two collections:

- ``chunks``: stores the file chunks
- ``files``: stores file metadata

The two collections are in a common bucket and the collection names
are prefixed with the bucket name.

The driver provides the ``GridFSBucket()`` method to
create ``GridFSBucket`` instances:

.. code-block:: scala

   val myDatabase = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb")
   
   // Create a gridFSBucket using the default bucket name "fs"
   val gridFSBucket = GridFSBucket(myDatabase)

You can pass a bucket name to the ``GridFSBucket()`` method:

.. code-block:: scala

   // Create a gridFSBucket with a custom bucket name "files"
   val gridFSFilesBucket = GridFSBucket(myDatabase, "files")

.. note::

   GridFS automatically creates indexes on the ``files`` and ``chunks``
   collections when you upload data to the GridFS bucket.

Upload to GridFS
----------------

The ``GridFSBucket.uploadFromObservable()`` method reads the contents
of an ``Observable[ByteBuffer]`` and saves it to the ``GridFSBucket`` instance.

You can use the ``GridFSUploadOptions`` type to configure the chunk size
or include additional metadata.

The following example uploads the contents of a
``Observable[ByteBuffer]`` into ``GridFSBucket``:

.. code-block:: scala

   // Get the input stream
   val observableToUploadFrom: Observable[ByteBuffer] = Observable(
     Seq(ByteBuffer.wrap("MongoDB Tutorial".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)))
   )
   
   // Create some custom options
   val options: GridFSUploadOptions = new GridFSUploadOptions()
       .chunkSizeBytes(358400)
       .metadata(Document("type" -> "presentation"))
   
   val fileId: BsonObjectId = gridFSBucket
       .uploadFromObservable("mongodb-tutorial", observableToUploadFrom, options)
       .headResult()

Find Files Stored in GridFS
---------------------------

To find the files stored in the ``GridFSBucket``, use the ``find()``
method.

The following example prints out the filename of each file stored:

.. code-block:: scala

   gridFSBucket.find().results().foreach(file => println(s" - ${file.getFilename}"))

You can also provide a custom filter to limit the results returned.
The following example prints out the filenames of all files in which the
``contentType`` value is an ``image/png`` value in the user-defined metadata
document:

.. code-block:: scala

   gridFSBucket
     .find(Filters.equal("metadata.contentType", "image/png"))
     .results()
     .foreach(file => println(s" > ${file.getFilename}"))

Download from GridFS
--------------------

The ``downloadToObservable()`` method returns an ``Observable[ByteBuffer]``
that reads the contents from MongoDB.

To download a file by its file ``_id``, pass the ``_id`` to the method.
The following example downloads a file by its file ``_id``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val downloadById = gridFSBucket.downloadToObservable(fileId).results()

If you don't know the ``_id`` of the file but know the filename, then you
can pass the filename to the ``downloadToObservable()`` method. By
default, it will download the latest version of the file. Use the
``GridFSDownloadOptions`` class to configure which version to download.

The following example downloads the original version of the file named
``mongodb-tutorial``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val downloadOptions: GridFSDownloadOptions = new GridFSDownloadOptions().revision(0)
   val downloadByName = gridFSBucket.downloadToObservable("mongodb-tutorial", downloadOptions).results()

Rename Files
------------

If you need to rename a file, then use the ``rename()`` method.

The following example renames a file to ``mongodbTutorial``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val fileId: ObjectId = ... // ObjectId of a file uploaded to GridFS
   gridFSBucket.rename(fileId, "mongodbTutorial").printResults()

.. note::

   The ``rename()`` method requires an ``ObjectId`` rather than a ``filename`` to
   ensure the correct file is renamed.
   
   To rename multiple revisions of the same filename, first retrieve the
   full list of files. Then, for every file that should be renamed,
   run ``rename()`` with the corresponding ``_id``.

Delete Files
------------

To delete a file from the ``GridFSBucket``, use the ``delete()`` method.

The following example deletes a file from the ``GridFSBucket``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val fileId: ObjectId = ... //ObjectId of a file uploaded to GridFS
   gridFSBucket.delete(fileId).printResults()
