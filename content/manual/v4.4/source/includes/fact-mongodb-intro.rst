Welcome to the MongoDB {+version+} Manual! MongoDB is a
document database designed for ease of development
and scaling. The Manual introduces key concepts in MongoDB, presents the
query language, and provides operational and administrative
considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference
section.

MongoDB offers both local and cloud-hosted deployment options:

- For locally hosted deployments, MongoDB offers both a *Community*
  and an *Enterprise* version of the database:

  - MongoDB Community is the {+source-available+} edition of MongoDB.

  - MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise
    Advanced subscription and includes comprehensive support for your
    MongoDB deployment. MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused
    features such as LDAP and Kerberos support, on-disk encryption,
    and auditing.

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__
  is a hosted MongoDB Enterprise service option in the cloud which 
  requires no installation overhead and offers a free tier to get 
  started.
