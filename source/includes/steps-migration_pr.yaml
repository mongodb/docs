title: Your data is currently in a MongoDB database.
ref: mongodb
level: 4
stepnum: 1

   This guide focuses on migrating to Atlas from an existing MongoDB deployment
   on AWS. If you have data in other database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
   DynamoDB, please `contact us <https://mongodbcom-node-staging-2.corp.mongodb.com/contact>`_
   for help with your migration.

title: Your current MongoDB database is running MongoDB 2.6+
ref: mongodb-version
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |

   Atlas supports the latest versions of MongoDB: 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0.
   If you're running MongoDB version 2.6 or greater, the Atlas Live Migration
   Service can move your data directly into a newer database version.
   Update your `MongoDB drivers <https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers>`_
   and make any necessary code changes at the application level to ensure
   compatibility. If you're running a version older than 2.6, see 
   `Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6 <https://docs.mongodb.com/v2.6/release-notes/2.6-upgrade/index.html>`_
   for upgrade instructions.

title: Your current deployment is a MongoDB replica set.
ref: mongod-replica-set
level: 4
stepnum: 3
content: |

   If your deployment is currently a standalone instance, you must first
   :manual:`convert it to a replica set </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`.
   Live migration of data from sharded clusters is not supported. 
---
title: Authentication is enabled on your source deployment
ref: authentication-enabled
level: 4
stepnum: 4
content: |

   The migration process requires that authentication is enabled on your
   source cluster in AWS. See :manual:`Enable Auth </tutorial/enable-authentication>`
   for instructions on enabling authentication.

   You can verify that authentication is enabled on your source cluster
   using the :manual:`mongo </reference/program/mongo/>` command:

   .. code-block:: sh 

      mongo <mongodb-connection-string> -u <mongodb-username> -p --authenticationDatabase admin
---
title: The database user from your source cluster on AWS that you will use
       to perform the migration has the required MongoDB roles.
ref: required-roles
level: 4
stepnum: 5
content: |

   The user must have the :authrole:`clusterMonitor` and :authrole:`backup` roles. To verify
   that the database user that you intend to use for migration has the appropriate
   roles, run the :manual:`db.getUser() </reference/method/db.getUser>` command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      testRS:PRIMARY> use admin
      switched to db admin
      testRS:PRIMARY> db.getUser("admin")
      {
        "_id" : "admin.admin",
        "user" : "admin",
        "db" : "admin",
        "roles" : [
          {
            "role" : "backup",
            "db" : "admin"
          },
          {
            "role" : "clusterMonitor",
            "db" : "admin"
          }
        ]
      }
...
