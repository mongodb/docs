  Remove the :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` key and its value from the
  configuration file created during this tutorial.
  
  .. code-block:: yaml

     security:
        keyFile: <path-to-keyfile>

title: "Restart the ``mongos`` with the updated configuration file."
pre: |

  Connect to the :program:`mongos` and use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()`
  method against the ``admin`` database to safely shut down the
  :program:`mongos`.
  
  Restart one :program:`mongos` at a time to ensure that clients
  can connect to the sharded cluster. If your cluster has only one
  :program:`mongos`, this step results in downtime while the :program:`mongos`
  is offline.
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer()
  
  You can then restart the :program:`mongos specifying the path to the updated
  config file using :option:`--config`.
  
  .. example::

     The following operation restarts the :program:`mongos` specifying
     the updated configuration file, here named ``mongos-secure.conf``.
     The ``<path>`` represents the system path to the folder containing
     the configuration file.

     .. code-block:: shell
     
        mongos --config <path>/mongos-secure.conf

  .. note::
    
     MongoDB deployments running on :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` use
     the ``.cfg`` file extension instead of ``.conf``, and
     :program:`mongos.exe` instead of :program:`mongos`.
