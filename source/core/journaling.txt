Journaling Mechanics
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write
operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the journal
before the changes are in the data files. This document discusses the
implementation and mechanics of Journaling in MongoDB systems, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-journaling`
for information on configuring, tuning and managing journaling.

.. _journaling-journal-files:

Journal Files
-------------

With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal directory within
the directory defined by :setting:`dbpath`, which is :file:`/data/db`
by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain
write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number
file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory.

Journal files are append-only files and have file names prefixed with
``j._``. When a journal file holds 1 gigabyte of data, MongoDB creates
a new journal file. Once MongoDB applies all the write operations in
the journal files, it deletes these files. Unless you
write *many* bytes of data per-second, the journal directory should
contain only two or three journal files.

To limit the size of each journal file to 128 megabytes, use the
:setting:`smallfiles` run time option when starting :program:`mongod`.

To speed the frequent sequential writes that occur to the current
journal file, you can ensure that the journal directory is on a
different filesystem.

.. important::

   If you place the journal on a different filesystem from your data
   files you *cannot* use a filesystem snapshot to capture valid
   backups of a :setting:`dbpath` directory.

.. note::

   Depending on your filesystem, you might experience a preallocation
   lag the first time you start a :program:`mongod` instance with
   journaling enabled.

   MongoDB may preallocate journal files if the :program:`mongod`
   process determines that it is more efficient to preallocate journal
   files than create new journal files as needed. The amount of time
   required to pre-allocate lag might last several minutes, during
   which you will not be able to connect to the database. This is a
   one-time preallocation and does not occur with future invocations.

To avoid preallocation lag, see :ref:`journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag`.

.. _journaling-storage-views:

Storage Views used in Journaling
--------------------------------

Journaling adds three storage views to MongoDB.

The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB
data files. The ``shared view`` is the only view with direct access
to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :program:`mongod`
asks the operating system to map your existing on-disk data files to the
``shared view`` memory view. The operating system maps the files but
does not load them. MongoDB later loads data files to ``shared view`` as
needed.

The ``private view`` stores data for use in :doc:`read operations
</core/read-operations>`. MongoDB maps ``private view`` to the ``shared view``
and is the first place MongoDB applies new :doc:`write operations
</core/write-operations>`.

The journal is an on-disk view that stores new write operations
after MongoDB applies the operation to the ``private cache`` but
before applying them to the data files. The journal provides durability.
If the :program:`mongod` instance were to crash without having applied
the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to
the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files.

.. _journaling-record-write-operation:

How Journaling Records Write Operations
---------------------------------------

MongoDB copies the write operations to the journal in batches called
group commits. See :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more
information on the default commit interval. These "group commits" help
minimize the performance impact of journaling.

Journaling stores raw operations that allow MongoDB to reconstruct the
following:

- document insertion/updates
- index modifications
- changes to the namespace files

As :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` occur, MongoDB
writes the data to the ``private view`` in RAM and then copies the write
operations in batches to the journal. The journal stores the operations
on disk to ensure durability. MongoDB adds the operations as entries on
the journal's forward pointer. Each entry describes which bytes the
write operation changed in the data files.

MongoDB next applies the journal's write operations to the ``shared
view``. At this point, the ``shared view`` becomes inconsistent with the
data files.

At default intervals of 60 seconds, MongoDB asks the operating system to
flush the ``shared view`` to disk. This brings the data files up-to-date
with the latest write operations.

When MongoDB flushes write operations to the data files, MongoDB removes the
write operations from the journal's behind pointer. The behind pointer
is always far back from the advanced pointer.

As part of journaling, MongoDB routinely asks the operating system to
remap the ``shared view`` to the ``private view``, for consistency.

.. note::

   The interaction between the ``shared view`` and the on-disk
   data files is similar to how MongoDB works *without*
   journaling, which is that MongoDB asks the operating system to flush
   in-memory changes back to the data files every 60 seconds.
