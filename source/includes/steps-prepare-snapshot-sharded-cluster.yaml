  a. Choose the point from which you want to restore your backup.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 40 40
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Restore Type

          - Description

          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

          - Allows you to choose one :term:`stored snapshot <snapshot>`.

          - Select an existing :term:`snapshot <snapshot>` to restore.

        * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

          - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up to
            but not including the selected time. By default, the
            :term:`oplog` stores 24 hours of data.

            .. example::

               If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the restore
               is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

            .. important::

               You cannot perform a :abbr:`PIT (Point in Time)` restore
               that covers any time prior to the latest backup resync. For
               the conditions that cause a resync, see
               :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

          - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  c. If you chose :guilabel:`Point In Time` and :term:`checkpoints
     <checkpoint>` are enabled, a list of :guilabel:`Checkpoints`
     appears. You may choose a checkpoint to be your point in time, or
     click :guilabel:`Choose another point in time` to remove the list
     of checkpoints and select the date and time from the menus.
