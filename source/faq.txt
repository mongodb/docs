Why Am I Having Problems Connecting to a MongoDB Instance?
----------------------------------------------------------

If you have trouble connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see
the :ref:`Connection Troubleshooting Guide <kotlin-connection-troubleshooting>`
for possible solutions.

How is the {+language+} Driver Different from KMongo?
-----------------------------------------------

The {+driver-short+} is the official MongoDB driver for {+language+}. It is
developed by the MongoDB team and provides a native API for {+language+}
applications to connect to MongoDB and work with data. It is implemented
by wrapping the :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </java-drivers/>`.

.. include:: /includes/kmongo-description.rst

The {+driver-short+} was developed in collaboration with the creator of KMongo,
Julien Buret, to give users an officially-supported driver.

The official {+driver-short+} and KMongo have generally similar APIs.
Notable similarities between the {+driver-short+} and KMongo include:

- Support for synchronous and coroutine-based operations
- Support using data classes to represent MongoDB documents
- Support for KotlinX serialization
- Support for MongoDB CRUD API and aggregation API

Although the official {+driver-short+} and KMongo are similar, there are some
key differences:

- The official driver does *not* have built-in support for `reactor <https://projectreactor.io/>`__,
  `rxjava2 <https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava>`__, `Jackson <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson>`__,
  or `GSON <https://github.com/google/gson>`__.
- The official driver does *not* support MongoDB shell commands.

How Does Connection Pooling Work in the Kotlin Driver?
------------------------------------------------------

Every ``MongoClient`` instance has a built-in connection pool for each server
in your MongoDB topology. Connection pools open sockets on demand to
support concurrent MongoDB operations in your multi-threaded application.

The maximum size of each connection pool is set by the ``maxPoolSize`` option, which
defaults to ``100``. If the number of in-use connections to a server reaches
the value of ``maxPoolSize``, the next request to that server will wait
until a connection becomes available.

Each ``MongoClient`` instance opens two additional sockets per server in your
MongoDB topology for monitoring the server's state.

For example, a client connected to a 3-node replica set opens 6
monitoring sockets. It also opens as many sockets as needed to support
an application's threads on each server, up to
the value of ``maxPoolSize``. If ``maxPoolSize`` is ``100`` and the
application only uses the primary (the default), then only the primary
connection pool grows and there can be at most ``106`` total connections. If the
application uses a :ref:`read preference <kotlin-read-write-pref>` to query the
secondary nodes, their pools also grow and there can be ``306`` total connections.

Additionally, connection pools are rate-limited such that each connection pool
can only create, at maximum, the value of ``maxConnecting`` connections
in parallel at any time. Any additional thread stops waiting in the
following cases:

- One of the existing threads finishes creating a connection, or
  an existing connection is checked back into the pool.
- The driver's ability to reuse existing connections improves due to
  rate-limits on connection creation.

You can set the minimum number of concurrent connections to
each server with the ``minPoolSize`` option, which defaults to ``0``.
The connection pool will be initialized with this number of sockets. If
sockets are closed due to any network errors, causing the total number
of sockets (both in use and idle) to drop below the minimum, more
sockets are opened until the minimum is reached.

You can set the maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can
remain idle in the pool before being removed and replaced with
the ``maxIdleTimeMS`` option, which defaults to ``0`` (no limit).

The following default configuration for a ``MongoClient`` works for most
applications:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   val client = MongoClient("<connection string>")

Create a client once for each process, and reuse it for all
operations. It is a common mistake to create a new client for each
request, which is very inefficient.

To support high numbers of concurrent MongoDB operations
within one process, you can increase ``maxPoolSize``. Once the pool
reaches its maximum size, additional threads wait for sockets
to become available.

The driver does not limit the number of threads that
can wait for sockets to become available, and it is the application's
responsibility to limit the size of its pool to bound queuing
during a load spike. Threads wait for the amount of time specified in
the ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` option, which defaults to ``120000`` (120 seconds).

A thread that waits more than the length of time defined by
``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` for a socket raises a connection error. Use this
option if it is more important to bound the duration of operations
during a load spike than it is to complete every operation.

When ``MongoClient.close()`` is called by any thread, the driver
closes all idle sockets and closes all sockets that are in
use as they are returned to the pool.

Guide <connect-to-mongodb>`.
