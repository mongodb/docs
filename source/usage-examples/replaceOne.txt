   :description: Replace a document in a collection using the `ReplaceOne()` or `ReplaceOneAsync()` methods, with examples for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

You can replace one document with another by using the ``ReplaceOne()`` synchronous method 
or the ``ReplaceOneAsync()`` asynchronous method on a collection object.

Example
-------

The following code replaces the first document in the ``restaurants`` collection that has a 
value of "Pizza" in the ``cuisine`` field. After the replacement, this document will 
have a ``name`` field with a value of "Mongo's Pizza" and new values for the 
``address`` and ``borough`` fields.

Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the 
corresponding code.

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: replace-one-sync

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/replace-one/ReplaceOne.cs
         :start-after: start-replace-one
         :end-before: end-replace-one
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:
      
      For a fully runnable example of the ``ReplaceOne()`` operation, see the
      `ReplaceOne code sample <{+example+}/replace-one/ReplaceOne.cs>`__.

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: replace-one-async

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/replace-one/ReplaceOneAsync.cs
         :start-after: start-replace-one-async
         :end-before: end-replace-one-async
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      For a fully runnable example of the ``ReplaceOneAsync()`` operation, see the
      `ReplaceOneAsync code sample <{+example+}/replace-one/ReplaceOneAsync.cs>`__.

Expected Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running either of the preceding full examples prints the following results:

.. code-block:: none

   First pizza restaurant before replacement: J&V Famous Pizza
   Restaurants modified by replacement: 1
   First pizza restaurant after replacement: Mongo's Pizza
   Resetting sample data...done.
