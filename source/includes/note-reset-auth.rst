If at any point you wish to reset the authentication settings for your
group and start again, click :guilabel:`Clear Settings`
in the :guilabel:`Authentication & SSL Settings` dialog box to clear all
authentication and security settings, automation users, and automation roles.
You **cannot** clear the authentication and security settings if there
are managed processes in your deployment. 

See :doc:`/tutorial/clear-security-settings` for more information.
