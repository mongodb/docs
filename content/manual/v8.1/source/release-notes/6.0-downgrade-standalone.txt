Before you attempt a downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
in this page.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade/latest-patch-release.rst

.. include:: /includes/downgrade/single-version-support.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Access Control
--------------

If your deployment has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required
privileges.
      
Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the downgrade procedure, you must complete the following
prerequisite steps.

1. Create Backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

To learn how to create a backup, see :ref:`backup-methods`.

2. Remove Backward-Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
|newversion| features that are incompatible with |oldversion|. For a
list of incompatible features and how to remove them, see
:ref:`6.0-downgrade-considerations`.

3. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (FCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your standalone
instance:

#. Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/6.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

Downgrade Procedure
-------------------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that the
   prerequisites have been completed.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the latest |oldversion| binaries.

      Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the
      latest patch release in the |oldversion| series. If using a
      package manager, add a new repository for the |oldversion|
      binaries, then perform the actual downgrade process.

   .. step:: Replace the |newversion| binaries with the downloaded |oldversion| binaries.

      Ensure that the |oldversion| binaries are in your System PATH. To
      confirm your binary version, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongod --version

      The command output should indicate a 5.0-series release.

   .. step:: Shut down the ``mongod`` instance.

      To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the deployment and run the
      following command:
         
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

   .. step:: Update configuration files.

      Disable any configurable |newversion| features by updating the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance's configuration file before
      restarting.

      To see the list of configurable |newversion| features, review the
      :ref:`6.0 Release Notes <release-notes-6.0>`.

   .. step:: Restart with the latest |oldversion| ``mongod`` instance.

      To start a ``mongod`` process, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         mongod --dbpath </path-to-data-folder>

      To learn more about starting a ``mongod`` process, see
      :ref:`start-mongod-processes`.
