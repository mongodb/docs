Upgrading
---------

MongoDB 1.8 is a standard, incremental production release and works as
a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 1.6, except:

- :term:`Replica set <replica set>` members should be upgraded in a
  particular order, as described in :ref:`1.8-upgrade-replica-set`.

- The :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command has changed in 1.8, causing
  incompatibility with previous releases. :dbcommand:`mapReduce` no
  longer generates temporary collections (thus, ``keepTemp`` has been
  removed). Now, you must always supply a value for ``out``. See the
  ``out`` field options in the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` document. If you
  use MapReduce, this also likely means you need a recent version of
  your client driver.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Read through all release notes before upgrading and ensure that no
changes will affect your deployment.

.. _1.8-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrading a Standalone ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the v1.8.x binaries from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. Shutdown your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

#. Replace the existing binary with the 1.8.x :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

#. Restart MongoDB.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://downloads.mongodb.org/

.. _1.8-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrading a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.8.x :term:`secondaries <secondary>` **can** replicate from 1.6.x
:term:`primaries <primary>`.

1.6.x secondaries **cannot** replicate from 1.8.x primaries.

Thus, to upgrade a :term:`replica set` you must replace all of your
secondaries first, then the primary.

For example, suppose you have a replica set with a primary, an
:term:`arbiter` and several secondaries. To upgrade the set, do the
following:

1. For the arbiter:

   a. Shut down the arbiter.

   #. Restart it with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. Change your config (optional) to prevent election of a new primary.

   It is possible that, when you start shutting down members of the set,
   a new primary will be elected. To prevent this, you can give
   all of the secondaries a priority of ``0`` before
   upgrading, and then change them back afterwards. To do so:

   a. Record your current config. Run :method:`rs.config()` and paste the
      results into a text file.

   #. Update your config so that all secondaries have
      priority ``0``. For example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         config = rs.conf()
         {
              "_id" : "foo",
              "version" : 3,
              "members" : [
                      {
                              "_id" : 0,
                              "host" : "ubuntu:27017"
                      },
                      {
                              "_id" : 1,
                              "host" : "ubuntu:27018"
                      },
                      {
                              "_id" : 2,
                              "host" : "ubuntu:27019",
                              "arbiterOnly" : true
                      }
                      {
                              "_id" : 3,
                              "host" : "ubuntu:27020"
                      },
                      {
                              "_id" : 4,
                              "host" : "ubuntu:27021"
                      },
              ]
         }
         config.version++
         3
         rs.isMaster()
         {
              "setName" : "foo",
              "ismaster" : false,
              "secondary" : true,
              "hosts" : [
                      "ubuntu:27017",
                      "ubuntu:27018"
              ],
              "arbiters" : [
                      "ubuntu:27019"
              ],
              "primary" : "ubuntu:27018",
              "ok" : 1
         }
         // for each secondary
         config.members[0].priority = 0
         config.members[3].priority = 0
         config.members[4].priority = 0
         rs.reconfig(config)

#. For each secondary:

   a. Shut down the secondary.

   #. Restart it with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. If you changed the config, change it back to its original state:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      config = rs.conf()
      config.version++
      config.members[0].priority = 1
      config.members[3].priority = 1
      config.members[4].priority = 1
      rs.reconfig(config)

#. Shut down the primary (the final 1.6 server), and then restart it
   with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

.. _1.8-upgrade-shard-cluster:
.. _1.8-upgrade-sharded-cluster:

Upgrading a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Turn off the balancer:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongo <a_mongos_hostname>
      use config
      db.settings.update({_id:"balancer"},{$set : {stopped:true}}, true)

#. For each :term:`shard`:

   - If the shard is a :term:`replica set`, follow the directions above for
     :ref:`1.8-upgrade-replica-set`.

   - If the shard is a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, shut it down
     and then restart it with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. For each :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

   a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongos` process.

   #. Restart it with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. For each config server:

   a. Shut down the config server process.

   #. Restart it with the 1.8.x binary from the `MongoDB Download Page`_.

#. Turn on the balancer:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.settings.update({_id:"balancer"},{$set : {stopped:false}})

Returning to 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If for any reason you must move back to 1.6, follow the steps above in
reverse. Please be careful that you have not inserted any documents
larger than 4MB while running on 1.8 (where the max size has increased
to 16MB). If you have you will get errors when the server tries to read
those documents.

Journaling
``````````

Returning to 1.6 after using 1.8
:ref:`Journaling <journaling-internals>` works
fine, as journaling does not change anything about the data file format.
Suppose you are running 1.8.x with journaling enabled and you decide to
switch back to 1.6. There are two scenarios:

- If you shut down cleanly with 1.8.x, just restart with the 1.6 mongod
  binary.

- If 1.8.x shut down uncleanly, start 1.8.x up again and let the journal
  files run to fix any damage (incomplete writes) that may have existed
  at the crash. Then shut down 1.8.x cleanly and restart with the 1.6
  mongod binary.

Changes
-------

Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB now supports write-ahead :doc:`/core/journaling` to
facilitate fast crash recovery and durability in the storage engine.
With journaling enabled, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` can be quickly restarted
following a crash without needing to repair the :term:`collections
<collection>`. An aggregation pipeline makes it possible to do
aggregation.

Sparse and Covered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Sparse Indexes <index-type-sparse>` are indexes that only include
documents that contain the fields specified in the index. Documents
missing the field will not appear in the index at all. This can
significantly reduce index size for indexes of fields that contain only a
subset of documents within a :term:`collection`.

:ref:`Covered Indexes <covered-queries>` enable MongoDB to answer
queries entirely from the index when the query only selects fields
that the index contains.

Incremental MapReduce Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command supports new options that enable
incrementally updating existing :term:`collections <collection>`.
Previously, a MapReduce job could output either to a temporary
collection or to a named permanent collection, which it would overwrite
with new data.

You now have several options for the output of your MapReduce jobs:

- You can merge MapReduce output into an existing collection. Output
  from the Reduce phase will replace existing keys in the output
  collection if it already exists. Other keys will remain in the
  collection.

- You can now re-reduce your output with the contents of an existing
  collection. Each key output by the reduce phase will be reduced with
  the existing document in the output collection.

- You can replace the existing output collection with the new results of
  the MapReduce job (equivalent to setting a permanent output
  collection in previous releases)

- You can compute MapReduce inline and return results to the caller
  without persisting the results of the job. This is similar to the
  temporary collections generated in previous releases, except results
  are limited to 8MB.

For more information, see the ``out`` field options in the
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` document.
