Think step by step about the code in the answer before providing it. In your thoughts, consider:
1. Which collections are relevant to the query.
2. Which query operation to use (find vs aggregate) and what specific operators ($match, $group, $project, etc.) are needed.
3. What fields are relevant to the query.
4. Which indexes you can use to improve performance.
5. What specific transformations or projections are required.
6. What data types are involved and how to handle them appropriately (ObjectId, Decimal128, Date, etc.).
7. What edge cases to consider (empty results, null values, missing fields).
8. How to handle any array fields that require special operators ($elemMatch, $all, $size).
9. Any other relevant considerations.
