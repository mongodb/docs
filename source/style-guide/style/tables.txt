Text that's difficult to read in paragraph form often becomes clear
when put into a table. Tables clarify the relationships among
information, and they're easy to scan. This topic provides the
guidelines for the following aspects of tables:

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Example tables that reflect the guidelines are presented in a separate
section at the end of this topic.

.. note::

   Don't create tables that are overly complex or that scroll
   horizontally. If a table has too much information, try to break it
   up into smaller tables.

Introductory Text for Tables
----------------------------

In the text that precedes a table, introduce the table in a way that
relates the table to the text. If the table immediately follows the
reference to it, use a generic reference (such as *the following
table*) even if the table has a title. Provide a link to a table title
only when the table doesn't immediately follow the reference or when
the table is in a different article or section.

To introduce a table, use a sentence (not a fragment), and end the
sentence with a colon.

Table Titles
------------

Tables should normally have titles (captions). However, some tables are
closely associated with the surrounding text and don't require titles.
For example, decision matrixes and tables within tasks, procedures, and
tutorials don't require numbers or titles.

When creating table titles, use the following guidelines:

- Use sentence-style capitalization for table titles. However, for
  words that are always uppercase or always lowercase, match that case.
- Don't start a table title with an article (*a*, *an*, *the*).
- Don't end a table title with a period or colon.
- Place the title above the table, not below it, and tag it as bold.
- Don't manually number table titles. If titles should be numbered, the
  style sheet will number them.
- Make table titles concise; limit them to one line if possible.
- Make table titles descriptive:

  - Avoid using a table title that duplicates a topic or section title.
  - Ensure that no two table titles in an article or section are
    identical. To distinguish between the titles that are similar, add
    qualifiers.

- Don't include trademark symbols in table titles.

Column Headers
--------------

Use the following guidelines for text in column headers:

-  Use sentence-style capitalization in column headers. However, for
   words that are always uppercase or always lowercase, match that
   case.
-  Use singular nouns for column headers, unless the context requires
   otherwise.
-  Don't end column headers with ellipses or colons.

Table Text
----------

Use the following guidelines for text in table cells:

-  Use the same punctuation and capitalization guidelines that you use
   for text in lists. See :ref:`writing-list-items`.
-  Make the entries in a table parallel. For example, in a column that
   describes options, be consistent in beginning the entries with a
   verb or noun.
-  Avoid leaving a table cell blank. If no information is available for
   that cell, use *Not applicable* or *None*. Use the abbreviation *NA*
   only if space constraints exist. Don't use dashes. An exception is
   for matrix-type tables that use an X or other marker to indicate
   support. In such cases, blank cells are acceptable (see the third
   example at the end of this topic).
-  When showing a notation (for example, a note or warning) in a table,
   use the guidelines in :ref:`notations`.
-  If space in a table is constrained, you can use abbreviations and
   symbols that you wouldn't normally use in body text (such as % for
   percent).
-  Don't use color to differentiate table text.

Table Footnotes
---------------

If a notation (for example, a note or warning) applies to the entire
table, place the content in a regular notation preceding the table. If
a notation applies only to the content in a certain cell, place the
notation in that cell. However, if a notation applies to all of the
content in a row or column, or to the content in two or more cells, you
can use footnotes.

-  When writing the text of table footnotes, use the following
   guidelines:

   -  Ensure that all footnotes are written clearly and completely. Use
      sentences when possible. Avoid cryptic language.
   -  Ensure that all footnotes have parallel grammatical structure
      (sentences are paralleled by sentences, phrases by phrases, and
      so on).

-  Place the footnote text at the end of the table, either in a final
   row that spans the entire table or under the last row in the table.

-  Use superscript numbers to indicate the footnotes in the cells to
   which they apply. If numbers might be confusing (for example,
   because the text in the cells are numerical values), use lowercase
   letters instead.

   -  A footnote cited in a column header applies to the entire column.
   -  A footnote cited in a table cell applies to the text in that
      cell. Use a cell-level footnote if the note applies to multiple
      cells in the table.

Attribute or Parameter Tables in API documents
----------------------------------------------

When creating attribute or parameter tables in API documents, use the
following additional guidelines:

-  For tables that describes JSON or XML attributes, write the first
   sentence of a description with an implied subject. For example, if
   the attribute is name, the description might be as follows: "Server
   name, which becomes the initial host name of the server"
-  For attributes, include the valid values and default value at the
   end of the description. Use the formats "Valid values are *n* and
   *n*." and "The default is *n*." For example, "Valid values are
   ``true`` and ``false``." and "The default is ``false``."
-  If table descriptions or construction is complex, consider using a
   definition list or itemized list instead of a table.
-  Avoid putting definition lists in tables.

Examples
--------

The following table explains the different parts of the preceding URL:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Part of URL
     - Explanation

   * - ``swift://``
     - The prefix that passes file system requests to the Swift file
       system.

   * - ``acontainer``
     - The name of the container in Swift that contains the objects to
       be accessed. Container names must conform to RFC952 restrictions
       for host names—that is, the characters A-Z, numbers 0-9, and the
       hyphen (-).

       Nonconforming container names are inaccessible by swiftfs.

   * - ``aservice``
     - A user-friendly "service" name. A service name maps to a
       collection of configuration entries in the Hadoop core-site.xml
       file that specify where the container is located (for example,
       MongoDB-dfw).

   * - ``/path/to/files``
     - The name of the object or objects in Swift to be referenced.
       Although Swift doesn't support paths, swiftfs attempts to
       interpret names that look like paths and behave appropriately.
       For example, an input path named ``/path/to/*`` would qualify
       all objects with names prefixed by ``/path/to/``. Similarly, an
       output path of ``/path/to/`` would prefix the names of all newly
       created objects with ``/path/to/``.

The following table provides the default values for the absolute
limits:

     - 4500

   * - RAM
     - Maximum RAM across all data nodes, in gigabytes (GB)
     - 23040

   * - VCPUs
     - Maximum virtual CPUs across all data nodes
