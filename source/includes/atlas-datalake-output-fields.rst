       - Description

     * - ``cloudProviderConfig``
       - object
       - Configuration information related to the cloud service where 
         {+data-lake+} source data is stored.

     * - ``cloudProviderConfig.<provider>``
       - object
       - Name of the provider of the cloud service where {+data-lake-short+} 
         can access the S3 Bucket data stores. 

         {+data-lake-short+} only supports ``AWS``.

         iamAssumedRoleARN``
       - string
       - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Role that
         {+data-lake-short+} assumes when accessing S3 Bucket
         {+data-lake-stores+}.

         The IAM Role must support the following actions against each
         S3 bucket:

         - ``s3:GetObject``
         - ``s3:ListBucket``

     * - ``dataProcessRegion``
       - Optional
       - The cloud provider region to which {+data-lake+} routes
         client connections for data processing.

         If ``null``, the {+data-lake+} routes client connections to the
         region nearest to the client based on DNS resolution.

     * - ``dataProcessRegion.cloudProvider``
       - Required
       - Name of the cloud service provider. 

         {+data-lake+} only supports ``AWS``.

     * - ``dataProcessRegion.region``
       - Required
       - Name of the region to which {+data-lake+} routes client 
         connections for data processing.

         {+data-lake+} only supports the following regions:

     * - ``name``
       - string
       - Name of the {+data-lake+}.

     * - ``state``
       - string
       - Current state of the {+data-lake+}:

         - ``ACTIVE`` - The {+data-lake-short+} is active and 
           verified. You can query the
           {+data-lake-stores+} associated to the {+data-lake+}.

         - ``UNVERIFIED`` - The {+data-lake+} has an incomplete 
           configuration *or* the provided credentials do not grant 
           the access to the {+data-lake-stores+}. 

           For |aws| specifically, the
           provided ``cloudProviderConfig.aws.iamAssumedRoleARN`` 
           must grant access to the |aws| S3 buckets associated with any
           {+data-lake-stores+}.

     * - ``storage``
       - object
       - Configuration details for each {+data-lake-store+} and its
         mapping to MongoDB database(s) and collection(s).

     * - ``storage.databases``
       - object
       - Configuration details for mapping each {+data-lake-store+}
         to queryable databases and collections.

         An empty object indicates that the {+data-lake-short+}
         has no mapping configuration for any {+data-lake-store+}. 

     * - ``storage.stores``
       - array
       - Each object in the array represents a {+data-lake-store+}.
         {+data-lake-short+} uses the ``storage.databases``
         configuration details to map data in each {+data-lake-store+}
         to queryable databases and collections.

         An empty object indicates that the {+data-lake-short+} has 
         no configured {+data-lake-stores+}.
