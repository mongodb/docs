   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { drop: <collection_name>, writeConcern: <document>}

   The command takes the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - drop
        - The name of the collection to drop.

      * - writeConcern

        - Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern
          </reference/write-concern>` of the :dbcommand:`drop` command.
          Omit to use the default write concern.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-drop.rst

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper method
   :method:`db.collection.drop()`.

Behavior
--------

This command also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
collection.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-drop-collection-change.rst

.. warning::

   This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
   will block other operations until it has completed.

The :dbcommand:`drop` command and its helper
:method:`db.collection.drop()` create an :ref:`change-event-invalidate`
for any :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on the dropped collection.
