Add a User with Oplog Access
----------------------------

To access the oplog, a database user must have read access on
the ``local`` database. To create a user with read access on ``local``:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-access.rst

   .. step:: Add a user.

      a. It it's not already displayed, click the 
         :guilabel:`Database Users` tab.

      #. Click :icon-fa5:`plus` :guilabel:`Add New Database User` and 
         enter a user name such as ``oploguser``.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Grant Specific Privileges` and select the 
         ``read`` role and the ``local`` database. This restricts the 
         user to read operations on the ``local`` database.

      #. Enter a password and click :guilabel:`Add User`.

Access the Oplog
----------------

1. :doc:`Connect to your cluster </mongo-shell-connection>` with the
   {+mongosh+}, using the credentials of the new database user with
   access to the ``local`` database.

#. Switch to the ``local`` database.

   .. code-block:: none

      > use local

#. The oplog collection is named ``oplog.rs``. Database write operations
   are recorded in date order, with a :manual:`timestamp </reference/bson-types/#timestamps>`
   field and a wall clock field.

   The timestamp field contains an integer with
   :wikipedia:`seconds since epoch <Unix_time>`.

.. note::

   - To increase the size of an oplog for a cluster, see
     :ref:`Set Oplog Size <set-oplog-size>`.

   - You can't use the MongoDB command
     :ref:`replSetResizeOplog <paid-tier-command-limitations>`
     to resize the oplog.
