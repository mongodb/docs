Overview
--------

On this page, you can learn how to create an encryption schema for
automatic {+csfle+} ({+csfle-abbrev+}) as well as see an example detailing
how to create the encryption schema used in the {+csfle-abbrev+}
:ref:`Quick Start <csfle-quick-start>`.

Encryption Schemas
------------------

An encryption schema is a JSON object which uses a strict subset of
`JSON Schema Draft 4 standard syntax <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04>`_
along with the keywords ``encrypt`` and ``encryptMetadata``
to define the **encryption rules** that specify how your
{+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled client should encrypt your documents.

Encryption rules are JSON key-value pairs that define how your client
application encrypts your fields. You must specify or inherit the following
information in an encryption rule:

- The algorithm used to encrypt your field
- Which {+dek-long+} (DEK) your client uses to encrypt your field
- The `BSON <https://bsonspec.org/>`__ type of your field

Encryption rules must contain either the ``encrypt`` or
``encryptMetadata`` keyword.

To learn more about the encryption algorithms you can define in your
encryption schema, see :ref:`<csfle-reference-encryption-algorithms>`.

To learn more about {+dek-long+}s, see :ref:`csfle-reference-keys-key-vaults`.

encrypt Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``encrypt`` keyword defines an encryption rule for a single field in a
BSON document. Encryption rules containing the ``encrypt`` keyword have
the following structure:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/encrypt-keyword.json
   :language: json

encryptMetadata Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``encryptMetadata`` keyword defines encryption rules which child
elements of the sibling ``properties`` tag inherit. Encryption rules
containing ``encryptMetadata`` have the following structure:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/encryptmetadata-keyword.json
   :language: json

.. _csfle-fundamentals-pattern-properties: 

patternProperties Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``patternProperties`` keyword in your encryption schema to 
define encryption rules for all fields with names that match a regular expression.
This allows you to specify multiple fields for encryption based on a single regular
expression, or to specify them by only using a part of the field name. The
``patternProperties`` keyword replaces ``properties`` in your encryption schema.

Specify encryption rules with ``patternProperties`` using the following
structure:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/patternProperties-keyword.json
   :language: json

To see an example of how to use ``patternProperties`` see
:ref:`field-level-encryption-auto-encrypt-with-pattern-properties`

Example
-------

This example explains how to generate the encryption schema used in 
the :ref:`Create an Encryption Schema For Your Documents <csfle-quickstart-encryption-schema>`
step of the {+csfle-abbrev+} Quick Start. 

In the Quick Start, you insert documents with the following structure
into the ``patients`` collection of the ``medicalRecords`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/inserted-doc.json
   :language: json

Specify the Namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the root of your encryption schema, specify the namespace to which your
encryption schema applies. Specify the following to encrypt and decrypt
documents in the ``patients`` collection of the ``medicalRecords``
database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/namespace.json
   :language: json

Specify the {+dek-long+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Quick Start, you encrypt all fields of your document with a single
{+dek-long+} (DEK). To configure all fields in your documents to use a
single DEK for encryption and decryption, specify the ``_id`` of your DEK
with the ``encryptMetadata`` keyword at the root of your encryption schema
as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/metadata.json
   :language: json

Choose Encryption Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You decide to encrypt the following fields with the following encryption
algorithms:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 33 34 33

   * - Field Name
     - Encryption Algorithm
     - BSON Type

   * - ``ssn``
     - Deterministic
     - Int

   * - ``bloodType``
     - Random
     - String

   * - ``medicalRecords``
     - Random
     - Array

   * - ``insurance.policyNumber``
     - Deterministic
     - Int

You choose to encrypt the ``ssn`` and ``insurance.policyNumber`` fields
with deterministic encryption for the following reasons:

.. TODO: Kenn to review frequency analysis wording

- You want to be able to query on these fields.
- The values in these fields have a high cardinality, so
  this data is not susceptible to a frequency analysis
  attack.

You choose to encrypt the ``bloodType`` field with random encryption
for the following reasons:

- You do not plan to query on this field.
- The values in this field have low cardinality, making
  them susceptible to a frequency analysis attack if you encrypted them
  deterministically.

.. TODO: Technical reviewer, Kenn. The previous wording of this suggested
   that only automatic encryption did not support deterministic enryption
   of BSON arrays, however after testing it seems both manual and automatic
   encryption DO NOT support deterministic encryption of BSON arrays. Updated
   phrasing from "automatic encryption does not support deterministic..." to "CSFLE does not
   support deterministic...", let us know if this is incorrect!

You must encrypt the ``medicalRecords`` field with random encryption
as {+csfle-abbrev+} does not support deterministic
encryption of fields of type ``array``.

.. tip::

   To learn more about supported and unsupported automatic encryption
   operations, see :ref:`csfle-reference-automatic-encryption-supported-operations`.

Specify Encryption Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To encrypt the ``ssn`` field with deterministic encryption, specify the
following in your encryption schema:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/ssn.json
   :language: json

To encrypt the ``bloodType`` field with random encryption, specify the
following in your encryption schema:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/bloodType.json
   :language: json

To encrypt the ``medicalRecords`` field with random encryption, specify the
following in your encryption schema:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/medicalRecords.json
   :language: json

To encrypt the ``insurance.policyNumber`` field with deterministic
encryption, specify the following in your encryption schema:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/schema/insurancePolicyNumber.json
   :language: json
