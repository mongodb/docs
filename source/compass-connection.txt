The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog for a cluster provides the details to connect
to a cluster via `Compass
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs#compass>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-connection-prereq.rst

.. _compass-connect-automatically:

Connect to Your Cluster
-----------------------

.. important::

   This procedure requires Compass 1.8.0 or later. If you are using an
   earlier version of Compass and cannot update, use the
   :ref:`compass-connect-manually` procedure instead.

.. include:: /includes/steps/connect-to-cluster-compass.rst

Alternatively, you can :ref:`enter your cluster connection into compass
manually <compass-connect-manually>`.

.. _compass-connect-manually:

Enter Connection Details Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to :ref:`automatically filling in the connection details
<compass-connect-automatically>` using a MongoDB :manual:`URI connection
string </reference/connection-string>`, you can manually create a new
connection in `Compass
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs#compass>`__.

To set up a :guilabel:`New Connection` from Compass to your |service| cluster,
enter the following information in Compass and click :guilabel:`Connect`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field Name
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Hostname`

     - The hostname of primary for a replica set or the hostname for the
       :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` for a sharded cluster. 
       
       For a replica set, you can locate the primary hostname in the |service|
       UI by:
       
       #. Clicking :guilabel:`Clusters`,
       #. Clicking the cluster you want to connect to,
       #. Click on the replica set member marked as :guilabel:`PRIMARY`, and
       #. Copy the hostname of the replica set.
       
       For a sharded cluster, from the |service| UI click :guilabel:`Connect`
       for the cluster and click :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.
       Extract the :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` hostname from the 
       :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>`.
       
       Make note of the port number of the primary or :binary:`mongos
       <bin.mongos>` and use it to fill in the :guilabel:`Port` field in
       Compass.

   * - :guilabel:`Port`

     - The port of the primary for a replica set or the port for the
       :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` for a sharded cluster.

   * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
     - Select ``Username / Password``.

   * - :guilabel:`Username`

     - MongoDB user. The |service| connection details displays the
       MongoDB administration user set up for the cluster. You can
       connect with a different MongoDB user.

   * - :guilabel:`Password`

     - Password associated with the specified MongoDB user.

   * - :guilabel:`Authentication Database`

     - Specify ``"admin"``.
     
   * - :guilabel:`Replica Set Name`
     - The name of the |service| cluster's replica set. You can retrieve this
       by clicking the :guilabel:`Connect` button for the cluster and
       selecting :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`. Extract the replica
       set name from the URI connection string's ``replicaSet`` value.
       
   * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`
     - Specify how Compass directs read operations. Options are 
       ``Primary``, ``Primary Preferred``, ``Secondary``, 
       ``Secondary Preferred``, and ``Nearest``. See
       :manual:`/core/read-preference`.

   * - :guilabel:`SSL`
     - Select ``"Use System CA / Atlas Deployment"``

   * - :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel`
     - Select ``"Off"``

   * - :guilabel:`Favorite Name`
     - Enter a name for the connection if saving as a favorite.
