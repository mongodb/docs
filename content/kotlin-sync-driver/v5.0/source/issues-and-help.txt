We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Kotlin community that includes users
with varying levels of experience using the Kotlin driver. We find the quickest
way to get support for general questions is through the `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`_.

Refer to our `support channels <https://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`__
documentation for more information.

If you think you've found a bug or want to see a new feature in the Kotlin
driver, please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

* `Create an account and login <https://jira.mongodb.org>`__.

* Click :guilabel:`Create`. Please provide as much information as possible
  about the issue and the steps to reproduce it.

.. important:: Bug Reports Are Public

   Bug reports in JIRA for the Kotlin driver and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER)

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the driver. We will guide
user contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Please
ensure that any pull requests include documentation, tests, and pass the
``gradle`` checks.
