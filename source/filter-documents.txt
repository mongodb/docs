Filter Documents in the Visualization

   :class: singlecol

To display a subset of results in your data that match a given
criteria, use the :guilabel:`Filters` input bar above the chart
display. Input a filter document employing the same syntax used in the
query portion of the :manual:`db.collection.find()
</tutorial/query-documents/>` method. After entering a filter document,
click :guilabel:`Apply` to see the filter reflected in your visualization.

.. note::

   Filters on large collections may have performance issues if there
   are not appropriate :manual:`indexes <indexes>` on the collection.

Basic Filter Example
--------------------

The following chart shows the average runtime of movies by genre.
The filter of ``{runtime: {$gte: 120 }}`` means that we are only
taking into account movies which have a runtime greater than or
equal to 120 minutes.

.. _regex-filter:

Regular Expression (RegEx) Filter
---------------------------------

.. _`regular expression`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression?oldid=858335070


RegEx filters allow you to apply a `regular expression`_ as the match
criteria to restrict the data |charts| displays. The expression
uses the following syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   { <field>: { $regex: "pattern", $options: "<options>" } }

The ``$options`` are optional and are the same as the
:query:`$regex options <$options>` in the MongoDB shell.

.. example::

   **Filter data to document fields that start with a specific letter**

   To find all documents where the ``jobs`` field begins with the
   letter ``A``, you would write the following in the
   :guilabel:`Filter` bar:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "job" : { $regex : "^A" } }

   **Filter data to document fields that start with a specific letter
   ignoring case**

   To find all documents where the ``jobs`` field begins with the
   letter ``A`` or ``a``, you would write the following in the
   :guilabel:`Filter` bar:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "job" : { $regex : "^A", $options : "i" } }

.. note::

   The quotation marks around the regular expression are required. You
   may not use forward slashes to delineate the regex value as you may
   in the MongoDB shell.

.. _date-filter:

Relative Date Filter
--------------------

Relative Date Filters allow you to specify a date from which |charts|
restricts the data displayed. For example, you can set a Relative Date
Filter to display data from only the last month or last year. To
create a filter spanning from the specified date to the current date,
specify the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch of January 1,
1970. Use this date in conjunction with a
:manual:`comparison query operator </reference/operator/query-comparison/>`
to set the inclusive or exclusive time range of the data displayed.

.. example::

   The following Relative Date Filter returns documents that have a
   ``timestamp`` field which resolves to a date less than 30 days from
   the current date:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { timestamp: {  $gt: new Date(new Date() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) } }

   First, the inner ``new Date()`` constructor generates the current
   date in milliseconds since the Unix epoch of January 1, 1970. The
   mathematical series ``30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`` results in the
   number of milliseconds elapsed in 30 days. The filter takes the
   current date in milliseconds since the Unix epoch and subtracts the
   number of milliseconds in 30 days. This results in a new millisecond
   value which the filter passes to an outer ``new Date()`` constructor
   and resolves to the date 30 days prior to the time the user executes
   the filter.

   Using a mathematical series as shown here allows the filter to
   always span a relative timeframe of 30 days prior to the time
   the user executes the filter.

For a more complete example of a relative date filter, see the
:ref:`Relative Date Filter Example <relative-date-example>`.

.. admonition:: ISO-8601 Dates
   :class: note

   The date functions utilized in |charts| filters are consistent and
   compatible with the date functions used in the
   :manual:`mongo shell </mongo>`. As a result, you can also use the
   ``ISODate()`` constructor in your |charts-short| query filters.
   Specifying an ``ISODate()`` constructor with no parameters exhibits
   the same behavior as specifying a ``new Date()`` constructor with no
   paramters, both returning the current date in their respective
   formats.

   .. example::

      The following filter returns documents that have a
      ``timestamp`` field between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017
      inclusively:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {$and: [{timestamp: {$gte: ISODate("2017-01-01")}},
         {timestamp: {$lte: ISODate("2017-12-31")}}]}

.. _relative-date-example:

Relative Date Filter Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following chart visualizes workout data. Each document in the
collection represents an individual workout activity, which contains
information such as the type of workout and various exercise
statistics. This line chart shows the distance per month covered
across all workouts over the past year (365 days):

.. figure:: /images/charts/relative-date-example.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Charts dashboard filter

The chart utilizes the following filter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "Workout Date (As Date)": {$gte: new Date(new Date() - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) }}

This filter returns documents where the ``Workout Date (As Date)``
field is within one year prior to the time |charts-short| executes the
query. The ``(new Date() - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 )`` parameter
results in the date one year prior to the current date as expressed in
milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |charts-short| returns documents
with a value greater than or equal to this date, as signified by the
:manual:`$gte </reference/operator/query/gte/>` operator.

.. admonition:: Date() is not supported
   :class: note

   The ``Date()`` function (as opposed to the ``new Date()``
   constructor) returns the current date as a string, so it cannot be
   used for filtering dates in |charts-short|. Use:

   - ``new Date()``,
   - ``ISODate()``, or
   - ``new ISODate()``
