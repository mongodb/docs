# AI Style Reviewer

AI-powered documentation reviewer that checks PRs for writing quality, style guide compliance, and clarity.

## How It Works

When triggered, the AI reviewer:
1. Fetches the PR diff
2. Analyzes changes against MongoDB style guidelines
3. Posts inline comments on issues found
4. Adds a summary comment

It uses Claude (Anthropic API) to understand context and provide actionable feedback.

## Triggering a Review

### Option 1: Add a Label

Add the `ai-review` label to any PR. The review runs automatically.

### Option 2: Comment Command

Comment `/ai-review` on a PR to trigger a review.

## What It Checks

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Writing Clarity** | Passive voice, complex sentences, ambiguous pronouns |
| **Terminology** | MongoDB-specific terms, consistent naming |
| **Style Guide** | Active voice, second person ("you"), sentence structure |
| **Nested Components** | Admonitions inside admonitions (always flagged) |
| **SEO** | Title/meta issues (only if PR touches them) |

---

## Example Output

### Inline Comment

> **Style**: Consider using active voice here.
> 
> **Current**: "The data is processed by the server"  
> **Suggested**: "The server processes the data"

| `trigger.command` | `/ai-review` | Comment command to trigger |
| `feedback.granularity` | `minimal` | Only HIGH severity issues |

| `seo-guidelines.md` | SEO best practices |
| `nested-components-guide.md` | Why nested admonitions are problematic |

- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** repository secret

## FAQ

**Will this block my PR?**  
No. The reviewer only posts comments — it never blocks merges.

**Is every suggestion mandatory?**  
No. These are AI suggestions. Use your judgment. Some may not apply to your context.

**Why only 5 inline comments max?**  
To avoid cognitive overload. The AI prioritizes the most important issues.

**Can I re-run the review?**  
Yes. Remove and re-add the `ai-review` label, or comment `/ai-review` again.

**What if I disagree with a suggestion?**  
Ignore it! The AI doesn't have full context. If you see repeated bad suggestions, let us know so we can improve the prompts.
