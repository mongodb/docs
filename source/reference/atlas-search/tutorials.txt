Prerequisites 
-------------

To complete these tutorials, you must have the following: 

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version 4.2 or higher.

- The :doc:`sample datasets </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  cluster. You will use a collection with movie data from the |service| 
  sample dataset.

- {+mongosh+} on your local machine.

About the Tutorials 
-------------------

- The :ref:`autocomplete-tutorial` describes how to create and query an 
  |fts| index configured with an ``autocomplete`` field using the 
  ``autocomplete`` operator. We will create the |fts| index on the 
  ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and index ``title`` field text 
  values for autocompletion. We will run |fts| queries using 
  the ``autocomplete`` operator to search the indexed field for a 
  sequence of characters.

- The :ref:`synonyms-tutorial` describes how to add a collection that 
  configures words as synonyms, create an index that defines synonym 
  mappings on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection, and run |fts| 
  queries against the ``title`` field using words that are configured 
  as synonyms.
