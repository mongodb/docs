level: 4
ref: create-backups
content: |

  On the |onprem| host that you're upgrading, back up your existing
  configuration files and logs to a directory other than the install
  directory.

  .. important::

     You need the backed-up ``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties``
     file for later in this procedure.

  .. example::

     The following commands back up the configuration files and logs to
     your home directory:

     .. code-block:: sh

        cp -a <install_dir>/conf ~/mms_conf.backup
        cp -a <install_dir>/logs ~/mms_logs.backup

  .. include:: /includes/fact-opsmanager-ha-start-upgrade-mode.rst

  Navigate to the directory into which you want to install |onprem|.
  Extract the archive to that directory:

  .. code-block:: sh

     tar -zxf mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz

  .. important::

     To install a new version in the same directory as the old version,
     follow these steps:

     a. Rename the current installation directory.

        .. code-block:: sh

           mv <install_dir> <install_dir_old>

     b. Create a new directory with the original name of your old
        directory.

        .. code-block:: sh

           mkdir <install_dir>

     This avoids an empty installation directory and code library
     conflicts.

    All log files should be restored.
    Most, but not all, configuration file should be restored. Restore:

    ``conf-mms.properties``
      The :doc:`settings </reference/configuration>` for this
      |mms| deployment.

    ``gen.key``
      The :ref:`encryption key <gen-key>` for the
      :term:`backing databases` of this |mms| deployment.

    .. example::

       These commands restore the configuration files and logs from
       your home directory:

       .. code-block:: sh

          cp -a ~/mms_logs.backup <install_dir>/logs
          cp -a ~/mms_conf.backup/conf-mms.properties <install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties

title: "*Optional.* On each |onprem| server, merge any needed changes into the ``mms.conf`` file from your backup."
ref: merge-mms-conf
content: |

  The ``mms.conf`` file is rarely customized, as it contains port and
  |jvm| configuration settings. If you :doc:`modified the ports
  </tutorial/manage-ports>` or the |jvm| settings that |onprem| uses,
  you need to re-apply those changes from your backup
  copy to the ``mms.conf`` file after |onprem| is upgraded.

  .. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning/unredacted-secrets-from-mms-conf.rst

  The upgrade to |onprem| 4.1 and 4.2 removed the ``-d64`` flag from
  the ``JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS`` parameter.
