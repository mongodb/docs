You can use Relational Migrator to import projects. Import a project when you 
want to collaborate on a shared project. You can also duplicate a project by 
:ref:`exporting <export-project>` the project and then importing it. 

About this Task

Be aware of the following information when you import projects:

- When you import projects, Relational Migrator only uses ``.relmig`` files.

- Relational Migrator rejects files for import and returns an error message in 
  the following conditions:
  
  - The format of the file cannot be determined or if critical information is 
    missing.
  
  - The file was exported from an unsupported version of Relational Migrator

  - The version number of the file is older than a well-defined minimum version.
