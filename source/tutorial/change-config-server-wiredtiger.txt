===================================
Change Config Servers to WiredTiger
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engine of the
:term:`config servers <config server>` in a :term:`sharded cluster` to
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-config-server-storage-engine-mix.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-minimum-version.rst

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

   The tutorial runs :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   from the same host as the :binary:`~bin.mongod` they are connecting to.
   If run remotely, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   must specify the ip address or the associated hostname in order to
   connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Procedure
---------

This tutorial assumes that you have three config servers for this
sharded cluster. The three servers are named **first**, **second**, and
**third**, based on their position in the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
:setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting.

.. important::

   During this process, at most only two config servers will be running
   at any given time to ensure that the sharded cluster's metadata is
   **read-only**.
