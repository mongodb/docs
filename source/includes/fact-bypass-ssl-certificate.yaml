ref: fact-bypass-ssl-certificate
content: |
   By default, the :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` setting
   is ``true``, and a valid trusted certificate is required to connect to
   MongoDB instances using SSL. When the Monitoring Agent is managed by
   the Automation Agent, this setting cannot be set to ``false``.  However,
   you can set :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` to ``false``
   if you install and configure the Monitoring Agent manually. When
   :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` is ``false``, you do
   not need to set the :msetting:`sslTrustedServerCertificates`
   setting because |mms| will not verify the certificates.

   .. warning::

      Setting this option to ``false`` makes connections between the 
      Monitoring Agent and MongoDB databases susceptible to *man-in-the-middle*
      attacks. This configuration is recommended only for testing and not
      for production.
