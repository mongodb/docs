.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: clone

   The :dbcommand:`clone` command clones a database from a
   remote MongoDB instance to the current host. :dbcommand:`clone` copies the
   database on the remote instance with the same name as the current
   database. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { clone: "db1.example.net:27017" }

   Replace ``db1.example.net:27017`` above with the resolvable hostname for the
   MongoDB instance you wish to copy from. Note the following
   behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`clone` can run against a :term:`slave` or a
     non-:term:`primary` member of a :term:`replica set`.

   - :dbcommand:`clone` does not snapshot the database. If any clients
     update the database you're copying at any point during the clone
     operation, the resulting database may be inconsistent.

   - You must run :dbcommand:`clone` on the **destination server**.

   - The destination server is not locked for the duration of the
     :dbcommand:`clone` operation. This means that :dbcommand:`clone` will occasionally yield to
     allow other operations to complete.

   See :dbcommand:`copydb` for similar functionality with greater flexibility.

   .. warning::

      This command obtains an intermittent :term:`write lock` on the
      destination server, which can block other operations until it
      completes.
