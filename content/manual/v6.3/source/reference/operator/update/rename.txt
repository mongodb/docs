.. update:: $rename

   The :update:`$rename` operator updates the name of a field and has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {$rename: { <field1>: <newName1>, <field2>: <newName2>, ... } }

   The new field name must differ from the existing field name. To
   specify a ``<field>`` in an embedded document, use :term:`dot
   notation`.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.students.updateOne(
         { _id: 1 },
         { $rename: { 'nickname': 'alias', 'cell': 'mobile' } }
      )

   This operation renames the field ``nickname`` to ``alias``, and the
   field ``cell`` to ``mobile``.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/fact-update-operator-processing-order.rst

The :update:`$rename` operator logically performs an :update:`$unset`
of both the old name and the new name, and then performs a
:update:`$set` operation with the new name. As such, the operation may
not preserve the order of the fields in the document; i.e. the renamed
field may move within the document.

If the document already has a field with the ``<newName>``, the
:update:`$rename` operator removes that field and renames the specified
``<field>`` to ``<newName>``.

If the field to rename does not exist in a document, :update:`$rename`
does nothing (i.e. no operation).

For fields in embedded documents, the :update:`$rename` operator can
rename these fields as well as move the fields in and out of embedded
documents. :update:`$rename` does not work if these fields are in array
elements.

Examples
--------

Create the ``students`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.insertMany( [
      {
        "_id": 1,
        "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
        "mobile": "555-555-5555",
        "nmae": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
      },
      {
        "_id": 2,
        "alias": [ "My dearest friend" ],
        "mobile": "222-222-2222",
        "nmae": { "first" : "abigail", "last" : "adams" }
      },
      {
        "_id": 3,
        "alias": [ "Amazing grace" ],
        "mobile": "111-111-1111",
        "nmae": { "first" : "grace", "last" : "hopper" }
      }
   ] )

The documents contain an error, ``nmae`` should be ``name``. The
examples in the following sections update the documents in the
collection.

Rename a Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename a field, call the :update:`$rename` operator with the current
name of the field and the new name:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.updateMany( {}, { $rename: { "nmae": "name" } } )

This operation renames the field ``nmae`` to ``name`` for all documents
in the collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
     "mobile": "555-555-5555",
     "name": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
   }

   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "alias" : [ "My dearest friend" ],
      "mobile" : "222-222-2222",
      "name" : { "first" : "abigail", "last" : "adams" }
   }

   { "_id" : 3,
     "alias" : [ "Amazing grace" ],
     "mobile" : "111-111-1111",
     "name" : { "first" : "grace", "last" : "hopper" } }

Rename a Field in an Embedded Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename a field in an embedded document, call the :update:`$rename`
operator using the :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>` to refer
to the field. If the field is to remain in the same embedded document,
also use the dot notation in the new name, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.updateOne( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.first": "name.fname" } } )

This operation renames the embedded field ``first`` to ``fname``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     alias: [ 'The American Cincinnatus', 'The American Fabius' ],
     mobile: '555-555-5555',
     name: { last: 'washington', fname: 'george' }
   }

Rename a Field That Does Not Exist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When renaming a field and the existing field name refers to a field
that does not exist, the :update:`$rename` operator does nothing, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.updateOne( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse' } } )

This operation does nothing because there is no field named ``wife``.
