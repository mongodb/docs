.. pipeline:: $project

   Reshapes a document stream by renaming, adding, or removing
   fields. Also use :pipeline:`$project` to create computed values or
   sub-documents. Use :pipeline:`$project` to:

   - Include fields from the original document.
   - Insert computed fields.
   - Rename fields.
   - Create and populate fields that hold sub-documents.

   Use :pipeline:`$project` to quickly select the fields that you
   want to include or exclude from the response. Consider the
   following aggregation framework operation.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $project : {
              title : 1 ,
              author : 1 ,
          }}
       );

   This operation includes the ``title`` field and the ``author``
   field in the document that returns from the aggregation
   :term:`pipeline`.

   .. note::

      The ``_id`` field is always included by default. You may
      explicitly exclude ``_id`` as follows:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.article.aggregate(
             { $project : {
                 _id : 0 ,
                 title : 1 ,
                 author : 1
             }}
         );

      Here, the projection excludes the ``_id`` field but includes the
      ``title`` and ``author`` fields.

   Projections can also add computed fields to the document stream
   passing through the pipeline. A computed field can use any of the
   :ref:`expression operators <aggregation-expression-operators>`.
   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $project : {
              title : 1,
              doctoredPageViews : { $add:["$pageViews", 10] }
          }}
      );

   Here, the field ``doctoredPageViews`` represents the value of the
   ``pageViews`` field after adding 10 to the original field using the
   :expression:`$add`.

   .. note::

      You must enclose the expression that defines the computed field
      in braces, so that the expression is a valid object.

   You may also use :pipeline:`$project` to rename fields. Consider
   the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $project : {
              title : 1 ,
              page_views : "$pageViews" ,
              bar : "$other.foo"
          }}
      );

   This operation renames the ``pageViews`` field to ``page_views``,
   and renames the ``foo`` field in the ``other`` sub-document as
   the top-level field ``bar``. The field references used for
   renaming fields are direct expressions and do not use an operator
   or surrounding braces. All aggregation field references can use
   dotted paths to refer to fields in nested documents.

   Finally, you can use the :pipeline:`$project` to create and
   populate new sub-documents. Consider the following example that
   creates a new object-valued field named ``stats`` that holds a number
   of values:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
          { $project : {
              title : 1 ,
              stats : {
                  pv : "$pageViews",
                  foo : "$other.foo",
                  dpv : { $add:["$pageViews", 10] }
              }
          }}
      );

   This projection includes the ``title`` field and places
   :pipeline:`$project` into "inclusive" mode. Then, it creates the
   ``stats`` documents with the following fields:

   - ``pv`` which includes and renames the ``pageViews`` from the
     top level of the original documents.

   - ``foo`` which includes the value of ``other.foo`` from the
     original documents.

   - ``dpv`` which is a computed field that adds 10 to the value of
     the ``pageViews`` field in the original document using the
     :expression:`$add` aggregation expression.
