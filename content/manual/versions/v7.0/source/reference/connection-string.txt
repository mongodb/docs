Find Your {+atlas+} Connection String
-----------------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI 
      :tabid: atlas-cli

      To find your {+atlas+} connection string using the
      :atlascli:`Atlas CLI </>`, :atlascli:`install 
      </install-atlas-cli/>` and :atlascli:`connect
      </connect-atlas-cli/>` from the Atlas CLI, then run the following
      command. Replace ``<clusterName>`` with the name of the {+atlas+}
      cluster and replace ``<projectId>`` with the project ID.

      .. code-block::

         atlas clusters connectionStrings describe <clusterName> --projectId <projectId>

      To learn more, see :atlascli:`atlas clusters connectionStrings describe
      </command/atlas-clusters-connectionStrings-describe/>`.

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      To find your {+atlas+} connection string in the Atlas UI,
      follow these steps:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-find-atlas-connection-string.rst

Your {+atlas+} connection string resembles the following 
example:

Find Your Self-Hosted Deployment's Connection String
----------------------------------------------------

If you are connected to your self-hosted MongoDB Enterprise or
MongoDB Community deployment, run :method:`db.getMongo()` method to
return the connection string.

If you are not connected to your deployment, you can
determine your connection string based on the connection type you
want to use. See :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist` to learn the SRV
connection string syntax or
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format` to learn the
standard connection string syntax.

Your self-hosted connection string resembles the following
examples:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: SRV Connection String
      :tabid: srv

      .. include:: /includes/srv-connection-examples-onprem.rst

   .. tab:: Standard Connection String
      :tabid: standard

      .. include:: /includes/standard-connection-examples-onprem.rst

:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`. For more
examples, see :ref:`connections-connection-examples`.

Connection String Formats
-------------------------

You can specify the MongoDB connection string by using one
of the following formats:

- :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`: A connection string with a hostname
  that corresponds to a DNS SRV record. Your driver or
  :binary:`~bin.mongosh` queries the record to determine which hosts
  are running the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  instances.

- :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`: A connection
  string that specifies all hosts that are running the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

{+atlas+} clusters use :ref:`SRV connection format
<connections-dns-seedlist>` unless you connect to an 
:atlas:`online archive </online-archive/manage-online-archive/>`.

.. _connections-dns-seedlist:

SRV Connection Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports a
:abbr:`DNS (Domain Name Service)`-constructed :term:`seed list`. Using 
DNS to construct the available servers list allows more flexibility of
deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without
reconfiguring clients.

The SRV URI connection scheme has the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://[username:password@]host[/[defaultauthdb][?options]]

For more examples, see :ref:`connections-connection-examples`.

.. include:: /includes/list-table-connection-string-components.rst

In order to leverage the DNS seed list, use the same syntax as a :ref:`standard connection string
<connections-standard-connection-string-format>` with a prefix of
``mongodb+srv`` rather than the standard ``mongodb``. The ``+srv``
indicates to the client that the hostname that follows corresponds to a
DNS SRV record. The driver or :binary:`~bin.mongosh` will then
query the DNS for the record to determine which hosts are running the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

.. note::

   Use of the ``+srv`` connection string modifier
   automatically sets the :urioption:`tls` (or the equivalent
   :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``true`` for the connection. You can
   override this behavior by explicitly setting the :urioption:`tls`
   (or the equivalent :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``false`` with
   ``tls=false`` (or ``ssl=false``) in the query string.

When using the ``+srv`` format, you must specify the ``hostname``, 
``domain``, and ``top-level domain (TLD)`` in the following format: 
``<hostname>.<domain>.<TLD>.`` This table shows how the placeholders
correspond to example values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50 

   * - Placeholder
     - Example

   * - ``<hostname>``
     - ``server``

   * - ``<domain>``
     - ``example``

   * - ``<TLD>``
     - ``com``

   * - ``<hostname>.<domain>.<TLD>``
     - ``server.example.com``

This example shows a DNS :term:`seed list` connection string that 
correctly uses the ``<hostname>.<domain>.<TLD>`` format. It
authenticates as user ``myDatabaseUser`` with the password
``D1fficultP%40ssw0rd``:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@server.example.com/

The corresponding DNS configuration resembles:

.. code-block:: none

   Record                            TTL   Class    Priority Weight Port  Target
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27317 mongodb1.example.com.
   _mongodb._tcp.server.example.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27017 mongodb2.example.com.

Individual SRV records must be in 
``_mongodb._tcp.<hostname>.<domain>.<TLD>`` format.

When a client connects to a member of the :term:`seed list`, the client 
retrieves a list of replica set members it can connect to. Clients 
often use DNS aliases in their seed lists which means the host may
return a server list that differs from the original seed list. If this
happens, clients will use the hostnames provided by the replica set 
rather than the hostnames listed in the seed list to ensure that 
replica set members can be reached via the hostnames in the resulting
replica set config. 

.. important::

   The hostnames returned in SRV records must share the same parent
   domain (in this example, ``example.com``) as the given hostname. If
   the parent domains and hostname do not match, you will not be able to
   connect.

This example shows a DNS seed list connection string that is missing
the ``<hostname>``. This is incorrect and raises an error. 

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   # This connection string is missing the <hostname> and raises a connection error

   mongodb+srv://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@example.com/       


Like the standard connection string, the DNS seed list connection string
supports specifying options as a query string. With a DNS seed list
connection string, you can *also* specify the following options via a
TXT record:

- ``replicaSet``
- ``authSource``

You may only specify one TXT record per :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.
If multiple TXT records appear in the DNS and/or if the TXT
record contains an option other than ``replicaSet`` or ``authSource``,
the client will return an error.

The TXT record for the ``server.example.com`` DNS entry would resemble:

.. code-block:: none

   Record              TTL   Class    Text
   server.example.com. 86400 IN TXT   "replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB"

Taken together, the DNS SRV records and the options specified in the TXT
record resolve to the following standard format connection string:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=mySet&authSource=authDB

You can override the options specified in a TXT record by passing the option
in the query string. In the following example, the query string has provided
an override for the ``authSource`` option configured in the TXT record
of the DNS entry above.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb+srv://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@server.example.com/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB

Given the override for the ``authSource``, the equivalent connection
string in the standard format would be:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb1.example.com:27317,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=300000&replicaSet=mySet&authSource=aDifferentAuthDB

.. note::

   The ``mongodb+srv`` option fails if there is no available DNS
   with records that correspond to the hostname identified in the
   connection string. If you use the ``+srv`` connection string modifier,
   the :urioption:`tls` (or the equivalent :urioption:`ssl`) option is 
   set to ``true`` for the connection. You can override this behavior by 
   explicitly setting the :urioption:`tls` 
   (or the equivalent :urioption:`ssl`) option to ``false`` with
   ``tls=false`` (or ``ssl=false``) in the query string.

   For an example that connects :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to a replica set using 
   the DNS seed list connection format, see :ref:`mongosh Connection Options 
   <example-connect-mongosh-using-srv>`.

.. _connections-standard-connection-string-format:

Standard Connection String Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection
URI used to connect to a self-hosted MongoDB standalone deployment,
replica set, or sharded cluster.

The standard URI connection scheme has the form:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]

For more examples, see :ref:`connections-connection-examples`.

Connection String Database Options
``````````````````````````````````

You can specify a default database in the ``[/defaultauthdb]`` field of the 
connection string. The client uses the specified ``[/defaultauthdb]`` database 
as the default database. If unspecified by the connection string, the 
default database is the ``test`` database.

You can specify the authentication database in your connection string
using the :urioption:`authSource` connection option. If specified, the
client uses this database to verify your user identity and credentials.
If :urioption:`authSource` is unspecified, it defaults to the 
``[/defaultauthdb]`` database. If both :urioption:`authSource` and 
``[/defaultauthdb]`` are unspecified, :urioption:`authSource` 
defaults to the ``admin`` database.

The following connection string sets the default database to ``myDefaultDB``
and the authentication database to ``admin``:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongodb://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017/myDefaultDB?authSource=admin
