":term:`Capped collections <capped collection>` are fixed-size collections"
" that support high-throughput operations that insert and retrieve "
"documents based on insertion order. Capped collections work in a way "
"similar to circular buffers: once a collection fills its allocated space,"
" it makes room for new documents by overwriting the oldest documents in "
"the collection."

"Store log information generated by high-volume systems. Inserting "

"Cache small amounts of data in a capped collections. Since caches are "
