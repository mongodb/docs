Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that
   allows you to rotate the MongoDB server log and/or audit log to
   prevent a single logfile from consuming too much disk space.

   You must issue the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command against the
   :term:`admin database`.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        logRotate: <target>
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``<target>``
     - string
     - The log or logs to rotate, according to the following:
 
       - ``1``  -- Rotates both the server and audit logs
       - ``server`` -- Rotates only the server log
       - ``audit``  -- Rotates only the audit log
 
   * - ``comment``
     - any
     - *optional* A message logged by the server to the log file and
       audit file at time of log rotation.
 
You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

For example, if a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has a
process ID (PID) of ``2200``, the following command rotates the log
file for that instance on Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

   kill -SIGUSR1 2200

Limitations
-----------

- Your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance needs to be running with the
  :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option in order to use
  :dbcommand:`logRotate`

- :ref:`Auditing <auditing>` must be enabled to rotate the audit log.

Behavior
--------

The :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` setting or
:option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` option specify
:dbcommand:`logRotate`'s behavior.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate
<mongod --logRotate>` are set to ``rename``, :dbcommand:`logRotate`
renames the existing log file by appending the current timestamp to the
filename. The appended timestamp has the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS>

Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same
name as originally specified by the :setting:`systemLog.path` setting to
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate
<mongod --logRotate>` are set to ``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate`
follows the typical Linux/Unix behavior, and simply closes the log file
then reopens a log file with the same name. With ``reopen``,
:binary:`~bin.mongod` expects that another process renames the file
prior to the rotation, and that the reopen results in the creation of a
new file.

Examples
--------

The following example rotates both the server log and the audit log:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({logRotate: 1})

The following example rotates only the audit log, and provides a custom
message to the log file at time of rotation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({logRotate: audit, comment: "Rotating audit log"})
