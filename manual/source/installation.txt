Supported Platforms
-------------------

.. important:: 

   MongoDB does not support 32-bit x86 platforms.

.. include:: includes/platform-support.rst

.. [#oracle-linux] 
   
   MongoDB only supports Oracle Linux running the  Red Hat Compatible
   Kernel (RHCK). MongoDB does **not** support the Unbreakable
   Enterprise Kernel (UEK).

.. [#RockyAlmaLinux-support-install]

   MongoDB on-premises products released for RHEL version 8.0+ are 
   compatible with and supported on Rocky Linux version 8.0+ and 
   AlmaLinux version 8.0+, contingent upon those distributions meeting their 
   obligation to deliver full RHEL compatibility.

.. [#SLES12-SP-info]

   MongoDB versions 5.0 and greater are tested against SLES 12 service 
   pack 5. Earlier versions of MongoDB are tested against SLES 12 
   with no service pack.

.. [#SLES15-SP-info]

   MongoDB versions 7.0 and later are tested against SLES 15 service pack 4. 
   Earlier versions of MongoDB are tested against SLES 15 with no service pack.

.. [#RHEL7-compat]
   
   MongoDB version 7.0 is built and tested against RHEL 7.9. Earlier versions 
   of MongoDB are tested against RHEL 7 and assume forward compatibility.

.. [#RHEL8-tcmalloc-support]

   RHEL 8 on PPC64LE and s390x does not support the updated version of TCMalloc 
   used in MongoDB versions 8.0 and later.  On these architectures, RHEL 8 uses 
   the legacy TCMalloc version. To learn more, see :ref:`tcmalloc-performance`.

.. [#RHEL9-tcmalloc-support]

   RHEL 9 on PPC64LE and s390x does not support the updated version of TCMalloc 
   used in MongoDB versions 8.0 and later.  On these architectures, RHEL 9 uses 
   the legacy TCMalloc version. To learn more, see :ref:`tcmalloc-performance`.
