content: |

   To use :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` as a backup strategy
   for sharded clusters, you must stop the 
   :ref:`sharded cluster balancer <sharding-balancing>` and use the
   :dbcommand:`fsync` command or the :method:`db.fsyncLock` method on
   :program:`mongos` to block writes on the cluster during backups.

   Sharded clusters can also use one of the following coordinated backup
   and restore processes, which maintain the atomicity guarantees of
   transactions across shards:

   - `MongoDB Cloud Manager

   - `MongoDB Ops Manager
