  A string of terms that MongoDB parses and uses to query the text
  index. MongoDB performs a logical ``OR`` search of the terms unless
  specified as a phrase. See |object-behavior| for more information on
  the field.

  The language that determines the list of stop words for the search and
  the rules for the stemmer and tokenizer. If not specified, the search
  uses the default language of the index. For supported languages, see

  A boolean flag to enable or disable case sensitive search. Defaults
  to ``false``; i.e. the search defers to the case insensitivity of the
  :doc:`text </core/index-text>` index.

  For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`.

  A boolean flag to enable or disable diacritic sensitive search
  against :doc:`version 3 text indexes </core/index-text>`. Defaults to
  ``false``; i.e. the search defers to the diacritic insensitivity of
  the :doc:`text </core/index-text>` index.
 
  Text searches against earlier versions of the text index are
  inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive.
  As such, the ``$diacriticSensitive`` option has no effect with
  earlier versions of the text index.

  For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity`.
