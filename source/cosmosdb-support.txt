`Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction>`__
makes it easy to use Azure Cosmos DB as if it were a MongoDB database.
With Azure Cosmos DB, you can run the same application code and use the same drivers
and tools that you use with MongoDB.

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB implements MongoDB's
`Wire Protocol <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/>`__
to allow MongoDB `drivers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/>`__ to connect and
interact with Cosmos DB as though it were a MongoDB host. However, this
implementation has limitations, as outlined in the :ref:`cosmosdb-compat-section` section
of this page.

Version Information
-------------------

Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB v4.2, or MongoDB v5.0 for vCore clusters.
These versions don't support all the newer features and functionality in the versions of
MongoDB available on `MongoDB Atlas. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/>`__

.. tip:: MongoDB Version History
   
   To learn more about the features available in each version of MongoDB, see
