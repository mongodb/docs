     |service| generates a one-time use download link that expires
     within 1 hour after its creation.

     The amount of time to create this link increases with the size of

  Once the download is ready, |service|:

  - Emails you an alert that your snapshot download is ready.
  - Displays the download link in the :guilabel:`Restores & Downloads` 
    tab.

  |service| compresses the snapshot into a ``.tar.gz`` file. This
  archive includes the snapshot and the |mongod| logs.

  Once extracted, you can access the data files by starting a
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance on the host and pointing it at the
  extract directory using the
  :option:`--dbpath <mongod.--dbpath>` option.
