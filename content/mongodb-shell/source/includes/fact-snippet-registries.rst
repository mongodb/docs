The snippets feature uses the
`npm package manager <https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm>`__ to install
snippets from a pre-specified registry. You can configure your local
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` to use one or more registries: 

- The `community registry
  <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/tree/main/snippets>`__
  that is maintained by MongoDB
- A private registry that you maintain
- Multiple registries used together
