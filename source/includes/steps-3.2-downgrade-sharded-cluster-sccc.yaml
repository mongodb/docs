title: Disable the Balancer.

  Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
  sharded cluster, as described in
  :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

title: Downgrade each shard, one at a time.
level: 4
ref: 3.2-downgrade-shard
content: |
  For each replica set shard:

  a. Downgrade the protocolVersion.

  #. Downgrade the :binary:`~bin.mongod` secondaries *before* downgrading
     the primary.

  #. To downgrade the primary, run :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and then downgrade.
  
  For details on downgrading a replica set, see :ref:`3.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

title: "Downgrade the SCCC config servers."
level: 4
ref: 3.2-downgrade-config
content: |
    If the sharded cluster uses 3 mirrored :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances
    for the config servers, downgrade all three instances in reverse
    order of their listing in the :option:`--configdb <mongos --configdb>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos`. For example, if :binary:`~bin.mongos` has the
    following :option:`--configdb <mongos --configdb>` listing:

    .. code-block:: sh

       --configdb confserver1,confserver2,confserver3

    Downgrade first ``confserver3``, then ``confserver2``, and lastly,
    ``confserver1``. If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is using the
    :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` storage engine, you must
    include the :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>` option (or
    :setting:`storage.engine` if using the configuration file) with the
    3.0 binary.

    .. code-block:: sh

       mongod --configsvr --dbpath <path> --port <port> --storageEngine <storageEngine>
