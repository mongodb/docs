      You can retrieve multiple documents from a collection

   .. replacement:: result-operation

      the ``get()`` method to retrieve the results

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method to retrieve documents that meet a
set of criteria. When you call the ``get()`` method, MongoDB returns the
matching documents according to their :term:`natural order` in the collection or
according to the sort order that you can specify by using the ``orderBy()``
method.

.. tip::

   To learn about other ways to retrieve documents with the
   {+odm-short+}, see the :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-retrieve` guide.

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database 
      - Retrieves and prints documents from the ``movies`` collection
        that match a query filter
      
      The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``runtime`` field is greater than ``900``
      - ``orderBy()``: Sorts matched documents by their ascending
        ``_id`` values
      - ``get()``: Retrieves the query results as a Laravel collection
        object

            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            // Results are truncated
      
            [
              {
                "_id": ...,
                "runtime": 1256,
                "title": "Centennial",
                ...,
              },
              {
                "_id": ...,
                "runtime": 1140,
                "title": "Baseball",
                ...,
              },
              ...
            ]

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Retrieves and prints documents from the ``movies`` collection
        that match a query filter

      The example calls the following query builder methods:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``runtime`` field is greater than ``900``
      - ``orderBy()``: Sorts matched documents by their ascending
        ``_id`` values
      - ``get()``: Retrieves the query results as a Laravel collection
        object

            ( [_id] => ... [runtime] => 1140
