   .. step:: Load the sample data.

      For this tutorial, you use a publicly accessible 
      PDF document that contains that contains a `recent MongoDB earnings report
      <https://investors.mongodb.com/node/13176/pdf>`_
      as the data source for your vector store. This document describes
      MongoDB's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2025.

      To load the sample data, run the following code snippet.
      It does the following:

      - Creates a new directory called ``data``.
      - Retrieves the PDF from the specified URL and saves it as a file in the directory.
      - Uses the ``SimpleDirectoryReader`` `data connector
        <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/connector/>`__
        to extract raw text and metadata from the file. It also formats the data into
        documents.

            Q4 Revenue\nNEW YORK , March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:
            MDB) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and
            fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2025.\n\xa0\n  \xa0\n"MongoDB  delivered a
            strong end to fiscal 2025 with 24% Atlas revenue growth and significant margin
            expansion. Atlas consumption in the quarter\nwas better than expected and we
            continue to see good performance in new workload wins due to the flexibility,
            scalability and performance of the\nMongoDB  platform. In fiscal year 2026 we
            expect to see stable consumption growth in Atlas, our main growth driver,"
            said Dev Ittycheria, President\nand Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB
            .\n"Looking ahead, we remain incredibly excited about our long-term growth
            opportunity. MongoDB  removes the constraints of legacy databases,\nenabling
            businesses to innovate at AI speed with our flexible document model and
            seamless scalability. Following the Voyage AI acquisition, we\ncombine
            real-time data, sophisticated embedding and retrieval models and semantic
            search directly in the database, simplifying the development of\ntrustworthy

            MongoDB  had $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
            and\nrestricted cash. During the three months ended January 31, 2025, MongoDB
            generated $50.5 million of cash from\noperations, compared to $54.6 million of
            cash from operations in the year-ago period. MongoDB  used $26.0 million of
            cash\nin capital expenditures and used $1.6 million of cash in principal
            payments of finance leases, leading to free cash flow of\n$22.9 million,

   .. step:: Instantiate the vector store.

      Run the following code to create a vector store 
      named ``atlas_vector_store`` by using the 
      ``MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch`` method, which
      specifies the following:
      
      - A connection to your |service| {+cluster+}.
      - ``llamaindex_db.test`` as the |service| database and collection 
        used to store the documents.
      - ``vector_index`` as the index to use for querying the vector store.

      Then, you save the vector store to a `storage context
      <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/storage_context/>`__,
      which is a LlamaIndex container object used to prepare your data for storage.
      
      ..
         NOTE: If you edit this Python code, also update the Jupyter Notebook
         at https://github.com/mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/ai-integrations/llamaindex.ipynb

      .. code-block:: python

         # Connect to your Atlas cluster
         mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING)

         # Instantiate the vector store
         atlas_vector_store = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(
             mongo_client,
             db_name = "llamaindex_db", 
             collection_name = "test",
             vector_index_name = "vector_index"
         ) 
         vector_store_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=atlas_vector_store)

   .. step:: Store your data as vector embeddings.

      Once you've loaded your data and instantiated |service| as a vector store, 
      generate vector embeddings from your data and store them in |service|. 
      To do this, you must build a `vector store index 
      <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/indexing/indexing/>`__.
      This type of index is a LlamaIndex data structure that 
      splits, embeds, and then stores your data in the vector store.

      The following code uses the ``VectorStoreIndex.from_documents``
      method to build the vector store index on your sample data. It turns
      your sample data into vector embeddings and stores these embeddings 
      as documents in the ``llamaindex_db.test`` collection in your 
      |service| {+cluster+}, as specified by the vector store's storage context.
      
      .. note:: 

         This method uses the embedding model and chunk settings 
         that you configured when you
         :ref:`set up your environment <llamaindex-environment>`.

      ..
         NOTE: If you edit this Python code, also update the Jupyter Notebook
         at https://github.com/mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/ai-integrations/llamaindex.ipynb

      .. code:: python

         vector_store_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
            sample_data, storage_context=vector_store_context, show_progress=True
         )
         
      .. tip:: 

         After running the sample code, you can
         view your vector embeddings :ref:`in the {+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-view-collections>`
         by navigating to the ``langchain_db.test`` collection in your {+cluster+}.
