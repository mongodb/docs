     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`User Name`

       - The user's login name. All MongoDB users for |service| are
         associated with the ``admin`` database; i.e. their
         authentication database is ``admin``.

     * - :guilabel:`User Privileges`

       - You can assign roles in one of the following ways:

         - Select pre-bundled ``Read and write to any database`` which
           provides all the roles for a MongoDB admin user for the
           |service| group's clusters, or

         - Select ``Only read any database`` which provides the user
           with privileges to read any database, or

         - Click ``Show Advanced Option`` and select individual roles
           and specify the database associated with the role.

         For more information on roles, see :manual:`Role-Based Access
         Control </core/authorization>` and :manual:`Built-in Roles
         </core/security-built-in-roles>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - The user's password.

         |service| clusters use :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1
         </core/security-scram-sha-1>` to authenticate MongoDB users.
