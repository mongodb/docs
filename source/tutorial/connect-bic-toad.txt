Prerequisites
-------------

``mongosql_auth`` Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the latest ``mongosql_auth`` plugin component `.msi installer
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongosql-auth-c/releases>`__ and install.

MySQL Enterprise Edition ODBC Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure requires the Enterprise edition of the MySQL ODBC
driver. MySQL Enterprise uses OpenSSL, which is compatible with |bic|
for TLS/SSL connections.

Go to `<https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>`_ and download the MySQL
Enterprise Edition.

If you have a community edition of the driver, to install the
Enterprise edition for the same driver version, you must uninstall
the community edition. To uninstall, you can either:

- Remove the driver by using the .msi for community edition.

- Remove the driver from the :guilabel:`Control Panel` >
  :guilabel:`Programs and Features` screen.
