.. _host-issue-outofmemoryerror:

Logs Display ``java.lang.OutOfMemoryError``
-------------------------------------------

If your logs display ``java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space``,
adjust the Java Heap memory settings.

To adjust the Java Heap memory settings, repeat the following steps for
every host running |a-mms| instance except dedicated Backup Daemon
hosts:

1. Open ``mms.conf`` in your preferred text editor.
2. Find this line:

   .. code-block:: ini

      JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS="${JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS} -Xss228k -Xmx8096m -Xms8096m -XX:NewSize=600m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128m -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow"

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 10 40 40
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Key
        - Value
        - Default

      * - ``-Xmx``
        - Java Heap Maximum Memory
        - 8,096 :abbr:`MB (Megabytes)` (``8096m``)
      * - ``-Xms``
        - Java Heap Starting Memory
        - 8,096 :abbr:`MB (Megabytes)` (``8096m``)

   .. warning:: **Do not change other Java options**

      Changing any option values other than ``-Xmx`` and
      ``-Xms`` could have an unexpected impact 
      on the |application|. Do not change other values 
      without consulting MongoDB Support.
      Starting with |onprem| 7.0, |onprem| adopted a Garbage-First
      Garbage Collector (G1GC) method for the JVM. Don't use ``-Xmn``
      to set the size of the heap for the young generation.

3. Change the ``-Xmx`` and ``-Xms`` values:
   
   - Change the ``-Xmx`` and ``-Xms`` values to a larger
     value. You should set both parameters to the same value
     to remove any performance impact from the VM constantly
     reclaiming memory from the heap.

   Specify the values as ``#k|m|g``: a number followed 
   by:

   - ``k`` (kilobytes),
   - ``m`` (megabytes), or
   - ``g`` (gigabytes)

   .. example::

      To set the Java Heap to 12 :abbr:`GB (Gigabytes)`, 
      set the values to: ``-Xmx12g -Xms12g``.

4. Restart each host running |a-mms| instance on which you made these
   changes.

The optimal value for your |onprem| installation depends upon your
|onprem| hosts' architecture: platform, physical memory, etc. The goal
of heap tuning is to balance the time the |jvm| spends reclaiming
memory from objects that are no longer running, also known as garbage
collection, and the frequency of garbage collection.

- Large heap sizes mean less frequent and slower garbage collection.

- Small heap sizes mean more frequent and faster garbage collection.

.. important::

   Consider the co-located MongoDB processes running on the host and
   do not set your Java Heap size to a value greater than the amount of
   physical memory in the |onprem| host or less than the default value
   of ``8096m`` (8,096 :abbr:`MB (Megabytes)`).

.. _host-issue-stackoverflowerror:

Logs Display ``java.lang.StackOverflowError``
---------------------------------------------

If your logs display ``java.lang.StackOverflowError``, adjust the
Java stack memory settings.
 
To adjust the Java stack memory settings, repeat the following steps for
every host running |a-mms| instance except dedicated Backup Daemon hosts:

1. Open ``mms.conf`` in your preferred text editor.
2. Find this line:

   .. code-block:: ini

      JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS="${JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS} -Xss228k -Xmx8096m -Xms8096m -XX:NewSize=600m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128m -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow"

   The key values in this line are:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 60
      :stub-columns: 1
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Key
        - Value
      * - ``-Xss``
        - Java Stack Size

   By default, this value is set to 228 :abbr:`KB (Kilobytes)` 
   (``228k``).

   .. warning:: **Do not change other Java options**

      Changing any option value other than ``-Xss`` could have
      an unexpected impact on the |application|. Do not change
      other values without consulting MongoDB Support.

3. Change ``-Xss228k`` to ``-Xss1m`` (1 :abbr:`MB (Megabyte)`).

.. important::

   Consider the co-located MongoDB processes running on the host and
   do not set your Java stack size to a value greater than the amount of
   physical memory in the |onprem| host or less than the default value
   of ``228k`` (228 :abbr:`KB (Kilobytes)`).

.. _host-issue-userlimits:

Increase User Limits
--------------------

For the recommended User Limit (``ulimit``) setting, see the |faq| on
:ref:`open-file-limits`.

|mms| infers the host's ``ulimit`` setting using the total number of
available and current connections. To learn more about ``ulimit`` in
MongoDB, see the :manual:`UNIX ulimit Settings </reference/ulimit/>`
reference page in the MongoDB manual.

Ensure Sufficient RAM for All Components
----------------------------------------

Ensure that each server has enough RAM for the components it runs. If a
server runs multiple components, its RAM must be at least the sum of
the required amount of RAM for *each* component.

To learn about the individual RAM requirements for the |application|
server, |application| Database, Backup Daemon server, and Backup
Database, see :doc:`/core/requirements`.

Obsolete Config Settings
------------------------

|mms| fails to start if there are obsolete configuration settings set
in the :doc:`conf-mms.properties </reference/configuration>` file. If
there is an obsolete setting, the log lists an
:guilabel:`Obsolete Setting` error as in the following:

.. warning::

   [OBSOLETE SETTING] Remove ``mms.multiFactorAuth.require`` or
   replace ``mms.multiFactorAuth.require`` with
   ``mms.multiFactorAuth.level``.

You will need to remove or replace the obsolete property in the
``conf-mms.properties`` file before you can start |mms|.

.. _host-issue-expired-hosts:

Expired Hosts in Admin Console
------------------------------

The :ref:`Overview page <admin-console-general-overview>` of the
:guilabel:`Admin Console` displays the hosts that serve |onprem|. Each
host should respond to regular pings that |onprem| sends as part of
monitoring.

|onprem| marks a host that doesn't respond to pings after 30 minutes as
*expired*. Processes on an expired host display in red. When the
hostname for a monitored host changes, |onprem| lists the host twice:
once with its current hostname and once with its prior hostname. The
hostname changes for one of two reasons:

This occurs when the hostname for a monitored host changes. The
hostname changes for one of two reasons:

- A cloud service provider returns an external hostname instead of an
  internal hostname for the same host.
- A user may have changed the hostname on the host.

To remove the expired host:

1. Hover over the process in Servers tab of the :guilabel:`Overview`
   page.
2. Click the :icon-mms:`remove` icon that displays.

The host remains in the host list using its new hostname.
