   :description: Customize `_id` fields during migration by changing their BSON data type and using JavaScript expressions to ensure unique values.

You can customize an ``_id`` field as part of your migration job.
Customized ``_id`` fields allow you to change a field's BSON data type 
and write custom JavaScript expressions instead of using a project's
:ref:`Key Handling Option <rm-key-handling-setting>`.
Customized ``_id`` fields **must** evaluate to a unique value.

About this Task
---------------

- You may want to use customized ``_id`` fields to make your ``_id`` field
  more expressive. For example, you can concatenate multiple fields to form
  a unique ``_id``.

- You can revert the custom ID changes at any time. The ``_id`` field 
  returns to the project's :ref:`Key Handling Option <rm-key-handling-setting>`.

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane or diagram view.

#. From the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon next to a mapping rule.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-v` icon next to the :guilabel:`_id` field
   and select :guilabel:`Transform to calculated field`.

#. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`BSON type`.

#. (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Null handling` option.

   - :guilabel:`Omit`: Null values are not inserted into your 
     destination collection.
   - :guilabel:`Insert as null`: Null values are inserted into the destination
     collection. 

#. Enter a valid JavaScript expression. For examples, see 
   :ref:`valid JavaScript expressions<calculated-field-examples>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Done` and then click :guilabel:`Save and close`.
