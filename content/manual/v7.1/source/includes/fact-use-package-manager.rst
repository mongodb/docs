While MongoDB can be installed manually via a downloaded ``.tgz``
tarball as described in this document, it is recommended to use the
|package-manager| package manager on your system to install MongoDB if
possible. Using a package manager automatically installs all needed
dependencies, provides an example ``mongod.conf`` file to get you
started, and simplifies future upgrade and maintenance tasks.
