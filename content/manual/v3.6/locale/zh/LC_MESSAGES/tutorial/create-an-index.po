"Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by creating "
"small and efficient representations of the documents in a "
":term:`collection`. Users can create indexes for any collection on any field"
" in a :term:`document`. By default, MongoDB creates an index on the ``_id`` "
"field of every collection."

"This tutorial describes how to create an index on a single field. MongoDB "
"also supports :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>`, which are "
"indexes on multiple fields. See :ref:`index-create-compound-index` for "

"To create an index, use :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` or a similar "
":api:`method from your driver <>`. The "

"The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of "
