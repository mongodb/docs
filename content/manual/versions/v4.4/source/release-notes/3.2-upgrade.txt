Before you attempt any upgrade, please familiarize yourself with the
content of this document.

If you need guidance on upgrading to 3.2, `MongoDB offers 3.2 upgrade services
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact/mongodb-3-2-upgrade-services?tck=docs_server>`_ to help ensure a smooth transition without interruption to your
MongoDB application.

.. _3.2-upgrade-considerations:

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 3.2, you must be running a
3.0-series release.

To upgrade from a 2.6-series release, you *must* upgrade to the latest
3.0-series release before upgrading to 3.2. For the procedure to
upgrade from the 2.6-series to a 3.0-series release, see :v3.0:`Upgrade
to 3.0 </release-notes/3.0-upgrade>`.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before beginning your upgrade, see the :v3.2:`Compatibility Changes in
MongoDB 3.2 </release-notes/3.2-compatibility>` document to ensure that
your applications and deployments are compatible with MongoDB 3.2.
Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment before starting the
upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.


.. _3.2-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 3.2
-----------------------------------------------------

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version 3.0 to 3.2. To upgrade from version
2.6 to 3.2, :v3.0:`upgrade to the latest
3.0-series release </release-notes/3.0-upgrade>`
*first*, and then use the following procedure to upgrade from 3.0 to 3.2.

Upgrade with Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to 3.2 using your package
manager. Follow the appropriate :v3.2:`installation instructions
</administration/install-on-linux>` for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade.

Manual Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Otherwise, you can manually upgrade MongoDB:

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.2-upgrade-mongod.rst

.. note::
   MongoDB 3.2 generates core dumps on some :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   failures. For production environments, you may prefer to turn off core
   dumps for the operating system, if not already.

.. _3.2-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set to 3.2
----------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All replica set members must be running version 3.0 before you can
upgrade them to version 3.2. To upgrade a replica set from an earlier
MongoDB version, :v3.0:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
3.0-series release </release-notes/3.0-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure
to upgrade from MongoDB 3.0 to 3.2.

Upgrade Binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can upgrade from MongoDB 3.0 to 3.2 using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:

.. include:: /includes/warning-mixed-version-rs-config.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.2-upgrade-replica-set.rst

.. note::
   MongoDB 3.2 generates core dumps on some :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   failures. For production environments, you may prefer to turn off core
   dumps for the operating system, if not already.

.. _3.2-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 3.2
----------------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Version 3.0 or Greater
    To upgrade a sharded cluster to 3.2, **all** members of the
    cluster must be at least version 3.0. The upgrade process checks
    all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
    component is running version earlier than 3.0.

- Stop Metadata Changes during the Upgrade
    During the upgrade, ensure that clients do not make changes to the
    collection metadata. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
    perform any of the following operations:

    - :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

    - :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

    - :method:`sh.addShard()`

    - :method:`db.createCollection()`

    - :method:`db.collection.drop()`

    - :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

    - any operation that creates a database

    - any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way.

    See the :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of sharding
    commands. Not all commands on the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page
    modify the cluster metadata.

- :ref:`Disable the balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`

- Back up the ``config`` Database
    *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
    ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Upgrade Binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.2-upgrade-sharded-cluster.rst

.. note::

   MongoDB 3.2 generates core dumps on some :binary:`~bin.mongod` failures.
   For production environments, you may prefer to turn off core dumps
   for the operating system, if not already.

Once the sharded cluster binaries have been upgraded to 3.2, existing
config servers will continue to run as mirrored :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances. For instructions on upgrading existing config servers to a
replica set, see :v3.2:`Upgrade Config Servers to Replica Set
</tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set>` (requires MongoDB
version 3.2.4 or later versions).
