Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} uses connection pools to manage
connections to a MongoDB deployment. You can specify connection pool settings
in your application to configure this behavior.

A connection pool is a cache of open database connections maintained by the {+driver-short+}.
When your application requests a connection to MongoDB, the driver retrieves
a connection from the pool, performs operations, and returns the connection
to the pool for reuse.

Connection pools help reduce application latency and the number of times the driver
creates new connections.

Create a Connection Pool
------------------------

Each ``MongoClient`` instance has a built-in connection pool for each server in your
MongoDB topology. If you do not configure the ``minPoolSize`` option, connection
pools open sockets on demand. These sockets support concurrent MongoDB
operations in your application.

When you instantiate a new ``MongoClient``, the client opens two sockets per server
in your MongoDB topology to monitor the server's state.

For example, a client connected to a three-node replica set opens six monitoring
sockets. If the application uses the default setting for ``maxPoolSize`` and
only queries the primary node, there can be at most ``106`` open
sockets and ``100`` connections in the connection pool. If the application uses
a :ref:`read preference <kotlin-sync-configure>` to query the secondary nodes, there
can be ``306`` total connections.

For efficiency, create a client once for each process and reuse it for all
operations. Avoid creating a new client for each request because this will
increase latency.

Configure a Connection Pool
---------------------------

You can specify settings for your connection pool by using either a connection
string or a ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings`  tab to
see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    The following table describes connection pool options that you can set
    in your connection string:

    .. list-table::
      :widths: 25,75                                                          
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Option
        - Description
      
      * - ``maxConnecting``
      
        - Sets the maximum number of connections a pool may establish
          concurrently.

          *Default:* ``2``
      
      * - ``maxIdleTimeMS``
      
        - Sets the maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can 
          remain idle in the pool before it is removed and closed. Set this value higher
          than your application's expected idle period but lower than firewall or proxy
          connection timeouts to prevent unexpected disconnections.

          *Default:* ``0``
      
      * - ``maxPoolSize``

        - Sets the maximum number of connections that can be open in a pool. If an
          operation needs a new connection while the connection pool has
          the maximum number of open connections, the operation
          waits for a new connection to open.

          *Default:* ``100`` 

      * - ``minPoolSize``

        - Sets the minimum number of connections that can be open in a pool.
          The value of ``minPoolSize`` must be less than 
          the value of ``maxPoolSize``.

          *Default*: ``0``

      * - ``maxLifeTimeMS``

        - Sets the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the driver
          can continue to use a pooled connection before closing the
          connection. A value of ``0`` indicates that there is no upper bound on
          how long the driver can keep a pooled connection open. 

          *Default*: ``0``
    
    To learn more about these options, see the `ConnectionString
    <{+core-api+}/ConnectionString.html>`__ API documentation.

  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: MongoClient
     
    To specify connection pool settings in a ``MongoClientSettings`` object,
    chain the ``applyToConnectionPoolSettings()`` method to the ``MongoClientSettings`` builder.
    Pass a ``ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder`` block as a parameter to the
    ``applyToConnectionPoolSettings()`` method.
     
    The following table describes the setter methods you can use in a
    ``ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder`` block to configure the connection pool:

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 40 60
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Method
          - Description

        * - ``addConnectionPoolListener()``
          - Adds a listener for connection pool-related events.

        * - ``applyConnectionString()``
          - Applies the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

        * - ``applySettings()``
          - Uses the connection pool settings specified in a
            ``ConnectionPoolSettings`` object.

        * - ``maintenanceFrequency()``
          - Sets the frequency for running connection pool maintenance jobs.

        * - ``maintenanceInitialDelay()``
          - Sets the time to wait before running the first maintenance job
            on the connection pool.

        * - ``maxConnectionIdleTime()``
          - Sets the maximum time a connection can be idle before it's closed.

        * - ``maxConnectionLifeTime()``
          - Sets the maximum time a pooled connection can be open before it's
            closed.

        * - ``maxSize()``
          - Sets the maximum number of connections that can be open in a pool.
            
            *Default*: ``100``

        * - ``maxWaitTime()``
          - Sets the maximum time to wait for an available connection.
            
            *Default*: ``2`` minutes

        * - ``minSize()``
          - Sets the minimum number of connections that can be open in a pool.
            
            *Default*: ``0``

    To learn more about these methods, see the `ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder
    <{+core-api+}/connection/ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder.html>`__
    API documentation.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to create a connection pool that
has maximum size of ``50`` connections.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings`  tab to
see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-pools.kt

  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: MongoClient

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-pools.kt
       :start-after: start-client-settings
       :end-before: end-client-settings
       :language: kotlin
