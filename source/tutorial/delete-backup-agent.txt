================================
Remove the Backup Agent from MMS
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS displays active Backup Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to MMS for more than 24
hours, MMS removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To remove a Backup Agent **from MMS**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-backup-agent>` and then remove the ``mongodb-mms-backup-agent``
file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you installed the agent using a
``tar.gz`` file, the agent might be in a different directory, depending on
what you chose when you installed it.

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller to
remove the ``MMS Backup Agent`` program.
