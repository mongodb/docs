   MongoDB supports hardware monitoring using managed deployments running
   Automation Agent version 2.7.0 or later. Once the Automation Agents are
   installed, only managed MongoDB processes report hardware monitoring data.
   If you choose not manage MongoDB processes using the upgraded Automation
   Agents, Ops Manager displays the Munin-based charts.
