MongoDB 2.6 is now available. Key features include aggregation
enhancements, text-search integration, query-engine improvements, a new
write-operation protocol, and security enhancements.

MMS 1.4, which includes On-Prem Backup in addition to Monitoring, is
now also available. See `MMS 1.4 documentation
<https://mms.mongodb.com/help-hosted/v1.4/>`_ and the `MMS 1.4 release
notes <https://mms.mongodb.com/help-hosted/v1.4/management/changelog/>`_
for more information.

Major Changes
-------------

The following changes in MongoDB affect both the standard and Enterprise
editions:

.. _rn-2.6-aggregation-cursor:

Aggregation Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregation pipeline adds the ability to return result sets of any
size, either by returning a cursor or writing the output to
a collection. Additionally, the aggregation pipeline supports
variables and adds new operations to handle sets and redact data.

- The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` now returns a cursor, which
  enables the aggregation pipeline to return result sets of any size.

- Aggregation pipelines now support an ``explain`` operation to aid
  analysis of aggregation operations.

- Aggregation can now use a more efficient external-disk-based sorting
  process.

- New pipeline stages:

  - :pipeline:`$out` stage to output to a collection.

  - :pipeline:`$redact` stage to allow additional control to accessing
    the data.

- New or modified operators:

  - :doc:`set expression operators
    </reference/operator/aggregation-set>`.

  - :expression:`$let` and :expression:`$map` operators to allow for
    the use of variables.

  - :expression:`$literal` operator and :expression:`$size` operator.

  - :expression:`$cond` expression now accepts either an object or
    an array.

.. _rel-notes-text-query-operator:

Text Search Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text search is now enabled by default, and the query system, including
the aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$match` stage, includes the
:query:`$text` operator, which resolves text-search queries.

MongoDB 2.6 includes an updated :doc:`text index
</core/index-text>` format and deprecates the :dbcommand:`text`
command.

.. _rel-notes-data-modification:

Insert and Update Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements to the update and insert systems include additional
operations and improvements that increase consistency of modified
data.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-update-field-order.rst
     :start-after: order-of-document-fields
     :end-before: .. versionchanged

- New or enhanced update operators:

  - :update:`$bit` operator supports bitwise ``xor`` operation.

  - :update:`$min` and :update:`$max` operators that perform
    conditional update depending on the relative size of the specified
    value and the current value of a field.

  - :update:`$push` operator has enhanced support for the
    :update:`$sort`, :update:`$slice`, and :update:`$each` modifiers
    and supports a new :update:`$position` modifier.

  - :update:`$currentDate` operator to set the value of a field to the
    current date.

- The :update:`$mul` operator for multiplicative increments for insert
  and update operations.

.. seealso:: :ref:`update-operations-incompatibility`

.. _rel-notes-write-operations:

New Write Operation Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new write protocol integrates write operations with
write concerns. The protocol also provides improved
support for bulk operations.

MongoDB 2.6 adds the write commands :dbcommand:`insert`,
:dbcommand:`update`, and :dbcommand:`delete`, which provide the basis
for the improved bulk insert. All officially supported MongoDB drivers
support the new write commands.

The :program:`mongo` shell now includes
methods to perform bulk-write operations. See :method:`Bulk()` for
more information.

.. seealso:: :ref:`write-methods-incompatibility`

MSI Package for MongoDB Available for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB now distributes MSI packages for Microsoft Windows. This is the
recommended method for MongoDB installation under Windows.

.. _2.6-relnotes-security:

Security Improvements
---------------------

MongoDB 2.6 enhances support for secure deployments through improved SSL
support, x.509-based authentication, an improved authorization system
with more granular controls, as well as centralized credential storage, and
improved user management tools.

Specifically these changes include:

- A new :ref:`authorization model <authorization>` that provides the
  ability to create custom :ref:`user-defined-roles` and the ability to
  specify user privileges at a collection-level granularity.

- Global user management, which stores all user and
  user-defined role data in the ``admin`` database and provides a new
  set of commands for managing users and roles.

- :doc:`x.509 certificate authentication </tutorial/configure-x509>`
  for client authentication as well as for internal authentication of
  sharded and/or replica set cluster members. x.509 authentication is
  only available for deployments using SSL.

- Enhanced SSL Support:

  - :doc:`Rolling upgrades of clusters
    </tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl>` to use SSL.

  - :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl` support connections to
    :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using SSL
    connections.

  - :ref:`Prompt for passphrase <ssl-certificate-password>`
    by :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` at startup.

  - Require the use of strong SSL ciphers, with a minimum 128-bit key
    length for all connections. The strong-cipher requirement prevents
    an old or malicious client from forcing use of a weak cipher.

- MongoDB disables the http interface by default, limiting
  :doc:`network exposure </core/security-network>`. To enable the
  interface, see :setting:`httpinterface`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`authentication-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`ssl-hostname-validation`,
   and :doc:`/administration/security-checklist`.

Query Engine Improvements
-------------------------

- MongoDB can now use :doc:`index intersection
  </core/index-intersection>` to fulfill queries supported by more
  than one index.

- :ref:`index-filters` to limit which indexes can become the winning
  plan for a query.

- :doc:`/reference/method/js-plan-cache` methods to view and clear the
  :doc:`query plans </core/query-plans>` cached by the query optimizer.

- MongoDB can now use :method:`~cursor.count()` with
  :method:`~cursor.hint()`. See :method:`~cursor.count()` for details.

Improvements
------------

Geospatial Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`2dsphere indexes version 2
  <2dsphere-v2>`.

- Support for :ref:`geojson-multipoint`,
  :ref:`geojson-multilinestring`, :ref:`geojson-multipolygon`, and
  :ref:`geojson-geometrycollection`.

- Support for geospatial query clauses in :query:`$or` expressions.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`2.6-2dsphere-version-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-geo-maxDistance-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-uniqueDocs-incompatibility`,
   :ref:`2.6-geospatial-validation-incompatibility`

Index Build Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`Background index build
  <index-creation-building-indexes-on-secondaries>` allowed on
  secondaries. If you initiate a background index build on a
  :term:`primary`, the secondaries will replicate the index build in
  the background.

- Automatic rebuild of interrupted index builds after a restart.

  - If a standalone or a primary instance terminates during an index
    build *without a clean shutdown*, :program:`mongod` now restarts
    the index build when the instance restarts. If the instance shuts
    down cleanly or if a user kills the index build, the interrupted
    index builds do not automatically restart upon the restart of the
    server.

  - If a secondary instance terminates during an index build, the
    :program:`mongod` instance will now restart the interrupted index
    build when the instance restarts.

  To disable this behavior, use the :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry`
  command-line option.

- :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` now wraps a new
  :dbcommand:`createIndex` command.

- The ``dropDups`` option to :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()`
  and :dbcommand:`createIndex` is deprecated.

.. seealso:: :ref:`2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility`

Enhanced Sharding and Replication Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command to remove :term:`orphaned
  documents <orphaned document>` from a shard.

- New :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` command to combine contiguous chunks
  located on a single shard. See :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` and
  :doc:`/tutorial/merge-chunks-in-sharded-cluster`.

- New :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` and
  :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` methods to provide a
  formatted report of the status of a replica set from the perspective
  of the primary and the secondary, respectively.

Operational Changes
-------------------

Storage
~~~~~~~

:collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` is now the default allocation strategy for
all new collections. The new allocation strategy uses more storage
relative to total document size but results in lower levels of
storage fragmentation and more predictable storage capacity planning
over time.

To use the previous *exact-fit allocation strategy*:

- For a specific collection, use :dbcommand:`collMod` with
  :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` set to ``false``.

- For all new collections on an entire :program:`mongod` instance,
  set :parameter:`newCollectionsUsePowerOf2Sizes` to ``false``.

See :doc:`/core/storage` for more information about MongoDB's storage system.

Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed upward limit for the :setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections` for :program:`mongod`
  and :program:`mongos`. Previous versions capped the maximum possible
  :setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections` setting at ``20,000`` connections.

- Connection pools for a :program:`mongos` instance may be used by multiple
  MongoDB servers. This can reduce the number of connections needed
  for high-volume workloads and reduce resource consumption in
  sharded clusters.

- The C++ driver now monitors :term:`replica set` health with the
  :dbcommand:`isMaster` command instead of
  :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`. This allows the C++ driver to support
  systems that require authentication.

- New :method:`cursor.maxTimeMS()` and corresponding ``maxTimeMS``
  option for commands to specify a time limit.

Tool Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :program:`mongo` shell supports a global :ref:`/etc/mongorc.js
  <mongo-global-mongorc-file>`.

- All MongoDB :doc:`executable files </reference/program>` now support
  the ``--quiet`` option to suppress all logging output except for
  error messages.

- :program:`mongoimport` uses the input filename, without the file
  extension if any, as the collection name if run without the ``-c`` or
  ``--collection`` specification.

- :program:`mongoexport` can now constrain export data using
  :option:`--skip` and :option:`--limit`, as well as order the documents
  in an export using the :option:`--sort` option.

- :program:`mongostat` can support the use of :option:`--rowcount`
  (:option:`-n`) with the :option:`--discover` option to produce the
  specified number of output lines.

- Add strict mode representation for :bsontype:`data_numberlong` for
  use by :program:`mongoexport` and :program:`mongoimport`.

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

The following changes are specific to MongoDB Enterprise Editions:

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`MongoDB Enterprise for Windows
</tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows>` is now available. It
includes support for Kerberos, SSL, and SNMP.

.. include:: /includes/admonition-mongodb-enterprise-windows-ldap.rst

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows includes OpenSSL version 1.0.1g.

Auditing
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise adds :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` capability for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. See :ref:`auditing`
for details.

.. _relnotes-ldap-authentication:

LDAP Support for Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise provides support for proxy authentication of users.
This allows administrators to configure a MongoDB cluster to
authenticate users by proxying authentication requests
to a specified Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service.
See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication` for details.

.. include:: /includes/admonition-mongodb-enterprise-windows-ldap.rst

MongoDB does **not** support LDAP authentication in mixed sharded
cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4 and version 2.6
shards. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for upgrade instructions.

Expanded SNMP Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise has greatly expanded its SNMP support to provide
SNMP access to nearly the full range of metrics provided by
:method:`db.serverStatus()`.
