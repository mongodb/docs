To select the MongoDB version for your cluster, use the
dropdown in the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section
of the cluster form:

You can upgrade an existing |service| cluster to a newer major
MongoDB version, if available, when you 
:ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you 
cannot downgrade a cluster's MongoDB version.

.. important::

   If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
   that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
   cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that
   version unless you delete the custom role.

If you select :guilabel:`Latest Release`, |service| uses the most
recent MongoDB release for your {+cluster+}. |service| also 
upgrades your {+cluster+} to new major and rapid version releases 
via a rolling process to maintain {+cluster+} availability
as each release becomes available.

You can select :guilabel:`Latest Release` only if your {+cluster+} is
running the most recent major release of MongoDB.

.. note::

   Until MongoDB 5.1 is released, you can upgrade your {+cluster+}s to 
   :guilabel:`Latest Release` if they run MongoDB 4.4 or 5.0. When
   MongoDB 5.1 is released, you will be able to upgrade your
   {+cluster+}s to :guilabel:`Latest Release` only if they run MongoDB
   5.0.

To learn more about MongoDB versions, see :manual:`MongoDB Versioning
</reference/versioning>` in the MongoDB Manual.
