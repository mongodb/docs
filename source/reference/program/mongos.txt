Synopsis
--------

For a :doc:`sharded cluster </sharding>`, the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances provide the interface between the client applications and the
sharded cluster. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances route queries and
write operations to the shards. From the perspective of the
application, a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance behaves identically to
any other MongoDB instance.

Core Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. program:: mongos

.. option:: --help, -h

   Returns information on the options and use of :program:`mongos`.


.. option:: --version

   Returns the :program:`mongos` release number.


.. option:: --config <filename>, -f <filename>

   Specifies a configuration file for runtime configuration options. The
   configuration file is the preferred method for runtime configuration of
   :program:`mongos`. The options are equivalent to the command-line
   configuration options. See :doc:`/reference/configuration-options` for
   more information.
   
   Ensure the configuration file uses ASCII encoding. The :program:`mongos`
   instance does not support configuration files with non-ASCII encoding,
   including UTF-8.


.. option:: --configExpand <none|rest|exec>

   *Default*: none

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Enables using :ref:`Expansion Directives <externally-sourced-values>`
   in configuration files. Expansion directives allow you to set
   externally sourced values for configuration file options. 
   
   :option:`--configExpand` supports the following expansion directives:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``none``
   
        - Default. :program:`mongos` does not expand expansion directives. 
          :program:`mongos` fails to start if any configuration file settings 
          use expansion directives.
   
      * - ``rest``
   
        - :program:`mongos` expands ``__rest`` expansion directives when 
          parsing the configuration file. 
   
      * - ``exec``
   
        - :program:`mongos` expands ``__exec`` expansion directives when
          parsing the configuration file.
   
   You can specify multiple expansion directives as a comma-separated
   list, e.g. ``rest, exec``. If the configuration file contains
   expansion directives not specified to :option:`--configExpand`, the :program:`mongos`
   returns an error and terminates.
   
   See :ref:`externally-sourced-values` for configuration files
   for more information on expansion directives.


.. option:: --verbose, -v

   Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on standard output
   or in log files. Increase the verbosity with the ``-v`` form by
   including the option multiple times, (e.g. ``-vvvvv``.)
   


.. option:: --quiet

   Runs :program:`mongos` in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount
   of output.

   This option suppresses:
   
   - output from :term:`database commands <database command>`
   
   - replication activity
   
   - connection accepted events
   
   - connection closed events


.. option:: --port <port>

   *Default*: 27017

   The TCP port on which the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance listens for
   client connections.  
   


.. option:: --bind_ip <hostnames|ipaddresses|Unix domain socket paths>

   *Default*: localhost

   
   .. note::
   
      Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :program:`mongos` bind to localhost
      by default. See :ref:`3.6-bind-to-localhost`.
   
   The hostnames and/or IP addresses and/or full Unix domain socket
   paths on which :program:`mongos` should listen for client connections. You
   may attach :program:`mongos` to any interface. To bind to multiple
   addresses, enter a list of comma-separated values.
   
   .. example:: ``localhost,/tmp/mongod.sock``
   
   You can specify both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or hostnames that
   resolve to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
   
   .. example:: ``localhost, 2001:0DB8:e132:ba26:0d5c:2774:e7f9:d513``
   
   .. note::
   
      If specifying an IPv6 address *or* a hostname that resolves to an
      IPv6 address to :option:`--bind_ip`, you must start :program:`mongos` with 
      :option:`--ipv6` to enable IPv6 support. Specifying an IPv6 address
      to :option:`--bind_ip` does not enable IPv6 support.
   
   If specifying a 
   `link-local IPv6 address <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Link-local_address&oldid=880793020#IPv6>`_ 
   (``fe80::/10``), you must append the 
   `zone index <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPv6_address&oldid=877601778#Scoped_literal_IPv6_addresses>`_
   to that address (i.e. ``fe80::<address>%<adapter-name>``). 
   
   .. example:: ``localhost,fe80::a00:27ff:fee0:1fcf%enp0s3``
   
   .. include:: /includes/tip-hostnames.rst
   
   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst
   
   For more information about IP Binding, refer to the
   :doc:`/core/security-mongodb-configuration` documentation.

   To bind to all IPv4 addresses, enter ``0.0.0.0``.
   
   To bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, enter ``::,0.0.0.0`` or
   starting in MongoDB 4.2, an asterisk ``"*"`` (enclose the asterisk in
   quotes to avoid filename pattern expansion). Alternatively, use the
   :setting:`net.bindIpAll` setting.
   
   .. note::
   
      - ``--bind_ip`` and ``--bind_ip_all`` are mutually exclusive.
        Specifying both options causes :program:`mongos` to throw an error and
        terminate.
   
      - The command-line option ``--bind`` overrides the configuration
        file setting :setting:`net.bindIp`.


.. option:: --bind_ip_all

   
   .. versionadded:: 3.6
   
   If specified, the :program:`mongos` instance binds to all IPv4
   addresses (i.e. ``0.0.0.0``). If :program:`mongos` starts with
   :option:`--ipv6`, :option:`--bind_ip_all` also binds to all IPv6 addresses
   (i.e. ``::``). 
   
   :program:`mongos` only supports IPv6 if started with :option:`--ipv6`. Specifying
   :option:`--bind_ip_all` alone does not enable IPv6 support.
   
   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst
   
   For more information about IP Binding, refer to the
   :doc:`/core/security-mongodb-configuration` documentation.

   
   Alternatively, you can set the ``--bind_ip`` option to ``::,0.0.0.0``
   or, starting in MongoDB 4.2, to an asterisk ``"*"`` (enclose the
   asterisk in quotes to avoid filename pattern expansion).
   
   .. note::
   
      ``--bind_ip`` and ``--bind_ip_all`` are mutually exclusive. That
      is, you can specify one or the other, but not both.
   


.. option:: --maxConns <number>

   The maximum number of simultaneous connections that :program:`mongos` will
   accept. This setting has no effect if it is higher than your operating
   system's configured maximum connection tracking threshold.
   
   Do not assign too low of a value to this option, or you will
   encounter errors during normal application operation.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-maxconns-mongos.rst


.. option:: --syslog

   Sends all logging output to the host's :term:`syslog` system rather
   than to standard output or to a log file (:option:`--logpath`).
   
   The :option:`--syslog` option is not supported on Windows.
   
   .. warning::
   
      The ``syslog`` daemon generates timestamps when it logs a message, not
      when MongoDB issues the message. This can lead to misleading timestamps
      for log entries, especially when the system is under heavy load. We
      recommend using the :option:`--logpath` option for production systems to
      ensure accurate timestamps.
   
   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB includes the :ref:`component
   <log-message-components>` in its log messages to ``syslog``.
   
   .. code-block:: none
   
      ...  ACCESS   [repl writer worker 5] Unsupported modification to roles collection ...


.. option:: --syslogFacility <string>

   *Default*: user

   Specifies the facility level used when logging messages to syslog.
   The value you specify must be supported by your
   operating system's implementation of syslog. To use this option, you
   must  enable the :option:`--syslog` option.


.. option:: --logpath <path>

   Sends all diagnostic logging information to a log file instead of to
   standard output or to the host's :term:`syslog` system. MongoDB creates
   the log file at the path you specify.
   
   By default, MongoDB will move any existing log file rather than overwrite
   it. To instead append to the log file, set the :option:`--logappend` option.
   


.. option:: --logappend

   Appends new entries to the end of the existing log file when the :program:`mongos`
   instance restarts. Without this option, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will back up the
   existing log and create a new file.


.. option:: --redactClientLogData

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   A :program:`mongos` running with :option:`--redactClientLogData` redacts any message accompanying a given
   log event before logging. This prevents the :program:`mongos` from writing
   potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
   Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
   names are still visible in the logs.
   
   Use :option:`--redactClientLogData` in conjunction with
   :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest` and
   :doc:`/core/security-transport-encryption` to assist compliance with
   regulatory requirements.
   
   For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII) in one or more collections. The :program:`mongos` logs events
   such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
   possible that the :program:`mongos` may expose PII as a part of these logging
   operations. A :program:`mongos` running with :option:`--redactClientLogData` removes any message
   accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
   removing the PII.
   
   Diagnostics on a :program:`mongos` running with :option:`--redactClientLogData` may be more difficult
   due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
   :ref:`process logging <monitoring-log-redaction>` manual page for an
   example of the effect of :option:`--redactClientLogData` on log output.
   
   On a running :program:`mongos`, use :dbcommand:`setParameter` with the
   :parameter:`redactClientLogData` parameter to configure this setting.


.. option:: --timeStampFormat <string>

   *Default*: iso8601-local

   The time format for timestamps in log messages. Specify one of the
   following values:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``ctime``
   
        - Displays timestamps as ``Wed Dec 31
          18:17:54.811``.
   
      * - ``iso8601-utc``
   
        - Displays timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the
          ISO-8601 format. For example, for New York at the start of the
          Epoch: ``1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z``
   
      * - ``iso8601-local``
   
        - Displays timestamps in local time in the ISO-8601
          format. For example, for New York at the start of the Epoch:
          ``1969-12-31T19:00:00.000-0500``
   


.. option:: --pidfilepath <path>

   Specifies a file location to store the process ID (PID) of the :program:`mongos`
   process . The user running the ``mongod`` or ``mongos``
   process must be able to write to this path. If the :option:`--pidfilepath` option is not
   specified, the process does not create a PID file. This option is generally
   only useful in combination with the :option:`--fork` option.
   
   .. admonition:: Linux
      :class: note
   
      On Linux, PID file management is generally the responsibility of
      your distro's init system: usually a service file in the ``/etc/init.d``
      directory, or a systemd unit file registered with ``systemctl``. Only
      use the :option:`--pidfilepath` option if you are not using one of these init
      systems. For more information, please see the respective
      :doc:`Installation Guide </installation>` for your operating system.
   
   .. admonition:: macOS
      :class: note
   
      On macOS, PID file management is generally handled by ``brew``. Only use
      the :option:`--pidfilepath` option if you are not using ``brew`` on your macOS system. 
      For more information, please see the respective
      :doc:`Installation Guide </installation>` for your operating system.


.. option:: --keyFile <file>

   Specifies the path to a key file that stores the shared secret
   that MongoDB instances use to authenticate to each other in a
   :term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set`. :option:`--keyFile` implies
   ``client authorization``. See :ref:`inter-process-auth` for more
   information.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-keyfile-fmt.rst


.. option:: --setParameter <options>

   Specifies one of the MongoDB parameters described in
   :doc:`/reference/parameters`. You can specify multiple ``setParameter``
   fields.
   


.. option:: --nounixsocket

   Disables listening on the UNIX domain socket. :option:`--nounixsocket` applies only
   to Unix-based systems.

   The :program:`mongos` process
   always listens on the UNIX socket unless one of the following is true:
   
   - :option:`--nounixsocket` is set
   
   - :setting:`net.bindIp` is not set
   
   - :setting:`net.bindIp` does not specify ``localhost`` or its associated IP address
   
   .. |mongodb-package| replace:: :program:`mongos`
   
   .. include:: /includes/note-deb-and-rpm-default-to-localhost.rst


.. option:: --unixSocketPrefix <path>

   *Default*: /tmp

   The path for the UNIX socket. :option:`--unixSocketPrefix` applies only
   to Unix-based systems.
   
   If this option has no value, the
   :program:`mongos` process creates a socket with ``/tmp`` as a prefix. MongoDB
   creates and listens on a UNIX socket unless one of the following is true:
   
   - :setting:`net.unixDomainSocket.enabled` is ``false``
   
   - :option:`--nounixsocket` is set
   
   - :setting:`net.bindIp` is not set
   
   - :setting:`net.bindIp` does not specify ``localhost`` or its associated IP address


.. option:: --filePermissions <path>

   *Default*: ``0700``

   Sets the permission for the UNIX domain socket file.
   
   :option:`--filePermissions` applies only to Unix-based systems.


.. option:: --fork

   Enables a :term:`daemon` mode that runs the :program:`mongos` process in the
   background. By default :program:`mongos` does not run as a daemon:
   typically you will run :program:`mongos` as a daemon, either by using
   :option:`--fork` or by using a controlling process that handles the
   daemonization process (e.g. as with ``upstart`` and ``systemd``).

   Using the :option:`--fork` option requires that you configure log
   output for the :program:`mongos` with one of the following:

   - :option:`--logpath`
   - :option:`--syslog`

   The :option:`--fork` option is not supported on Windows.


.. option:: --transitionToAuth

   .. versionadded:: 3.4
   
      Allows the :program:`mongos` to accept and create authenticated and
      non-authenticated connections to and from other :binary:`~bin.mongod`
      and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the deployment. Used for
      performing rolling transition of replica sets or sharded clusters
      from a no-auth configuration to :ref:`internal authentication
      <inter-process-auth>`. Requires specifying a :ref:`internal
      authentication <inter-process-auth>` mechanism such as
      :option:`--keyFile`.
   
   For example, if using :ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>` for
   :ref:`internal authentication <inter-process-auth>`, the :program:`mongos` creates
   an authenticated connection with any :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the security mechanisms do
   not match, the :program:`mongos` utilizes a non-authenticated connection instead.
   
   A :program:`mongos` running with :option:`--transitionToAuth` does not enforce :ref:`user access
   controls <authorization>`. Users may connect to your deployment without any
   access control checks and perform read, write, and administrative operations.
   
   .. note::
   
      A :program:`mongos` running with :ref:`internal authentication
      <inter-process-auth>` and *without* :option:`--transitionToAuth` requires clients to connect
      using :ref:`user access controls <authorization>`. Update clients to
      connect to the :program:`mongos` using the appropriate :ref:`user <users>`
      prior to restarting :program:`mongos` without :option:`--transitionToAuth`.


.. option:: --networkMessageCompressors <string>

   *Default*: snappy,zstd,zlib

   
   .. versionadded:: 3.4
   
   Specifies the default compressor(s) to use for
   communication between this :program:`mongos` instance and:
   
   - other members of the sharded cluster
   
   - a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   
   - drivers that support the ``OP_COMPRESSED`` message format.
   
   MongoDB supports the following compressors:
   
   - :term:`snappy`
   
   - :term:`zlib` (Available starting in MongoDB 3.6)
   
   - :term:`zstd` (Available  starting in MongoDB 4.2)
   
   **In versions 3.6 and 4.0**, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` enable network compression by default with
   ``snappy`` as the compressor.
   
   **Starting in version 4.2**, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances default to both ``snappy,zstd,zlib``
   compressors, in that order.
   
   To disable network compression, set the value to ``disabled``.
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-networkMessageCompressors.rst


.. option:: --serviceExecutor <string>

   *Default*: synchronous

   .. versionadded:: 3.6
   
   Determines the threading and execution model :program:`mongos` uses to
   execute client requests. The ``--serviceExecutor`` option accepts one
   of the following values:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``synchronous``
   
        - The :program:`mongos` uses synchronous networking and manages its
          networking thread pool on a per connection basis. Previous
          versions of MongoDB managed threads in this way.
   
      * - ``adaptive``
   
        - The :program:`mongos` uses the new experimental asynchronous
          networking mode with an adaptive thread pool which manages
          threads on a per request basis. This mode should have more
          consistent performance and use less resources when there are
          more inactive connections than database requests.


.. option:: --timeZoneInfo <path>

   .. include:: /includes/fact-timeZoneInfo.rst
   
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      wget https://downloads.mongodb.org/olson_tz_db/timezonedb-latest.zip
      unzip timezonedb-latest.zip
      mongos --timeZoneInfo timezonedb-2017b/
   


.. option:: --outputConfig

   
   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Outputs the :program:`mongos` instance's configuration options, formatted
   in YAML, to ``stdout`` and exits the :program:`mongos` instance. For
   configuration options that uses :ref:`externally-sourced-values`,
   :option:`--outputConfig` returns the resolved value for those options.
   
   .. warning::
      
      This may include any configured passwords or secrets previously
      obfuscated through the external source.
   
   For usage examples, see:
      
   - :ref:`expansion-directive-output`
   
   - :doc:`/tutorial/convert-command-line-options-to-yaml`


Sharded Cluster Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: --configdb <replicasetName>/<config1>,<config2>...

   
   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
   
   Specifies the :ref:`configuration servers <sharding-config-server>` for the
   :term:`sharded cluster`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mirrored-config-servers-deprecated.rst
   
   Specify the config server replica set name and the hostname and port of
   at least one of the members of the config server replica set.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      sharding:
        configDB: <configReplSetName>/cfg1.example.net:27019, cfg2.example.net:27019,...
   
   The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances for the sharded cluster must specify
   the same config server replica set name but can specify hostname and
   port of different members of the replica set.


.. option:: --localThreshold

   *Default*: 15

   Specifies the ping time, in milliseconds, that :binary:`~bin.mongos` uses
   to determine which secondary replica set members to pass read
   operations from clients. The default value of ``15`` corresponds to
   the default value in all of the client :ecosystem:`drivers
   </drivers>`.
   
   When :binary:`~bin.mongos` receives a request that permits reads to
   :term:`secondary` members, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` will:
   
   - Find the member of the set with the lowest ping time.
   
   - Construct a list of replica set members that is within a ping time of
     15 milliseconds of the nearest suitable member of the set.
   
     If you specify a value for the :option:`--localThreshold` option, :binary:`~bin.mongos` will
     construct the list of replica members that are within the latency
     allowed by this value.
   
   - Select a member to read from at random from this list.
   
   The ping time used for a member compared by the :option:`--localThreshold` setting is a
   moving average of recent ping times, calculated at most every 10
   seconds. As a result, some queries may reach members above the threshold
   until the :binary:`~bin.mongos` recalculates the average.
   
   See the :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection`
   section of the :doc:`read preference </core/read-preference>`
   documentation for more information.


.. _mongos-tls-options:

TLS Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for full
   documentation of MongoDB's support.

.. option:: --tlsMode <mode>

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Enables TLS used for all network connections. The
   argument to the :option:`--tlsMode` option can be one of the following:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``disabled``
   
        - The server does not use TLS.
   
      * - ``allowTLS``
   
        - Connections between servers do not use TLS. For incoming
          connections, the server accepts both TLS and non-TLS.
   
      * - ``preferTLS``
   
        - Connections between servers use TLS. For incoming
          connections, the server accepts both TLS and non-TLS.
   
      * - ``requireTLS``
   
        - The server uses and accepts only TLS encrypted connections.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/tls-facts-ca-file.rst

.. option:: --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   .. note::
   
    Starting in 4.0, on macOS or Windows, you can use a certificate from
    the operating system's secure store instead of specifying a PEM file. See
    :option:`--tlsCertificateSelector`.
   
   Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the TLS certificate
   and key.
   
   - On Linux/BSD, you must specify :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile` when TLS is enabled.

.. option:: --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword <value>

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
   :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile`). Use the :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword` option only if the
   certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the :program:`mongos` will
   redact the password from all logging and reporting output.
   
   Starting in MongoDB 4.0:
   
   - On Linux/BSD, if the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and
     you do not specify the :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword` option, MongoDB will prompt for a
     passphrase. See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.
   
   - On macOS or Windows, if the private key in the PEM file is
     encrypted, you must explicitly specify the :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword` option.
     Alternatively, you can use a certificate from the secure system
     store (see :option:`--tlsCertificateSelector`) instead of a PEM file or use an
     unencrypted PEM file.

   Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
   from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
   :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.
   
   Starting in 4.0, on macOS or Windows, you can use a certificate from
   the operating system's secure store instead of a PEM key file. See
   :option:`--tlsCertificateSelector`. When using the secure store, you
   do not need to, but can, also specify the :option:`--tlsCAFile`.

.. option:: --tlsClusterCAFile <filename>

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
   from the Certificate Authority used to validate the certificate
   presented by a client establishing a connection. Specify the file
   name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.
   
   If :option:`--tlsClusterCAFile` does not specify the :file:`.pem` file for validating the
   certificate from a client establishing a connection, the cluster uses
   the :file:`.pem` file specified in the :option:`--tlsCAFile` option.
   
   :option:`--tlsClusterCAFile` lets you use separate Certificate Authorities to verify the
   client to server and server to client portions of the TLS handshake.
   
   Starting in 4.0, on macOS or Windows, you can use a certificate from

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   For clients that do not present certificates, :program:`mongos` bypasses
   TLS/SSL certificate validation when establishing the connection.
   
   For clients that present a certificate, however, :program:`mongos` performs
   certificate validation using the root certificate chain specified by
   ``--tlsCAFile`` and reject clients with invalid certificates.
   
   Use the :option:`--tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates` option if you have a mixed deployment that includes
   clients that do not or cannot present certificates to the :program:`mongos`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/tls-facts-see-more.rst


.. option:: --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Bypasses the validation checks for TLS certificates on other
   servers in the cluster and allows the use of invalid certificates to
   connect.
   
   .. note::
   
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/tls-facts-x509-invalid-certificate.rst

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/tls-facts-see-more.rst


.. option:: --tlsAllowInvalidHostnames

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Disables the validation of the hostnames in TLS certificates,
   when connecting to other members of the replica set or sharded cluster
   for inter-process authentication. This allows :program:`mongos` to connect
   to other members if the hostnames in their certificates do not match
   their configured hostname.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/tls-facts-see-more.rst


.. option:: --tlsDisabledProtocols <protocol(s)>

   .. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   Prevents a MongoDB server running with TLS from accepting
   incoming connections that use a specific protocol or protocols. To
   specify multiple protocols, use a comma separated list of protocols.
    
   :option:`--tlsDisabledProtocols` recognizes the following protocols: ``TLS1_0``, ``TLS1_1``,
   ``TLS1_2``, and starting in version 4.0.4 (and 3.6.9), ``TLS1_3``.
   
   - On macOS, you cannot disable ``TLS1_1`` and leave both ``TLS1_0`` and
     ``TLS1_2`` enabled. You must disable at least one of the other
     two, for example, ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.
   
   - To list multiple protocols, specify as a comma separated list of
     protocols. For example ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.
   
   - Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the server from
     starting.
   
   - The specified disabled protocols overrides any default disabled
     protocols.
   
   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB disables the use of TLS 1.0 if TLS
   1.1+ is available on the system. To enable the disabled TLS 1.0,
   specify ``none`` to :option:`--tlsDisabledProtocols`. See :ref:`4.0-disable-tls`.
   
   Members of replica sets and sharded clusters must speak at least one
   protocol in common.

SSL Options (Deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   All SSL options are deprecated since 4.2. Use the TLS counterparts
   instead, as they have identical functionality to the SSL options.  The SSL
   protocol is deprecated and MongoDB supports TLS 1.0 and later.

.. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for full
   documentation of MongoDB's support.

.. option:: --sslOnNormalPorts

   .. deprecated:: 2.6 Use :option:`--tlsMode requireTLS <--tlsMode>` instead.
   
   Enables TLS/SSL for :program:`mongos`.
   
   With :option:`--sslOnNormalPorts`, a :program:`mongos` requires TLS/SSL encryption for all
   connections on the default MongoDB port, or the port specified by
   :option:`--port`. By default, :option:`--sslOnNormalPorts` is
   disabled.

   argument to the :option:`--sslMode` option can be one of the following:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``disabled``
   
        - The server does not use TLS/SSL.
   
      * - ``allowSSL``
   
        - Connections between servers do not use TLS/SSL. For incoming
          connections, the server accepts both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL.
   
      * - ``preferSSL``
   
        - Connections between servers use TLS/SSL. For incoming
          connections, the server accepts both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL.
   
      * - ``requireSSL``
   
        - The server uses and accepts only TLS/SSL encrypted connections.

     two, for example, ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.
   
   - To list multiple protocols, specify as a comma separated list of
     protocols. For example ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.
   
   - Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the server from
     starting.
   
   - The specified disabled protocols overrides any default disabled
     protocols.
   
   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB disables the use of TLS 1.0 if TLS
   1.1+ is available on the system. To enable the disabled TLS 1.0,
   specify ``none`` to :option:`--sslDisabledProtocols`. See :ref:`4.0-disable-tls`.
   
   Members of replica sets and sharded clusters must speak at least one
   protocol in common.
   
   .. seealso:: :ref:`ssl-disallow-protocols`


.. option:: --sslFIPSMode

   .. deprecated:: 4.2 Use :option:`--tlsFIPSMode <mongos --tlsFIPSMode>` instead.
   
   Directs the :program:`mongos` to use the FIPS mode of the  TLS/SSL
   library. Your system must have a FIPS
   compliant library to use the :option:`--sslFIPSMode` option.

Audit Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: --auditDestination

   
   Enables :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` and specifies where
   :program:`mongos` sends all audit events.

   :option:`--auditDestination` can have one of the following values:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 50
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``syslog``
   
        - Output the audit events to syslog in JSON format. Not available on
          Windows. Audit messages have a syslog severity level of ``info``
          and a facility level of ``user``.
   
          The syslog message limit can result in the truncation of
          audit messages. The auditing system will neither detect the
          truncation nor error upon its occurrence.
   
      * - ``console``
   
        - Output the audit events to ``stdout`` in JSON format.
   
      * - ``file``
   
        - Output the audit events to the file specified in
          :option:`--auditPath` in the format specified in
          :option:`--auditFormat`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/note-audit-in-enterprise-only.rst


.. option:: --auditFormat

   Specifies the format of the output file for :doc:`auditing
   </core/auditing>` if :option:`--auditDestination` is ``file``. The
   :option:`--auditFormat` option can have one of the following values:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 50
   
      * - Value
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``JSON``
   
        - Output the audit events in JSON format to the file specified
          in :option:`--auditPath`.
   
      * - ``BSON``
   
        - Output the audit events in BSON binary format to the file
          specified in :option:`--auditPath`.
   
   Printing audit events to a file in JSON format degrades server
   performance more than printing to a file in BSON format.
   
   .. include:: /includes/note-audit-in-enterprise-only.rst


.. option:: --auditPath

   Specifies the output file for :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` if
   :option:`--auditDestination` has value of ``file``. The :option:`--auditPath`
   option can take either a full path name or a relative path name.
   
   .. include:: /includes/note-audit-in-enterprise-only.rst


.. option:: --auditFilter

   Specifies the filter to limit the :ref:`types of operations
   <audit-action-details-results>` the :doc:`audit system
   </core/auditing>` records. The option takes a string representation
   of a query document of the form:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      { <field1>: <expression1>, ... }
   
   The ``<field>`` can be :doc:`any field in the audit message
   </reference/audit-message>`, including fields returned in the
   :ref:`param <audit-action-details-results>` document. The
   ``<expression>`` is a :ref:`query condition expression
   <query-selectors>`.

Profiler Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.0

.. option:: --slowms <integer>

   *Default*: 100

   
   The *slow* operation time threshold, in milliseconds. Operations
   that run for longer than this threshold are considered *slow*.
   
   When :setting:`~param.logLevel` is set to ``0``, MongoDB records *slow*
   operations to the diagnostic log at a rate determined by
   :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpSampleRate`.
   
   At higher :setting:`~param.logLevel` settings, all operations appear
   in the diagnostic log regardless of their latency.
   
   For :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances,  affects the diagnostic
   log only and not the profiler since profiling is not available on
   :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
   
   .. versionadded:: 4.0


.. option:: --slowOpSampleRate <double>

   *Default*: 1.0

   The fraction of *slow* operations that should be logged.
   :option:`--slowOpSampleRate` accepts values between 0 and 1, inclusive.

   For :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, :option:`--slowOpSampleRate` affects the diagnostic log
   only and not the profiler since profiling is not available on
   :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
   
   .. versionadded:: 4.0


LDAP Authentication and Authorization Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: --ldapServers <host1>:<port>,<host2>:<port>,...,<hostN>:<port>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   The LDAP server against which the :program:`mongos` authenticates users or
   determines what actions a user is authorized to perform on a given
   database. If the LDAP server specified has any replicated instances,
   you may specify the host and port of each replicated server in a
   comma-delimited list.
   
   If your LDAP infrastructure partitions the LDAP directory over multiple LDAP
   servers, specify *one* LDAP server or any of its replicated instances to
   :option:`--ldapServers`. MongoDB supports following LDAP referrals as defined in `RFC 4511
   4.1.10 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt>`_. Do not use :option:`--ldapServers`
   for listing every LDAP server in your infrastructure.
   
   This setting can be configured on a running :program:`mongos` using
   :dbcommand:`setParameter`.
   
   If unset, :program:`mongos` cannot use :doc:`LDAP authentication or authorization
   </core/security-ldap>`.

.. option:: --ldapValidateLDAPServerConfig <boolean>

   *Available in MongoDB Enterprise*

   A flag that determines if the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance checks
   the availability of the :option:`LDAP server(s)
   <mongos --ldapServers>` as part of its startup:

   - If ``true``, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance performs the
     availability check and only continues to start up if the LDAP
     server is available.

   - If ``false``, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance skips the
     availability check; i.e. the instance starts up even if the LDAP
     server is unavailable.
   
.. option:: --ldapQueryUser <string>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   The identity with which :program:`mongos` binds as, when connecting to or
   performing queries on an LDAP server.
   
   Only required if any of the following are true:
   
   - Using :ref:`LDAP authorization <security-ldap-external>`.
   - Using an LDAP query for :option:`username transformation <--ldapUserToDNMapping>`.
   - The LDAP server disallows anonymous binds
   
   You must use :option:`--ldapQueryUser` with :option:`--ldapQueryPassword`.
   
   If unset, :program:`mongos` will not attempt to bind to the LDAP server.
   
   This setting can be configured on a running :program:`mongos` using
   :dbcommand:`setParameter`.
   
   .. note::
   
      Windows MongoDB deployments can use :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults`
      instead of :option:`--ldapQueryUser` and :option:`--ldapQueryPassword`. You cannot specify
      both :option:`--ldapQueryUser` and :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults` at the same time.


.. option:: --ldapQueryPassword <string>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
     The password used to bind to an LDAP server when using
     :option:`--ldapQueryUser`. You must use :option:`--ldapQueryPassword` with
     :option:`--ldapQueryUser`.
   
   If unset, :program:`mongos` will not attempt to bind to the LDAP server.
   
   This setting can be configured on a running :program:`mongos` using
   :dbcommand:`setParameter`.
   
   .. note::
   
      Windows MongoDB deployments can use :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults`
      instead of :option:`--ldapQueryPassword` and :option:`--ldapQueryPassword`. You cannot specify
      both :option:`--ldapQueryPassword` and :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults` at the same time.


.. option:: --ldapBindWithOSDefaults <bool>

   *Default*: false

   .. versionadded:: 3.4
   
      Available in MongoDB Enterprise for the Windows platform only.
   
   Allows :program:`mongos` to authenticate, or bind, using your Windows login
   credentials when connecting to the LDAP server.
   
   Only required if:
   
   - Using :ref:`LDAP authorization <security-ldap-external>`.
   - Using an LDAP query for :option:`username transformation <--ldapUserToDNMapping>`.
   - The LDAP server disallows anonymous binds
   
   Use :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults` to replace :option:`--ldapQueryUser` and
   :option:`--ldapQueryPassword`.


.. option:: --ldapBindMethod <string>

   *Default*: simple

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   The method :program:`mongos` uses to authenticate to an LDAP server.
   Use with :option:`--ldapQueryUser` and :option:`--ldapQueryPassword` to
   connect to the LDAP server.
   
   :option:`--ldapBindMethod` supports the following values:
   
   * ``simple`` - :program:`mongos` uses simple authentication.
   
   * ``sasl`` - :program:`mongos` uses SASL protocol for authentication
   
   If you specify ``sasl``, you can configure the available SASL mechanisms
   using :option:`--ldapBindSaslMechanisms`. :program:`mongos` defaults to
   using ``DIGEST-MD5`` mechanism.


.. option:: --ldapBindSaslMechanisms <string>

   *Default*: DIGEST-MD5

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   A comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms :program:`mongos` can
   use when authenticating to the LDAP server. The :program:`mongos` and the
   LDAP server must agree on at least one mechanism. The :program:`mongos`
   dynamically loads any SASL mechanism libraries installed on the host
   machine at runtime.
   
   Install and configure the appropriate libraries for the selected
   SASL mechanism(s) on both the :program:`mongos` host and the remote
   LDAP server host. Your operating system may include certain SASL
   libraries by default. Defer to the documentation associated with each
   SASL mechanism for guidance on installation and configuration.
   
   If using the ``GSSAPI`` SASL mechanism for use with
   :ref:`security-kerberos`, verify the following for the
   :program:`mongos` host machine:
   
   ``Linux``
     - The ``KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`` environment
       variable resolves to the name of the client :ref:`keytab-files`
       for the host machine. For more on Kerberos environment
       variables, please defer to the
       `Kerberos documentation <https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.13/doc/admin/env_variables.html>`__.
     - The client keytab includes a
       :ref:`kerberos-user-principal` for the :program:`mongos` to use when
       connecting to the LDAP server and execute LDAP queries.
   
   ``Windows``
     If connecting to an Active Directory server, the Windows
     Kerberos configuration automatically generates a
     `Ticket-Granting-Ticket <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380510(v=vs.85).aspx>`__
     when the user logs onto the system. Set :option:`--ldapBindWithOSDefaults` to
     ``true`` to allow :program:`mongos` to use the generated credentials when
     connecting to the Active Directory server and execute queries.
   
   Set :option:`--ldapBindMethod` to ``sasl`` to use this option.
   
   .. note::
   
      For a complete list of SASL mechanisms see the
      `IANA listing
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml>`_.
      Defer to the documentation for your LDAP or Active Directory
      service for identifying the SASL mechanisms compatible with the
      service.
   
      MongoDB is not a source of SASL mechanism libraries, nor
      is the MongoDB documentation a definitive source for
      installing or configuring any given SASL mechanism. For
      documentation and support, defer to the SASL mechanism
      library vendor or owner.
   
      For more information on SASL, defer to the following resources:
   
      - For Linux, please see the `Cyrus SASL documentation <https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/>`__.
      - For Windows, please see the `Windows SASL documentation <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223500.aspx>`__.


.. option:: --ldapTransportSecurity <string>

   *Default*: tls

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   By default, :program:`mongos` creates a TLS/SSL secured connection to the LDAP
   server.
   
   For Linux deployments, you must configure the appropriate TLS Options in
   ``/etc/openldap/ldap.conf`` file. Your operating system's package manager
   creates this file as part of the MongoDB Enterprise installation, via the
   ``libldap`` dependency. See the documentation for ``TLS Options`` in the
   `ldap.conf OpenLDAP documentation
   <http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap.conf&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release>`_
   for more complete instructions.
   
   For Windows deployment, you must add the LDAP server CA certificates to the
   Windows certificate management tool. The exact name and functionality of the
   tool may vary depending on operating system version. Please see the
   documentation for your version of Windows for more information on
   certificate management.
   
   Set :option:`--ldapTransportSecurity` to ``none`` to disable TLS/SSL between :program:`mongos` and the LDAP
   server.
   
   .. warning::
   
      Setting :option:`--ldapTransportSecurity` to ``none`` transmits plaintext information and possibly
      credentials between :program:`mongos` and the LDAP server.


.. option:: --ldapTimeoutMS <long>

   *Default*: 10000

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   The amount of time in milliseconds :program:`mongos` should wait for an LDAP server
   to respond to a request.
   
   Increasing the value of :option:`--ldapTimeoutMS` may prevent connection failure between the
   MongoDB server and the LDAP server, if the source of the failure is a
   connection timeout. Decreasing the value of :option:`--ldapTimeoutMS` reduces the time
   MongoDB waits for a response from the LDAP server.
   
   This setting can be configured on a running :program:`mongos` using
   :dbcommand:`setParameter`.


.. option:: --ldapUserToDNMapping <string>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
   
   Maps the username provided to :program:`mongos` for authentication to a LDAP
   Distinguished Name (DN). You may need to use :option:`--ldapUserToDNMapping` to transform a
   username into an LDAP DN in the following scenarios:
   
   - Performing LDAP authentication with simple LDAP binding, where users
     authenticate to MongoDB with usernames that are not full LDAP DNs.
   
   - Using an :option:`LDAP authorization query template
     <mongod --ldapAuthzQueryTemplate>` that requires a DN.
   
   - Transforming the usernames of clients authenticating to Mongo DB using
     different authentication mechanisms (e.g. x.509, kerberos) to a full LDAP
     DN for authorization.
   
   :option:`--ldapUserToDNMapping` expects a quote-enclosed JSON-string representing an ordered array
   of documents. Each document contains a regular expression ``match`` and
   either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` template used for transforming the
   incoming username.
   
   Each document in the array has the following form:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      {
        match: "<regex>"
        substitution: "<LDAP DN>" | ldapQuery: "<LDAP Query>"
      }
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 10 70 20
   
      * - Field
        - Description
        - Example
   
      * - ``match``
        - An ECMAScript-formatted regular expression (regex) to match against a
          provided username. Each parenthesis-enclosed section represents a
          regex capture group used by ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery``.
        - ``"(.+)ENGINEERING"``
          ``"(.+)DBA"``
   
      * - ``substitution``
   
        - An LDAP distinguished name (DN) formatting template that converts the
          authentication name matched by the ``match`` regex into a LDAP DN.
          Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric value is replaced by the
          corresponding `regex capture group
          <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
          from the authentication username via the ``match`` regex.
          
          The result of the substitution must be an `RFC4514
          <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt>`_ escaped string.
   
        - ``"cn={0},ou=engineering,
          dc=example,dc=com"``
   
      * - ``ldapQuery``
   
        - A LDAP query formatting template that inserts the authentication
          name matched by the ``match`` regex into an LDAP query URI encoded
          respecting RFC4515 and RFC4516. Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric
          value is replaced by the corresponding `regex capture group
          <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
          from the authentication username via the ``match`` expression.
          :program:`mongos` executes the query against the LDAP server to retrieve
          the LDAP DN for the authenticated user. :program:`mongos` requires
          exactly one returned result for the transformation to be
          successful, or :program:`mongos` skips this transformation.
   
        - ``"ou=engineering,dc=example,
          dc=com??one?(user={0})"``
   
   .. note::
   
      An explanation of  `RFC4514 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt>`_,
      `RFC4515 <https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515>`_,
      `RFC4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_, or LDAP queries is out
      of scope for the MongoDB Documentation. Please review the RFC directly or
      use your preferred LDAP resource.
   
   For each document in the array, you must use either ``substitution`` or
   ``ldapQuery``. You *cannot* specify both in the same document.
   
   When performing authentication or authorization, :program:`mongos` steps through
   each document in the array in the given order, checking the authentication
   username against the ``match`` filter.  If a match is found,
   :program:`mongos` applies the transformation and uses the output for
   authenticating the user. :program:`mongos` does not check the remaining documents
   in the array.
   
   If the given document does not match the provided authentication name, or
   the transformation described by the document fails, :program:`mongos` continues
   through the list of documents to find additional matches. If no matches are
   found in any document, :program:`mongos` returns an error.
   
   .. example::
   
     The following shows two transformation documents. The first
     document matches against any string ending in ``@ENGINEERING``, placing
     anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group. The
     second document matches against any string ending in ``@DBA``, placing
     anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group.
   
     .. important::  You must pass the array to :option:`--ldapUserToDNMapping` as a string.
   
     .. code-block:: text
   
        "[
           {
              match: "(.+)@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM",
              substitution: "cn={0},ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
           },
           {
              match: "(.+)@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM",
              ldapQuery: "ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user={0})"
   
           }
   
        ]"
   
     A user with username ``alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the first
     document. The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string
     ``alice``. The resulting output is the DN
     ``"cn=alice,ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"``.
   
     A user with username ``bob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the second document.
     The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string ``bob``.  The
     resulting output is the LDAP query
     ``"ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user=bob)"``. :program:`mongos` executes this
     query against the LDAP server, returning the result
     ``"cn=bob,ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com"``.
   
   If :option:`--ldapUserToDNMapping` is unset, :program:`mongos` applies no transformations to the username
   when attempting to authenticate or authorize a user against the LDAP server.
   
   This setting can be configured on a running :program:`mongos` using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` database command.



Additional Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. this section will move into the top following the resolution of
   SERVER-12889

.. option:: --ipv6

   
   Enables IPv6 support. :program:`mongos` disables IPv6 support by default.
   
   Setting :option:`--ipv6` does *not* direct the :program:`mongos` to listen on any
   local IPv6 addresses or interfaces. To configure the :program:`mongos` to
   listen on an IPv6 interface, you must either:
   
   - Configure :option:`--bind_ip` with one or more IPv6 addresses or
     hostnames that resolve to IPv6 addresses, **or**
   - Set :option:`--bind_ip_all` to ``true``.
