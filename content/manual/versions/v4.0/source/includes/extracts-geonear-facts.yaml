   Returns an ordered stream of documents based on the proximity to a
   geospatial point. Incorporates the functionality of
   :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$sort`, and :pipeline:`$limit` for
   geospatial data. The output documents include an additional distance
   field and can include a location identifier field.

ref: geoNear-distance-calculation
content: |
   MongoDB calculates distances in meters if the specified (``near``)
   point is a GeoJSON point and in radians if the specified (``near``)

ref: geoNear-distance-calculation-spherical-field
content: |
   If ``true``, then MongoDB uses spherical geometry to calculate
   distances in meters if the specified (``near``) point is a GeoJSON
   point and in radians if the specified (``near``) point is a legacy
   coordinate pair.
