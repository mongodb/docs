   Shut down your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the |newversion| :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

   Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If you wish remote clients to connect to
   the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, you must specify ``--bind_ip`` (or
   the :setting:`net.bindIp` setting). For more information, see
   :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.

      This command must perform writes to an internal system

      successfully, you can safely retry the command as
      the operation is idempotent.
