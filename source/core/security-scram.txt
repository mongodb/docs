.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
   MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

   If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
   schema, you must upgrade to SCRAM **before** you upgrade to version
   4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
   :doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the
default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. SCRAM is based on the
IETF `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that
defines best practices for implementation of challenge-response
mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords.

Using SCRAM, MongoDB verifies the supplied user credentials against the
user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password
<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database
<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database
where the user was created, and together with the user's name, serves
to identify the user.

Features
--------

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM provides:

- A tunable work factor (``iterationCount``),

- Per-user random salts, and

- Authentication of the server to the client as well as the client to the
  server.

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM uses the SHA-1 hashing function.

Driver Support
--------------

To use SCRAM, you must upgrade your driver if your current driver
version does not support ``SCRAM``.

The minimum driver versions that support ``SCRAM`` are:
