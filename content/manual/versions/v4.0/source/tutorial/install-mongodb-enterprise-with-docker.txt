Install MongoDB Enterprise with Docker
======================================

.. important::

   The recommended solutions for using containers with MongoDB are:

   - For development and testing use the
     `MongoDB Community Docker container <https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/>`__.
   
   - For MongoDB Enterprise production installations use Kubernetes through the
     :opsmgr:`MongoDB Ops Manager </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`.

.. note::

   This procedure uses Docker's official `mongo image
   <https://github.com/docker-library/mongo>`__, which is supported by
   the Docker community and *not* MongoDB.

If the above recommended solutions do not satisfy your needs,
follow the steps in this tutorial to manually install 
:products:`MongoDB Enterprise </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>` with
Docker.

Considerations
--------------

A full description of `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`__ is beyond the scope
of this documentation. This page assumes prior knowledge of Docker.

This documentation only describes installing MongoDB Enterprise with Docker,
and does not replace other resources on Docker. We encourage you to thoroughly
familiarize yourself with Docker and its related subject matter before
installing MongoDB Enterprise with Docker.

.. important::

   This procedure uses Docker's official `mongo image
   <https://github.com/docker-library/mongo>`__, which is supported by
   the Docker community and *not* MongoDB. It supports only the major
   versions listed in their `repositiory
   <https://github.com/docker-library/mongo>`__, and only a specific
   minor version for each major version. The minor version can be found
   in the ``Dockerfile`` in the folder for each major version.

Create a Docker Image with MongoDB Enterprise
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-enterprise-with-docker.rst

Push the Image to Docker Hub
----------------------------

Optionally, you can push your Docker image to a remote repository, like Docker
Hub, to use the image on other host machines. If you push the image to Docker
Hub, you can then run ``docker pull`` for each host machine on
which you want to install MongoDB Enterprise via Docker. For complete guidance
on using ``docker pull``, reference its documentation
`here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#examples>`__.
