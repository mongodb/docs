  Open the ``<install-dir>/conf/conf-daemon.properties`` file and set the
  :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` value to the servers and ports hosting the
  |application| database. For example:
action:
  language: cfg
  code: |
    mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017,mongodb3.example.net:27017

  Additionally, ensure that the file system that holds the
  :setting:`rootDirectory` has sufficient space to accommodate the
  current snapshots of all backed up instances.
