     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Identifier`

       - 
         - In the first field, enter the database on which the user
           authenticates.

         - In the second field, enter a username.

         Together, the database and username uniquely identify the
         user. Though the user has just one authentication database,
         the user can have privileges on other databases. You grant
         those privileges when assigning the user roles.

         If you are authenticating with an external system, like
         Kerberos or an LDAP server, add users to the
         ``$external`` database.

     * - :guilabel:`Roles`

       - Enter any available user-defined roles and :manual:`built-in
         roles </reference/built-in-roles>` into the field. The field
         provides a drop-down list of existing roles when you click in this
         field.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - Enter the user's password.

         .. important::

            If you specified ``$external`` as the database in the
            :guilabel:`Identifier`, you do not need to specify a
            password for the new user.
