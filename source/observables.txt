Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access the results of MongoDB operations
from an ``Observable`` instance.

An ``Observable`` represents a stream of data emitted by an operation
over time. To access this data, you can create an ``Observer`` instance
that subscribes to the ``Observable``. 

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} is built upon the MongoDB Java Reactive Streams driver.
   The ``Observable`` class extends the ``Publisher`` class from Java Reactive
   Streams and includes additional convenience methods to help process results.

How to Process an Observable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a MongoDB operation and process its data, you must request
the operation results from an ``Observable``. The driver provides the
``Observable`` interface for operations that return any number of 
results. Operations that produce no results or one result, such as the
``findOne()`` method, return a ``SingleObservable[T]``. The ``[T]``
parameterization corresponds to the data type that the ``SingleObservable``
handles.

Operations that can produce an unbounded number of results return an instance of the
``Observable[T]`` type. Some operations return specific ``Observable`` types that
provide additional methods to filter and process results before subscribing to them.
The following list describes some types that allow you to chain operation-specific
methods to the ``Observable``:

- ``FindObservable[T]``: Returned by the ``find()`` method
- ``DistinctObservable[T]``: Returned by the ``distinct()`` method
- ``AggregateObservable[T]``: Returned by the ``aggregate()`` method

You can request operation results by calling the ``subscribe()`` method
on the operation's ``Observable``. Pass an instance of the ``Observer``
class as a parameter to the ``subscribe()`` method. This ``Observer`` receives
the operation results from the ``Observable``. Then, you can use methods
provided by the ``Observer`` class to print results, handle errors, and
perform additional data processing.

To learn more about processing results, see the following API documentation:

- `Observable <{+driver-api+}/Observable.html>`__
- `Subscription <{+driver-api+}/Subscription.html>`__
- `Observer <{+driver-api+}/Observer.html>`__

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your Scala application, create a ``MongoClient`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/observables.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _scala-observables-callbacks:

Use Callbacks to Process Results
--------------------------------

After subscribing to an ``Observable[T]``, you can use the following
callback methods provided by the ``Observer`` class to access operation results
or handle errors:

- ``onNext(result: TResult)``: Called when the ``Observer`` receives new results. You
  can define logic for processing results by overriding this method.

- ``onError(e: Throwable)``: Called when the operation generates an error and prevents
  the ``Observer`` from receiving more data from the ``Observable``. You can define
  error handling logic by overriding this method.

- ``onComplete()``: Called when the ``Observer`` has consumed all results from the 
  ``Observable``. You can perform any final data processing by overriding this method.

The following sections show how to customize these methods to process read and
write operation results from an ``Observable``.

Access Read Operation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access data retrieved by a read operation, create an ``Observable[T]``
to store the operation results. Then, subscribe to the observable and
override the ``Observer`` class callback methods to process the results.

This example queries the ``restaurants`` collection for documents
in which the ``cuisine`` value is ``"Czech"``. To retrieve
and process results, the example assigns a ``Observable[Document]``
to the operation and performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``subscribe()`` method to subscribe to the ``Observable``
  and passes an ``Observer`` as a parameter
- Overrides the ``onNext()`` method to print each retrieved document,
  which are ``Document`` instances
- Overrides the ``onError()`` method to print any errors
- Overrides the ``onComplete()`` methods to print a message after all
  the results from the ``Observable`` are processed

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/observables.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-read-observable
      :end-before: end-read-observable
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Iterable((_id, ...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='Koliba Restaurant'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='40812870'}))
      Iterable((_id, ...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='Bohemian Beer Garden'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='41485121'}))
      Iterable((_id,...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='Hospoda'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='41569184'}))
      Iterable((_id,...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='Olde Prague Tavern'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='41711983'}))
      Processed all results

Access Write Operation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access data retrieved by a write operation, create an ``Observable[T]``
to store the operation results. Then, subscribe to the observable and
override the ``Observer`` class callback methods to process the results.

This example inserts documents into the ``restaurants`` collection
in which the ``cuisine`` value is ``"Nepalese"``. To retrieve
and process results, the example assigns an ``Observable[InsertManyResult]``
to the operation and performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``subscribe()`` method to subscribe to the ``Observable``
  and passes an ``Observer`` as a parameter
- Overrides the ``onNext()`` method to print the result of the insert
  operation, returned as an ``InsertManyResult``
- Overrides the ``onError()`` method to print any errors
- Overrides the ``onComplete()`` methods to print a message after all
  the results from the ``Observable`` are processed

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/observables.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-write-observable
      :end-before: end-write-observable
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      AcknowledgedInsertManyResult{insertedIds={0=BsonObjectId{value=...},
      1=BsonObjectId{value=...}}}
      Processed all results

.. _scala-observables-lambda:

Use Lambda Functions to Process Results
---------------------------------------

Instead of explicitly overriding the callback functions from the
``Observer`` class, you can use lambda functions to concisely
process operation results. These functions allow you to use the
``=>`` arrow notation to customize the implementation of ``onNext()``,
``onError()``, and ``onComplete()``.

.. tip::

   To learn more about lambda functions, also known as anonymous
   functions, see the :wikipedia:`Anonymous function <w/index.php?title=Anonymous_function&oldid=1252038929>`
   Wikipedia entry.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example queries the ``restaurants`` collection for each
distinct value of the ``borough`` field. The code subscribes
to the ``Observable`` returned by the ``distinct()`` method, then
uses lambda functions to print results and handle errors:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/observables.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-lambda
      :end-before: end-lambda
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Missing
      Queens
      Staten Island
      Processed all results

.. _scala-observables-futures:

Use Futures to Retrieve All Results
-----------------------------------

You can subscribe to an ``Observable`` implicitly and aggregate its results
by calling the ``toFuture()`` method. When you call ``toFuture()`` on 
an ``Observable``, the driver performs the following actions:

- Subscribes to the ``Observable``
- Collects the items emitted by the ``Observable`` and stores them in a
  ``Future`` instance

Then, you can iterate through the ``Future`` to retrieve the operation
results.

.. important::

   If your ``Observable`` contains a large number of documents, calling
   the ``toFuture()`` method will consume significant memory. If you expect
   a large result set, consider using :ref:`callback <scala-observables-callbacks>`
   or :ref:`lambda <scala-observables-lambda>` functions to access results.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example queries the ``restaurants`` collection for documents
in which the value of the ``name`` field is ``"The Halal Guys"``.
To access the operation results, the code converts the ``Observable``
to a ``Future``, waits until the ``Future`` collects each result, and
iterates through the results:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/observables.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-to-future
      :end-before: end-to-future
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Iterable((_id,...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='The Halal Guys'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='50012258'}))
      Iterable((_id,...), ..., (name,BsonString{value='The Halal Guys'}),
      (restaurant_id,BsonString{value='50017823'}))
