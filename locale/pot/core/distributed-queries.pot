msgid "In :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, all write operations go to the set's :term:`primary`. The primary applies the write operation and records the operations on the primary's operation log or :term:`oplog`.

msgid "MongoDB partitions data in a sharded collection into *ranges* based on the values of the :term:`shard key`. Then, MongoDB distributes these chunks to shards. The shard key determines the distribution of chunks to shards. This can affect the performance of write operations in the cluster."
