      Supported Authentication Mechanisms
      -----------------------------------

      .. include:: /includes/fact-asql-driver-auth-mechanism.rst

      Prerequisites
      -------------

      - An |service| {+fdi+} or a {+MongoDB-Enterprise+} database.

      .. include:: includes/data-federation/fact-asql-recommended-mongodb-version

      - An application or BI tool that you want to connect to your 
        {+fdi+} with the JDBC driver.

      - The `MongoDB JDBC Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/jdbc-driver>`__.

      Procedure
      ---------

      You can use the JDBC driver to connect to SQL-based Java applications that accept
      a |jdbc| API, such as a `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ project.

      Download and Verify the JDBC Driver

Standalone Drivers
-------------------------

If you use a standalone driver with a BI tool that MongoDB doesn't officially support, 
you must test the features of the {+sql-interface+} that you want to use to confirm
they are supported by that tool. MongoDB can't guarantee that all BI tools are fully supported.

MongoDB provides the {+sql-interface+} standalone JDBC and ODBC drivers for experimentation
and custom integration with SQL-92 dialect-based third-party BI tools that support a
generic ODBC or JDBC driver connection. Use the type of driver that your BI tool
specifies.
