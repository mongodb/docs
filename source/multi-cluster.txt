   This feature is a beta release. Use |multi-cluster| 
   deployments only in development environments.
   
   You can deploy |k8s-op-full| to manage MongoDB deployments that span two
   or more |k8s| clusters. During the beta, the |k8s-op-short| supports
   deploying only replica sets across two or more |k8s| clusters.
   Deploying sharded clusters across two or more |k8s| clusters is not supported.
