   You may wish to make the {+dbtools-short+} available in your system's
   ``PATH`` environment variable, which allows referencing each tool
   directly on the command line by name, without needing to specify its
   full path, or first navigating to its parent directory.

   You can either:

   - Copy the DB Tools binaries from the extracted directory into a
     directory already listed in your ``PATH``, such as
     ``/usr/local/bin``. Navigate into the extracted directory, then run
     the following command to copy the binaries:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo cp * /usr/local/bin/

   - Add the DB Tools installation directory to your PATH, by editing
     your shell's configuration file. For example, in ``bash``, you
     would edit the ``~/.bash_profile`` file.
