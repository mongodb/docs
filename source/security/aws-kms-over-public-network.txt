Encrypt your data at rest in |service| with the customer-managed 
keys (CMK) that you create, own, and manage in your |aws| |kms|.

This page describes how to configure customer key management using |aws| |kms| 
on your |service| project and on the {+clusters+} in that project.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |aws| |kms| for a MongoDB
project, you must:

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-kms-prereqs.rst

Procedures 
----------

.. _aws-kms-enable-project:

Enable Role-Based Access for Your Encryption Key for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-rba-encryption-for-project.rst

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: api
   
      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-rba-encryption-api.rst

After you enable role-based access for your encryption key for your project, 
enable customer-managed keys for each |service| {+cluster+} in your project by following 
:ref:`aws-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest`. 

.. _aws-kms-switch-project:

Switch to Role-Based Access for Your Encryption Key for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of January 26, 2021, |aws| requires the use of |iam| *roles* instead of |iam| 
*users* for managing access to |aws| |kms| encryption keys within |service|. 
If you initially configured your project to use |iam| *user* credentials to access 
|aws| |kms| keys, switch to role-based access to comply with this new requirement
using the following procedure.

.. include:: /includes/fact-switching-access-to-encryption-keys.rst

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-migrate-rba-encryption-for-project.rst

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: api
   
      To update your encryption key management with the 
      {+atlas-admin-api+}, use the same steps outlined in the 
      :ref:`above procedure <aws-kms-enable-project>`.

.. _aws-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`aws-kms-enable-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| {+cluster+} that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for {+clusters+} in that project.

For new {+clusters+}, toggle the
:ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you create the {+cluster+}. 

For existing {+clusters+}:
