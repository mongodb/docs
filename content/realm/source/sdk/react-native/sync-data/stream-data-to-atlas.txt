Sync Data Unidirectionally from a Client Application
----------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define an Asymmetric Object

      Asymmetric objects sync data unidirectionally. Define an asymmetric object
      by setting ``asymmetric`` to ``true`` in your :js-sdk:`object model 
      <Realm.html#~ObjectSchema>`:

      .. tabs-realm-languages::

         .. tab::
            :tabid: javascript

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/data-ingest.test.snippet.data-ingest-object.jsx 
               :language: javascript
               :emphasize-lines: 6

         .. tab::
            :tabid: typescript
         
            .. literalinclude::  /examples/generated/react-native/ts/data-ingest.test.snippet.data-ingest-object.tsx 
               :language: typescript
               :emphasize-lines: 12

      For more information on how to define an asymmetric object, refer to 
      :ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <react-native-define-an-asymmetric-object>`.

   .. step:: Connect and Authenticate with an App Services App

      To stream data from the client to your backend App, you must 
      :ref:`connect to an App Services backend 
      <react-native-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app>` and
      :ref:`authenticate a user <react-native-authenticate-users>`.
            
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/data-ingest.test.snippet.anonymous-login.tsx
         :language: typescript

      Data Ingest is a feature of Flexible Sync, so the App you connect 
      to must use :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`.

   .. step:: Open a Realm

      After you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced realm
      using a Flexible Sync :realm-react-sdk:`configuration object 
      <types/Realm.FlexibleSyncConfiguration.html>`.

      .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
         .. tab::
            :tabid: javascript
            
            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/data-ingest.test.snippet.open-realm.jsx 
               :language: javascript
         
         .. tab::
            :tabid: typescript
            
            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/data-ingest.test.snippet.open-realm.tsx
               :language: typescript

      Unlike bi-directional Sync, Data Ingest does not use a 
      :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription <react-native-flexible-sync>`.
         
      You cannot query an asymmetric object or write it to a local
      realm, so asymmetric objects are incompatible with bi-directional
      Flexible Sync, Partition-Based Sync, or local Realm use.

   .. step:: Create Asymmetric Objects

      Once you have an open Realm, you can create an asymmetric object inside
      a write transaction using :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.create() 
      <classes/Realm-1.html#create>`. When creating an asymmetric object,
      ``Realm.create()`` returns ``undefined`` rather than the object itself.
            
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/data-ingest.test.snippet.write-data-ingest-object.tsx
         :language: typescript
         
      You cannot read these objects. Once created, they sync to the App 
      Services backend and the linked Atlas database.

      Atlas Device Sync completely manages the lifecycle of this data. 
      It is maintained on the device until Data Ingest synchronization is 
      complete, and then removed from the device.
