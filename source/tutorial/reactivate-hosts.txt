Reactivate Monitoring for a Process
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

.. only:: cloud or classic

   If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
   process, |mms| stops monitoring the process. |mms| stops monitoring a
   :program:`mongos` that is unreachable for 24 hours and a
   :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

.. only:: onprem

   If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
   process, |mms| stops monitoring the process. By default, |mms| stops
   monitoring a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable for 24 hours and a
   :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days. Your group might have
   different default behavior. Ask your system administrator.

When the system stops monitoring a process, the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page marks the process with an ``x``
in the :guilabel:`Last Ping` column. If the instance is a
:program:`mongod`, |mms| displays a caution icon at the top of each
:guilabel:`Deployment` page.

You can reactivate monitoring for the process whether or not the process is
running. When you reactivate monitoring, the Monitoring Agent has an hour to
reestablish contact and provide a ping to |mms|. If a process is running and
reachable, it appears marked with a green circle in the :guilabel:`Last
Ping` column. If it is unavailable, it appears marked with a
red square. If it remains unreachable for an hour, |mms| again stops monitoring
the process.

You can optionally remove a process that you are no longer using. Removed
processes are permanently hidden from |mms|. For more information, see
:doc:`/tutorial/remove-hosts`.
