This page outlines how to use |compass| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

If you need to install |compass-short|, see
:ref:`download-install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |compass-short| to a replica set, it is not
  recommended to connect directly to an individual replica
  set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a
  :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
  :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
  the result of an election, |compass-short| may either forcibly close
  the connection or display stale data.

  Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set
  :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` when 
  filling in your connection information.

- If you are using Kerberos as your authenticaion mechanism, do not 
  specify the :guilabel:`Password` in the connection form.

Connect
-------

When you open |compass-short|, an initial connection dialog appears:

   :figwidth: 690px

|compass-short| provides two methods to connect to your deployment,
either providing your deployment connection string or filling in your
deployment information in specific fields.

   .. tab:: Paste Connection String
      :tabid: paste-connection-string

      .. include:: /includes/steps/starting-compass-paste-string.rst

   .. tab:: Fill in Individual Fields
      :tabid: individual-fields

      .. include:: /includes/steps/starting-compass-individual-fields.rst

For MongoDB permissions required to access |compass-short|,
see :ref:`required-access`.

.. note::

  |compass| securely stores sensitive information entered in the
  connection form using an API that is specific to your operating
  system.

  For more information on how |compass-short| handles sensitive
  data, refer to the
  :ref:`FAQ page <compass-faq-confidential-data>`.

.. _disconnect:

Disconnect
----------

.. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-compass.rst

Disconnecting from a MongoDB instance closes the Compass connection to
the active instance and returns the Compass view to the initial
connection dialog.
