:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling
for large data sets and enable high throughput operations by
distributing the data set across a group of servers.

To learn more about sharding, see
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster that |mms| manages.
Later, you can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance
operations on the cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. |deployment| replace:: sharded cluster

.. include:: /includes/prereqs-deploy-resource.rst

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/fact-one-cluster-per-proj.rst

Do Not Deploy Monitoring Agents inside and outside |k8s|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not mix MongoDB deployments outside |k8s| with ones insider |k8s|
in the same Project.

Due to |k8s| network translation, a Monitoring Agent outside |k8s|
cannot monitor MongoDB instances inside |k8s|. For this reason, k8s
and non-k8s deployments in the same Project is not supported. Use
separate projects.


Procedure
---------

The procedure for deploying a sharded cluster depends on whether you
require the deployment to run with |tls| enabled for intra-cluster
communication and clients connecting to the database:
