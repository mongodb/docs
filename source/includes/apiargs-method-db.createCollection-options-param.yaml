  To create a :term:`capped collection`,
  specify ``true``. If you specify ``true``, you must also set a maximum
  size in the ``size`` field.

  Specify ``false`` to disable the automatic creation of an index on the

  .. important::

     For replica sets, all collections must have ``autoIndexId`` set to ``true``.

  Specify a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. Once a
  capped collection reaches its maximum size, MongoDB removes the older
  documents to make space for the new documents. The ``size`` field is
  required for capped collections and ignored for other collections.

  The maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection. The
  ``size`` limit takes precedence over this limit. If a capped
  collection reaches the ``size`` limit before it reaches the maximum
  number of documents, MongoDB removes old documents. If you prefer to
  use the ``max`` limit, ensure that the ``size`` limit, which is
  required for a capped collection, is sufficient to contain the
  maximum number of documents.

  Available for the MMAPv1 storage engine only.

  .. deprecated:: 3.0

     For the MMAPv1 storage engine, all collections use the :ref:`power
     of 2 sizes allocation <power-of-2-allocation>` unless the
     ``noPadding`` option is ``true``. The ``usePowerOf2Sizes`` option
     does not affect the allocation strategy.

  Available for the MMAPv1 storage engine only.

  .. versionadded:: 3.0

     ``noPadding`` flag disables the :ref:`power of 2 sizes allocation
     <power-of-2-allocation>` for the collection. With ``noPadding``
     flag set to true, the allocation strategy does not include
     additional space to accommodate document growth, as such, document
     growth will result in new allocation. Use for collections with
     workloads that are insert-only or in-place updates (such as
     incrementing counters).

     Defaults to ``false``.

  .. warning:: 

     Do not set ``noPadding`` if the workload includes removes or any
     updates that may cause documents to grow. For more information,
     see :ref:`exact-fit-allocation`.

  Available for the WiredTiger storage engine only.

  .. versionadded:: 3.0

  Allows users to specify configuration to the storage engine on a
  per-collection basis when creating a collection. The value of the
  ``storageEngine`` option should take the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }

  Storage engine configuration specified when creating collections are
  validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to
  support replica sets with members that use different storage
  engines.
