   :description: Modify, normalize, or return a breakdown of the score assigned to a returned document with the boost, constant, embedded, or function options.

Every document returned by an |fts| query is assigned a score based
on relevance, and the documents included in a result set are returned
in order from highest score to lowest. 

Many factors can influence a document's score, including:

- The position of the search term in the document,
- The frequency of occurrence of the search term in the document,
- The type of :ref:`operator <fts-operators>` the query uses,
- The type of :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` the query uses.

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-array-scoring.rst

The score assigned to a returned document is part of the document's
metadata. You can include each returned document's score along with the
result set by using a :pipeline:`$project` stage in your aggregation
pipeline. In the :pipeline:`$project` stage, the ``score`` field takes
the :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression,
which requires the ``searchScore`` value. You can also specify the
``searchScoreDetails`` value for the ``scoreDetails`` field
:manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression for a
detailed breakdown of the score.

The following example query uses a :pipeline:`$project` stage to add a
field named ``score`` to the returned documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.movies.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "text": {
           "query": "Helsinki",
           "path": "plot"
         }
       }
     },
     {
       $project: {
         plot: 1,
         title: 1,
         score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
       }
     }
   ])

After a :pipeline:`$project` stage, you don't need to include a
descending :pipeline:`$sort` because |fts| returns the documents from
highest score to lowest. However, if multiple documents in the results
have identical scores, the ordering of the documents in the results is
non-deterministic. If you want the results to have a determined order,
we recommend that you include the :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option in your
:pipeline:`$search` stage to sort the results by a unique field. If you 
don't specify a unique field, |fts| defaults to sorting the results
arbitrarily when the results have an identical score. You can use the
:ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option to also return an ascending sort of the
results by score. To learn more, see :ref:`sort-ref` and :ref:`Sort by
Score Examples <sort-by-score-egs>`.
