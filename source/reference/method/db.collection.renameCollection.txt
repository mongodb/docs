.. method:: db.collection.renameCollection(target, dropTarget)


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongo-shell-method.rst


   Renames a collection. Provides a wrapper for the
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` :term:`database command`.


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``target``
   
        - string
   
        - The new name of the collection. Enclose the string in quotes.
          See :ref:`restrictions-on-db-names`.

      * - ``dropTarget``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. If ``true``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` drops the ``target`` of :dbcommand:`renameCollection` prior to
          renaming the collection. The default value is ``false``.


Behavior
--------

The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method operates within a
collection by changing the metadata associated with a given collection.

Refer to the documentation :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for additional
warnings and messages.

.. warning::

   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command will invalidate open cursors
   which interrupts queries that are currently returning data.

   For :doc:`/changeStreams`, the
   :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command create an
   :ref:`change-event-invalidate` for any existing
   :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on the source or target collection.
   
- The method has the following limitations:

  - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` cannot move a collection
    between databases. Use :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for these
    rename operations.

  - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` is not supported on
    sharded collections.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.2

:method:`~db.collection.renameCollection()` obtains an exclusive lock on
the source and target collections for the duration of the operation. All
subsequent operations on the collections must wait until
:method:`~db.collection.renameCollection()` completes. Prior to MongoDB
4.2, renaming a collection within the same database with
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` required obtaining an exclusive database
lock.

Interaction with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongodump` started with 
:option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` fails if a client issues
:method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` during the dump process. See
:option:`mongodump.--oplog` for more information.

Example
-------

Call the :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method on a
collection object. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.rrecord.renameCollection("record")

This operation will rename the ``rrecord`` collection to ``record``. If
the target name (i.e. ``record``) is the name of an existing collection,
then the operation will fail.
