Restore Replica Set from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
=====================================================

.. start-content

With |backup|, you can restore from any point within a 24-hour period as well
as :doc:`restore from a stored snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot>`. For replica sets and sharded
clusters, these restores reflect a single point in time.

Specify a Point from which to Restore a Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Above the table, click on :guilabel:`Restore`. A window for
   selecting the restoration point appears.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Use Custom Point In Time` checkbox to enable the
   :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time(24 HR)` fields.

#. Specify the point in time for which to build the snapshot.

   a. Enter the :guilabel:`Date`. You can use the calendar icon to
      select a date.

   #. Select the :guilabel:`Time(24 HR)` using the hour and the minute
      drop downs. This time will be in the same time zone as your
      :ref:`User Time Zone <mms-personalization>`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Select Destination` button.

MMS will create a backup that includes *every* point in time until
this timestamp. In other words, the point in time is the an upper
*exclusive* bound: if you select a timesnamp of 12:00:00, then the
last operation in the restore would be the last operation of
11:59:59.
