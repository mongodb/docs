"MongoDB can use the intersection of multiple indexes to fulfill queries. "
"[#previous-versions]_ In general, each index intersection involves two "
"indexes; however, MongoDB can employ multiple/nested index intersections "
"to resolve a query."

"To determine if MongoDB used index intersection, run "

"Index intersection does not eliminate the need for creating "

" list order (i.e. the order in which the keys are listed in the index) "
"and the sort order (i.e. ascending or descending), matter in "
":doc:`compound indexes </core/index-compound>`, a compound index may not "
