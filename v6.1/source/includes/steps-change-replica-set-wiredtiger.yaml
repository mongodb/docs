title: "Prepare a data directory for the new ``mongod`` running with WiredTiger."
ref: change-wt-repl-sync-wiredtiger-dir
pre: |
  Prepare a data directory for the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that
  will run with the WiredTiger storage engine. ``mongod`` must have read
  and write permissions for this directory. You can either delete the
  contents of the stopped secondary member's current data directory or
  create a new directory entirely.

  ``mongod`` with WiredTiger will not start with data files created with
  a different storage engine.

  Remove any :ref:`4.2-mmapv1-conf-options` from the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance configuration.

title: "Start ``mongod`` with WiredTiger."
ref: change-wt-repl-sync-start-mongod-w-wiredtiger
content: |
   Start :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specifying ``wiredTiger`` as the
   :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>` and the prepared data directory for
   WiredTiger as the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`.

   Specify additional options as appropriate, such as
   :option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>`.

  Since no data exists in the ``--dbpath``, the ``mongod`` will perform an
  :doc:`initial sync </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`. The length of the
  initial sync process depends on the size of the database and network
  connection between members of the replica set.
