   To restore from an encrypted backup, you need the same master key
   used to encrypt the backup and either the same certificate as is on
   the :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon>` host or a new certificate provisioned 
   with that key from the |kmip| host.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4

      Starting in 3.4, |onprem| supports encryption for any backup job 
      that was stored in a :opsmgr:`head database </reference/glossary/#term-head-database>` running 
      `MongoDB Enterprise
      <https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`__ 
      3.4 or later with the :manual:`WiredTiger </core/security-encryption-at-rest/#encrypted-storage-engine>`
      storage engine.

      For details on setting up backup encryption, see
      :doc:`/tutorial/encrypt-snapshots`.

ref: fact-restoreInfo-file
content: |

  The backup restore file includes a metadata file named
  ``restoreInfo.txt``. This file captures the options the database used
  when the snapshot was taken. The database must be run with the listed
  options after it has been restored. This file contains:

  - *Group name*

  - *Replica Set name*

  - *Cluster ID* (if applicable)

  - *Snapshot timestamp* (as Timestamp at UTC)

  - *Restore timestamp* (as a BSON Timestamp at UTC)

  - *Last Oplog applied* (as a BSON Timestamp at UTC)

  - *MongoDB version*

  - *Storage engine type*

  - :manual:`mongod startup options </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` used on the database
    when the snapshot was taken

  - *Encryption*
    (Only appears if encryption is enabled on the snapshot)

  - *Master Key UUID*
    (Only appears if encryption is enabled on the snapshot)

    If restoring from an encrypted backup, you must have a certificate
    provisioned for this Master Key.

     If the snapshot is encrypted, the restore panel displays the KMIP
     master key id and the KMIP server information. You can also find
     the information when you view the snapshot itself as well as in
     the ``restoreInfo.txt`` file.

ref: encrypted-backup-enable-encryption
content: |
    If the storage engine is :guilabel:`WiredTiger`, you can enable
    encryption. To enable encryption, select :guilabel:`Enable
    Encryption`. Select only if you have :ref:`set up KMIP server
    <setup-kmip-server-conf>` for your backups and :ref:`configured the
    project to use KMIP <configure-group-kmip>`.
