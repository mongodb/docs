=============================
Create an Alert Configuration
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

An alert configuration defines the conditions that trigger an alert and
defines the notifications to be sent. When you create a new alert
configuration you have the option of using an existing configuration as a
template.

Considerations
--------------

Costs
~~~~~

Costs to send alerts depend on your telephone service contract. Many
factors may affect alert delivery, including do not call lists, caps
for messages sent or delivered, delivery time of day, and message
caching.

Alert Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create multiple alert configurations with different minimum
frequencies. The minimum frequency for an alert is 5 minutes. The time
between re-notifications increases by the frequency amount every alert
cycle (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.) up to a
maximum of 24 hours.

You can set the time to elapse before |mms| sends an alert after an alert
condition occurs. This helps eliminate false positives.

User Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| provides several options for user notifications, including SMS. If
you choose SMS, |mms| sends alert text messages to all users in the group
who have filled in their mobile numbers for their accounts.

Procedure
---------

This procedure lets you choose to create the new alert configuration with
or without using an existing alert configuration as a template.
