Whitelist
~~~~~~~~~

To access a cluster, you must connect from an IP address on the
|service| project's IP whitelist. If you need to add an IP address to
the whitelist, you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can
also add the IP address from the :ref:`Security tab <add-to-access-list>`.
