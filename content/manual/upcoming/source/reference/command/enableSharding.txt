Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: enableSharding

   .. note::

      .. versionchanged:: 6.0

      Starting in MongoDB 6.0, this command is **not** required to
      :ref:`shard <sharding-background>` a collection.

   The :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command explicitly creates a database.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.enableSharding` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-serverless.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

- *Recommended*.  Specify the database to create:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( 
        { 
          enableSharding: "<database name>"
        } 
     )

- Optionally, you can include the primary shard specification in the command, 
  although this is not recommended:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( 
        { 
          enableSharding: "<database name>",
          primaryShard: "<shard name>"  
        } 
     )

You can only run the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command on the ``admin`` database
from a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`enableSharding <cmd-enableSharding-db>`
     - String
     - .. _cmd-enableSharding-db:

       The database you want to use.  The database is created if it
       does not exist.

   * - :ref:`primaryShard <cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>`
     - String
     - .. _cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard:

       .. include:: /includes/primary-shard-enable-sharding-opt.rst

Returns
~~~~~~~

The command returns a document that contains status of the operation.

Primary Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, you should not need to specify the :ref:`primaryShard
<cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>` in the command. Instead, allow the
balancer to select the primary shard. 

However, if you do specify the :ref:`primaryShard
<cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>` in the command for a :ref:`database
<cmd-enableSharding-db>` and the database is already sharding enabled
with a different primary shard, the operation returns an error and the
primary shard for the database remains as before. To change the primary
shard for a database, use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` instead.

Example
-------

The following command, run from a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, creates the 
the ``shardTest`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { enableSharding: "shardTest" } )
