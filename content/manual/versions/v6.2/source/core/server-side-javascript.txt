Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the following commands, methods, and operator that
perform server-side execution of JavaScript code:

- :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and the corresponding :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  method :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`.  For more
  information, see :doc:`/core/map-reduce`.

- :query:`$where` operator that evaluates a JavaScript expression or a
  function in order to query for documents.

- :group:`$accumulator` and :expression:`$function` aggregation
  operations that allows users to define custom aggregation expressions.

You can also specify a JavaScript file to :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to
run on the server. For more information, see
:ref:`running-js-scripts-in-mongo-on-mongod-host`

If you do not need to perform server-side execution of JavaScript code,
see :ref:`disable-server-side-js`.

Running ``.js`` files via a ``mongosh`` Instance on the Server
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify a JavaScript (``.js``) file to :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
to execute the file on the server. This is a good technique
for performing batch administrative work. When you run
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` on the server, connecting via the localhost
interface, the connection is fast with low latency.
