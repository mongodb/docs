What should I do if the chart generated looks incorrect, or |charts-short| doesn't generate a chart from the prompt?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are improving :guilabel:`Natural Language` mode to reduce the
occurrence of incorrect responses. In the meantime, we provide a message
that helps you understand how to improve the response.

The following table lists the possible messages you can receive and the 
underlying cause of each.

   * - Message
     - Further Explanation

   * - Some chart types are currently not supported in the Natural
       Language mode. Grouped Bar chart has been selected. Switch to the
       Classic mode to change this.
     - We currently do not supoort the chart type you requested in the
       prompt. When you write a prompt, leave the chart type selection to
       |charts-short|, or specify another :ref:`supported chart type
       <nlc-supported-charts>`.

   * - Customization options are currently not supported in the Natural
       Language mode. Switch to the Classic mode to continue.
     - We currently do not support customization options in the
       :guilabel:`Customize` section of the :guilabel:`Classic` mode for
       chart generation.

   * - The prompt is not specific enough. Edit the prompt and try again.
     - There is not enough information in the prompt to generate a
       chart.

   * - Couldn't find 'field_name' in the data source. Edit the prompt
       and try again. 
     - You entered a field that doesn't exist in the data schema. To see
       the exisiting fields you can tag from the data source, press the
       ``@`` key when writing the prompt.

In the bottom-left corner of your generated chart, please give us
feedback to help improve the response.
