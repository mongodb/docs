Overview
--------

The {+shared-library+} is a **dynamic library** that enables your client
application to perform :ref:`automatic field level encryption
<field-level-encryption-automatic>`.
A dynamic library is a set of functionality accessed
by an application at runtime rather than compile time.
The {+shared-library+} performs the following tasks:

- Reads the encryption schema to determine which fields to encrypt or decrypt
- Prevents your application from executing unsupported operations on encrypted
  fields

The {+shared-library+} *does not* do any of the following:

- Perform data encryption or decryption
- Access the encryption key material
- Listen for data over the network

The {+shared-library+} is a preferred alternative to ``mongocryptd`` and does
not require you to spawn another process to perform automatic encryption.

.. tip::
   
   While we recommend using the {+shared-library+}, ``mongocryptd`` is still supported.

   To learn more about ``mongocryptd``, see :ref:`<field-level-encryption-mongocryptd>`.

through the following parameters:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 30 70

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - cryptSharedLibPath
      - | Specifies the absolute path to the {+shared-library+} package,
        | {+shared-library-package+}.
        | **Default**: ``undefined``

    * - cryptSharedLibRequired
      - | Specifies if the driver must use the {+shared-library+}. If ``true``,
        | the driver raises an error if the {+shared-library+} is unavailable.
        | If ``false``, the driver performs the following sequence of actions:
        
        #. Attempts to use the {+shared-library+}.
        #. If the {+shared-library+} is unavailable, the driver attempts to
           spawn and connect to ``mongocryptd``.
   
        | **Default**: ``false``
