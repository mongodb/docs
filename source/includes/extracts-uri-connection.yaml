   .. versionadded:: MongoDB 3.4.7
   
   You can connect to your |service| cluster using its 
   `connection string URI <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/>`_.
   In the connect dialog perform the following steps: 
   
   a. Click :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.
   #. Copy the connection string found in step 1.
   #. Replace **PASSWORD** with the password for the root user, and 
      **DATABASE** with the name of the database to which you wish to connect.

      .. important::

         You must escape any instances of the ``@`` character in the provided
         ``<PASSWORD>``. For example, ``p@ssword`` should be ``p%40ssword``.

   This connection string is specified to :program:`{{program}}` in the
   ``--uri`` option.
   
   Prior to MongoDB 3.4.7, you could only specify the cluster host information to
   :program:`{{program}}` in the ``{{parameter}}`` option.
   
   When using ``{{parameter}}``, if the |service| cluster is a replica 
   set you must also retrieve the replica set name. For example:

   .. code-block:: none
