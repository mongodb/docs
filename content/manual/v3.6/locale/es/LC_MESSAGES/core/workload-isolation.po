"MongoDB includes a number of features that allow database administrators "
"and developers to isolate workload by functional or geographical "
"groupings."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:20
msgid ""
"This capability provides \"data center awareness,\" which allows "
"applications to target MongoDB deployments with consideration of the "
"physical location of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. MongoDB "
"supports segmentation of operations across different dimensions, which "
"may include multiple data centers and geographical regions in multi-data "
"center deployments, racks, networks, or power circuits in single data "
"center deployments."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:28
msgid ""
"MongoDB also supports workload isolation based on functional or "
"operational parameters, to ensure that certain :binary:`~bin.mongod` "
"instances are only used for reporting workloads or that certain high-"
"frequency portions of a sharded collection only exist on specific shards."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:34
msgid "Specifically, with MongoDB, you can:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:36

"ensure write operations propagate to specific members of a replica set, "
"or to specific members of replica sets."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:39
msgid "ensure that specific members of a replica set respond to queries."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/workload-isolation.txt:41

"ensure that specific ranges of your :term:`shard key` balance onto and "
"reside on specific :term:`shards <shard>`."
msgstr ""

"combine the above features in a single distributed deployment, on a per-"
"operation (for read and write operations) and collection (for chunk "
"distribution in sharded clusters distribution) basis."

"preferences and write concerns."

msgid ""
":ref:`Zones <zone-sharding>` in sharded clusters, which allows MongoDB "
"administrators to create :term:`zones <zone>` that represent a group of "
"shards and associate one or more ranges of :term:`shard key` values to "
"these zones. You can associate each zone with one or more shards in the "
"cluster. A shard can associate with any number of zones. In a balanced "
"cluster, MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone only to the "
"shards inside the zone."
