An organization is the top-level entity. Billing, teams, and resource
policies are managed at the organization level. Rate limits and API keys
are also managed at this level but can be further constrained within
projects, which are logical grouping of database deployments or
clusters, and associated resources. An organization can contain multiple
projects.

Roles and Permissions
---------------------

You can manage users and teams for projects at the organization level.
You can also assign roles that grant privileges to users at the
organization and project levels, including role for creating and
deleting {+model-api-key+}\s for the project.

For the complete list of roles and privileges in Atlas that you can grants users
at the organization and project levels, see :atlas:`Atlas User Roles
</reference/user-roles/>`.
