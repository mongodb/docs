Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to handle errors in your sink connector.
The following list shows some common scenarios that cause your sink
connector to experience an error:

- You write to a topic using Avro serialization and try to decode your messages from
  that topic using Protobuf deserialization
- You use a change data capture handler on a message that does not contain change
  event documents
- You apply an invalid single message transform to incoming documents

When your sink connector encounters an error it does two actions:

- :ref:`Handles the Error <kafka-sink-handle-errors>`
- :ref:`Logs the Error <kafka-sink-log-errors>`

.. _kafka-sink-handle-errors:

Handle Errors
-------------

When your connector encounters an error, it needs to handle it in some way.
Your sink connector can do the following in response to an error:

- :ref:`Stop <kafka-sink-errors-stop>` *default*
- :ref:`Tolerate Errors <kafka-sink-tolerate-errors>`
- :ref:`Write Errant Messages to a Topic (Dead Letter Queue) <kafka-sink-errors-dlq>`

.. _kafka-sink-errors-stop:

Stop
~~~~

By default, your sink connector terminates and stops processing messages
when it encounters an error. This is a good option for you if any error in
your sink connector indicates a serious problem.

When your sink connector crashes, you must do one of the
following actions and then restart your connector to resume processing messages: 

- Allow your sink connector to temporarily :ref:`tolerate errors <kafka-sink-tolerate-errors>`
- Update your sink connector's configuration to allow it to process the message
- Remove the errant message from your topic

You can have your sink connector stop when it encounters an error by either not
specifying any value for the ``errors.tolerance`` option, or by
adding the following to your connector configuration:

.. code-block:: properties

   errors.tolerance=none

.. _kafka-sink-tolerate-errors:

Tolerate Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure your sink connector to tolerate all errors and never stop
processing messages. This is a good option for getting your sink connector up and
running quickly, but you run the risk of missing problems in your connector 
as you do not receive any feedback if something goes wrong.

You can have your sink connector tolerate all errors by specifying the following
option:

.. code-block:: properties

   errors.tolerance=all

.. _kafka-sink-errors-dlq:

Dead Letter Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure your sink connector to write errant messages to a 
topic, called a **dead letter queue**, for you to inspect or process further.
A dead letter queue is a location in message queueing
systems such as {+ak+} where the system routes errant messages instead of
crashing or ignoring the error. Dead letter queues combine the feedback of
stopping the program with the durability of tolerating all errors, and are a
good error handling starting point for most deployments.

You can have your sink connector route all errant messages to a dead
letter queue by specifying the following options:

.. code-block:: properties

   errors.tolerance=all
   errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=<name of topic to use as dead letter queue>

If you want to include the specific reason for the error as well as the
errant message, use the following option:

.. code-block:: properties

   errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=true

.. important:: Bulk Write Errors 

   If an error occurs while performing a bulk write to MongoDB, you must specify
   the following to log any information about the error to a dead letter queue:

   .. code-block:: properties

      errors.tolerance=all
      mongo.errors.tolerance=none
      errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=<name of topic to use as dead letter queue>

   We will fix this special case soon. To track the status of this issue, 
   see :issue:`this JIRA ticket <KAFKA-223>`.

   For more information on the ``mongo.errors.tolerance`` option, see our
   section on :ref:`connector level options <kakfa-sink-connector-level>`.

For more information, see Confluent's guide on 
`Dead Letter Queues <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/dead-letter-queue.html#dead-letter-queue>`__.

.. _kafka-sink-log-errors:

Log Errors
----------

You can record tolerated and untolerated errors to a log file. Click on the tabs
to see how to log errors:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Untolerated Errors
      :tabid: untolerated-errors

      The following default option makes {+kc+} write only untolerated errors to its application log:

      .. code-block:: properties

         errors.log.enable=false

   .. tab:: Tolerated and Untolerated Errors
      :tabid: tolerated-errors

      The following option makes {+kc+} write both tolerated and untolerated errors to its
      application log:

      .. code-block:: properties

         errors.log.enable=true

If you would like to log metadata about your message, such as your message's
topic and offset, use the following option:

.. code-block:: properties

   errors.log.include.messages=true

For more information, see Confluent's guide on 
`logging with Kafka Connect <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/logging.html>`__.

.. _kakfa-sink-connector-level:

Connector Level Options
-----------------------

The {+mkc+} provides options that allow you to configure error
handling at the connector level. The options are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Kafka Connect Option
     - {+mkc+} Option

   * - ``errors.tolerance`` 
     - ``mongo.errors.tolerance``

   * - ``errors.log.enable``
     - ``mongo.errors.log.enable``

You want to use these options if you want your connector to respond differently
to errors related to MongoDB than to errors related to the {+kc+} framework.
