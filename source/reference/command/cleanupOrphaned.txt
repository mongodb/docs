   Starting in MongoDB 6.0.3, you should run an aggregation using the 
   :pipeline:`$shardedDataDistribution` stage to confirm no orphaned 
   documents remain. For details, 
   see :ref:`shardedDataDistribution-no-orphaned-docs`.

Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: cleanupOrphaned

   Use this command to wait for orphaned documents in a chunk
   range from a shard key's :bsontype:`MinKey` to its
   :bsontype:`MaxKey` for a specified namespace to be
   cleaned up from a majority of a shard's members.

   To run, issue :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` in the ``admin`` database
   directly on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is the primary
   replica set member of the shard. You do not need to disable the
   balancer before running :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

   .. note::

      Do not run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` on a
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

              
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.runCommand( 
     {
       cleanupOrphaned: "<database>.<collection>",
       startingFromKey: <minimumShardKeyValue>, // deprecated
       secondaryThrottle: <boolean>, // deprecated
       writeConcern: <document> // deprecated
     } 
  )

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Field
 
     - Type
 
     - Description
 
   * - ``cleanupOrphaned``
 
     - string
 
     - The namespace, i.e. both the database and the collection name,
       of the sharded collection for which to wait for cleanup of the
       orphaned data.
 
Behavior
--------

.. _cleanupOrphaned-determine-range:

Determine Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The value of this field is not used to determine the bounds of the cleanup 
range. The :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command waits until all orphaned 
documents in all ranges in the namespace are cleaned up from the shard before
completing, regardless of the presence of or value of
``startingFromKey``. 

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, you must have
:authrole:`clusterAdmin` privileges to run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

.. _cleanupOrphaned-output:

Output
------

Return Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command returns a document containing
a subset of the following fields:

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.ok

   Equal to ``1`` on success.

   A value of ``1`` indicates that either:

   - No orphaned documents remain in the ``cleanupOrphaned`` namespace
     on the shard, or
   - The collection referenced in the ``cleanupOrphaned`` namespace is
     not sharded.

   A value of ``0`` indicates that an error has occurred.

.. admin-only
