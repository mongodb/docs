.. _mck-1.0.0-rn:

|k8s-op-short| v1.0.0
---------------------

*Released 9 May 2025*

MongoDB is unifying its Kubernetes offerings with the introduction of |k8s-op-short|. 
This new operator is an open-source project and represents a merge of the previous 
`MongoDB Community Operator <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/tree/master/docs/mongodbcommunity>`__ 
and the `MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator <https://wwww.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/>`__. This makes it 
easier to manage, scale, and upgrade your deployments. Future changes will build on this 
to more closely align how Community and Enterprise are managed 
in Kubernetes, to offer an even more seamless and streamlined experience. 

As an open-source project, it now allows for community contributions, helping drive quicker bug 
fixes and ongoing innovation.

License
-------

Users with contracts that allowed use of the Enterprise Operator can still leverage the new replacement, 
allowing customers to adopt it without contract changes. |k8s-op-short| itself is licensed under the 
Apache 2.0 license, and a `license file <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/tree/master>`__ 
included in the repository provides further detail. 

License entitlements for all other MongoDB products and tools, such as 
MongoDB Enterprise Server and Ops Manager, remain unchanged. If you have
licensing questions regarding these products or tools, please contact your 
MongoDB account team.

Migration
---------

Migration from the Community Kubernetes Operator and the Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to 
|k8s-op-short| is seamless: your MongoDB deployments are not impacted by the upgrade and 
require no changes. Simply follow the instructions in the :ref:`migration guide <migrate-to-mck>`.


Legacy Operator Deprecation and EOL
-----------------------------------

We will continue best-effort support of the Community Kubernetes Operator for 6 month,
until November, 2025). Each Enterprise Kubernetes Operator release will remain supported 
according to the current `guidance <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/reference/support-lifecycle/>`__

All future bug fixes and improvements will be released in new versions of |k8s-op-short|. 
We encourage all users to plan their migration to |k8s-op-short| within these timelines.
