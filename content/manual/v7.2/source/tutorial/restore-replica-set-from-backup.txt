This procedure outlines the process for taking MongoDB data and
restoring that data into a new :term:`replica set`. Use this approach
for seeding test deployments from production backups or as part
of disaster recovery.

.. important::
   You *cannot* restore a single data set to three new :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances and **then** create a replica set. If you copy the data set
   to each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and then create the replica set,
   MongoDB will force the secondaries to perform an :term:`initial
   sync`. The procedures in this document describe the correct and
   efficient ways to deploy a restored replica set.

You can also use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to restore database files
using data created with :binary:`~bin.mongodump`. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools` for more information.

Restore Database into a Single Node Replica Set

Add Members to the Replica Set
------------------------------

MongoDB provides two options for restoring secondary members of a
replica set:

- :ref:`Manually copy the database files <restore-rs-copy-db-files>`
  to each data directory.

- :ref:`Allow initial sync <restore-rs-initial-sync>` to distribute
  data automatically.

.. note::

   If your database is large, initial sync can take a long time to
   complete. For large databases, it might be preferable to copy the
   database files onto each host.


.. _restore-rs-copy-db-files:

Copy Database Files and Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data by copying MongoDB data
files directly.

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-secondary-from-backup-directly.rst

.. _restore-rs-initial-sync:

Update Secondaries using Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data using the default :ref:`initial
sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` operation.
