Capped collections are fixed-size collections that insert and retrieve
documents based on insertion order. Capped collections work similarly to
circular buffers: once a collection fills its allocated space, it makes
room for new documents by overwriting the oldest documents in the
collection.

Restrictions
------------

- Capped collections cannot be sharded.

- You cannot create capped collections on :atlas:`serverless instances
  </tutorial/create-serverless-instance/>`.

- Capped collections are not supported in :ref:`Stable API <stable-api>`
  V1.

- You cannot write to capped collections in :ref:`transactions
  <transactions>`.

- The :pipeline:`$out` aggregation pipeline stage cannot write results
  to a capped collection.

Command Syntax
--------------

The following example creates a capped collection called ``log`` with a
maximum size of 100,000 bytes.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection( "log", { capped: true, size: 100000 } )

For more information on creating capped collections, see
:method:`~db.createCollection()` or :dbcommand:`create`.

Use Cases
---------

.. include:: /includes/capped-collections/use-ttl-index.rst

The most common use case for a capped collection is to store log
information. When the capped collection reaches its maximum size, old
log entries are automatically overwritten with new entries.

Get Started
-----------

Behavior
--------

Consider these behavioral details for capped collections.

.. _capped-collections-oplog:

Oplog Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`oplog.rs <oplog>` collection that stores a log
of the operations in a :term:`replica set` uses a capped collection.

Unlike other capped collections, the oplog can grow past its configured
size limit to avoid deleting the :data:`majority commit point
<replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>`.

.. note:: 

   MongoDB rounds the capped size of the oplog up to the nearest 
   integer multiple of 256, in bytes.

_id Index
~~~~~~~~~

Capped collections have an ``_id`` field and an index on the ``_id``
field by default.

Updates
~~~~~~~

Avoid updating data in a capped collection. Because capped collections
are fixed-size, updates can cause your data to expand beyond the
collection's allocated space, which can cause unexpected behavior.

Query Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/capped-collections/query-natural-order.rst

Tailable Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a :term:`tailable cursor` with capped collections. Similar to the
Unix ``tail -f`` command, the tailable cursor "tails" the end of a
capped collection. As new documents are inserted into the capped
collection, you can use the tailable cursor to continue retrieving
documents.

For information on creating a tailable cursor, see
:ref:`tailable-cursors-landing-page`.
