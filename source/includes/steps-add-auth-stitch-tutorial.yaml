title: Set toggle switch for using Realm rules for data access.
content: |
  In addition to authenticating users for embedded chart access, you can
  perform fine-grained data access control with your Realm app's :stitch:`service
  rules </services/define-a-service-rule/>`. Set the toggle switch to
  :guilabel:`On` if you want to enable rule enforcement.

  When this option is enabled, any Realm rules defined on collections will
  be observed by |charts-short| when retrieving chart data. You can use this
  feature to restrict access to the data shown on your chart, including
  showing different subsets of data to different users, depending on their
  :stitch:`role </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>`.

  .. note::

     - This option assumes that the :ref:`data source <data-sources>` for
       this chart uses the same MongoDB database and collection as your
       Realm app.

     - Using this option may have a performance impact, so you should leave
       it off if you do not need to restrict data access based on Realm
       rules.
