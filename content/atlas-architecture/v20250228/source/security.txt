Security in the {+service+} Well-Architected Framework
======================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Security pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes features that
ensure data integrity and privacy through comprehensive safeguarding
measures, such as encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained access
controls, and adherence to regulatory standards.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about
security in {+service+}:

      |service-fullname| enforces mandatory |tls| encryption for database connections.
      Restrict database access to specific IP addresses and |cidr| ranges
      and use private endpoints and VPC peering.

      Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with built-in and custom roles
      to control operations on resources. Get recommendations on the best
      authentication method for production environments.
