Overview
--------

The {+odbc-driver+} provides connectivity between a SQL client
and the |bi|. The ODBC driver enables users to create a
:doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>` and connect
a variety of :doc:`BI tools </client-applications>` to the |bi-short|. It includes
the |bi-short| :doc:`authentication plugin </reference/auth-plugin-c>`,
which implements the client side of MongoDB-supported authentication
mechanisms.

Compatibility
-------------

The {+odbc-driver+} is compatible with |bi-short| version 2.5 and
later. The latest production version of |bi-short| is available from
the {+download-center+}.

Using the ODBC Driver
---------------------

Configure your system to use the ODBC driver by setting up a
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`. A DSN holds configuration
information about your |bi-short| instance, including server address,
port number, and login credentials. See
:doc:`Create a System DSN</tutorial/create-system-dsn>` for
instructions on setting up a DSN on your system.
