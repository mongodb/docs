Account

  passwords.

- If your account is suspended due to inactivity, reset your password 
  to unsuspend your account.

User Sessions

- |cloudgov-short| ends your session after 15 minutes of 
  inactivity, requiring you to log in again. You are prompted to 
  continue your current session after 10 minutes of inactivity.

Monitoring and Logging

- You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role to 
  configure an integration.

- In addition to :atlas:`standard Atlas logging </mongodb-logs/>`, 
  |cloudgov-short| logs the username and IP address associated with all 
  failed login attempts, temporary lockouts and failed |api| digest 
  authentications.
