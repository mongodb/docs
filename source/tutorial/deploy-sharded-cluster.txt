:manual:`Sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` provide horizontal scaling
for large data sets and enable high throughput operations by
distributing the data set across a group of servers.

To learn more about sharding, see
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster that |mms| manages.
Later, you can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance
operations on the cluster.

Considerations
--------------

Do Not Deploy Monitoring Agents Inside and Outside |k8s|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to |k8s| network translation, a monitoring agent outside |k8s|
cannot monitor MongoDB instances inside |k8s|. For this reason, k8s
and non-k8s deployments in the same project are not supported. Use
separate projects.

Choose Whether to Encrypt Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you deploy your sharded cluster via the |k8s-op-short|, you must
choose whether to encrypt connections using |tls| certificates.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`TLS-Encrypted` connections:

- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between cluster shards.
- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Requires valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`Non-Encrypted Connections`:

- Doesn't encrypt connections between cluster shards.
- Doesn't encrypt connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Has fewer setup requirements than a deployment with |tls|-encrypted
  connections.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/cannot-secure-standalone.rst

To set up |tls| encryption for a replica set, see 
:ref:`deploy-replica-set`.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want to encrypt your
replica set connections with |tls|.

   .. tab:: TLS-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: encrypted

      Renew TLS Certificates for a Sharded Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Renew your |tls| certificates periodically
      using the following procedure:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-k8s-sc-tls-custom-renew.rst

   .. tab:: Non-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: non-encrypted
