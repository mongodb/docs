This page describes changes and new features introduced in  
{+c2c-full-product-name+} 1.9.

1.9.0 Release 
-------------

**November 13, 2024**

Embedded Verifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.9.0, ``mongosync`` includes an embedded verifier to
confirm the successful sync of collections from the source
cluster to the destination. The verifier is enabled by default
for replica set migrations.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-verification-support-1.9.0.rst

To check verification status, see the ``verification`` field in
the :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` response.

For details, see :ref:`c2c-embedded-verifier`.

Other Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features: 

- ``mongosync`` now supports migrating documents that have an empty timestamp 
  values, such as Timestamp(0,0) for source clusters using MongoDB version 6.0 
  or later. 

- Added a ``stdin`` disclaimer to the ``mongosync`` executable regarding 
  verification. Users must to accept this disclaimer before ``mongosync``  
  can run.

- Added ``--acceptDisclaimer`` flag for users that have previously read the 
  disclaimer to bypass it.

- Added a memory check in the ``/start`` endpoint for enabling verification. 
  Verification requires 10 GB of base memory and 0.5 GB per 1 million documents.

Optimizations: 

- Increased internal timeout to reduce the occurrence of timeout failures during 
  initialization
