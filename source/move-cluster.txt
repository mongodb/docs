Considerations
--------------

|service| supports moving M10+ multi-region clusters to new regions.

.. include:: /includes/fact-M0-modify-region.rst

Migration, Downtime and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Depending on the amount of data to migrate, migrations can take a
significant amount of time. To maximize availability for a replica set,
|service| migrates one member at a time, starting with the secondary
members first and then the primary.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity: each newly migrated replica set member must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` are set to read from
secondaries: the replica set is down one secondary during the migration.

VPC Peering (AWS Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you move a cluster out of a region that has a :doc:`VPC
(Virtual Private Cloud) <security-vpc-peering>` peering connection,
the moved cluster can no longer use that peering connection to communicate
with servers in the VPC. Any other clusters with nodes remaining in the
original region can continue to use the VPC peering connection.

You can create multiple VPC connections for each region, including
a new VPC peering connection with the region to which you moved a cluster.

.. note::

   Cluster nodes moved out of a region can no longer inherit access
   rules from an AWS security group or IP whitelisted VPC CIDR blocks
   configured for the VPC peering connection. You must :ref:`add-to-whitelist`
   for all the virtual servers residing in the VPC. Cluster nodes remaining
   in the region are unaffected.

Move a Single-Region Cluster
----------------------------

Use the following procedure to move nodes to an ``M0+`` single-region cluster:
   
.. note::

   You cannot change the cloud provider of an ``M10+`` cluster.
   You can modify the cloud provider of an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier
   or ``M2/M5`` Shared Tier cluster when upgrading to an
   ``M10`` or larger instance size.

Move a Multi-Region Cluster
---------------------------

Use the following procedure to move nodes to one or more regions in an
``M10+`` multi-region cluster:

.. note::

   Each node in the preferred and electable regions can participate in 
   :manual:`replica set elections </core/replica-set-elections>` and can
   become the :term:`primary` as long as the majority of nodes in the
   replica set are available. The total number of electable nodes in the
   cluster, nodes that participate in elections, must be 3, 5, or 7.
