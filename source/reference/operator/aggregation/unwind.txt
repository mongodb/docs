$unwind (aggregation)
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $unwind

   Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a
   document for *each* element. Each output document is the input
   document with the value of the array field replaced by the element.

   The :pipeline:`$unwind` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $unwind: <field path> }

   To specify a field path, prefix the field name with a dollar sign
   ``$`` and enclose in quotes.

Behaviors
---------

:pipeline:`$unwind` has the following behaviors:

- If you specify a path for a field that does not exist in an input
  document, the pipeline ignores the input document and will not output
  documents for that input document.

- If a value in the field specified by the field path is *not* an
  array, :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` generates an error.

- If the array holds an empty array (``[]``) in an input document, the
  pipeline ignores the input document and will not generate any result
  documents.

Examples
--------

Consider an ``inventory`` with the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "ABC1", sizes: [ "S", "M", "L"] }

The following aggregation uses the :pipeline:`$unwind` stage to output
a document for each element in the ``sizes`` array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.aggregate( [ { $unwind : "$sizes" } ] )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "ABC1", "sizes" : "S" }
   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "ABC1", "sizes" : "M" }
   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "ABC1", "sizes" : "L" }

Each document is identical to the input document except for the value
of the ``sizes`` field which now holds a value from the original
``sizes`` array.
