.. operator:: $geoWithin

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   The :operator:`$geoWithin` operator is a geospatial query operator
   that queries for a defined point, line or shape that exists entirely
   within another defined shape. When determining inclusion, MongoDB
   considers the border of a shape to be part of the shape (subject to
   the precision of floating point numbers).

   The :operator:`$geoWithin` operator queries for inclusion in a
   :term:`GeoJSON` polygon or a shape defined by legacy coordinate
   pairs.

   The :operator:`$geoWithin` operator does not return sorted results.
   As a result MongoDB can return :operator:`$geoWithin` queries more
   quickly than geospatial :operator:`$near` or :operator:`$nearSphere`
   queries, which sort results.

   The ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes both support the
   :operator:`$geoWithin` operator.

   If querying for inclusion in a GeoJSON polygon on a sphere, pass the
   polygon to :operator:`$geoWithin` through the :operator:`$geometry`
   operator. Coordinates of a polygon are an array of LinearRing
   coordinate arrays. The first element in the array represents the
   exterior ring. Any subsequent elements represent interior rings (or
   holes).

   For a polygon with only an exterior ring use following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.<collection>.find( { <location field> :
                               { $geoWithin :
                                  { $geometry :
                                     { type : "Polygon" ,
                                       coordinates : [ [ [ <long1>, <lat1> ] , [ <long2>, <lat2> ] ... ] ]
                            } } } } )

   .. important:: Specify coordinates in this order: **"longitude, latitude."**

   For a polygon with an exterior and interior ring use following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.<collection>.find( { <location field> :
                               { $geoWithin :
                                  { $geometry :
                                     { type : "Polygon" ,
                                       coordinates : [ [ [ <long1>, <lat1> ] , [ <long2>, <lat2> ] ... ]
                                                       [ [ <longa>, <lata> ] , [ <longb>, <latb> ] ... ] ]
                            } } } } )

   The following example selects all indexed points and shapes that
   exist entirely within a GeoJSON polygon:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.places.find( { loc :
                        { $geoWithin :
                          { $geometry :
                            { type : "Polygon" ,
                              coordinates: [ [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 3 , 6 ] , [ 6 , 1 ] , [ 0 , 0 ] ] ]
                      } } } } )

   If querying for inclusion in a shape defined by legacy coordinate
   pairs on a plane, use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.<collection>.find( { <location field> :
                               { $geoWithin :
                                  { <shape operator> : <coordinates>
                            } } } )

   For the syntax for a shape operator, see:

     - :operator:`$box`

     - :operator:`$polygon`

     - :operator:`$center` (defines a circle)

     - :operator:`$centerSphere` (defines a circle on a sphere)

.. operator:: $within

   .. deprecated:: 2.4
      :operator:`$geoWithin` replaces :operator:`$within` in MongoDB 2.4.
      Additionally, :operator:`$within` no longer require a geospatial
      index. However, geospatial indexes support much faster queries
      than the unindexed equivalents.
