Scala MongoDB Driver
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

`Casbah <http://github.com/mongodb/casbah>`_ is the officially supported
Scala driver for MongoDB.
It provides wrappers and extensions to the
:doc:`Java Driver </drivers/java>`
meant to allow a more Scala-friendly interface to MongoDB.
It supports serialization/deserialization of common Scala types (including
collections and regex), Scala collection versions of DBObject and
DBList and a fluid query DSL.

- `Salat <https://github.com/novus/salat/>`_ is a simple serialization
  library for case classes. Leverages MongoDB's DBObject
  (which uses BSON underneath) as its target format. Salat is focused
  on fostering a DWIM and intuitive usage pattern for the end-user's
  benefit, without sacrificing run time performance.

- `Blue Eyes <http://github.com/jdegoes/blueeyes>`_ is a lightweight
  framework for building REST APIs with strong MongoDB integration
  including a DSL and Mock MongoDB for testing.

- `Lift Web Framework <http://liftweb.net/>`_ supports MongoDB through
  - `Lift-MongoDB <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/MongoDB>`_
  and object mapping via the
  `Record <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Record>`_ back-end
  implementation.

- `Mssd (MongoDB Synchronous Scala Driver)
  <http://www.webpageanalyse.com/dev/mssd>`_ is a synchronous Scala
  driver which wraps the plain old java driver with a more elegant
  scala friendly API. Mssd focuses on simplicity of use with not too
  much magic involved.

- `Mongolia <https://github.com/nilskp/mongolia>` is a type-safe Scala
  DSL, based on the v2.+ Java driver. It enforces type-safety by implicitly
  converting non-BSON values to BSON, fully configurably. It also bypasses
  the Java drivers' UUID bug by storing UUIDs as type 4 Binary.
