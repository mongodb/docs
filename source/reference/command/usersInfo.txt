.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: usersInfo

   Returns information about one or more users. To view a user's
   information, your privileges must include the :authaction:`viewUser`
   action on the user's database. You always can view your own
   information.

   To match a single user on the database, use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { usersInfo: { user: < name >, db: < db > },
        showCredentials: < Boolean >,
        showPrivileges: < Boolean >
      }

   The ``showCredentials`` field is optional. Set the field to ``true``
   to display the user's password hash. By default, this field is
   ``false``.

   The ``showPrivileges`` field is optional. Set the field to ``true``
   to show the user's full set of privileges, including expanded
   information for all child roles taken from the
   :ref:`admin.system.roles <admin-system-roles-collection>`
   collection. By default, this field is ``false``.

   For example, to see information and privileges, but not the
   credentials, for the user ``"Kari"`` defined in ``"home"`` database,
   run the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        usersInfo:  { user: "Kari", db: "home" },
        showPrivileges: true
      }

   To view a user that exists in the database on which the command is
   run, you can specify the user by name only. For example, if you are
   in the ``home`` database and a user named ``"Kari"`` exists in the
   ``home`` database, you can run the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        usersInfo:  "Kari",
        showPrivileges: true
      }

   To view info for several users, use an array, with or
   without the optional fields. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { usersInfo: [ { user: "Kari", db: "home" }, { user: "Li", db: "myApp" } ],
        showPrivileges: true
      }

   To view all users on the database the command is run, set
   ``userInfo`` to 1:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { usersInfo: 1 }

   When viewing all users, you can specify the ``showCredentials``
   field but not the ``showPrivileges`` field.
