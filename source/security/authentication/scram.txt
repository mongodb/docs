Overview
--------

**Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)** is a family of
authentication mechanisms that use a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate
the user. SCRAM-SHA-256, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm to hash your password, is the
default authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} version 4.0
and later. SCRAM-SHA-1, which uses the SHA-1 algorithm instead, is the default
authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} versions earlier than 4.0.

You can use SCRAM to authenticate to MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB
Enterprise Advanced, and MongoDB Community Edition.

.. tip:: SCRAM Mechanisms

   To learn more about the SCRAM family of authentication mechanisms, see
   `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`__ and
   :wikipedia:`Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism <Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism>`
   on Wikipedia.

   For more information about the MongoDB implementation of SCRAM, see
   :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Code Placeholders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

- ``+srv``: Include this option in your connection string prefix only if you are connecting
  to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. To learn more about the ``+srv`` option, see
  :manual:`Connection String Formats </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-formats>`
  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
- ``<db_username>``: The MongoDB username of the user to authenticate.
- ``<db_password>``: The MongoDB password of the user to authenticate.
- ``<hostname>``: The network address of your MongoDB deployment.
- ``<port>``: The port number of your MongoDB deployment. If you omit this parameter,
  the driver uses the default port number (``27017``). You don't need a port number
  when connecting to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
- ``<authenticationDb>``: The MongoDB database that contains the user's authentication
  data. If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default value, ``admin``.
- ``<authenticationMechanism>``: Set to ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

To use the code examples on this page, replace these placeholders with your own values.

Using SCRAM Authentication in Your Application
----------------------------------------------

To use SCRAM to authenticate, set the ``authMechanism`` connection option to ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
or ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.
You can set this option in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClient
      :tabid: mongoclient

      .. code-block:: python

         client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb[+srv]://<hostname>:<port>",
                                      username="<db_username>",
                                      password="<db_password>",
                                      authSource="<authenticationDb>",
                                      authMechanism="<authenticationMechanism>")

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. code-block:: python

         uri = ("mongodb[+srv]://<percent-encoded db_username>:<percent-encoded db_password>"
                "@<hostname>:<port>/?"
                "authSource=<authenticationDb>"
                "&authMechanism=<authenticationMechanism>")
         client = pymongo.MongoClient(uri)
