Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your
cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the
event of data loss.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for an |service|
   project to manage backups for or to restore a backup to clusters in
   that project.

Cloud for Government Considerations
-----------------------------------

Commercial and government cloud provider backups are not compatible 
with one another. If you create a backup from a government region-only 
project, you may only restore that data to a government region-only 
project. The same is true for commercial region-only projects.

For a list of regions by cloud provider, see :ref:`<supported-regions>`.
