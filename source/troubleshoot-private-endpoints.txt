      **SRV Record for DNS Seedlist Private Endpoint-Aware Connection 
      Strings**

      The following example shows the SRV record for an {+aws-pl+}
      -enabled single-region {+cluster+}, showing three unique ports 
      defined for ``pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net``:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false
         
         $ nslookup -type=SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net

         Server: 127.0.0.53
         Address: 127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1026 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1024 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1025 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.

      In the preceding example:

      - ``_mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net`` is the SRV
        record that the
        ``mongodb+srv://cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net``
        connection string references.

      - ``pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net`` is the hostname for each
        node in one |service| {+cluster+} in one region for which 
        you have configured {+aws-pl+}.

      - ``1024``, ``1025``, and ``1026`` are unique ports that 
        |service| assigns on the load balancer for each |service| 
        replica set node in the region for which you enabled 
        {+aws-pl+}. All nodes in an |service| replica set are 
        accessible via the same hostname, with the load balancer 
        resolving individual nodes by their unique port.

      **Hostname DNS Resolution in Private Endpoint-Aware Connection 
      Strings and SRV Records**

      The hostname in the SRV record and the standard connection string 
      is a |dns| Canonical Name (``CNAME``) record that resolves to the
      endpoint-specific regional |dns| name that |aws| generates for the
      interface endpoint. A |dns| ``ALIAS`` record exists for each 
      subnet in your |vpc| that you deployed the interface endpoint to. 
      Each ``ALIAS`` record contains the private IP address of the 
      :term:`interface endpoint` for that subnet.

      The following example shows the |dns| lookup for the hostname in 
      the SRV record and in the standard connection string, including 
      the endpoint-specific regional |dns| name for the interface 
      endpoint and its |dns| ``ALIAS`` records:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net
         Server: 127.0.0.53
         Address: 127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net
         canonical name = vpce-024f5b57108c8d3ed-ypwbxwll.vpce-svc-02863655456245e5c.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com.

         Name: vpce-024f5b57108c8d3ed-ypwbxwll.vpce-svc-02863655456245e5c.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com

      Multi-Region Private Endpoints 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Private endpoints are only available in multi-region clusters if there is a 
      node within each region that the cluster spans that has a private endpoint 
      configured. To learn more about configuring multi-region private endpoints, see 
      :ref:`Regionalized Private Endpoints for Multi-Region Sharded Clusters <atlas_regionalized-pl>`.

      Test Connectivity from Your Deployed Application
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can use the tools ``nslookup`` and ``telnet`` to test the connectivity 
      from your application to your Private Endpoint in |service|. 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Get the connection details for your |service| {+cluster+}.

            Run ``nslookup`` with the ``-type=SRV`` flag to get the port numbers 
            associated with each of the nodes in your {+cluster+}.

            .. io-code-block:: 
               :copyable: true 

               .. input:: 
                  :language: bash

                   nslookup -type=SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net

               .. output::
                  :language: bash

                   Server: 127.0.0.53
                   Address: 127.0.0.53#53
                   Non-authoritative answer:
                   _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1026 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.
                   _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1024 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.
                   _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.k45tj.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1025 pl-0-us-east-1.k45tj.mongodb.net.

         .. step:: Test the connectivity.

            From your application environment, with one of the listed ports (for example, 
            ``1026``, ``1024`` or ``1025`` in the example output above), run the 
            following ``telnet`` command to test connectivity:

            .. code-block:: bash

               telnet pl-0-<xyz>.mongodb.net 1024
               telnet pl-0-<xyz>.mongodb.net 1025

         * - Deleting
           - |service| is removing the private endpoint 
             connection from the {+az-pl+} Service.

      Obtain Private IPs with DNS Lookup
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      When a client in your VNet connects to an |service| cluster using
      one of these private endpoint-aware connection strings, the
      client attempts to establish a connection to the Private Link
      Service in the |service| VNet through the private endpoint's
      network interface. The Private Link service sends traffic through
      an |azure| Standard Load Balancer to the |service| cluster nodes
      that you deployed in that region. Your client's |dns| resolution
      mechanism handles resolving the hostname to the network
      interface's private IP address. The driver is only aware of the
      hostname in the connection string, listening on one port for each 
      node in the cluster's replica set.

      **SRV Record for DNS Seedlist Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings**

      The following example shows the SRV record for an 
      {+az-pl+}-enabled single-region cluster, showing three unique
      ports defined for ``pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net``:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup -type=SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.mongodb.net

         Server:  127.0.0.53
         Address:  127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1024 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1025 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1026 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net.

      In the preceding example:

      - ``_mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.mongodb.net`` is
        the SRV record that the connection string references.

      - ``pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net`` is the hostname for
        each node in one |service| cluster in one region for which
        you have configured {+az-pl+}.

      - ``1024``, ``1025``, and ``1026`` are unique ports that 
        |service| assigns on the load balancer for each |service|
        replica set node in the region for which you enabled 
        {+az-pl+}. All nodes in an |service| replica set are
        accessible via the same hostname, with the load balancer
        resolving individual nodes by their unique port.

      **Hostname DNS Resolution in Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings and SRV Records**

      The hostname in the SRV record and the standard connection string
      is a |dns| ``A`` record that resolves to the private IP address
      of the private endpoint's network interface. 

      The following example shows the |dns| lookup for the hostname in
      the SRV record and in the standard connection string:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net
         Server:  127.0.0.53
         Address:  127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         Name:	pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.mongodb.net
         Address: 10.0.0.4
