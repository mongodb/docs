Introduction
------------

This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the **Kotlin driver**
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB
using a different driver or programming language, see our
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

The Kotlin driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters
from a Kotlin application.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your
own free (no credit card required) cluster.

Consult the following steps to connect your Kotlin application with a MongoDB Atlas
cluster.

Set up Your Project
-------------------

Install Kotlin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that your system has Kotlin installed running on JDK 1.8 or later.
For more information on getting started with Kotlin/JVM development,
refer to `Get started with Kotlin/JVM <{+kotlin-docs+}/jvm-get-started.html>`__
in the Kotlin language documentation.

Create the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Kotlin driver dependencies using
Gradle or Maven. We recommend that you use an integrated development
environment (IDE) such as Intellij IDEA or Eclipse IDE to make it more convenient
to configure Gradle or Maven to build and run your project.

If you are not using an IDE, see
`Creating New Gradle Builds <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
or  `Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
for more information on how to set up your project.

.. _add-mongodb-dependency:

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list:

.. code-block:: kotlin
   :caption: build.gradle.kts

   dependencies {
       implementation("org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine:{+full-version+}")
       implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:+")
   }

If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the following to
your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: pom.xml

   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
           <artifactId>mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine</artifactId>
           <version>{+full-version+}</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>

Once you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
project which may require running your dependency manager and refreshing
the project in your IDE.

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

After setting up your Kotlin project dependencies, create a MongoDB cluster
where you can store and manage your data. Complete the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?jmp=docs_driver_kotlin>` guide
to set up a new Atlas account, create and launch a free tier MongoDB cluster,
load datasets, and interact with the data.

After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you should have a new MongoDB
cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded
into your cluster.

Connect to your Cluster
-----------------------

In this step, we create and run an application that uses the MongoDB Kotlin
driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster and run a query on the sample data.

We pass instructions to the driver on how to connect to your
MongoDB cluster in a string called the *connection string*. This string
includes information on the hostname or IP address and port of your
cluster, authentication mechanism, user credentials when applicable, and
other connection options.

If you are connecting to an instance or cluster that is not hosted by Atlas,
see :ref:`Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB <kotlin-other-ways-to-connect>` for
instructions on how to format your connection string.

To retrieve your connection string for the cluster and user you created in
the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
:guilabel:`Database` section and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button for the cluster that you
want to connect to as shown below.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_select_cluster.png
   :alt: Atlas Connection GUI cluster selection screen

.. TODO:(DOCSP-29148) will have to update the image and description of UI for kotlin

Proceed to the :guilabel:`Connect Your Application` step and select the Java driver.
Select "4.9 or Later" for the version.
Click the :guilabel:`Copy` icon to copy the *connection string* to your clipboard as
shown below.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_copy_string_java.png
   :alt: Atlas Connection GUI connection string screen

Save your Atlas connection string in a safe location that you can access
for the next step.

Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, create a file ``QuickStartDataClassExample.kt``. Use the following sample
code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas, replacing the
value of the ``uri`` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
The example uses a Kotlin data class to model MongoDB data.

Ensure you replace the "<password>" section of the connection string with
the password you created for your user that has **atlasAdmin** permissions.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/QuickStartDataClassExample.snippet.quick-start-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :caption: QuickStartDataClassExample.kt

When you run the ``main`` function, it should output the details
of the movie from the sample dataset which should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Movie(
      title=Back to the Future,
      year=1985,
      cast=[Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover]
   )

.. TODO:(DOCSP-29224): add back in when document data format data classes are documented
.. To learn more about using data classes to store and retrieve data, refer to
.. :ref:`Document Data Format: Data Classes <fundamentals-data-classes>`.

If you receive no output or an error, check whether you included the proper
connection string in your Kotlin class, and whether you loaded the sample dataset
into your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

.. important:: Known connection issue when using TLS v1.3

   If you encounter an error connecting to your MongoDB instance or cluster
   that resembles the following while running your application, you may need
   to update your JDK to the latest patch release:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request

   This exception is a known issue when using the TLS 1.3 protocol with
   specific versions of JDK, but was fixed for the following releases:

   - JDK 11.0.7
   - JDK 13.0.3
   - JDK 14.0.2

   To resolve this error, update your JDK to one of the preceding patch
   versions or a newer one.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the Kotlin driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
sample data, and print out the result.

Working with the Document Class (Alternative)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous section, you ran a query on a sample collection to retrieve
data with a data class. In this section, you can learn to
use a `Document <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__ class
to store and retrieve data from MongoDB.

Next, create a new file to contain your application called ``QuickStartDocumentExample.kt``
in the base package directory of your project. Use the following sample
code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas, replacing the
value of the ``uri`` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/QuickStartDocumentExample.snippet.quick-start-document.kt
   :caption: QuickStartDocumentExample.kt
   :language: kotlin

When you run the ``main`` function, it should output the details
of the movie from the sample dataset which will look something like this:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     _id: ...,
     plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
     genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
     ...
     title: 'Back to the Future',
     ...
   }

If you receive no output or an error, check whether you included the proper
connection string in your Kotlin class, and whether you loaded the sample dataset
into your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
