===========================================
Update a {+FDI+} Region
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. meta::
   :keywords: choose region, atlas ui, atlas cli
   :description: Change the cloud provider region for your federated database instance and update the connection string to ensure requests are routed through the new region.

You can change the cloud provider region through which your {+fdi+}
requests are routed. By default, {+df+} requests are routed through
the region that is closest to your client application. The region that
is closest to your application may be different from the regions that
house your data stores.

.. note::

   If you change the cloud provider region through which your {+fdi+}
   requests are routed, you must update your {+fdi+} connection string
   with the new hostname. This change ensures that your requests are
   routed through the new region.

Required Access
---------------

To update your {+fdi+} region, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.
Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner``
to the project before setting up a private endpoint.

Procedure
---------

To change the |aws| region through which your {+fdi+} requests are 
routed, do the following in the {+atlas-cli+} or |service| UI:

.. tabs::
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-dataFederation-update.rst
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
 
      .. include:: /includes/steps/adf-update-region.rst
