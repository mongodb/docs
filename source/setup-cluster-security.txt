You can use |service| securely out of the box. |service| comes 
preconfigured with secure default settings. You can fine-tune 
the security features for your {+database-deployments+} to meet your 
unique security needs and preferences. Review the following security 
features and considerations for {+database-deployments+}.

.. important::

   As a security best practice, don't include sensitive information in 
   namespaces and field names. |service| doesn't obfuscate this 
   information.

Preconfigured Security Features
-------------------------------

The following security features are part of the |service| product:

:abbr:`FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard Publication)` 140-2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| automatically enables :abbr:`FIPS (Federal Information
Processing Standard Publication)` 140-2 level 2 for all databases.

.. _security-tls:

Encryption in Transit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| requires |tls-ssl| to encrypt the connections to your 
databases.

|tls-ssl| certificates are:

- Valid for 90 days from the day |service| issues the certificate.
- Rotated 42 days before the certificate's expiration date.

To learn more about TLS encryption, see the :website:`Atlas Security White Paper
</resources/products/capabilities/mongodb-atlas-security>`.

To configure SSL or TLS OCSP certificate revocation checking, see 
:ref:`oscp-cert-check`.

.. _security-vpc:

Virtual Private Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All |service| projects with one or more M10+ {+dedicated-clusters+}
receive their own dedicated |vpc| (or VNet if you use |azure|). 
|service| deploys all {+dedicated-clusters+} inside this |vpc| or VNet.

Encryption at Rest 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, |service| encrypts all data stored on your |service| {+database-deployments+}. 
|service| also supports :ref:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management 
<security-kms-encryption>`. 

Required Security Features
--------------------------

You *must* configure the following security features:

Network and Firewall Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-open-network-ports.rst

.. _security-ip-access-list:

IP Access List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| only allows client connections to the {+database-deployment+} from entries in
the project's IP access list. To connect, you must add an entry to the
IP access list. To set up the IP access list for the project, see
:doc:`/security/ip-access-list`.

For |service| {+clusters+} deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
:ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the |ipaddr| addresses of your |gcp| or
|azure| services to |service| project |ipaddr| access list to grant
those services access to the {+cluster+}.

User Authentication or Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| requires clients to authenticate to connect to the database. 
You must create database users to access the database. To set up 
database users to your {+database-deployments+}, see
:doc:`security-add-mongodb-users`. |service| offers many 
security features for :ref:`{+database-deployment+} authentication and authorization <db-deployment-auth>`.

To access {+database-deployments+} in a project, users must belong to 
that project. Users can belong to multiple projects.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`atlas-access`.

Optional Security Features
--------------------------

You *may* configure the following security features:

Network Peering Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports peering connections with other |aws|, |azure|, or 
|gcp| network peering connections. To learn more, see 
:doc:`security-vpc-peering`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-vpc-per-project-no-link.rst

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports private endpoints on: 

- |aws| using the `{+aws-pl+} <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__
  feature

- |azure| using the `{+az-pl+}
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/private-link/>`__ feature

- |gcp| using the `{+gcp-psc+} <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`__ 
  feature

To use private endpoints, see :doc:`security-private-endpoint`.

Unified AWS Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some |service| features, including :ref:`Data Federation 
<atlas-data-federation>` and :doc:`security-kms-encryption`, use |aws| 
`IAM roles
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__
for authentication.

To set up an |aws| IAM role for |service| to use, see
:ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`.

.. _db-deployment-auth:

{+Database-Deployment+} Authentication and Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| offers the following security features for 
{+database-deployment+} authentication and authorization.

Database User Authentication or Authorization
`````````````````````````````````````````````

|service| requires clients to authenticate to access
{+database-deployments+}. You must create database users to access the
database. To set up database users for your {+database-deployments+}, 
see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

Custom Roles for Database Authorization
```````````````````````````````````````

|service| supports creating :ref:`custom roles <mongodb-roles>`
for database authorization in cases where the built-in |service|
:ref:`roles <atlas-user-privileges>` don't grant your desired set of 
privileges.

Authentication with AWS IAM
```````````````````````````

You can set up authentication and authorization for your |aws| |iam|
roles. To learn more, see :ref:`set-up-pwdless-auth`.

User Authentication or Authorization with |ldap|
````````````````````````````````````````````````

|service| supports performing user authentication and authorization
with |ldap|. To use |ldap|, see
:doc:`Set Up User Authentication and Authorization with LDAP
</security-ldaps>`.

User Authentication with X.509
``````````````````````````````

X.509 client certificates provide database users access to the 
{+database-deployments+} in your project. Options for X.509 
authentication include |service|-managed X.509 authentication and 
self-managed X.509 authentication. To learn more 
about self-managed X.509 authentication, see :ref:`self-managed-x509`.

Restrict MongoDB Support Access to |service| Backend Infrastructure
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Organization owners can restrict MongoDB Production Support Employees
from accessing |service| backend infrastructure for any |service|
{+database-deployment+} in their organization. Organization owners may 
grant a 24 hour bypass to the access restriction at the |service| 
{+database-deployment+} level.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restrict-support-access.rst

To enable this option, see :doc:`security-restrict-support-access`.

Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports using |aws| |kms|, Azure Key Vault, and |gcp| to
encrypt storage engines and cloud provider backups. To use encryption
at rest, see :doc:`security-kms-encryption`.

Client-Side Field Level Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports :manual:`client-side field level encryption
</core/security-client-side-encryption>`, including
:manual:`automatic </core/security-automatic-client-side-encryption>`
encryption of fields. All |service| users are entitled to use MongoDB's 
automatic client-side field level encryption features.

To learn more, see
:driver:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption Requirements
</security/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide#requirements>`.

.. note::

   :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>`, the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+}
   <atlas-ui>`, and the :mdb-shell:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   (``mongosh``) do not support decrypting client-side field
   level-encrypted fields.

|service| supports auditing all system event actions. To use database
auditing, see :doc:`Set up Database Auditing </database-auditing>`.

Access Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| surfaces authentication logs directly in the {+atlas-ui+} so 
that you can easily review successful and unsuccesful authentication 
attempts made against your {+database-deployment+}s. To view your 
database access history, see :doc:`access-tracking`.

Multi-Factor Authentication for {+atlas-ui+} Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports |mfa| to help you control access to your 
|service| accounts. To set up |mfa|, see :ref:`atlas-enable-mfa`.

.. _oscp-cert-check:

OCSP Certificate Revocation Check 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your network allows outbound requests to specific IP addresses only, 
to allow |ssl| or |tls| :abbr:`OCSP (Online Certificate Status 
Protocol)` certificate revocation checking, you must allow access to 
|service|\' CA (Certificate Authority) :abbr:`OCSP (Online Certificate 
Status Protocol)` Responder servers that can be found in the 
:abbr:`OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)` |url| of the |ssl| or 
|tls| certificate. 

To disable :abbr:`OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)` 
certificate revocation checking, refer to the documentation 
for the :driver:`MongoDB driver </>` version that your application uses.
