The {+atlas-admin-api+} doesn't provide access to the data stored in
your clusters. To read or write data in a database, you must
authenticate to your cluster using the credentials for a :ref:`database
user <security-database-users>` with the appropriate read or write
:ref:`roles <database-user-roles>`. You can use the {+atlas-admin-api+}
to create and manage database users.
