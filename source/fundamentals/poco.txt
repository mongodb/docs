Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how you can use ":wikipedia:`Plain Old CLR/Class
Objects <Plain_old_CLR_object>`", or **POCOs**, with the {+driver-short+} for your operations
and queries. POCOs are simple class objects that do not inherit
features from any framework-specific base class and do not return any
special types. We recommend using POCOs in your {+language+} code to
adhere to idiomatic driver usage and achieve the best performance.

You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how to use
POCOs with the {+driver-short+} or if you need to adjust the driver's default
field mapping behavior.

Create a POCO
-------------

You can create a POCO by defining a simple class that does not
implement interfaces or extend classes from a framework. When you
execute an operation such as a read or write using a POCO, the driver
internally *serializes*, or converts, the POCO to BSON.

Select the :guilabel:`POCO` or :guilabel:`BSON` tab to see how the
driver serializes a sample POCO to BSON:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: POCO
      :tabid: poco-representation

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: false

         public class Clothing
         {
             public ObjectId Id { get; set; }
             public string Name { get; set; }
             public bool InStock { get; set; }
             public double Price { get; set; }
             public List<string> ColorSelection { get; set; }
         }

   .. tab:: BSON
      :tabid: bson-representation

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
           "_id": ObjectId("..."),
           "Name": "Long Sleeve Shirt",
           "InStock": true,
           "Price": 17.99,
           "ColorSelection": [ "black", "navy", "red" ]
         }

You can define a POCO with any object structure that suits your
needs, including nested objects, arrays, lists, and any data types.

Custom Serialization
--------------------

If the default field mapping behavior does not meet your needs, you can
specify custom behavior using serialization-related attributes. These
attributes change the way that the driver serializes each property of
your POCO. This section describes some of the common
serialization-related attributes.

Set Field Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver serializes POCO properties to BSON fields with the same field
name and capitalization. To store a property under a different name, use
the ``[BsonElement()]`` attribute. The following code maps the
``YearBuilt`` property of the ``House`` class to the ``year_built``
field in the serialized BSON document:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   public class House
   {
       public ObjectId Id { get; set; }

       [BsonElement("year_built")]
       public int YearBuilt { get; set; }
   }

Though it is common to use the Pascal case naming convention when
defining {+language+} classes, using the ``[BsonElement()]`` attribute
allows you to select a different or custom naming convention in your
MongoDB collection.

.. tip:: Set Custom Field Name Convention
   
   If you want to serialize every property with a custom field name, you
   can define a ``ConventionPack`` instead of using the
   ``[BsonElement()]`` attribute. For example, if you define your class
   using the Pascal case naming convention, you can use the following
   code to use camel case field names in the serialized document:

   .. literalinclude:: ../includes/fundamentals/code-examples/poco.cs
      :start-after: start-conventionpack
      :end-before: end-conventionpack
      :language:  csharp
      :copyable:
      :dedent:

Select Type Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To serialize a {+language+} property to a specific BSON type, use the
``[BsonRepresentation()]`` attribute. This works only if the
{+language+} primitive type is convertible to the BSON type you specify.
In the following code sample, the ``YearBuilt`` property, defined as a
``char`` in {+language+}, is serialized as a BSON ``Int32`` type:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   public class House
   {
       public ObjectId Id { get; set; }

       [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.Int32)]
       public char YearBuilt { get; set; }
   }

For more information on valid type conversions, see the `{+language+}
Conversions Specification
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/conversions>`__.

Set Field Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver serializes properties to BSON fields in the order they
are specified in the POCO. To store properties in a custom order to
match an existing schema, you can specify the ``Order`` named
parameter in the ``[BsonElement()]`` attribute. In the following code
sample, the driver stores the ``YearBuilt`` property after the
``Style`` property:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   public class House
   {
       public ObjectId Id { get; set; }

       [BsonElement(Order = 2)]
       public int YearBuilt { get; set; }

       [BsonElement(Order = 1)]
       public string Style { get; set; }
   }

If any properties don't have an explicit ``Order``, the driver will
serialize them in the default order after those that do.

Identify ``Id`` Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the driver maps any public property named ``Id``, ``id``, or
``_id`` to the BSON ``_id`` field. To explicitly select the
property to map to the ``_id`` field, use the ``[BsonId()]`` attribute.
The following code sample maps the ``Identifier`` property to the
``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   public class House
   {
       [BsonId]
       public string Identifier { get; set; }
   }

.. warning:: Multiple Id Fields

   If you identify more than one property as the ``_id`` field using the
   ``[BsonId()]`` attribute, the driver throws a
   ``DuplicateBsonMemberMapAttributeException``. If your POCO
   properties use more than one of the three recognized field
   names (``Id``, ``id``, and ``_id``), the driver throws a
   ``BsonSerializationException``.

Omit Empty Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the driver serializes undefined properties to fields with ``null``
values. To ignore undefined properties during serialization, use the ``[BsonIgnore()]``
attribute. The following code shows how you can prevent the driver from
serializing the ``YearBuilt`` property if it is undefined:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   public class House
   {
       public ObjectId Id { get; set; }

       [BsonIgnore]
       public int YearBuilt { get; set; }
       public string Style { get; set; }
   }

Example
-------

The following example shows how to insert a ``Clothing`` document with custom field
mapping specifications into MongoDB.

The following code defines the ``Clothing`` class with these
serialization-related attributes:

- ``[BsonElement()]``, which specifies custom field names in the camel case naming convention
- ``[BsonRepresentation()]``, which specifies serialization of the ``Price`` field as a BSON ``Double`` type

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/fundamentals/code-examples/poco.cs
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model
   :language:  csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The following code instantiates a ``Clothing`` object and inserts the document into a collection:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/fundamentals/code-examples/poco.cs
   :start-after: start-insert
   :end-before: end-insert
   :language:  csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The BSON representation of the inserted document looks like this:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": ObjectId("..."),
     "name": "Denim Jacket",
     "inStock": false,
     "price": 32.99,
     "colorSelection": [ "dark wash", "light wash" ]
   }
