==============================================================
Development Release Notes for MongoDB 2.8.0 Release Candidates
==============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.8 is currently in development. While 2.8 release candidates
are currently available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing
only and not for production use**.

Major Changes
-------------

Storage Engines: Improved Concurrency, Document-Level Locking with Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.8 includes support for two storage engines: MMAPv1, the
storage engine available in previous versions of MongoDB, and
`WiredTiger <http://wiredtiger.com>`_. By
default, in 2.8 MongoDB uses the MMAPv1 engine.

In 2.8 MMAPv1 adds support for collection-level locking by
default. With the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB now provides
document-level locking and compression. WiredTiger supports all
MongoDB features and
can interoperate with MMAPv1 in the same replica set or sharded cluster,
but requires a change to the on-disk storage format. To convert an
existing data set to WiredTiger, you can either:

- upgrade replica sets in a rolling manner. See
  :ref:`2.8-upgrade-replica-set` or :ref:`2.8-upgrade-cluster`, or

- use :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` to import
  data.

To enable WiredTiger, start MongoDB with the following option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger

If you attempt to start a :program:`mongod` with a
:setting:`storage.dbPath` that contains data files produced by a
storage engine other than the one specified by ``--storageEngine``,
:program:`mongod` will refuse to start.

Start :program:`mongod` with the ``--wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes``
option to store indexes and collections in separate directories. Use
this capability to store indexes and data on separate storage
devices. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes

WiredTiger has additional options that you can configure
at start up time. To configure the storage engine
for a :program:`mongod` instance, use the following option:

.. code-block:: sh

   --wiredTigerEngineConfig "<option>=<setting>,<option>=<setting>"

Specify a comma-separated list of options in quotes on the command
line. See the `WiredTiger storage engine options
<http://source.wiredtiger.com/2.4.1/group__wt.html#ga9e6adae3fc6964ef837a62795c7840ed>`_.

You can modify the WiredTiger storage engine
configuration options of a running :program:`mongod` instance with the
:parameter:`wiredTigerEngineRuntimeConfigSetting` parameter, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { "setParameter": 1,
                      "wiredTigerEngineRuntimeConfigSetting": "<option>=<setting>,<option>=<setting>" })

To change WiredTiger settings for all new collections, use the following option:

.. code-block:: sh

   --wiredTigerCollectionConfig "<option>=<setting>,<option>=<setting>"

To change WiredTiger settings for all new indexes:

.. code-block:: sh

   --wiredTigerIndexConfig "<option>=<setting>,<option>=<setting>"

Specify a comma-separated list of options in quotes on the command
line. See the `wired tiger index and collection-level options
<http://source.wiredtiger.com/2.4.1/struct_w_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n.html#a358ca4141d59c345f401c58501276bbb>`_.

You can also configure WiredTiger on a per-collection basis using
:method:`db.createCollection()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection("<collectionName>", {storageEngine: {
                                               wiredtiger: {configString: "<option>=<setting>,<option>=<setting>"}}});

All existing server, database, and collection reporting exposes
statistics from WiredTiger, including: :method:`db.serverStatus()`,
:method:`db.stats()`, :method:`db.collection.stats()`, and
:method:`db.collection.validate()`.

WiredTiger supports compression by default on all collections using
the *Snappy* library.

Increased Number of Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB replica sets now support larger maximum replica set sizes up
to 50 members. As in earlier releases, replica sets may only have a
maximum of 7 voting members.

Use the following drivers with larger replica sets:

- C# (.NET) Driver
- Java Driver 2.12 or 2.13
- Python Driver (PyMongo) 3.0+
- Ruby Driver 2.0+
- Node.JS Driver 2.0+

Because the he C, C++, Perl, PHP, and earlier versions of the Ruby,
Python, and Node.JS drivers discover and monitor replica set members
serially, these drivers are not suitable for use with large replica
sets.

Security Improvements
---------------------

Adds ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` Authentication Mechanism
---------------------------------------------

MongoDB 2.8 adds a new ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication mechanism.

Changes to the Localhost Exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using :ref:`localhost-exception` to access MongoDB, you have limited
access and can only create a user in the ``admin`` database.

Query Engine Improvements
-------------------------

Query Introspection Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.8 includes a new query introspection system exposed in the
:method:`~cursor.explain()` method which is available on all
MongoDB query operations. (e.g. :method:`db.collection.find()`,
:method:`db.collection.remove()`, :method:`db.collection.update()`) operations.

See the  ``queryPlanner``, ``executionStats``, and
``serverInfo`` fields in the output of :method:`~cursor.explain()` for
new information on query execution and workload.

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For sharded collections, indexes can now cover queries that execute against the
primary.

   ``source/release-notes/2.8-general-improvements.rst`` file that we
   will fill in with the full release notes for 2.8. In the meantime,
   this section should contain a bulleted list of important changes.
