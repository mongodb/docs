To install MongoDB |edition| on your |distro-name| system, these
instructions will use the official |package-name| package, which is
maintained and supported by MongoDB Inc. The official |package-name|
package always contains the latest version of MongoDB, and is available
from its own dedicated repo.

.. important::

   The ``mongodb`` package provided by |distro-name| is **not**
   maintained by MongoDB Inc. and conflicts with the official
   |package-name| package. If you have already installed the ``mongodb``
   package on your |distro-name| system, you **must** first uninstall
   the ``mongodb`` package before proceeding with these instructions.
