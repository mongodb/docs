Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+php-library+} to run a replace
operation on a MongoDB collection. A replace operation performs differently
than an update operation. An update operation modifies only the specified
fields in a target document. A replace operation removes *all* fields
in the target document and replaces them with new ones.

To replace a document, use the ``MongoDB\Collection::replaceOne()`` method.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your PHP application, instantiate a ``MongoDB\Client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following value to your ``$collection`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/project.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Replace Operation
-----------------

You can perform a replace operation by using ``MongoDB\Collection::replaceOne()``. 
This method removes all fields except the ``_id`` field from the first document that
matches the search criteria. It then inserts the fields and values you specify into the 
document.

Required Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``replaceOne()`` method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter** document, which determines the documents to replace. For
  more information about query filters, see the 
  :manual:`Query Filter Documents section </core/document/#query-filter-documents>` in
  the {+mdb-server+} manual. 
- **Replace** document, which specifies the fields and values to insert in the new 
  document.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``replaceOne()`` method returns a ``MongoDB\UpdateResult`` 
object. The ``MongoDB\UpdateResult`` type contains the following
methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many were updated.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents modified by the update operation. If an updated
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.

   * - ``getUpsertedCount()``
     - | Returns the number of documents upserted into the database, if any.

   * - ``getUpsertedId()``
     - | Returns the ID of the document that was upserted in the database, if the driver
         performed an upsert.

   * - ``isAcknowledged()``
     - | Returns a boolean indicating whether the write operation was acknowledged.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``replaceOne()`` method to replace the fields and values
of a document in which the ``name`` field value is ``'Pizza Town'``. It then prints
the number of modified documents:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/write/replace.php
      :start-after: start-replace-one
      :end-before: end-replace-one
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      Modified documents: 1

.. important::

   The values of ``_id`` fields are immutable. If your replacement document specifies 
   a value for the ``_id`` field, it must match the ``_id`` value of the existing document.

Modify the Replace Operation
----------------------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``MongoDB\Collection::replaceOne()`` method
by passing an array that specifies option values as a parameter. The following
table describes some options you can set in the array:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``upsert``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-upsert>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         replace documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``sort``
     - | Specifies the sort order to apply to documents before
         performing the replace operation.

   * - ``collation``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``hint``
     - | Gets or sets the index to scan for documents. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``session``
     - | Specifies the client session to associate with the operation.

   * - ``let``
     - | Specifies a document with a list of values to improve operation readability.
         Values must be constant or closed expressions that don't reference document
         fields. For more information, see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment``
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``replaceOne()`` method to find the first document
in which the ``name`` field has the value ``'Food Town'``, then replaces this document 
with a new document in which the ``name`` value is ``'Food World'``. Because the
``upsert`` option is set to ``true``, the library inserts a new document if the query
filter doesn't match any existing documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/replace.php
   :start-after: start-replace-options
   :end-before: end-replace-options
   :language: php
   :copyable:
