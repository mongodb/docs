Introduction
------------

This tutorial explores features and capabilities of |charts| with
a :doc:`data source </data-sources>` containing information gleaned
from `IMDb <https://www.imdb.com/>`_ and `Rotten Tomatoes
<https://www.rottentomatoes.com/>`_. The tutorial demonstrates how to
use filters to refine a large result set down to an easily
understandable chart, as well as how to use multi-series charts and
multiple :ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` to add further
insights to your charts.

In this tutorial, you'll create two charts: a sorted column
chart and a scatter chart.

- The :ref:`sorted column chart <movie-details-column>`
  displays columns representing the number
  of awards won by directors with at least 50 total awards,
  sorted from highest to lowest and broken down by film genre.

- The :ref:`scatter chart <movie-details-scatter>` shows
  a diagram of movies with at least one
  award win along with their TomatoMeter rating
  and their :abbr:`MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)` rating
  (G, PG, PG-13, or R).
