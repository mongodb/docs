   .. note::
   
      If :guilabel:`Enforce Consistent Set` is set to ``Yes``, the
      custom role is also removed from managed MongoDB processes. If
      :guilabel:`Enforce Consistent Set` is set to ``No``, you must
      manually remove the role with the
      :manual:`dropRole </reference/command/dropRole>` command.
