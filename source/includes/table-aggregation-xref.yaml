v8: |
    Prior to 2.4, JavaScript code executed in a single thread.
grp1: |
   Provides grouping functionality.

   Is slower than the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and has less
   functionality than the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command.

grp2: |
      Can either group by existing fields or with a custom ``keyf``
      JavaScript function, can group by calculated fields.

      See :dbcommand:`group` for information and example using the 
      ``keyf`` function.
grp3: |
      Custom ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` JavaScript functions offer
      flexibility to grouping logic.

      See :dbcommand:`group` for details and restrictions on these
      functions.

grp4: |
      Returns results inline as an array of grouped items.

      The result set must fit within the :ref:`maximum BSON document
      size limit <limit-bson-document-size>`.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.2
         The returned array can contain at most 20,000 elements; i.e.
         at most 20,000 unique groupings. Previous versions had a limit
         of 10,000 elements.
grp5: |
      Does **not** support sharded collection.
grp7: |
      See :dbcommand:`group`.
mr1: |
     Implements the Map-Reduce aggregation for processing large data sets.
mr2: |
     In addition to grouping operations, can perform complex
     aggregation tasks as well as perform incremental aggregation on
     continuously growing datasets.

     See :doc:`/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/` and
     :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce/`.

mr3: |
     Custom ``map``, ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` JavaScript
     functions offer flexibility to aggregation logic.
     
     See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details and restrictions
     on the functions.
mr4: |
     Returns results in various options (inline, new collection, merge,
     replace, reduce). See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details on the
     output options.

     .. versionchanged:: 2.2
        Provides much better support for sharded map-reduce output than
        previous versions.
mr5: Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
mr7: |
     See :doc:`/core/map-reduce` and :dbcommand:`mapReduce`.
agg1: |
      .. versionadded:: 2.2

      Designed with specific goals of improving performance and
      usability for aggregation tasks.
      
      Uses a "pipeline" approach where objects are transformed as they
      pass through a series of pipeline operators such as
      :pipeline:`$group`,  :pipeline:`$match`, and :pipeline:`$sort`.

      See :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation` for more information
      on the pipeline operators.
agg2: |
      Pipeline operators can be repeated as needed.

      Pipeline operators need not produce one output document for every
      input document.

      Can also generate new documents or filter out documents.
agg3: |
      Limited to the operators and expressions supported by the
      aggregation pipeline.

      However, can add computed fields, create new virtual sub-objects,
      and extract sub-fields into the top-level of results by using the
      :pipeline:`$project` pipeline operator.

      See :pipeline:`$project` for more information as well as
      :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation` for more information on all
      the available pipeline operators.
agg4: |
      Returns results in various options (inline as a document that
      contains the result set, a cursor to the result set) or stores
      the results in a collection.

      The result is subject to the :ref:`BSON Document size
      <limit-bson-document-size>` limit if returned inline as a
      document that contains the result set.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.6

         Can return results as a cursor or store the results to a
         collection.

agg5: Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
agg7: |
      See :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline` and :dbcommand:`aggregate`.
