Whitelist
   To access a cluster, you must connect from an IP address on the |service|
   project's IP whitelist. If you need to add an IP address to the whitelist,
   you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the IP
   address from the :ref:`Security tab <add-to-whitelist>`.
