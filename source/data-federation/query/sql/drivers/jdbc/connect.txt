This page describes how to install and configure the 
MongoDB JDBC Driver for connecting to a {+fdi+}. The JDBC driver is a 
``.jar`` file that you can download and use from a BI tool or integrate 
into a Java project.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A {+fdi+} mapped to one or more data stores.

  .. include:: includes/data-federation/fact-asql-recommended-mongodb-version

- An application or BI tool that you want to connect to your 
  {+fdi+} with the JDBC driver.

- The 
  `MongoDB JDBC Driver <https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-jdbc>`__.

Procedure
---------

You can use the JDBC driver to connect a Java application like a 
`Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ project, or downloaded and 
installed in a visualization tool like Tableau or DBeaver.

.. note:: 

   If you want to use {+asql+} from 
   `Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__, see 
   :ref:`sql-connect-tableau`.

   If you want to follow a tutorial that connects the MongoDB JDBC 
   Driver to 
   `DBeaver (Community Edition) <https://dbeaver.io/download/>`__, see 
   :ref:`sql-getting-started`.
