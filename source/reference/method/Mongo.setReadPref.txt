Definition
----------

.. method:: Mongo.setReadPref(mode, tagSet)

   Call the :method:`~Mongo.setReadPref()` method on a :method:`Mongo
   <db.getMongo()>` connection object to control how the client will
   route all queries to members of the replica set.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-Mongo.setReadPref-param.rst

Examples
--------

To set a read preference mode in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the
following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().setReadPref('primaryPreferred')

To set a read preference that uses a tag set, specify an array of tag
sets as the second argument to :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()`, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().setReadPref('primaryPreferred', [ { "dc": "east" } ] )

You can specify multiple tag sets, in order of preference, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().setReadPref('secondaryPreferred',
                             [ { "dc": "east", "use": "production" },
                               { "dc": "east", "use": "reporting" },
                               { "dc": "east" },
                               {}
                             ] )

If the replica set cannot satisfy the first tag set, the client will
attempt to use the second read preference. Each tag set can contain zero
or more field/value tag pairs, with an "empty" document acting as a
wildcard which matches a replica set member with any tag set or no tag
set.

.. note::

   You must call :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` on the connection object
   before retrieving documents using that connection to use that read
   preference.
