.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database process's state. Most
   monitoring applications run this command at a regular interval to
   collect statistics about the instance:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { serverStatus: 1 }

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above), does not affect the operation of the
   command.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      In 2.4 you can dynamically suppress portions of the
      :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output, or include suppressed sections
      by adding fields to the command document as in the following
      examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0 } )
      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/example-server-status-projection-serverStatus.rst

   .. seealso:: :method:`db.serverStatus()`

.. When adding status fields to this document, make sure that the
   ``docs/source/reference/server-status.txt`` document also
   reflects those changes.

Output
------

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a collection of information that
reflects the database's status. These data are useful for diagnosing
and assessing the performance of your MongoDB instance. This reference
catalogs each datum included in the output of this command and
provides context for using this data to more effectively administer
your database.

.. include:: /includes/fact-3.0-serverStatus-output-change.rst

For an example of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output, see
:doc:`/reference/server-status`.

.. seealso:: Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also
   displayed dynamically by :binary:`~bin.mongostat`. See the
   :doc:`/reference/program/mongostat` command for more information.

.. _server-status-instance-information:

Instance Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the instance information, see the :ref:`Instance
Information section <server-status-example-instance-information>` of
the :doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.host

   The :data:`~serverStatus.host` field contains the system's hostname. In Unix/Linux
   systems, this should be the same as the output of the ``hostname``
   command.

.. data:: serverStatus.version

   The :data:`~serverStatus.version` field contains the version of MongoDB running on
   the current :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

.. data:: serverStatus.process

   The :data:`~serverStatus.process` field identifies which kind of MongoDB instance is
   running. Possible values are:

   - :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   - :binary:`~bin.mongod`

.. data:: serverStatus.uptime

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.uptime` field corresponds to the number of
   seconds that the :binary:`~bin.mongos` or :binary:`~bin.mongod` process has
   been active.

.. data:: serverStatus.uptimeEstimate

   :data:`~serverStatus.uptimeEstimate` provides the uptime as calculated from MongoDB's
   internal course-grained time keeping system.

.. data:: serverStatus.localTime

   The :data:`~serverStatus.localTime` value is the current time, according to the
   server, in UTC specified in an ISODate format.

.. _locks:
.. _server-status-locks:

locks
~~~~~

For an example of the ``locks`` output, see the :ref:`locks section
<server-status-example-locks>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.locks

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   The :data:`~serverStatus.locks` document contains embedded documents
   that provides a granular report for each lock type and mode.
   The possible lock types are as follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-types.rst

   The possible modes are as follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

   All values are of the ``NumberLong()`` type.

   .. COMMENT

      these definitions are for the servers and not per operations;
      as such, they differ from those in db.currentOp.txt

   .. data:: serverStatus.locks.acquireCount

      Number of times the lock was acquired in the specified mode.

   .. data:: serverStatus.locks.acquireWaitCount

      Number of times the :data:`~serverStatus.locks.acquireCount` lock
      acquisitions encountered waits because the locks were held in a
      conflicting mode.

   .. data:: serverStatus.locks.timeAcquiringMicros

      Cumulative wait time in microseconds for the lock acquisitions.

      :data:`~serverStatus.locks.timeAcquiringMicros` divided by
      :data:`~serverStatus.locks.acquireWaitCount` gives an
      approximate average wait time for the particular lock mode.

   .. data:: serverStatus.locks.deadlockCount

      Number of times the lock acquisitions encountered deadlocks.

.. _globallock:
.. _global-lock:
.. _server-status-globallock:
.. _server-status-global-lock:

globalLock
~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``globalLock`` output, see the :ref:`globalLock
section <server-status-example-globallock>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` data structure contains information regarding
   the database's current lock state, historical lock status, current
   operation queue, and the number of active clients.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` represents the time, in
   microseconds, since the database last started and created the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock`. This is roughly equivalent to total server
   uptime.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue` data structure value provides more
   granular information concerning the number of operations queued
   because of a lock.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total` provides a combined
   total of operations queued waiting for the lock.

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations,
   should cause no concern. Also, consider this value in light of the
   size of queue waiting for the read lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers`) and write lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers`) individually.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   read lock. A consistently small read-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, should cause no concern.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   write lock. A consistently small write-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, is no cause for concern.

globalLock.activeClients
========================

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients` data structure provides more
   granular information about the number of connected clients and the
   operation types (e.g. read or write) performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue` data.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total` is the total number
   of active client connections to the database. This combines clients
   that are performing read operations
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers`) and clients that
   are performing write operations (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers`).

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers` contains a count
   of the active client connections performing read operations.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers` contains a count
   of active client connections performing write operations.

.. _memory-status:
.. _server-status-memory:

mem
~~~

For an example of the ``mem`` output, see the :ref:`mem section
<server-status-example-memory>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem

   The :data:`~serverStatus.mem` data structure holds information regarding the target
   system architecture of :binary:`~bin.mongod` and current memory use.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.bits

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.bits` is either ``64`` or ``32``,
   depending on which target architecture specified during the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` compilation process. In most instances this is
   ``64``, and this value does not change over time.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.resident

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to the amount
   of RAM, in megabytes (MB), currently used by the database process. In normal
   use this value tends to grow. In dedicated database servers this
   number tends to approach the total amount of system memory.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.virtual

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in
   megabytes (MB), of virtual memory used by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   process. With :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled, the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` is at least twice the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.

   If :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` value is significantly larger
   than :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` (e.g. 3 or more times), this
   may indicate a memory leak.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.supported

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.supported` is true when the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem` values may not be accessible to the database server.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mapped

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` provides the amount of mapped memory,
   in megabytes (MB), by
   the database. Because MongoDB uses memory-mapped files, this value
   is likely to be to be roughly equivalent to the total size of your
   database or databases.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal` provides the amount of
   mapped memory, in megabytes (MB), including the memory used for
   journaling.
   This value will always be twice the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.
   This field is only included if journaling is enabled.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.note

   The field :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.note` appears if
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.supported` is false. The
   :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.note` field contains the text:
   ``"not all mem info support on this platform"``.

.. _server-status-connections:

connections
~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``connections`` output, see the :ref:`connections
section <server-status-example-connections>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections

   The :data:`~serverStatus.connections` sub document data regarding the
   current status of incoming connections and availability of the database
   server. Use these values to assess the current load and capacity
   requirements of the server.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.current

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` corresponds to the number of
   connections to the database server from clients. This number
   includes the current shell session. Consider the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` to add more context to this
   datum.

   This figure will include all incoming connections including any shell
   connections or connections from other servers, such as :term:`replica set`
   members or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.available

   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` provides a count of the number of unused
   available incoming connections the database can provide. Consider this
   value in combination with the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` to understand the connection load on
   the database, and the :doc:`/reference/ulimit` document for
   more information about system thresholds on available connections.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.totalCreated

   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.totalCreated` provides a count of
   **all** incoming connections created to the server. This number includes
   connections that have since closed.

.. _server-status-extra-info:
.. _server-status-extra_info:
.. _server-status-extrainfo:

extra_info
~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``extra_info`` output, see the :ref:`extra_info
section <server-status-example-extrainfo>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info` data structure holds data collected by the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance about the underlying system. Your system may
   only report a subset of these fields.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.note

   The field :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.note` reports that the data in this
   structure depend on the underlying platform, and has the text:
   "fields vary by platform."

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes` field is only available on
   Unix/Linux systems, and reports the total size in bytes of heap space
   used by the database process.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults`
   Reports the total number of page faults that require
   disk operations. Page faults refer to operations that require the
   database server to access data which isn't available in active
   memory. The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults` counter may
   increase dramatically during
   moments of poor performance and may correlate with limited
   memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and sporadic page
   faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.

   Windows draws a distinction between "hard" page faults involving disk IO, and
   "soft" page faults that only require moving pages in memory. MongoDB counts
   both hard and soft page faults in this statistic.

.. _server-status-backgroundflushing:
.. _server-status-background-flushing:

backgroundFlushing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   ``backgroundFlushing`` information only appears for instances that
   use the MMAPv1 storage engine.

For an example of the ``backgroundFlushing`` output, see the
:ref:`backgroundFlushing section
<server-status-example-backgroundflushing>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` periodically flushes writes to disk. In the default
   configuration, this happens every 60 seconds. The
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing` data structure contains data regarding
   these operations. Consider these values if you have concerns about
   write performance and :ref:`journaling <journaling-status>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes

   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is a counter that collects the
   number of times the database has flushed all writes to disk. This
   value will grow as database runs for longer periods of time.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms` value provides the total number
   of milliseconds (ms) that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes have spent
   writing (i.e. flushing) data to disk. Because this is an absolute
   value, consider the value of :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes`
   and :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` to provide better
   context for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` value describes the
   relationship between the number of flushes and the total amount of
   time that the database has spent writing data to disk. The larger
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is, the more likely this value
   is likely to represent a "normal," time; however, abnormal data can
   skew this value.

   Use the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` to ensure that a high
   average is not skewed by transient historical issue or a
   random write distribution.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` field is the amount
   of time, in milliseconds, that the last flush operation took to
   complete. Use this value to verify that the current performance of
   the server and is in line with the historical data provided by
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished` field provides a timestamp
   of the last completed flush operation in the :term:`ISODate`
   format. If this value is more than a few minutes old relative to
   your server's current time and accounting for differences in time
   zone, restarting the database may result in some data loss.

   Also consider ongoing operations that might skew this value by
   routinely block write operations.

.. _server-status-cursors:

cursors
~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 2.6
   See the :ref:`serverStatus.metrics.cursor <server-status-metrics>` field instead.

For an example of the ``cursors`` output, see the :ref:`cursors section
<server-status-example-cursors>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors

   The :data:`~serverStatus.cursors` data structure contains data regarding cursor state
   and use.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.note

   A note specifying to use the :data:`serverStatus.metrics.cursor`
   field instead of :data:`serverStatus.cursors`.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` provides the number of cursors that
   MongoDB is maintaining for clients. Because MongoDB exhausts unused
   cursors, typically this value small or zero. However, if there is a
   queue, stale :term:`tailable cursor`, or a large number of
   operations, this value may rise.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.clientCursors_size

   .. deprecated:: 1.x
      See :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.timedOut

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.timedOut` provides a counter of the total number
   of cursors that have timed out since the server process started. If
   this number is large or growing at a regular rate, this may
   indicate an application error.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.totalNoTimeout

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalNoTimeout` provides the number of open
   cursors with the option :data:`DBQuery.Option.noTimeout` set to
   prevent timeout after a period of inactivity.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.pinned

   :data:`serverStatus.cursors.pinned` provides the number
   of "pinned" open cursors.

.. _server-status-network:

network
~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``network`` output, see the :ref:`network section
<server-status-example-network>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.network

   The :data:`~serverStatus.network` data structure contains data regarding MongoDB's
   network use.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.bytesIn

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesIn` field reflects the
   amount of network traffic, in bytes, received *by* this
   database. Use this value to ensure that network traffic sent to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process is consistent with expectations and
   overall inter-application traffic.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.bytesOut

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesOut` field reflects the amount of
   network traffic, in bytes, sent *from* this database. Use this
   value to ensure that network traffic sent by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
   is consistent with expectations and overall inter-application
   traffic.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.numRequests

   The :data:`~serverStatus.network.numRequests` field is a counter of the total number
   of distinct requests that the server has received. Use this value
   to provide context for the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesIn` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesOut` values to ensure that MongoDB's network
   utilization is consistent with expectations and application use.

.. _server-status-repl:

repl
~~~~

For an example of the ``repl`` output, see the :ref:`repl section
<server-status-example-repl>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl

   The :data:`~serverStatus.repl` data structure contains status
   information for MongoDB's replication (i.e. "replica set")
   configuration. These values only appear when the current host has
   replication enabled.

   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.setName

   The :data:`~serverStatus.repl.setName` field contains a string with
   the name of the current replica set. This value reflects the
   :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` command line argument, or
   :setting:`~replication.replSetName` value in the configuration file.

   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.ismaster

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.repl.ismaster` field is
   either ``true`` or ``false`` and reflects whether the current node
   is the master or primary node in the replica set.

   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.secondary

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.repl.secondary` field is
   either ``true`` or ``false`` and reflects whether the current node
   is a secondary node in the replica set.

   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.primary

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   A string in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"`` listing the
   current :term:`primary` member of the replica set.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.hosts

   The ``[hostname]:[port]`` combination for the current member in the
   replica set.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.rbid

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   :term:`Rollback` identifier. Used to determine if a rollback has
   happened for this :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.slaves

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   An array with one document for every member of the replica set that
   reports replication process to this member. Typically this is the
   primary, or secondaries if using chained replication.

   To include this output you must pass the ``repl`` option to
   the :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus({ "repl": 1 })
      db.runCommand({ "serverStatus": 1, "repl": 1 })

   The content of the :data:`~serverStatus.repl.slaves` section

.. _server-status-opcountersrepl:
.. _server-status-opcounters-repl:

opcountersRepl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``opcountersRepl`` output, see the
:ref:`opcountersRepl section <server-status-example-opcountersrepl>` of
the :doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.opcountersRepl

   The :data:`~serverStatus.opcountersRepl` data structure, similar to the
   :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` data structure, provides an overview of
   database replication operations by type and makes it possible to
   analyze the load on the replica in more granular manner.  These
   values only appear when the current host has replication enabled.

   These values will differ from the :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` values
   because of how MongoDB serializes operations during replication.
   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

   These numbers will grow over time in response to database
   use. Analyze these values over time to track database utilization.

.. data:: serverStatus.opcountersRepl.insert

   :data:`~serverStatus.opcountersRepl.insert` provides a counter of the total number
   of replicated insert operations since the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
   last started.

   :data:`~serverStatus.opcountersRepl.getmore` provides a counter of the total number
   of "getmore" operations since the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last
   started. This counter can be high even if the query count is low.
   Secondary nodes send ``getMore`` operations as part of the replication
   process.

.. data:: serverStatus.opcountersRepl.command

   :data:`~serverStatus.opcountersRepl.command` provides a counter of the total number
   of replicated commands issued to the database since the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started.

opcounters
~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``opcounters`` output, see the :ref:`opcounters
section <server-status-example-opcounters>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.opcounters

   The :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` data structure provides an overview of
   database operations by type and makes it possible to analyze the
   load on the database in more granular manner.

   These numbers will grow over time and in response to database
   use. Analyze these values over time to track database utilization.

   .. note::

      The data in :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` treats operations
      that affect multiple documents, such as bulk insert or
      multi-update operations, as a single operation. See
      :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.document` for more granular
      document-level operation tracking.
