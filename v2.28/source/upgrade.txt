Overview
--------

In this section, you can identify essential changes you must make to your
application when you upgrade your driver to a new version.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the {+framework+} version your
  application runs on. See the :ref:`.NET/C# Driver Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>`
  page for this information.
- Address any breaking changes between the current version of the driver
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <csharp-breaking-changes>` section. To learn
  more about the {+mdb-server+} release compatibility changes, see the
  :ref:`<csharp-server-release-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To minimize the number of changes your application may require when
   upgrading driver versions in the future, use the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <csharp-stable-api>`.

.. _csharp-breaking-changes:

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification of a convention or a behavior starting in
a specific version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from
working properly if not addressed before upgrading the driver.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that
introduced them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking
changes between the current and upgrade versions. For example, if you
are upgrading the driver from v2.0 to v2.20, address all breaking changes from
the version after v2.0 including any listed under v2.20.

.. _csharp-breaking-changes-2.28.0:

Version 2.28.0 Potential Breaking Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All {+driver-short+} components are strongly named. If you are using driver version
  2.28 or later, and your application has dependencies that reference multiple
  {+driver-short+} versions, you must create
  binding redirects, as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     <configuration>
         <runtime>
             <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Driver"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Bson"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Driver.Core"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
             </assemblyBinding>
         </runtime>
     </configuration>

.. _csharp-breaking-changes-2.21.0:

Version 2.21.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The function signature of ``Render`` methods in the Atlas Search builders
  changed. The following code snippet shows the function signature prior
  to the change and after the change:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     // Render function signature prior to v2.21.0
     Render(IBsonSerializer<TDocument> documentSerializer, IBsonSerializerRegistry serializerRegistry);

     // Render function signature in v2.21.0 and later
     Render(SearchDefinitionRenderContext<TDocument> renderContext);

Version 2.19.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``ObjectSerializer`` only allows deserialization of
  types that are considered safe. If not specified otherwise, the
  ``ObjectSerializer`` uses the types returned by
  ``ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes``.

  To learn more about the ``ObjectSerializer``, visit the
  :ref:`FAQ <csharp-faq-object-serializer>`. For more information on
  ``DefaultAllowedTypes``, visit the `API Documentation
  <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.19/apidocs/html/P_MongoDB_Bson_Serialization_Serializers_ObjectSerializer_DefaultAllowedTypes.htm>`__.

- The default ``LinqProvider`` has been changed to LINQ3. The ``LinqProvider``
  can be configured for LINQ2 in ``MongoClientSettings`` as shown in the
  following code example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     var connectionString = "<connection string>";
     var clientSettings = MongoClientSettings
        .FromConnectionString(connectionString);
     clientSettings.LinqProvider = LinqProvider.V2;
     var client = new MongoClient(clientSettings);

Version 2.14.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This {+driver-long+} version removed support for {+framework+} v4.5.2 or earlier; the minimum
  {+framework+} supported is v4.7.2.

- This version of the {+driver-long+} does not support .NET Standard v1.5; the minimum .NET
  Standard supported is v2.0.

Version 2.13.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``slave0k`` connection string option was removed; the
  ``readPreference`` option is now used instead.

.. _csharp-server-release-changes:

Server Release Compatibility Changes
------------------------------------

A server release compatibility change is a modification
to the {+driver-long+} that discontinues support for a set of
{+mdb-server+} versions.

The driver discontinues support for a {+mdb-server+} version after it
reaches end-of-life (EOL).

To learn more about the MongoDB support for EOL products see the `Legacy
Support Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/legacy>`__.

To learn more about the compatibility between .NET/C# driver versions
and {+mdb-server+} versions, visit the
:ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page.

.. _csharp-server-8.1-incompatibility:

Server Version 8.1 Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use v2.14.1 or earlier versions of the {+driver-short+} to connect to a
deployment running {+mdb-server+} v8.1. Starting in {+mdb-server+} v8.1,
the ``buildinfo`` command requires authentication, causing an
incompatibility with these driver versions.

Version 2.14 Release Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The v2.14 driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.4 and earlier. To
use any driver from v2.14 and later, your {+mdb-server+} must be v3.6 or
later.

To learn how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see
:manual:`Release Notes </release-notes/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
