This document answers common questions about database replication
in MongoDB.

If you don't find the answer you're looking for, check
the :doc:`complete list of FAQs </faq>` or post your question to the
`MongoDB User Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mongodb-user>`_.

What kinds of replication does MongoDB support?
-----------------------------------------------

MongoDB supports :doc:`replica sets </core/replication-introduction>`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   In MongoDB 3.0.0, replica sets can have up to :ref:`50 nodes
   <3.0-replica-sets-max-members>`. Previous versions limited the
   maximum number of replica set members to 12.

MongoDB also supports master-slave replication; however, replica sets
are the recommended replication topology. However, if your deployment
requires more than 50 nodes, you must use master/slave replication.

What does the term "primary" mean?
----------------------------------

:term:`Primary` is a :doc:`replica set
</core/replication-introduction>` member that can accept writes. Only
the primary can accept write operations. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]

.. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]

   .. include:: /includes/footnote-two-primaries-edge-cases.rst

What does the term "secondary" mean?
------------------------------------

:term:`Secondary` nodes are the read-only nodes in :doc:`replica sets
</core/replication-introduction>`. 


How long does replica set failover take?
----------------------------------------

It varies, but a replica set will select a new primary within a minute.

It may take 10-30 seconds for the members of a :term:`replica
set` to declare a :term:`primary` inaccessible. This
triggers an :term:`election`. During the election, the cluster
is unavailable for writes.

The election itself may take another 10-30 seconds.

Does replication work over the Internet and WAN connections?
------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

For example, a deployment may maintain a :term:`primary` and :term:`secondary`
in an East-coast data center along with a :term:`secondary` member for disaster
recovery in a West-coast data center.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-geographically-distributed-replica-set`

Can MongoDB replicate over a "noisy" connection?
------------------------------------------------

Yes, but not without connection failures and the obvious latency.

Members of the set will attempt to reconnect to the other members of
the set in response to networking flaps. This does not require
administrator intervention. However, if the network connections
among the nodes in the replica set are very slow, it might not be
possible for the members of the node to keep up with the replication.

If the TCP connection between the secondaries and the :term:`primary`
instance breaks, a :term:`replica set` will automatically
elect one of the :term:`secondary` members of the set as primary.

Why use journaling if replication already provides data redundancy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`Journaling <journal>` facilitates faster crash recovery.
Prior to journaling, crashes often required :dbcommand:`database repairs <repairDatabase>`
or full data resync. Both were slow, and the first was unreliable.

Journaling is particularly useful for protection
against power failures, especially if your replica set resides in a single data
center or power circuit.

When a :term:`replica set` runs with journaling, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances can safely restart without any administrator intervention.

.. note::

   Journaling requires some resource overhead for write
   operations. Journaling has no effect on read performance, however.

   Journaling is enabled by default on all 64-bit
   builds of MongoDB v2.0 and greater.

How many arbiters do replica sets need?
---------------------------------------

Some configurations do not require any :term:`arbiter`
instances. Arbiters vote in :term:`elections <election>`
for :term:`primary` but do not replicate the data like
:term:`secondary` members.

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` require a majority of the
remaining nodes present to elect a primary. Arbiters allow you
to construct this majority without the overhead of adding replicating
nodes to the system.

There are many possible replica set :doc:`architectures
</core/replica-set-architectures>`.

A replica set with an odd number of voting nodes does not need an arbiter.

A common configuration consists of two replicating nodes that include a
:term:`primary` and a :term:`secondary`, as well as an :term:`arbiter`
for the third node. This configuration makes it possible for the set
to elect a primary in the event of failure, without requiring three
replicating nodes.

You may also consider adding an arbiter to a set if it has an equal
number of nodes in two facilities and network partitions between the
facilities are possible. In these cases, the arbiter will break
the tie between the two facilities and allow the set to elect a new
primary.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures`

What information do arbiters exchange with the rest of the replica set?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arbiters never receive the contents of a collection but do exchange the
following data with the rest of the replica set:

- Credentials used to authenticate the arbiter with the replica set. All
  MongoDB processes within a replica set use keyfiles. These exchanges
  are encrypted.

- Replica set configuration data and voting data. This information is
  not encrypted. Only credential exchanges are encrypted.

If your MongoDB deployment uses TLS/SSL, then all communications
between arbiters and the other members of the replica set are secure.
See the documentation for :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more
information. Run all arbiters on secure networks, as with all MongoDB
components.

.. see:: The overview of 
   :ref:`Arbiter Members of Replica Sets
   <replica-set-arbiters>`.

Which members of a replica set vote in elections?
-------------------------------------------------

All members of a replica set, unless the value of :data:`votes
<replSetGetConfig.members[n].votes>` is equal to ``0``, vote in
elections. This includes all :ref:`delayed
<replica-set-delayed-members>`, :ref:`hidden
<replica-set-hidden-members>` and :ref:`secondary-only
<replica-set-secondary-only-members>` members.
:ref:`Arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>` always vote in elections and
always have ``1`` vote.

Additionally, the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state` of the voting
members also determine whether the member can vote. Only voting members
in the following states are eligible to vote:

- ``PRIMARY``

- ``SECONDARY``

- ``RECOVERING``

- ``ARBITER``

- ``ROLLBACK``

.. seealso:: :ref:`replica-set-elections`

Do hidden members vote in replica set elections?
------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>` of :term:`replica
sets <replica set>` *do* vote in elections. To exclude a member from voting in an
:term:`election`, change the value of the member's
:data:`~replSetGetConfig.members[n].votes` configuration to ``0``.

.. seealso:: :ref:`replica-set-elections`

Is it normal for replica set members to use different amounts of disk space?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

Factors including: different oplog sizes, different levels of storage
fragmentation, and MongoDB's data file pre-allocation can lead to some
variation in storage utilization between nodes. Storage use
disparities will be most pronounced when you add members at different
times.
