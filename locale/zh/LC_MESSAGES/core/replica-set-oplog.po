"The :term:`oplog` (operations log) is a special :term:`capped collection`"
" that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data "
"stored in your databases. MongoDB applies database operations on the "
":term:`primary` and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. "
"The :term:`secondary` members then copy and apply these operations in an "
"asynchronous process. All replica set members contain a copy of the "
"oplog, in the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection, which allows them to "
"maintain the current state of the database."
