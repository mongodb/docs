   To use :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` as a backup
   strategy for sharded clusters, see :ref:`backup-sharded-dumps`.

   Sharded clusters can also use one of the following coordinated backup
   and restore processes, which guarantee atomicity across shards while
   still accepting writes:

   - `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_databasetools>`__

   - `MongoDB Cloud Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?tck=docs_databasetools>`__

   - `MongoDB Ops Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager?tck=docs_databasetools>`__
