The :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>` allows
MongoDB to provide native aggregation capabilities that corresponds to
many common data aggregation operations in SQL.

The following table provides an overview of common SQL aggregation
terms, functions, and concepts and the corresponding MongoDB
:ref:`aggregation operators <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`:

Examples
--------

The following table presents a quick reference of SQL aggregation
statements and the corresponding MongoDB statements. The examples in
the table assume the following conditions:

- The SQL examples assume *two* tables, ``orders`` and
  ``order_lineitem`` that join by the ``order_lineitem.order_id`` and
  the ``orders.id`` columns.

- The MongoDB examples assume *one* collection ``orders`` that contain
  documents of the following prototype:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       cust_id: "abc123",
       ord_date: ISODate("2012-11-02T17:04:11.102Z"),
       status: 'A',
       price: 50,
       items: [ { sku: "xxx", qty: 25, price: 1 },
                { sku: "yyy", qty: 25, price: 1 } ]
     }
