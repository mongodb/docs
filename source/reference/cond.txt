==================
``cond`` Directive
==================

The Sphinx built-in ``only`` directive allows writers to
conditionally include content based on a set of *tags* specified
at build-time. The MongoDB documentation project uses this primarily to
differentiate between prose intended for Ops Manager and that intended
for Cloud Manager.

However, even if a block of content is supressed by ``only``, Sphinx
still *evaluates* it. This leads to surprising behavior when sections
and references are defined within a conditional block.

As a workaround, you may use the experimental ``fixed_only`` extension
containing the ``cond`` directive.

This directive uses the same syntax as ``only``, but does **not**
evaluate suppressed content.
