The :term:`storage engine` is the component of the database that is
responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk.
MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, as different engines perform
better for specific workloads. Choosing the appropriate storage engine
for your use case can significantly impact the performance of your
applications.

|arrow| WiredTiger Storage Engine (*Default*)
   :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` is the default storage engine
   starting in MongoDB 3.2. It is well-suited for most workloads and is
   recommended for new deployments. WiredTiger provides a
   document-level concurrency model, checkpointing, and compression,
   among other features. 
   
   In MongoDB Enterprise, WiredTiger also supports
   :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest`. See
   :ref:`encrypted-storage-engine`.

|arrow| In-Memory Storage Engine
   :doc:`In-Memory Storage Engine </core/inmemory>` is available in
   MongoDB Enterprise. Rather than storing documents on-disk, it
   retains them in-memory for more predictable data latencies.

|arrow| MMAPv1 Storage Engine (*Deprecated as of MongoDB 4.0*)
   :doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` is the default storage engine for
   MongoDB versions 3.0 and earlier.
