   * - Level
     - Description

   * - ``0``
     - The profiler is off and does not collect any data.
       This is the default profiler level.

   * - ``1``
     - The profiler collects data for operations that take longer
       than the value of ``slowms`` or that match a :ref:`filter
       <set-profiling-level-options-filter>`. 

       When a filter is set:

       + The ``slowms`` and ``sampleRate`` options are not used for
         profiling.
       + The profiler only captures operations that match the
         :ref:`filter <set-profiling-level-options-filter>`.

   * - ``2``
     - The profiler collects data for all operations.
