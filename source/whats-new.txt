.. _version-6.12:

What's New in 6.12
------------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.12 release includes the following features:

- Adds support for v2.0 of the ``zstd`` compression algorithm. For more information about
  ``zstd`` v2.0, see the ``zstd``
  :github:`Release Notes <mongodb-js/zstd/releases/tag/v2.0.0>` on GitHub.

- Upgrades the ``bson`` package to v6.10.1. For more information about this release,
  see the :github:`v6.10.1 Release Notes <mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.10.1>` for the
  ``bson`` package on GitHub.

- The driver populates the ``ServerDescription.error`` field with a more specific error 
  type and message when marking a primary replica-set member stale.

- The driver reads socket data with a stream in object mode instead
  of buffer mode. This prevents message parsing errors in rare cases caused by inaccurate
  data chunking.

- If the driver encounters an error while connecting to a socks5 proxy, it no longer
  wraps the socks5 error in a ``MongoNetworkError``. This prevents the driver from
  wrapping a ``MongoNetworkError`` in another ``MongoNetworkError``.

To learn more about this release, see the
:github:`v6.12.0 Release Notes <mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.12.0>` on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.11:

What's New in 6.11
------------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.11 release includes the following features:

- Adds support for Node.js v22.

- Adds the Client-Side Operations Timeout (CSOT) feature. You can use
  CSOT to apply a single timeout to all steps needed to complete a
  server-side operation, including server selection, connection
  checkout, serialization, and server-side execution. To learn more, see
  the :ref:`node-csot` guide.

  .. note:: Experimental Feature

     The CSOT feature is experimental and might change in future driver
     releases.

- Adds OIDC authentication support for Kubernetes environments. To learn
  more about this feature, see the :ref:`node-enterprise-auth-oidc`
  section of the Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms guide.

  To use OIDC to authenticate from a Kubernetes environment, set the
  ``authMechanismProperties`` connection option to ``ENVIRONMENT:k8s``
  in your connection string. You can use this feature when connecting
  to an environment running in Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service,
  Google Kubernetes Engine, or Azure Kubernetes Service.

- The ``bson`` package adds support for binary vector data. To learn more about this feature,
  see the :github:`v6.10.0 Release Notes <mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.10.0>` for the
  ``bson`` package on GitHub.

- The driver emits ``ConnectionClosedEvents`` after ``PoolClearedEvents``.

To learn more about this release, see the
:github:`v6.11.0 Release Notes <mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.11.0>` on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.10:

What's New in 6.10
------------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.10 release is the first official release to support all {+mdb-server+}
8.0 features, and includes the following improvements and fixes:

- Removes support for {+mdb-server+} 3.6.

- Adds support for the {+mdb-server+} 8.0 bulk write API, which supports bulk write
  operations across multiple databases and collections in a single call.

- Allows SRV hostnames with fewer than three parts separated by ``.``
  characters. For example, the driver now supports hostnames such as
  ``mongodb+srv://mongodb.local``.

- Supports the explain option to retrieve an accurate ``maxTimeMS`` value for
  CRUD commands to describe the operation time. The explain options for find and aggregate
  operations are deprecated.

To learn more about this release, see the :github:`v6.10.0 Release Notes <mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.10.0>` on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.9:

What's New in 6.9
-----------------

- Support for {+mdb-server+} 3.6 is deprecated and will be removed in a future driver release.

- The driver natively supports explicit resource management for cursors and the
  ``MongoClient``, ``ClientSession``, and ``ChangeStream`` objects. When using a compatible Node.js
  version, you can implement explicit resource management by using the ``cursor.stream()``
  method and ``GridFSDownloadStream`` class.

  To learn how to use explicit resource management, see the
  :github:`v6.9.0 Release Notes <mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.9.0>` on
  GitHub. For more information about explicit resource management, see the
  :github:`ECMAScript Explicit Resource Management Proposal </tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management>`
  on GitHub.

- If you're using Node.js 18.13 or later, you can pass the ``autoSelectFamily`` and
  ``autoSelectFamilyTimeout`` options to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. When the
  ``autoSelectFamily`` option is ``true``, the driver automatically selects between
  an IPv4 or IPv6 connection. The ``autoSelectFamilyTimeout`` option specifies the
  timeout, in milliseconds, for the driver to select the connection family.

  The following code example shows how to use these options:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: true

     const client = new MongoClient(uri,
       { autoSelectFamily: true, autoSelectFamilyTimeout: 100 });

- The ``MongoClient`` constructor accepts the ``allowPartialTrustChain`` option. This option
  controls the ``X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN`` OpenSSL flag.

- The ``ConnectionCheckedOutEvent`` and ``ConnectionCheckFailedEvent`` now include a ``durationMS``
  property. This property indicates the time elapsed between the start and end of a
  connection checkout operation.

- If you're using Node.js 18 or later, the driver ignores the ``cryptoCallbacks`` option
  and uses callbacks defined in C++ instead, significantly improving encryption
  performance. This change is available in the v6.1.0 version of the ``mongodb-client-encryption`` package.

- To enhance security, the options specifying the spawn path and arguments for
  ``mongocryptd`` must be own properties of ``autoEncryption.extraOptions``.
  This change helps prevent global prototype pollution bugs related to these options.
  For more information about own properties, see
  `Object.hasOwn() <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwn>`__
  on MDN.

- Adds official support for Queryable Encryption (QE) range queries. To use this
  feature, your app must use ``mongodb-client-encryption`` v6.1.0 or later and must connect
  to {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later. For more information about QE range queries, see
  :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- The ``insertMany()`` and ``bulkWrite()`` methods accept ``ReadonlyArray`` inputs.

- The driver retries writes based on the top-level code, found in ``error.code``, rather
  than the nested code in ``error.result.writeConcernError.code``. This fixes an issue
  in sharded clusters running versions {+mdb-server+} earlier than 4.4.

- The ``LocalKMSProviderConfiguration.key`` property accepts a ``BSON`` ``Binary`` instance
  for ``AutoEncryptionOptions``.

- In TypeScript, the ``BulkOperationBase`` class reports the ``length`` getter property.

- The ``MongoWriteConcernError`` type now preserves the original top-level code in
  ``MongoWriteConcernError.code``.

- The ``cursor.toArray()`` method empties the current batch of documents into the array
  before calling the async iterator again. This change avoids the delays associated
  with ``async``/``await`` execution and improves performance by up to 5% on average.
  This optimization doesn't apply if you provide a transform to the ``cursor.map()`` method
  before calling the ``toArray()`` method.

- Fixes mixed use of the ``cursor.next()`` method with ``for await`` syntax.

- Adds the ``enableUtf8Validation`` option when deserializing BSON, which was
  inadvertently removed in {+driver-short+} v6.8.

- Adds the ``durationMS`` property to the ``ConnectionReadyEvent`` class. This property
  represents the time between the connection creation event and when the ``ConnectionReadyEvent``
  fires.

To learn more about this release, see the
:github:`v6.9.0 Release Notes <mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.9.0>` on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.8:

What's New in 6.8
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.8 release includes the following features:

- Fixes a bug where a local KMS provider accepted a ``BSON Binary`` instance at
  runtime, but the TypeScript compiler allowed only values of type ``Buffer`` and
  ``string``.

- The ``ReadConcernMajorityNotAvailableYet`` error is now a retryable read error.

- You can now associate a name with, and provide multiple keys for, KMS providers.
  This feature requires ``mongodb-client-encryption`` v6.0.1 or later.
  You can't use named KMS providers if your application uses the automatic
  KMS provider refresh capability.

  The following code example shows how to configure a ``ClientEncryption`` object with
  multiple AWS keys:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: true
   
     const clientEncryption = new ClientEncryption(keyVaultClient, {
       'aws:key1': {
         accessKeyId: ...,
         secretAccessKey: ...
       },
       'aws:key2': {
         accessKeyId: ...,
         secretAccessKey: ...
      },
  
     clientEncryption.createDataKey('aws:key-1', { ... });

- When you create a KMIP data key, you can now specify the ``delegated`` option. If this
  option is set to ``true``, the KMIP provider performs encryption and decryption of
  the data key locally, ensuring that the encryption key never leaves the KMIP server.
  This feature requires ``mongodb-client-encryption`` v6.0.1 or later.
  
  The following code example shows how to specify this option:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: true

     clientEncryption.createDataKey('kmip', { masterKey: { delegated: true } } );

- The driver now decodes BSON responses as the cursor iterates over them,
  rather than decoding the entire BSON response when it is received.

- The Github release for the ``mongodb`` package now contains a detached signature file,
  ``mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig``, for the NPM package. This change applies to every major
  and patch release for versions 5.x and 6.x of the driver. To verify the package signature,
  follow the instructions in the Release Integrity section of the
  `README.md <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/v6.8.0/README.md#release-integrity>`__
  file in the driver's GitHub repository.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.8.0 Release Notes
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.8.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.7:

What's New in 6.7
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.7 release includes the following features:

- Adds support for the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication mechanism when connected to 
  MongoDB Server v7.0 and later. The driver supports authentication with Azure
  machine authentication, GCP machine authentication, callback authentication,
  and human interaction callback authentication facets.

- Fixes an issue where setting the ``useBigInt64`` flag to ``true`` caused the internal
  ``compareTopologyVersion`` function to generate an error.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.7.0 Release Notes
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.7.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.6:

What's New in 6.6
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.6 release includes the following features:

- Upgrades to using BSON 6.7.0. For details about the new BSON features, see the
  release notes for `BSON 6.5.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.5.0>`__,
  `BSON 6.6.0 <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.6.0>`__, and
  `BSON 6.7.0 <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.7.0>`__.

- Adds the ``addStage()`` method to the fluid aggregation API. You can use this method to
  add aggregation pipeline stages individually, as shown in the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     const documents = await users.aggregate().addStage({ $project: { name: true } }).toArray();

- Adds the ``cause`` and ``dependencyName`` fields to the ``MongoMissingDependencyError``
  class. You can use these fields to programmatically determine if a package is missing
  or why a package didn't load.

- Adds the ``minRoundTripTime`` property to the ``ServerDescription`` class. This
  property contains the minimum round-trip time over the last 10 heartbeats.

- Adds the ``toJSON()`` method to the ``TopologyDescription`` class. Although you can use
  this method to stringify ``TopologyDescription`` objects to JSON, we
  recommend using Node's ``util.inspect()`` method instead, because it properly handles
  all types used in JavaScript and the driver.

- Adds cursor options support for the ``Collection.indexExists()``,
  ``Collection.indexes()``, and ``Collection.indexInformation()`` methods in Typescript.

- Removes support for the ``readConcern`` and ``writeConcern`` options from the
  ``Collection.listSearchIndexes()`` method. ``listSearchIndexes()`` is an Atlas-specific method, and Atlas
  search indexes don't support these options.

- Redefines the ``ServerDescription.roundTripTime`` property as a moving average. Previously,
  it was a weighted average of the most recently observed heartbeat duration and the
  previous duration.

- You can specify the type of a search index when creating the index, as shown
  in the following example:

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 3
    
     const indexName = await collection.createSearchIndex({
         name: 'my-vector-search-index',
         type: 'vectorSearch',
         definition: {
             mappings: { dynamic: false }
         }
     });

- The ``UpdateFilter.$currentDate`` property no longer throws an error when you pass
  it to a compound method, such as ``findOneAndUpdate()``, on a collection with a limited schema.

- The driver throws a ``MongoTransactionError`` only if you provide a
  ``ReadPreferenceMode`` other than ``primary`` and then try to perform a command that
  involves a read operation.

- The data type of the ``TopologyDescription.error`` property is ``MongoError``.

- The ``Collection.indexExists()`` method no longer supports the ``full`` option.

- The ``Collection.indexInformation()``, ``Collection.indexes()``, and
  ``Db.indexInformation()`` methods have a return type of
  ``IndexDescriptionCompact | IndexDescriptionInfo[]`` in TypeScript. 

- When retrieving AWS KMS (Key Management System) credentials, the driver no longer
  throws an error when it receives an access key that includes
  an expiration timestamp.

- The ``ClusterTime`` interface no longer defines the ``signature`` field as required in
  TypeScript.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.6.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.6.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.5:

What's New in 6.5
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.5 release includes the following features:

- Updates bulk write operations to use the ``pkFactory`` class for document
  ID generation.

.. warning::

   If you previously specified an instance of a ``pkFactory`` to handle
   bulk writes, the ``_id`` fields of the documents inserted by using bulk
   writes may be inconsistent with the behavior in this version.

- Fixes the read preference that is sent with read operations to 
  ``primaryPreferred`` when the driver is connected to a secondary node in
  the replica set.

- Fixes a memory leak in promise creation for socket operations.

- Reduces first-time connection latency when connecting to a DNS seedlist by
  querying the ``SRV`` and ``TXT`` records in parallel.

- Adds tracking to container metadata when running a client in Kubernetes
  or a container environment in the ``client.env.container`` field of the
  handshake document.

- Adds the original error document returned by the server to the
  ``errorResponse`` field of the ``MongoServerError`` document.

- Deprecates the ``CloseOptions`` interface which is unused by the driver.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.5.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.5.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.4:

What's New in 6.4
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.4 release includes the following features:

- When multiple ``mongos`` instances are available, different servers are used
  for read and write retry attempts.

- Caches AWS credentials at the client level, rather than for each
  authentication.

- Upgrades to using BSON 6.4.0. For details about the new BSON features, see the
  release notes for `BSON 6.3.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.3.0>`__ and `BSON 6.4.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.4.0>`__.

- Read operations that result in an ``ExceededTimeLimit`` error are retried.

- Fixes a request issue related to :ref:`TLS sockets <node-connect-tls>` and
  :manual:`KMS Providers
  </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/kms-providers/>`.

- Fixes the base64 padding on the ``saslContinue`` command to allow for mongosh
  authentication.

- Types ``countDocuments`` using ``Filter<Schema>`` rather than ``Document``,
  which enables autocompletion and helps prevent downstream typing issues.

- Fixes a type error in the ``$addToSet`` option of the ``bulkWrite`` command.
  The driver skips ``$addToSet`` validation you extend your types from
  ``Document`` or ``any``, or use properties of any type.

- Fixes the ``ServerHeartbeatSucceeded`` and ``ServerHeartbeatFailed`` event
  heartbeat duration so that it does not include the time to create the socket.

- Appropriately emits errors from cursor transform streams, rather than
  absorbing them.

- Makes AWS session tokens optional when a username and password are provided,
  and allows AWS SDK to handle the authentication requests.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.4.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.4.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.3:

What's New in 6.3
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.3 release includes the following features:

- Adds the ``serverMonitoringMode`` client option to control the
  behavior of the monitoring connection among the nodes in a topology.
  This option takes a value of ``auto`` (default), ``poll``, or
  ``stream``. To learn more, see the entry for this option in the
  :ref:`node-connection-options` guide.

  You can set the ``serverMonitoringMode`` option in a
  ``MongoClientOptions`` instance or as a connection string option. The
  following example shows how to create a client with the option set to
  ``stream``:

  .. code-block:: js

     new MongoClient('<connection string>', { serverMonitoringMode: 'stream' });

- Fixes a connection leak when the ``serverApi`` client option is set.

- Deprecates the ``contentType`` and ``aliases`` GridFS options. To
  store the content type and aliases of a file, add ``contentType`` and ``aliases``
  fields to the ``metadata`` document.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.3.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.3.0>`__.

.. _version-6.2:

What's New in 6.2
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.2 release includes the following features:

- Updates the ``bson`` package version to 6.2.0 to include
  color visualization of types, as shown in the following image:

  .. figure:: /includes/figures/bson-color.png
     :alt: A screenshot of the terminal that shows printing in color

  To learn more, see the `bson v6.2.0 release notes
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.2.0>`__.

- Ensures that the ``result.insertedIds`` property of a bulk write error type
  contains the ``_id`` values of successfully inserted documents. In
  previous versions, when a bulk write operation rejected an insert
  operation, the ``result.insertedIds`` property contained the
  ``_id`` values for all attempted inserts.

- Closes the implicit session created when running the ``findOne()``
  method on a time series collection regardless of the outcome of the
  operation.

- Allows the creation of collections that have names that start or end with the
  ``.`` character. This change aligns the driver's database and
  collection name-checking behavior with the server's.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.2.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.2.0>`__.

.. _version-6.1:

What's New in 6.1
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.1 release includes the following features:

- Updates the ``bson`` package version to 6.1.0 to expose the
  ``Decimal128.fromStringWithRounding()`` method. To learn more, see the
  `v6.1.0 bson release notes <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.1.0>`__.

- Detects environment variables for region settings when you
  authenticate by using the `IAM AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity action
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html>`__ 
  with ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication. To instruct the driver to use your region options, 
  you must set both of the following environment variables:

  - ``AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS``
  - ``AWS_REGION``

  To learn how to set region settings when using the ``MONGODB-AWS`` 
  authentication mechanism, see the :guilabel:`Web Identity Token` tab in the 
  :ref:`MONGODB-AWS <mongodb-aws>` section of the Authentication Mechanisms guide. 

- Fixes a memory leak issue caused by recursive calls to the ``next()``
  method of the ``ChangeStream`` type.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.1.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.1.0>`__.

.. _version-6.0:

What's New in 6.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v6.0

   This driver version introduces breaking changes. For a list of these changes, see
   the :ref:`Version 6.0 Breaking Changes section <node-breaking-changes-v6.0>` in the
   Upgrade guide.

The {+driver-short+} v6.0 release includes the following features:

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

   All of the ``ssl``-prefixed options in the ``MongoClientOptions``
   type are deprecated. In addition, the ``tlsCertificateFile`` option
   is deprecated.

   Instead, you should store your certificates in a ``SecureContext``
   object or set the ``tls``-prefixed options in your
   ``MongoClientOptions`` instance. To learn more, see :ref:`node-connect-tls`.

- Removal of support for the ``addUser()`` helper command. Use the
  :manual:`createUser </reference/command/createUser>` MongoDB Shell command instead.

- Removal of support for the ``collStats`` operation. Use the
  :manual:`$collStats </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats>` aggregation operator
  instead.

- The ``options`` field of the ``ConnectionPoolCreatedEvent`` type
  contains only the following fields, which are the non-default pool
  options:

  - ``maxConnecting``
  - ``maxPoolSize``
  - ``minPoolSize``
  - ``maxIdleTimeMS``
  - ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``

- The driver asynchronously reads files set in the ``tlsCAFile`` and
  ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` connection options when you call
  the ``MongoClient.connect()`` method, not when you create a
  ``MongoClient`` instance.

- Removal of the ``keepAlive`` and ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` connection
  options. The value of ``keepAlive`` is permanently set to ``true`` and the
  value of ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` is set to 300000 milliseconds (300
  seconds).

  To learn how to set keepalive settings at a system level,
  see the :manual:`Does TCP keepalive time affect MongoDB Deployments? </faq/diagnostics/#does-tcp-keepalive-time-affect-mongodb-deployments->`
  FAQ entry in the Server manual.

- Removes the following options for the ``Db.command()`` method:

  - ``willRetryWrite``
  - ``omitReadPreference``
  - ``writeConcern``
  - ``explain``
  - ``readConcern``
  - ``collation``
  - ``maxTimeMS``
  - ``comment``
  - ``retryWrites``
  - ``dbName``
  - ``authdb``
  - ``noResponse``

  Although you cannot pass these options to the
  ``Db.command()`` method, you can still set them in the command
  document. To learn more, see the :ref:`Command Options
  <node-command-options>` section of the Run a Command guide.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.0.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.0.0>`__.
