======================
Modify a User's Access
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When a user's responsibilities change, modify the user's access to include
only those roles the user requires. This follows the policy of :term:`least
privilege`.

To change a user's access, first determine the privileges the user needs and
then determine the roles that grants those privileges. Grant and revoke roles
using the method:`db.grantRolesToUser()` and :method:`db.revokeRolesFromUser`
methods.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`. For
descriptions of the access each system role provides, see :ref:`system-defined
roles <system-user-roles>`.
