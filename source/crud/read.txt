.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step::  Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_connect.rst

      In this code block there is a comment to replace the connection URI
      with your own. Make sure to replace the URI string with your
      :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you want to query. In this case
      you will use the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and ``{+guides-coll+}``
      collection.

      .. tip::

         This database and collection is part of the :ref:`Atlas sample datasets <guides-load-sample-data>`.

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db.rst

   .. step::  Retrieve all documents in the ``{+guides-coll+}`` collection.


      .. include:: /includes/find_all.rst

   .. step::  Iterate over the results.

      .. include:: /includes/iterate_all_noshellcursor.rst

   .. step::  Check your results.

       Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

       .. tip:: Sample Output

          The sample output is a document from the Atlas sample datasets.
          If you get no output, ensure you follow the :ref:`Load Sample Data <guides-load-sample-data>` guide.
