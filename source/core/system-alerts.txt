Overview
--------

System alerts are internal health checks that monitor the health of
|onprem| itself, including the health of backing databases, Backup
Daemons, and backed-up deployments. |onprem| runs health checks every 5
minutes.

To view system alerts, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top of
|onprem|, select the :guilabel:`Alerts` tab, and then select the
:guilabel:`Open Alerts` link under :guilabel:`System Alerts`.

Users with the :ref:`global-owner-role` or
:ref:`global-monitoring-admin-role` roles can :ref:`modify notification
settings <edit-system-alert-notification>` or :ref:`disable
<disable-system-alert>` an alert.

System Alerts
-------------

|onprem| provides the following system alerts:

.. alert:: Backup oplog TTL was resized

   Sends an alert if the Backup Daemon has fallen so far behind in
   applying :term:`oplog` entries that |onprem| has extended the period of
   time it will store the
   entries. By default, |onprem| stores oplog entries in the :ref:`Oplog
   Store <oplog-stores-page>` for 24 hours. If the Daemon has not yet
   applied an entry an hour before its expiration, |onprem| extends the
   storage period by three hours. If the entry again reaches an hour from
   expiration, |onprem| continues to extend the storage period, up to
   seven days.

   If you receive this alert, check that your Backup Daemon is running and
   that it has sufficiently performant hardware to apply oplog entries in a timely
   manner.

.. alert:: Backing database startup warnings

   Sends an alert if the MongoDB process hosting a :ref:`backing database
   <backing-database>` contains ``startupWarnings`` in its log files.
   Check the logs on the server running the MongoDB process.

.. alert:: An unhealthy database backing the system

   Sends an alert if |onprem| cannot connect to a backing database and run
   the ping command.

.. alert:: Backup daemon is down

   Sends an alert the Backup Daemon has not pinged |onprem| for more than
   15 minutes.

.. alert:: Backup daemon has low free head space

   Sends an alert if the disk partition on which the local copy of a
   backed-up replica set is stored has less than 1 GB of free space
   remaining.

   Follow the :ref:`edit-system-alert-notification` procedure to change this
   space limit.

.. alert:: Backup daemon has low free head space percentage

   Sends an alert if the disk partition on which the local copy of a
   backed-up replica set is stored has less than 10 percent of free space
   remaining.

   Follow the :ref:`edit-system-alert-notification` procedure to change this
   percentage.

.. alert:: Backup was not moved successfully

   Sends an alert if you attempt to move a job to a new Backup Daemon but
   the move failed. The job will continue to run in its original location.
   For more information on moving jobs, see :ref:`jobs-page`.

.. .. alert:: Failed integrity check
..
..    Sends an alert if snapshots are potentially corrupt. |onprem| performs
..    a periodic integrity check of a snapshot to make sure that it is
..    complete in the blockstore. If that validation fails, the alert is
..    triggered. Another result of an integrity failure is that |onprem| no
..    longer uses past snapshots to optimize creation of future ones,
..    which ensures future snapshots are complete.
..
..    If you receive this alert, contact MongoDB Support.

.. alert:: Blockstore space used exceeds threshold

   Sent if the disk space used by the blockstore exceeds the configured
   :setting:`threshold <mms.alerts.OutsideSpaceUsedThreshold.maximumSpaceUsedPercent>` 
   setting. The default threshold is 85% of the total disk capacity
   on which the blockstore is stored, but you can change the
   :setting:`mms.alerts.OutsideSpaceUsedThreshold.maximumSpaceUsedPercent`
   value in the |onprem| configuration.
