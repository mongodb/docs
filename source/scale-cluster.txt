Considerations
--------------

Migration, Availability, and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time required for an :term:`initial sync` and resynchronizing data
across storage volumes increases linearly with the amount of data in
the cluster. Making changes to a cluster often requires migrating to
new servers and storage volumes, which can take a long time. However,
cluster changes can be made more quickly in some cases. For example,
changing the instance size of a cluster on AWS does not require an
initial sync.

.. admonition:: Changes to Free/Shared Tier clusters result in limited downtime
   :class: note

   All changes to ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` clusters require 7-10 minutes of downtime.

To maximize availability:

- For a replica set, |service| migrates one node at a time, starting
  with the secondary nodes first and then the primary.

- For a sharded cluster, |service| performs the migration of the shards
  independently of each other. For each shard (i.e. replica set),
  |service| migrates one node at a time, starting with the secondary
  nodes first and then the primary.

:manual:`Retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` should prevent any
write errors during the election of a new primary. On average, an
election can take five seconds.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity: each newly migrated replica set node must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` are set to read from
secondaries: the replica set is down one secondary during the
migration.

.. Note to writers: beginning in v20160712, an instance size change
.. with no disk change does not require an initial sync

Host Names Can Become Inconsistent with Respect to Node Types

Billing
~~~~~~~

As you modify your cluster, you can compare the costs of different
options before applying them. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
displays the cost of the selected configuration, excluding data
transfer.

.. admonition:: Free Tier
   :class: important

   Upgrading an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an ``M2`` or greater paid
   tier cluster starts billing for the cluster. See :doc:`billing` for
   complete documentation on |service| billing.

The following sections provide complete documentation for each of the
|service| cluster scaling configuration options.

.. _scale-cluster-open-dialog:

A. Open the :guilabel:`Editing Cluster` Dialog
----------------------------------------------

.. container:: admonition

   For the cluster you want to modify, click the ellipses :guilabel:`...`
   icon, then select :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.

   Alternatively, if you are already viewing the specific cluster,
   click the :guilabel:`Configuration` button.

   For ``M0`` Free Tier clusters, you can also click the
   :guilabel:`Upgrade` button for the cluster.

.. _scale-cluster-cloud-provider:

B. Modify the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` of the Cluster
----------------------------------------------------------------

Modify the Cloud Provider of the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider.rst

   .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider-live-migrate.rst

.. container:: admonition

   Select :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` to view the
   currently configured cloud provider and region for the cluster.

   If you are upgrading from an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5``
   Shared Tier cluster, you can change the cloud provider backing your
   cluster by selecting from the available cloud providers.

Modify the Region of the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   Review the available regions for the selected cloud provider. 

   .. note::

      You can only modify the region of |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or
      ``M2/M5`` clusters when upgrading the cluster to a larger
      :guilabel:`Instance Size`.

   Regions marked as |star| are
   :guilabel:`Recommended` regions that provide higher availability
   compared to other regions. For more information, see: 

   - :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`.   
   - :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`.   
   - :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-base.rst

   .. |star| unicode:: U+2605

   The choice of cloud provider and region affects the 
   configuration options for the available instance sizes, network 
   latency for clients accessing your cluster, and the 
   :doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`.

.. _scale-cluster-region:

Deploy or Modify a Multi-Region Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterProviderRegionOnly.rst

.. _scale-cluster-instance:

C. Modify the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` of the Cluster
-----------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: M10+ Downgrade Restrictions
   :class: note

   You cannot downgrade an ``M10+`` cluster to an 
   ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` Shared Starter instance size.

You can change the instance size, as well as the memory, storage,
and |iops| (speed) specifications for the selected instance size.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterInstance.rst

.. _scale-cluster-storage:

Customize the Storage Settings of the Selected Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/customize-storage.rst

D. Modify the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` of the Cluster
------------------------------------------------------------

.. container:: admonition

   From the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section, you can

   - :ref:`scale-cluster-version`,
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-backups`,
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-sharding`,
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-shardNum`,
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-bi`,
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-encryption`, and
   - :ref:`scale-cluster-more-configuration-options`.

.. _scale-cluster-version:

Upgrade the MongoDB Version of the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   Select :guilabel:`Additional Settings` to view the currently
   configured MongoDB version for the cluster.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version-downgrade-restriction-scale.rst

   Select the new MongoDB version from the :guilabel:`Select a version` 
   dropdown. |service| supports the following upgrade paths:

   - MongoDB 3.2 -> MongoDB 3.4
   - MongoDB 3.4 -> MongoDB 3.6
   - MongoDB 3.6 -> MongoDB 4.0

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-3.2-eol-upgrade.rst

   |service| running with MongoDB 3.2 *must* upgrade to MongoDB 3.4
   before upgrading to MongoDB 3.6. 

   See :doc:`/tutorial/major-version-change` for the
   MongoDB-recommended procedure for a major version change. This
   procedure includes creating a staging cluster for the purpose of
   testing and validating application and cluster performance and
   functionality on the new MongoDB version.

.. _scale-cluster-sharding:

Scale your Replica Set to a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterSharding.rst

.. _scale-cluster-shardNum:

Modify the :guilabel:`Number of Shards` in your sharded cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterShardingNum.rst

.. _scale-cluster-backups:

Enable or Disable Backup for the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterBackup.rst

   You can disable backups for the cluster by toggling this option to
   :guilabel:`No`. Once you disable backup, |service| immediately
   deletes any backup snapshots for the cluster. See 
   :doc:`/backup-cluster` for more information.

.. _scale-cluster-enable-bi:

Enable or Disable |bic| for the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-bi.rst

.. _scale-cluster-enable-encryption:
