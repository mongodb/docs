Prerequisites
-------------

To upgrade a replica set to |newversion|, all replica set members must be
running version |oldversion|. To upgrade a replica set from an earlier MongoDB
version, :doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
3.2-series release </release-notes/3.2-upgrade>` *first*, and then
follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion|.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:
