Manage MongoDB Users and Roles
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When :doc:`MongoDB access control is enabled
<enable-mongodb-access-control>`, you provide client access to MongoDB by
creating users and assigning user roles. The users you create apply to all
MongoDB deployments in your MMS group, but each user has a specified
authentication database. Together, the userâ€™s name and database serve as a
unique identifier for that user.

You can specify access using MongoDB's :manual:`built-in roles
</reference/built-in-roles>` and also by :doc:`creating custom roles
</tutorial/manage-mongodb-roles>`. MMS provides the interface for doing
so.

You can create users before enabling accessing control or after, but they
don't go into effect until you enable access control. The MongoDB
instances won't require user credentials until access control is enabled.

To authenticate, a client must specify the username, password, database,
and authentication mechanism. For example, from the :program:`mongo`
shell, a client would specify the ``--username``, ``--password``,
``--authenticationDatabase``, and ``--authenticationMechanism`` options.

MongoDB users are separate from :doc:`MMS users </tutorial/manage-users>`.
MongoDB users have access to MongoDB databases. MMS users access to MMS
groups.

Considerations
--------------

Use only the MMS interface to manage users. Do not do so through direct
connection to a MongoDB instance.
