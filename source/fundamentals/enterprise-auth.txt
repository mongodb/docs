In this guide, we show you how to authenticate with MongoDB using each
**authentication mechanism** available exclusively in the MongoDB Enterprise
Edition.

You can use the following mechanisms with the latest version of the MongoDB
Enterprise Edition:

Kerberos (GSSAPI)
LDAP (PLAIN)

To authenticate using another mechanism, see
:ref:`golang-authentication-mechanisms`. For more
information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, see 
:ref:`golang-connection-guide`.
