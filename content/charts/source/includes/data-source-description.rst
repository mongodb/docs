A data source in |charts| references one of the following:

- A :ref:`collection <collections>` or database 
  :manual:`view </core/views>` in your MongoDB deployment. 
- A :ref:`charts view <data-sources-pipeline>` that you create using a
  collection.

You can use the fields in the data source to construct a chart. When you build a chart, you must specify the data source that the chart uses.
