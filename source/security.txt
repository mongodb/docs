Preconfigured Security Features
-------------------------------

|tls|
~~~~~

|cloudgov| and databases hosted in |cloudgov-short| use 
|tls| 1.2 to encrypt connections. This cannot be disabled, 
and |cloudgov-short| does not allow |tls| versions less than 1.2.

|fips| 140-2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|cloudgov-short| automatically enables |fips| 140-2 level 2 for all
databases.  

Required Security Features
--------------------------

You *must* configure the following security features:

- :ref:`IP access list <allow-ip>`, and

- :ref:`Database user authentication <database-access>`.

Optional Security Features
--------------------------

A subset of commercial |service| 
:atlas:`optional security features </setup-cluster-security/#optional-security-features>` 
are available in |cloudgov-short| with some limitations.

Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must use KMS keys in |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| regions to encrypt data in 
  |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| region-only projects. You must use KMS keys in 
  |aws-fr-moderate| regions to encrypt data in |aws-fr-moderate| 
  region-only projects.

See the |service| documentation to configure 
:atlas:`Customer Key Management with AWS KMS </security-aws-kms/>` and 
:atlas:`Manage Customer Keys with Google Cloud KMS </security-aws-kms/>`.

|vpc| Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only peer |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only peer |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.
- You can only peer |gaw| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |gaw| regions.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Set up a Network Peering Connection </security-vpc-peering/>`

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only link |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only link |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.
- You can only link |gaw| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |gaw| regions.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Set up a Private Endpoint </security-private-endpoint/>`.

Outbound IP Addresses 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following endpoints: 

- Use the :oas-atlas-op:`Return All IP Addresses for One Project
  </returnAllIPAddresses>` endpoint to retrieve all outbound IP
  addresses for the clusters in your project. To use this endpoint, 
  your API key must have the :authrole:`Project Read Only` role.  

- Use the :oas-atlas-op:`Return All Control Plane IP Addresses
  </returnAllControlPlaneIPAddresses>` endpoint to retrieve all outbound
  IP addresses for the Atlas control plane, categorized by cloud
  provider.
