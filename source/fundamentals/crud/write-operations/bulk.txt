Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to
perform **bulk operations**. Bulk operations reduce the number
of calls to the server by performing multiple write operations
in a single method.

The ``Collection`` and ``Client`` classes both provide a ``BulkWrite()``
method. You can use the ``Collection.BulkWrite()`` method to perform
multiple write operations on a single collection. You can use the
``Client.BulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk writes across
multiple namespaces. In MongoDB, a namespace consists of a database name 
and a collection name.

.. important:: Client Bulk Write Server Requirement

   To perform bulk operations on a ``Client`` instance,
   ensure that your application connects to {+mdb-server+}
   v8.0 or later

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the following structs:

- ``Book`` struct, which models documents in the ``db.books`` collection.
  Each document contains a description of a book that includes the title,
  author, and page length.

- ``Poem`` struct, which models documents in the ``db.poems`` collection.
  Each document contains a description of a poem that includes the title,
  author, and publication year.

   :end-before: end-structs
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the
``books`` and ``poems`` collection by using the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

.. _golang-bulk-collection:

Collection Bulk Write
---------------------

To perform a bulk operation on a single namespace, call the ``BulkWrite()``
method on a collection and pass an array of :ref:`WriteModel <golang-write-model-collection>`
documents as a parameter.

.. _golang-write-model-collection:

Define Collection Bulk Write Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define the write operations for your bulk operation on one
namespace, create a ``WriteModel`` for each insert, replace,
update, or delete.

InsertOneModel
``````````````

To define an insert operation for a bulk write, create an
``InsertOneModel`` specifying the document you want to insert. To 
insert multiple documents, create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each
document you want to insert.

You can specify the behavior of the ``InsertOneModel`` by
using the following method:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetDocument()`` 
     - | The document to insert.

The following example creates two ``InsertOneModel`` instances to
insert two documents into the ``books`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk insert model collection
   :end-before: end bulk insert model collection

ReplaceOneModel
```````````````

To define a replace operation for a bulk write, create 
a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying the document you want
replace and a replacement document. To replace multiple
documents, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` for each document
you want to replace.

You can specify the behavior of the ``ReplaceOneModel`` by
using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` specifying which document to replace.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

   * - ``SetReplacement()`` 
     - | The document to replace the matched document with.

   * - ``SetSort()`` 
     - | The sort order for matching documents. The replace operation
         replaces only the first document according to the sort criteria.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` doesn't match any documents.

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to replace a
document in the ``books`` collection in which the ``title`` value is ``"Lucy"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk replace model collection
   :end-before: end bulk replace model collection

UpdateOneModel and UpdateManyModel
``````````````````````````````````

To define an update operation for a bulk write, create
an ``UpdateOneModel`` specifying the document you want to update
and an :ref:`update document <golang-update-document>`. To update
multiple documents, use an ``UpdateManyModel``.

You can specify the behavior of each of the update models
by using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetArrayFilters()`` 
     - | The array elements the update applies to.

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` specifying which document to update.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

   * - ``SetSort()`` 
     - | The criteria to use when ordering matching documents.
         This method is only available for the ``UpdateOneModel``
         class.

   * - ``SetUpdate()`` 
     - | The modifications to apply on the matched documents.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` doesn't match any documents.

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to update
a document in the ``books`` collection, decrementing a
document's ``length`` by ``15`` if the ``author`` is ``"Elena Ferrante"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk update model collection
   :end-before: end bulk update model collection

DeleteOneModel and DeleteManyModel
``````````````````````````````````

To define a delete operation for a bulk write, create a
``DeleteOneModel`` specifying the document you want to delete.
To delete multiple documents, use the ``DeleteManyModel``. 

You can specify the behavior of each of the delete models
by using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

   * - ``SetFilter()`` 
     - | The :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` specifying which document to delete.

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.

The following example creates a ``DeleteManyModel`` to delete
documents in the ``books`` collection in which the ``length`` is
greater than ``300``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk delete model collection
   :end-before: end bulk delete model collection

Modify Collection-Level Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the behavior of your bulk write operation, pass a ``BulkWriteOptions``
instance to the ``BulkWrite()`` method.

The ``BulkWriteOptions`` type allows you to configure options by using the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Specifies whether the operation can opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetComment()``
     - | Specifies a comment to attach to the operation. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLet()``
     - | Specifies a document with a list of values to improve operation readability. Values
         must be constant or closed expressions that don't reference document fields. For more
         information, see the ``let`` field for the :manual:`delete
         </reference/command/delete/#std-label-delete-let-syntax>` and :manual:`update
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` commands in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetOrdered()``
     - | Specifies whether the driver stops performing write operations after an error occurs. 
       | Default: ``true``

Collection-Level Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` type, which
includes information about the bulk operation.

The ``BulkWriteResult`` type contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``InsertedCount``
     - The number of documents inserted.

   * - ``MatchedCount``
     - The number of documents matched by the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` in update and replace operations.

   * - ``ModifiedCount``
     - The number of documents modified by update and replace operations.

   * - ``DeletedCount``
     - The number of documents deleted.
   
   * - ``UpsertedCount`` 
     - The number of documents :ref:`upserted <golang-upsert-definition>` by update and replace operations.

   * - ``UpsertedIDs`` 
     - A map of an operation index to the ``_id`` of each :ref:`upserted <golang-upsert-definition>` document.

   * - ``Acknowledged`` 
     - A boolean value that indicates whether the write operation was acknowledged.

Collection-Level Execution Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify whether the bulk write performs the operations
in order, you can set the ``Ordered`` option
to a boolean value. To set this option, specify the ``Ordered``
field of a ``BulkWriteOptions`` instance.

Ordered
```````

By default, the ``BulkWrite()`` method runs bulk operations in
order you added them and stops if an error occurs.

.. tip::

   This is equivalent to passing a value of ``true`` to the ``SetOrdered()``
   method, as shown in the following code: 

   .. code-block:: go
     
      opts := options.BulkWrite().SetOrdered(true)

Unordered
`````````

To run bulk write operations in any order and continue if an error
occurs, pass a value of ``false`` to the ``SetOrdered()`` method. The method
reports errors after the operation completes.

The following example performs the following actions in any order: 

- Inserts two documents
- Replaces a document where the ``title`` is "My Brilliant Friend" with a new document
- Increments every document's ``length`` by ``10`` if the current
  ``length`` value is less than ``200``
- Deletes all documents where the ``author`` field value includes ``"Jam"``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
      :start-after: begin unordered collection
      :end-before: end unordered collection
      :language: go
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Number of documents inserted: 2
      Number of documents replaced or updated: 2
      Number of documents deleted: 1

The following documents are present in the ``books`` collection after
the bulk operation:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {"title":"Atonement","author":"Ian McEwan","length":351}
   {"title":"Middlemarch","author":"George Eliot","length":904}
   {"title":"Pale Fire","author":"Vladimir Nabokov","length":246}

.. _golang-bulk-client:

Client Bulk Write
-----------------

To perform a bulk operation across multiple namespaces, call the
``BulkWrite()`` method on your client and pass an array of
:ref:`ClientWriteModel <golang-write-model-client>` documents as a parameter.

.. _golang-write-model-client:

Define Client Bulk Write Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the write operations for your bulk operation on multiple
namespaces, create a ``ClientWriteModel`` for each insert,
replace, update, or delete. Pass each write model to the
``ClientBulkWrite`` struct and specify the target database and collection,
as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: go

   writes := []mongo.ClientBulkWrite{
     {"<database name>", "<collection name>", <write model>},
     ...
   }

ClientInsertOneModel
````````````````````

To define an insert operation for a bulk write, create a ``ClientInsertOneModel``
specifying the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, create
a ``ClientInsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

You can specify the behavior of the ``ClientInsertOneModel``
by using the following method:

   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetDocument()`` 
     - | The document to insert.

The following example creates two ``ClientInsertOneModel`` instances to
insert one document into the ``books`` collection and one document into the
``poems`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk insert model client
   :end-before: end bulk insert model client

`````````````````````

To define a replace operation for a bulk write, create
a ``ClientReplaceOneModel`` specifying the document
you want to replace and a :ref:`replacement document <golang-replacement-document>`.
To replace multiple documents, create a ``ClientReplaceOneModel`` for
each document you want to replace.

You can specify the behavior of the ``ClientReplaceOneModel`` by
using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

This example creates ``ClientReplaceOneModel`` instances to define
the following operations:

- Replace operation on the ``books`` collection to replace a 
  document in which the ``title`` value is ``"Lucy"``

- Replace operation on the ``poems`` collection to replace a 
  document in which the ``title`` value is ``"Song of Myself"``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk replace model client
   :end-before: end bulk replace model client

ClientUpdateOneModel and ClientUpdateManyModel
``````````````````````````````````````````````

To define an update operation for a bulk write, create
a ``ClientUpdateOneModel`` specifying the document you
want to update and an :ref:`update document <golang-update-document>`.
To update multiple documents, use a ``ClientUpdateManyModel``.

You can specify the behavior of each of the update models
by using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetArrayFilters()`` 
     - | The array elements the update applies to.

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

     - | The modifications to apply on the matched documents.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>`
         doesn't match any documents.

This example creates ``ClientUpdateOneModel`` instances to define
the following operations:

- Update operation on the ``books`` collection to update a 
  document in which the ``author`` value is ``"Elena Ferrante"``

- Update operation on the ``poems`` collection to update a 
  document in which the ``author`` value is ``"Ada Limon"``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk update model client
   :end-before: end bulk update model client

.. note::

   To update all documents that match the ``author`` field
   query filters in the preceding example, use ``ClientUpdateManyModel``
   instances.

ClientDeleteOneModel and ClientDeleteManyModel
``````````````````````````````````````````````

To define a delete operation for a bulk write, create
a ``ClientDeleteOneModel`` specifying the document you want

  document in which the ``length`` value is ``103``

- Delete operation on the ``poems`` collection to delete a 
  document in which the ``year`` value is ``1855``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk delete model client
   :end-before: end bulk delete model client

Modify Client-Level Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the behavior of your bulk write operation, pass a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions``
instance to the ``BulkWrite()`` method.

The ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` type allows you to configure options by using the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method

   * - ``Acknowledged`` 
     - A boolean value that indicates whether the write operation was acknowledged.

   * - ``HasVerboseResults`` 
     - A boolean value that indicates whether the result contains detailed results.

Client-Level Execution Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify whether the bulk write performs the operations
in order, you can set the ``Ordered`` option
to a boolean value. To set this option, specify the ``Ordered``
field of a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` instance.

Ordered
```````

By default, the ``BulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order you added them and stops if an error occurs.

.. tip::

   This is equivalent to passing a value of ``true`` to the ``SetOrdered()``
