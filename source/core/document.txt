Documents

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB stores all data in documents, which are JSON-style data
structures composed of field-and-value pairs:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "item": "pencil", "qty": 500, "type": "no.2" }

Most user-accessible data structures in MongoDB are documents,
including:

- All database records.

- :doc:`Query selectors </core/read-operations>`, which define what records to
  select for read, update, and delete operations.

- :doc:`Update definitions </core/write-operations>`, which define what fields
  to modify during an update.

- :doc:`Index specifications </core/indexes>`, which define what
  fields to index.

- Data output by MongoDB for reporting and configuration, such as the
  output of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` and the :ref:`replica set
  configuration document <replica-set-configuration-document>`.

Document Format
---------------

MongoDB stores documents on disk in the :term:`BSON` serialization
format. BSON is a binary representation of :term:`JSON` documents,
though contains more data types than does JSON. For the BSON spec, see
`bsonspec.org <http://bsonspec.org/>`_. See also
:doc:`/reference/bson-types`.

The :program:`mongo` JavaScript shell and the :doc:`MongoDB language
drivers </applications/drivers>` translate between BSON and the
language-specific document representation.


Document Structure
------------------

MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the
following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      field1: value1,
      field2: value2,
      field3: value3,
      ...
      fieldN: valueN
   }

The value of a field can be any of the BSON :doc:`data types
</reference/bson-types>`, including other documents, arrays, and arrays of
documents. The following document contains values of varying types:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var mydoc = {
                  _id: ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
                  name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
                  birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
                  death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
                  contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
                  views : NumberLong(1250000)
               }

The above fields have the following data types:

- ``_id`` holds an *ObjectId*.

- ``name`` holds a *subdocument* that contains the fields ``first`` and
  ``last``.

- ``birth`` and ``death`` hold values of the *Date* type.

- ``contribs`` holds an *array of strings*.

- ``views`` holds a value of the *NumberLong* type.

Field Names
-----------

Field names are strings. Field names cannot contain null characters,
dots (``.``) or dollar signs (``$``). See
:ref:`faq-dollar-sign-escaping` for an alternate approach.

BSON documents may have more than one field with the same name.
Most :doc:`MongoDB interfaces </applications/drivers>`, however, represent MongoDB
with a structure (e.g. a hash table) that does not support duplicate
field names. If you need to manipulate documents that have more than one
field with the same name, see the :doc:`driver documentation
</applications/drivers>` for your driver.

Some documents created by internal MongoDB processes may have duplicate
fields, but *no* MongoDB process will *ever* add duplicate fields to an
existing user document.

Document Limitations
--------------------

Documents have the following attributes:

- .. include:: /includes/fact-document-max-size.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-document-field-name-restrictions.rst

- MongoDB does not make guarantees regarding the order of fields in
  a BSON document. Drivers and MongoDB will reorder the fields of a
  documents upon insertion and following updates.

  Most programming languages represent BSON documents with some form
  of :term:`mapping type <mapping types>`. Comparisons between mapping typed objects
  depend on order. As a result, the only way to ensure that two
  documents have the same set of field and value pairs is to compare
  each field and value individually.

The ``_id`` Field
-----------------

The ``_id`` field has the following behavior and constraints:

- In documents, the ``_id`` field is always indexed for regular
  collections.

- The ``_id`` field may contain values of any :doc:`BSON data type
  </reference/bson-types>`, other than an array.

  .. warning:: To ensure functioning replication, do not store values
     that are of the BSON regular expression type in the ``_id``
     field.

     .. See :issue:`SERVER-9562` for more information.

The following are common options for storing values for ``_id``:

- Use an :doc:`ObjectId </reference/object-id>`.

- Use a natural unique identifier, if available. This saves space and
  avoids an additional index.

- Generate an auto-incrementing number. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/create-an-auto-incrementing-field`.

- Generate a UUID in your application code. For a more efficient
  storage of the UUID values in the collection and in the ``_id``
  index, store the UUID as a value of the BSON ``BinData`` type.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-bindata-storage-optimization.rst

- Use your driver's BSON UUID facility to generate UUIDs. Be aware
  that driver implementations may implement UUID serialization and
  deserialization logic differently, which may not be fully compatible
  with other drivers. See your :api:`driver documentation <>` for
  information concerning UUID interoperability.
