|service| offers the following security features for 
{+database-deployment+} authentication and authorization.

Database User Authentication or Authorization
---------------------------------------------

|service| requires clients to authenticate to access
{+database-deployments+}. You must create database users to access the
database. To set up database users for your {+database-deployments+}, 
see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

Custom Database Roles
---------------------

When the built-in |service|
:ref:`database user privileges <atlas-user-privileges>` don't
meet your desired set of privileges, you can create :ref:`custom roles 
<mongodb-roles>`.

Authentication with AWS IAM
---------------------------

You can authenticate applications running on |aws| services to |service|
{+clusters+} with |aws| |iam| roles. You can set up a database user to
use an |aws| |iam| role ARN for authentication and connect to your
database using {+mongosh+} and drivers that authenticate using your |aws|
|iam| role ARN. Using |aws| |iam| role reduces the number of
authentication mechanisms and number of secrets to manage.

To learn more, see :ref:`set-up-pwdless-auth`. 

User Authentication or Authorization with |ldap|
------------------------------------------------

|service| supports performing user authentication and authorization
with |ldap|. To use |ldap|, see
:doc:`Set up User Authentication and Authorization with LDAP </security-ldaps>`.

User Authentication with |oidc|
-------------------------------

|service| supports performing user authentication and authorization
with |oidc|. To use |oidc|, see :ref:`oidc-authentication-authorization`.

User Authentication with X.509
------------------------------

X.509 client certificates provide database users access to the 
{+database-deployments+} in your project. Options for X.509 
authentication include |service|-managed X.509 authentication and 
self-managed X.509 authentication. To learn more 
about self-managed X.509 authentication, see :ref:`self-managed-x509`.
