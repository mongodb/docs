Replication Processes

Members of a :term:`replica set` replicate data continuously. First, a
member uses *initial sync* to capture the data set. Then the member
continuously records and applies every operation that modifies the data
set. Every member records operations in its :doc:`oplog
</core/replica-set-oplog>`, which is a :term:`capped collection`.
