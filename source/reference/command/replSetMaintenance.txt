replSetMaintenance
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: replSetMaintenance

   The :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` admin command enables or disables the
   maintenance mode for a :term:`secondary` member of a :term:`replica
   set`.
   
   The command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetMaintenance: <boolean> }

   Consider the following behavior when running the
   :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` command:
   
   - You cannot run the command on the Primary.
   
   - You must run the command against the ``admin`` database.
   
   - When enabled ``replSetMaintenance: 1``, the member enters the
     ``RECOVERING`` state. While the secondary is ``RECOVERING``:
     
     - The member is not accessible for read operations.
     
     - The member continues to sync its :term:`oplog` from the Primary.
