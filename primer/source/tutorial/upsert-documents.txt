==================================
Upsert: Insert or Update Documents
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

By default, if the update condition matches no document, then the
update operation will not modify any document. In cases where you want
to insert a document if there are no matching documents, you
can specify an ``upsert`` option to the
:method:`~db.collection.update()` method.

The ``upsert`` option specifies that if the method finds matching
documents, the operation is an update. *However*, if the method does not find
any matching documents, the operation becomes an insert.

MongoDB refers to this update-or-insert operation as an
:term:`upsert`  operation.
