This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the **Java driver**
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB
using a different driver or programming language, see our
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

The Java driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters

own free (no credit card required) cluster.

Consult the following steps to connect your Java application with a MongoDB Atlas
cluster.
