|mms| provides built-in tools, alerts, charts, integrations, and 
logs to help you monitor your cluster. |mms| provides the following 
ways to monitor your deployments and improve performance.

Slow Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize your query performance, :ref:`review the best 
practices for query performance <query-best-practices>`. You can also 
:ref:`analyze slow queries <analyze-slow-queries>` and troubleshoot 
slow operations executed on your clusters.

Use the following built-in tools:

- :ref:`Monitor and improve slow queries <performance-advisor>` with 
  the Performance Advisor.
   
- :ref:`Monitor query performance <profile-databases>` with the 
  Profiler.

Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize your schema design, review our frequently used :ref:`schema 
design patterns <schema-design-patterns>`. You can also :ref:`improve 
your schema <schema-advisor>`. Improve your schema based on 
recommendations from the :ref:`Performance Advisor 
<performance-advisor>` and the :ref:`Data Explorer 
<data-explorer-db-colls>`.

Alerts
~~~~~~

To trigger alerts based on :ref:`alert conditions <alert-conditions>` 
and to help ensure deployment performance, 
:ref:`configure alerts and resolve them promptly <alerts>`. You can 
configure alerts based on specific conditions for your 
databases, users, accounts, and more. When you resolve alerts, you 
should fix the immediate problem, implement a long-term solution, and 
monitor your progress.

Deployment Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To monitor your deployment performance, :ref:`view 
deployment metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>`. View historical 
throughput, performance, and utilization metrics for your databases. To 
learn more, :ref:`review the available metrics 
<review-available-metrics>`.

Third-Party Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To receive |service| alerts in various 
external monitoring services, 
:ref:`integrate with third-party monitoring services 
<third-party-integrations>`.

MongoDB Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view :manual:`log messages
</reference/log-messages>` and :manual:`system event audit messages
</reference/audit-message>`, :ref:`view and download your MongoDB logs 
<mongodb-logs>`.

Diagnostic Archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To debug and troubleshoot issues, 
:ref:`locate and download the diagnostic archives 
<download-diagnostic-archives>`.
