Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify a query by using the {+php-library+}.

You can refine the set of documents that a query returns by creating a
**query filter**. A query filter is an expression that specifies the search
criteria that MongoDB uses to match documents in a read or write operation.
In a query filter, you can prompt the driver to search for documents that have
an exact match to your query, or you can compose query filters to express more
complex matching criteria.

.. tip:: Operations with Builders

   You can use a builder pattern to create filters to use in your queries.
   To learn more, see the :ref:`php-builders` guide.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide run operations on the ``fruits`` collection,
which contains documents representing fruits. The following
code example shows how to create a database and collection, then
insert the sample documents into your collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
   :start-after: start-setup
   :end-before: end-setup
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :copyable:

Exact Match
-----------

Literal value queries return documents that have an exact match to your query filter.

The following example specifies a query filter as a parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()``
method. The code returns all documents in which the value of the ``color`` field
is ``'yellow'``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: 

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-exact
      :end-before: end-find-exact
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false    

      {"_id":2,"name":"bananas","qty":7,"rating":4,"color":"yellow","type":["cavendish"]}
      {"_id":4,"name":"pineapples","qty":3,"rating":5,"color":"yellow"}

.. tip:: Find All Documents

   To find all documents in a collection, call the ``find()`` method and pass it an
   empty query filter. The following example finds all documents in a
   collection:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-all
      :end-before: end-find-all
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :copyable:

Comparison Operators
--------------------

Comparison operators evaluate a document field value against a specified value
in your query filter. The following list defines common comparison operators:

- ``$gt``: Greater than
- ``$lte``: Less than or Equal
- ``$ne``: Not equal

To view a full list of comparison operators, see the :manual:`Comparison Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-comparison/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example specifies a comparison operator in a query filter as a
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method. The code returns all documents
in which the value of the ``rating`` field is greater than ``2``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: 

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-comparison
      :end-before: end-find-comparison
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":1,"name":"apples","qty":5,"rating":3,"color":"red","type":["fuji","honeycrisp"]}
      {"_id":2,"name":"bananas","qty":7,"rating":4,"color":"yellow","type":["cavendish"]}
      {"_id":4,"name":"pineapples","qty":3,"rating":5,"color":"yellow"}

Logical Operators
-----------------

Logical operators match documents by using logic applied to the results of two or
more sets of expressions. The following list describes each logical operator: 

- ``$and``: Returns all documents that match the conditions of *all* clauses
- ``$or``: Returns all documents that match the conditions of *one* clause
- ``$nor``: Returns all documents that *do not* match the conditions of any clause
- ``$not``: Returns all documents that *do not* match the expression

To learn more about logical operators, see the :manual:`Logical Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-logical/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example specifies a logical operator in a query filter as a
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method. The code returns all documents
in which the ``qty`` field value is greater than ``5`` **or** the ``color`` field
value is ``'yellow'``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-logical
      :end-before: end-find-logical
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":2,"name":"bananas","qty":7,"rating":4,"color":"yellow","type":["cavendish"]}
      {"_id":3,"name":"oranges","qty":6,"rating":2,"type":["naval","mandarin"]}
      {"_id":4,"name":"pineapples","qty":3,"rating":5,"color":"yellow"}

Array Operators
---------------

Array operators match documents based on the value or quantity of elements in an
array field. The following list describes the available array operators:

- ``$all``: Returns documents with arrays that contain all elements in the query
- ``$elemMatch``: Returns documents if an element in their array field matches all conditions in the query
- ``$size``: Returns all documents with arrays of a specified size

To learn more about array operators, see the :manual:`Array Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-array/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example specifies an array operator in a query filter as a
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method. The code returns all
documents in which the ``type`` array field contains ``2`` elements:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-array
      :end-before: end-find-array
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":1,"name":"apples","qty":5,"rating":3,"color":"red","type":["fuji","honeycrisp"]}
      {"_id":3,"name":"oranges","qty":6,"rating":2,"type":["naval","mandarin"]}

Element Operators
-----------------

Element operators query data based on the presence or type of a field.

To learn more about element operators, see the :manual:`Element Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-element/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example specifies an element operator in a query filter as a
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method. The code returns all
documents that have a ``color`` field:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-element
      :end-before: end-find-element
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":1,"name":"apples","qty":5,"rating":3,"color":"red","type":["fuji","honeycrisp"]}
      {"_id":2,"name":"bananas","qty":7,"rating":4,"color":"yellow","type":["cavendish"]}
      {"_id":4,"name":"pineapples","qty":3,"rating":5,"color":"yellow"}

Evaluation Operators
--------------------

Evaluation operators return data based on evaluations of either individual
fields or the entire collection's documents.

The following list describes common evaluation operators:

- ``$text``: Performs a text search on the documents
- ``$regex``: Returns documents that match a specified regular expression
- ``$mod``: Performs a modulo operation on the value of a field and
  returns documents where the remainder is a specified value

To view a full list of evaluation operators, see the :manual:`Evaluation Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-evaluation/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example specifies an evaluation operator in a query filter as a
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method. The code uses a regular
expression to return all documents in which the ``name`` field value has at least
two consecutive ``'p'`` characters:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/specify-queries.php
      :start-after: start-find-evaluation
      :end-before: end-find-evaluation
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":1,"name":"apples","qty":5,"rating":3,"color":"red","type":["fuji","honeycrisp"]}
      {"_id":4,"name":"pineapples","qty":3,"rating":5,"color":"yellow"}
