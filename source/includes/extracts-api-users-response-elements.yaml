      * - links
        - object array

          include at least one link called self. The relations between URLs are 
          explained in the `Web Linking Specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`__.

             For the "global" roles (those whose name starts
             with ``GLOBAL_``) there is no **groupId** since these
             roles are not tied to a group.

      * - roles.orgId
        - string
        - The ID of the organization in which the user has the specified role. 

      * - roles.roleName
        - string
        - The name of the role. Accepted values are:

          .. only:: cloud

             .. note::

                The ``users`` resource returns all the roles the user
                has in both |mms| and |service|.
