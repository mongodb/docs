CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable you to work with
data stored in MongoDB.

- :ref:`Read Operations <java-read-operations>` find and return
  documents stored in your database.
- :ref:`Write Operations <java-write-operations>` insert, modify,
  or delete documents in your database.

Some operations combine aspects of read and write operations. See our
guide on :ref:`compound operations <java-compound-operations>`
to learn more about these hybrid methods.
