      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`Store Path`

        - The location where file system-based backups are stored on the |onprem| server.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels`

        - A comma-separated list of labels to assign the filestores to specific groups.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor`

        - A proportional value of how backup jobs are assigned to the
          given snapshot store compared to other snapshot stores.

          By default snapshot stores assign one shard per snapshot
          store.

          If a snapshot store has more than one shard assigned, it
          would result in one snapshot store being backed up often than
          the another. This ratio of backup jobs to shards can be
          changed using the load factor.

          An example of how the Load Factor affects backups:

          You are backing up a 5 shard cluster. Your deployment has
          filestore (A) with one shard and blockstore (B) with four
          shards. These blockstores should not get equally distribution
          of backup jobs, as B is four times larger than A. B should
          get a Load Factor of 4 and A should get a Load Factor or 1.
