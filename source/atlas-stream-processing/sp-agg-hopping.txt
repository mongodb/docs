Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow` stage specifies a 
:ref:`hopping window <hopping-windows>` for aggregation of data.
{+atlas-sp+} windows are stateful, can be recovered if interrupted, 
and have mechanisms for processing late-arriving data. You must apply 
all other aggregation queries to your streaming data within this 
window stage.

.. pipeline:: $hoppingWindow

   A ``$hoppingWindow`` pipeline stage has the following prototype 
   form:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "$hoppingWindow": {
          "interval": { 
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "hopSize": {
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "pipeline" : [ 
            <aggregation-stage-array> 
          ],
          "offset": {
            "offsetFromUtc": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "idleTimeout": {
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "allowedLateness": {
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>" 
          },
        }  
      }

Syntax
~~~~~~

The ``$hoppingWindow`` stage takes a document with the following 
fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``interval``
     - document 
     - Required
     - Document specifying the interval of a 
       :ref:`hopping window <hopping-windows>` as a combination of
       a size and a unit of time where: 
       
       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` can be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       For example, a ``size`` of ``20`` and a ``unit`` of ``second``
       sets each window to remain open for 20 seconds.

   * - ``hopSize``
     - document 
     - Required
     - Document that specifies the length of the 
       :ref:`hop <hopping-windows>` between window start times as a 
       combination of a ``size`` and a ``unit`` of time where: 
       
       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` can be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``
       
       For example, a ``size`` of ``10`` and a ``unit`` of ``second``
       defines a 10-second hop between window start times.

   * - ``pipeline`` 
     - array
     - Required 
     - Nested aggregation pipeline evaluated against the messages
       within the window.

   * - ``offset``
     - document
     - Optional
     - Document specifying a time offset for window boundaries relative 
       to UTC. The document is a combination of the size field 
       ``offsetFromUtc`` and a unit of time where:
       
       - The value of ``offsetFromUtc`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` must be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
       
       For example, an ``offsetFromUtc`` of ``8`` and a ``unit`` of 
       ``hour`` generates boundaries that are shifted eight hours
       ahead of UTC. If you do not specify an offset, the window 
       boundaries align with UTC.

   * - ``idleTimeout`` 
     - document 
     - Optional 
     - Document specifying how long to wait before closing windows if 
       ``$source`` is idle. Define this setting as a combination of a
       ``size`` and a ``unit`` of time where: 

       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` can be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       If you set ``idleTimeout``, {+atlas-sp+} closes open windows only
       if ``$source`` is idle for longer than the greater of either the 
       remaining window time or ``idleTimeout`` time. The idle timer 
       starts as soon as ``$source`` goes idle. 
       
       For example, consider a 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm window and
       ``idleTimeout`` time of 2 hours. If the last event is at 12:02 pm 
       after which ``$source`` goes idle, the remaining window time is
       58 minutes. {+atlas-sp+} closes the window after 2 hours of
       idleness at 2:02 pm, which is longer than the remaining window
       time and the ``idleTimeout`` time. If the ``idleTimeout`` time is
       set to only 10 minutes, {+atlas-sp+} closes the window after 58
       minutes of idleness at 1:00 pm, which is longer than
       ``idleTimeout`` time and the remaining window time.  
 
   * - ``allowedLateness``
     - document 
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies how long to keep 
       :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` generated from the 
       source open to accept late-arriving data after processing
       documents for window end time. If omitted, defaults to 3
       seconds.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-hopping-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

{+atlas-sp+} supports only one :ref:`window <atlas-sp-windows>` 
stage per pipeline.

When you apply the :pipeline:`$group` stage to your window stage,
a single :manual:`group key </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`
has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM.

Support for certain aggregation stages might be limited or unavailable
within windows. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-sp-aggregation-support`.

In the event of a service interruption, you can resume the internal
pipeline of a window from its state at the point of interruption. To
learn more, see :ref:`Checkpoints <atlas-sp-checkpointing>`.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A streaming data source generates detailed weather reports from
various locations, conformant to the schema of the :ref:`Sample
Weather Dataset <sample-weather>`. The following aggregation has three
stages:

1. The :pipeline:`$source` stage establishes a connection with the
   {+kafka+} broker collecting these reports in a topic named
   ``my_weatherdata``, exposing each record as it is ingested to the
   subsequent aggregation stages.

2. The :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow` stage defines overlapping windows of time that 
   are 100 seconds in duration, and which begin every 20 seconds. Each window executes 
   an internal ``pipeline`` which finds the average
   ``liquidPrecipitation.depth``, as defined in the ``sample_weatherdata`` documents
   streamed from the {+kafka+} broker, for the duration of a given window.
   The ``pipeline`` then outputs a single document with an ``_id`` equivalent to the start 
   timestamp of the window it represents and the ``averagePrecipitation`` for 
   that window. 

3. The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output to an {+service+}
   collection named ``stream`` in the ``sample_weatherstream``
   database. If no such database or collection exist, {+service+}
   creates them.

.. code-block:: js
   
   pipeline = [ 
    { $source: 
        { 
            "connectionName": "streamsExampleConnectionToKafka", 
            "topic": "my_weatherdata"
        }
    },
    { $hoppingWindow: 
        {
          "interval": {
            "size": 100,
            "unit": "second"
          },
          "hopSize": {
            "size": 20,
            "unit": "second"
          },
          "pipeline" : [
            {
                $group: {
                    _id: { "$meta": "stream.window.start" },
                    averagePrecipitation: { $avg: "$liquidPrecipitation.depth" }
                }
            }
            
          ],
        }
    },
    { $merge: 
        { 
            "into": 
            {
                "connectionName":"streamsExampleConnectionToAtlas",
                "db":"streamDB", 
                "coll":"streamCollection"
            }
        }
     }
   ]

To view the documents in the resulting ``sample_weatherstream.stream``
collection, connect to your {+service+} cluster and run the following command:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
    :language: json

      db.getSiblingDB("sample_weatherstream").stream.find()

   .. output::
    :language: json

    {
      _id: ISODate('2024-08-28T19:30:20.000Z'),
      averagePrecipitation: 2264.3973214285716
    },
    {
      _id: ISODate('2024-08-28T19:30:40.000Z'),
      averagePrecipitation: 2285.7061611374406
    },
    {
      _id: ISODate('2024-08-28T19:31:00.000Z'),
      averagePrecipitation: 2357.6940154440153
    },
    {
      _id: ISODate('2024-08-28T19:31:20.000Z'),
      averagePrecipitation: 2378.374061433447
    }

.. note::

   The preceding is a representative example. Streaming data are
   not static, and each user sees distinct documents.
