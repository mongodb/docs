Overview
--------

|mms| supports safe automatic MongoDB version upgrades and downgrades
of managed MongoDB deployments while maximizing the availability of
your deployment. |mms| can upgrade and downgrade :term:`sharded
clusters <sharded cluster>`, :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, and
:term:`standalone MongoDB instances <standalone>`.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version` describes how
to choose which versions of MongoDB are available to |mms|.

If |mms| does not manage your deployment, you need to change the
version of MongoDB manually. The MongoDB Manual provides upgrade
tutorials with each :manual:`release </release-notes>`.
