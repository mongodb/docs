The Grove platform automatically runs tests in CI when you make a pull request.
The test results report as a pass or failure on your pull request.

However, you can also run tests locally before you commit your changes. This
can help you catch errors early and iterate to a passing test more quickly.

The specifics of how to run the tests varies by interface and language.
Select your interface and language for specific details.
