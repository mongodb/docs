This tutorial describes the process for creating backups and restoring data
using the utilities provided with MongoDB. 

.. topic:: MongoDB Atlas

   MongoDB Atlas, the official MongoDB cloud service, provides 2 fully-managed
   methods for backups:

   1. :atlas:`Continuous Backups </backup/continuous-backups>`, which take
      incremental backups of data in your cluster, ensuring your backups are
      typically just a few seconds behind the operational system. Atlas continuous
      backups allow you to restore from stored snapshots or from a selected point
      in time within the last 24 hours.  You can also query a continuous backup
      snapshot.

   #. :atlas:`Cloud Provider Snapshots </backup/cloud-provider-snapshots>`, which
      provide localized backup storage using the native snapshot functionality of
      the cluster's cloud service provider.

Considerations
--------------

Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utilities
work with :doc:`BSON </reference/bson-types>` data dumps, and are
useful for creating backups of small deployments. For resilient and
non-disruptive backups, use a file system or block-level disk snapshot
function, such as the methods described in the :doc:`/core/backups`
document.

Binary BSON Dumps
-----------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` and :binary:`~bin.mongodump` utilities work with
:doc:`BSON </reference/bson-types>` data dumps, and are useful for creating
backups of small deployments. For resilient and non-disruptive backups, use a
file system or block-level disk snapshot function, such as the methods
described in the :doc:`/core/backups` document.

Use these tools for backups if other backup methods, such as

Procedures

Back Up a Database with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/sharded-clusters-backup-restore-mongodump-mongorestore-restriction.rst

Exclude ``local`` Database
``````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodump-local-database.rst

Required Access
```````````````

.. include:: /includes/access-mongodump-collections.rst

Basic ``mongodump`` Operations
``````````````````````````````

The :binary:`~bin.mongodump` utility backs up data by connecting to a
running :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

The utility can create a backup for an entire server, database or collection,
or can use a query to backup just part of a collection.

When you run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` without any arguments, the command
connects to the MongoDB instance on the local system
(e.g. ``localhost``) on port ``27017`` and creates a
database backup named ``dump/`` in the current directory.

To backup data from a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
running on the same machine and on the default port of ``27017``,
use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump

You can also specify the :option:`--host <mongodump.--host>` and
:option:`--port <mongodump.--port>` of the MongoDB instance that the
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` should connect to. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --host=mongodb.example.net --port=27017

:binary:`~bin.mongodump` will write :term:`BSON` files that hold a copy of
data accessible via the :binary:`~bin.mongod` listening on port ``27017`` of
the ``mongodb.example.net`` host. See :ref:`backup-from-non-local` for more
information.

To specify a different output directory, you can use the :option:`--out
or -o <mongodump.--out>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --out=/data/backup/

To limit the amount of data included in the database dump, you can
specify :option:`--db <mongodump.--db>` and
:option:`--collection <mongodump.--collection>` as options to
:binary:`~bin.mongodump`. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodump --collection=myCollection --db=test

This operation creates a dump of the collection named ``myCollection``
from the database ``test`` in a :file:`dump/` subdirectory of the
current working directory.

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodump-overwrite-files.rst

Point in Time Operation Using Oplogs
````````````````````````````````````

Use the :option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` option with
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` to collect the :term:`oplog` entries to build a
point-in-time snapshot of a database within a replica set. With
:option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>`, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` copies
all the data from the source database as well as all of the
:term:`oplog` entries from the beginning to the end of the backup
procedure. This operation, in conjunction with :option:`mongorestore
--oplogReplay <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>`, allows you to restore a
backup that reflects the specific moment in time that corresponds to
when :binary:`~bin.mongodump` completed creating the dump file.

.. _backup-from-non-local:

Create Backups from Non-Local ``mongod`` Instances
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

The :option:`--host <mongodump.--host>` and
:option:`--port <mongodump.--port>` options for
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` allow you to connect to and backup from a remote host.
Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --host=mongodb1.example.net --port=3017 --username=user --password="pass" --out=/opt/backup/mongodump-2013-10-24

On any :binary:`~bin.mongodump` command you may, as above, specify username
and password credentials to specify database authentication.

.. _backup-restore-dump:

Restore a Database with ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/sharded-clusters-backup-restore-mongodump-mongorestore-restriction.rst

Access Control
``````````````

To restore data to a MongoDB deployment that has :doc:`access control
</core/authorization>` enabled, the :authrole:`restore` role provides
the necessary privileges to restore data from backups *if* the data does
not include :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>`
collection data and you run :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` without the
:option:`--oplogReplay <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>` option.

.. include:: /includes/access-mongorestore-collections.rst

Basic ``mongorestore`` Operations
`````````````````````````````````

The :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utility restores a binary backup created by
:binary:`~bin.mongodump`. By default, :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` looks for a
database backup in the :file:`dump/` directory.

The :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utility restores data by connecting to a
running :binary:`~bin.mongod` directly.

:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` can restore either an entire database backup
or a subset of the backup.

.. include:: /includes/fact-uuid-restore-from-backup.rst

To use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to connect to an active
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, use a command with the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --port=<port number> <path to the backup>


Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore dump-2013-10-25/

Here, :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` imports the database backup in
the :file:`dump-2013-10-25` directory to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
running on the localhost interface on the default port ``27017``.

.. _backup-restore-oplogreplay:

Restore Point in Time Oplog Backup
``````````````````````````````````

If you created your database dump using the :option:`--oplog
<mongodump.--oplog>` option to ensure a point-in-time snapshot, call
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` with the
:option:`--oplogReplay <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>`
option, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --oplogReplay

You may also consider using the :option:`mongorestore --objcheck <mongorestore.--objcheck>`
option to check the integrity of objects while inserting them into the
database, or you may consider the :option:`mongorestore --drop <mongorestore.--drop>` option to drop each
collection from the database before restoring from
backups.

Restore Backups to Non-Local ``mongod`` Instances
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

By default, :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` connects to a MongoDB instance
running on the localhost interface and on the
default port (``27017``). If you want to restore to a different host or
port, use the :option:`--host <mongorestore.--host>` and :option:`--port
<mongorestore.--port>` options.

The following example that specifies the :option:`--host
<mongorestore.--host>` and :option:`--port <mongorestore.--port>`
options:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --host=mongodb1.example.net --port=3017

If restoring to an instance that enforces access control, include the
:option:`--username <mongorestore.--username>` and the
:option:`--authenticationDatabase
<mongorestore.--authenticationDatabase>` as well. Omit the
:option:`--password <mongorestore.--password>` option to have
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` prompt for the password:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --host=mongodb1.example.net --port=3017 --username=user  --authenticationDatabase=admin /opt/backup/mongodump-2013-10-24
