|govcloud|-managed |service| deployments, or "clusters", can be either 
a :atlas:`replica set </reference/glossary#std-term-replica-set>` or a 
:atlas:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. 
This tutorial walks you through creating a replica set.

Cloud for Government Considerations
-----------------------------------

- |govcloud-short| clusters must be tier ``M20`` or higher.

- You cannot deploy clusters across government and commercial 
  regions in the same project.

Procedure
---------

To deploy a cluster in |govcloud|:

.. include:: includes/steps/create-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/footnotes/data-bearing.rst

Next Steps
----------

To access your cluster you must allow your IP address. Proceed to
:ref:`Add Your Connection IP Address to IP Access List <allow-ip>`.
