  If the options in the :guilabel:`For` section display, you can filter
  the alert to apply to a subset of the targets.

  The :guilabel:`matches` field supports regular expressions. Regular
  expressions must match against an entire hostname.

  .. example::

     To find hostnames involving ``foo`` using a regular expression,
     you can filter for a hostname using one the following options:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 60 40
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Hostname Description
          - ``matches`` Query

        * - Starts with ``foo``
          - ``foo.*``

        * - Ends with ``foo``
          - ``.*foo``

        * - Contains ``foo``
          - ``.*foo.*``
