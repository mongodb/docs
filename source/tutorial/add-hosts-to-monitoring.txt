============================================
Add Existing MongoDB Processes to Monitoring
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can monitor existing MongoDB processes in |mms| by adding the
hostnames and ports of the processes. |mms| will start monitoring the
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances.

If you add processes from an environment that uses authentication, you
must add each :program:`mongod` instance separately and explicitly set the
authentication credentials on each.

If you add processes in an environment that does *not* use authentication,
you can manually add one process from a replica set or a sharded cluster
as a seed. Once the Monitoring Agent has the seed, it automatically discovers
all the other nodes in the replica set or sharded cluster.

.. only:: classic

   .. note::

      If your Classic account includes groups created in |mms| Cloud
      instead of |mms| Classic, then those groups will have access to
      functions not described in this documentation. See the `MMS Cloud
      Documentation <https://docs.mms.mongodb.com/>`_.

Unique Replica Set Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not add two different replica sets with the same name. |mms| uses the replica
set name to identify which set a member belongs to.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB process is accessible only by specific hostname or IP
address, or if you need to specify the hostname to use for servers with
multiple aliases, set up a preferred hostname. For details, see the
:guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` setting in :doc:`/core/settings`.

Prerequisite
------------

.. only:: cloud

   You must first install the :doc:`Automation Agent
   </tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent>` to the servers hosting the
   processes. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-hardware`.

.. only:: onprem or classic

   You must first :doc:`install a Monitoring Agent
   </tutorial/nav/install-monitoring-agent>` to your infrastructure.

.. index:: adding hosts
   single: hosts; adding

.. index:: host discovery
   single: hosts; discovery

Add MongoDB Processes
---------------------

If your deployments use authentication, perform this procedure for each process.
If your deployment does not use authentication, add one process from a replica
set or sharded cluster and |mms| will discover the other nodes in the replica
set or sharded cluster.
