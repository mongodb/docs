"With :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` set to ``false``, "
"MongoDB does not wait for :writeconcern:`w: \"majority\" <\"majority\">` "
"writes to be written to the on-disk journal before acknowledging the "
"writes. As such, :writeconcern:`majority` write operations could possibly"
" roll back in the event of a transient loss (e.g. crash and restart) of a"
" majority of nodes in a given replica set."

"Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a "

"Unlike :readconcern:`\"majority\"`, :readconcern:`\"linearizable\"` read "
"concern confirms with secondary members that the read operation is "
"reading from a primary that is capable of confirming writes with "
":writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` write concern. [#edge-"
"cases-2-primaries]_ As such, reads with linearizable read concern may be "
"significantly slower than reads with :readconcern:`\"majority\"` or "
":readconcern:`\"local\"` read concerns."

msgid ""
"In :ref:`some circumstances <edge-cases>`, two nodes in a replica set may"
" *transiently* believe that they are the primary, but at most, one of "
"them will be able to complete writes with :writeconcern:`{ w: "
"\"majority\" } <\"majority\">` write concern. The node that can complete "
":writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` writes is the current "
"primary, and the other node is a former primary that has not yet "
"recognized its demotion, typically due to a :term:`network partition`. "
"When this occurs, clients that connect to the former primary may observe "
"stale data despite having requested read preference :readmode:`primary`, "
"and new writes to the former primary will eventually roll back."
