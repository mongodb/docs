|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled 
:doc:`continuous backup snapshot </backup/continuous-backups>` or from a
selected point between snapshots. For replica sets, you can restore
from selected points in time within the last 24 hours. For sharded
clusters you can restore from checkpoints between snapshots within the
last 24 hours.

Restore a Cluster
-----------------

To restore a cluster:

#. Click :guilabel:`Backup` in the left-hand navigation.

   The :guilabel:`Overview` lists the project's clusters. If the cluster
   has backup enabled, its :guilabel:`Status` is :guilabel:`Active`. If
   the cluster has backup disabled, its :guilabel:`Status` is
   :guilabel:`Inactive`.

#. Select a cluster's snapshot to use for the restore.

   Hover over the :guilabel:`Active` status of the cluster and click
   :guilabel:`Restore or Download`.

   Alternatively, you can click the ``...`` button for the cluster and
   select the :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. 

   You may choose to:

   - Download your backup data via HTTPS and restore manually.

     \- or - 

   - Have |service| restore to a selected cluster. |service| can only
     restore to a cluster of the same type (i.e. replica set to replica
     set or sharded cluster to sharded cluster). 

     .. important::

        The restore process requires **downtime** for the target 
        cluster.

     .. note::

        The MongoDB versions must also be compatible. For instance, you
        cannot restore from a snapshot of a 3.6 cluster to a 3.4
        cluster.

     You can choose to restore to a cluster of a different project: 
     
     - To restore to another |service| project, you must have Project Owner
       role for the destination project.
     
     - You can restore to any |mms| project for which the authenticated
       |service| user has any of the following roles:
 
       - :cloudmgr:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles/#Organization-Owner>`
       - :cloudmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#Project-Owner>`
       - :cloudmgr:`Project Backup Admin </reference/user-roles/#Project-Backup-Admin>`

     In the prompt for destination, specify the project and select one of
     its clusters.
