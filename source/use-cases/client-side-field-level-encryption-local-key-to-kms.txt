Introduction
------------

This guide shows you how to migrate from using Client-Side Field
Level Encryption (CSFLE) with a **locally-managed master key** to one that
uses a remote **Key Management Service** (KMS) and is intended for
**full-stack developers**.

Currently, MongoDB drivers support the following Key Management Providers:

- `Amazon Web Services KMS <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`__
- `Azure Key Vault <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/>`__
- `Google Cloud Platform Key Management <https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management>`__
- Local KMS provider

Once you complete the steps in this guide, you should have:

- a master key hosted by one of the supported remote Key Management Services
- a working client application that encrypts and decrypts the data
  encryption key using the KMS master key

Prerequisites
-------------

This guide requires that you completed the following:

- created a CSFLE-enabled client using our `CSFLE guide </security/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide>`_
- decrypted any data encrypted while using a local KMS master key

Reasons to Use a Remote KMS
---------------------------

Choosing a remote KMS for master key management has the following advantages
over using your local filesystem to host the master key:

- Secure storage of the key with access auditing
- Reduced risk of access permission issues
- Availability and distribution of the key to remote clients
- Automated key backup and recovery
- Centralized encryption key lifecycle management

Additionally, MongoDB trasmits the data encryption keys to the KMS for
encryption and decryption, ensuring the Customer Master Key (CMK) is never
exposed to the client.

Set up a Remote Master Key
--------------------------

.. warning:: Decrypt all encrypted field data first

   Before you switch from a locally-managed master key to a remote KMS,
   you must decrypt all documents containing field-encrypted data if you
   want to keep it. Your existing data encryption keys can only be decrypted
   with the original locally-managed master key and not the CMK that the
   KMS generates.

   Failure to decrypt all data at this stage may cause permanent and
   unrecoverable data loss.

The following steps explain the setup and updates necessary to move from
a local key provider to a KMS. Select the tab that corresponds to your
provider:
