You can choose to restore to a cluster of a different project:

- To restore to another |mms| project, you must have
  :ref:`Automation Admin <automation-admin-role>` or
  :ref:`Backup Admin <backup-admin-role>` roles for the
  target project.

- To restore to another |service| project, you must have
  :ref:`Project Owner <project-roles>` role for the target project.
