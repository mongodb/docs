       can specify:

       - ``format``, and

       - ``verbosity``
       
       Output logs are viewable by selecting 
       :guilabel:`MongoDB Language Server` from the dropdown in the 
       :guilabel:`Output` view, or with the 
       `Language Server Protocol Inspector <https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol-inspector>`__.

     - .. code-block:: json

          {
            "format": "json",
            "verbosity": "verbose"
          }

   * - :guilabel:`Confirm Run All`

       .. include:: /includes/connection-location-table.rst

     - ``Global``

   * - :guilabel:`Hide Option To Choose Where To Save New Connections`
     - If disabled, you are prompted to choose where to save each new 
       connection. 
       
       If enabled, new connections are automatically saved to the 
       :guilabel:`Default Connection Saving Location` without prompt.
     - Enabled

   * - :guilabel:`Default Limit`

       connection configurations in a workspace or global scope.
     
       Edit the ``mdb.presetConnection`` property in your project's 
       ``settings.json`` file. 

       Within the ``mdb.presetConnections`` object, you 
       can specify:

       - A ``name`` for the connection.
       - A ``connectionString`` for your deployment.

       :red:`WARNING:` Do not store sensitive credentials in this setting. 
       Connection strings are stored in plain text, so they can be easily 
       accessed.

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          [
             {
                "name": "Preset Connection",
                "connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017"
             }
          ]

   * - :guilabel:`Send Telemetry`
     - If enabled, allows the collection of anonymous diagnostic and 
       usage telemetry data to help improve |vsce|.
     - Enabled

   * - :guilabel:`Use Default Template For Playground`
     - If enabled, playground files load with a template containing
       sample commands.

       If disabled, playground files load with an empty playground
       editor.
     - Enabled

   * - :guilabel:`Show Overview Page After Install`
     - If enabled, |vsce| displays an overview page
       after installation to help you get started.

       If disabled, |vsce| does not show the overview page after installation.
       This is useful in containerized environments, such as GitHub Codespaces,
       where your work environment is already set up. In these environments,
       you don't need to see the overview page every time you create a workspace.
     - Enabled

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Server`

       .. _vsce-setting-mcp-server:

     - Controls whether the :ref:`MongoDB MCP server <vsce-mcp-server>` starts
       automatically when VS Code opens and connects to an active connection.

       - If set to ``prompt``, the extension requests permission every time a
         connection succeeds in VS Code. 
       - If set to ``autoStartEnabled``, the server starts automatically when VS 
         Code opens. No notification appears.
       - If set to ``autoStartDisabled``, the server does not start automatically.
         No notification appears. You must start the server manually by using the 
         :ref:`Start MCP Server <vsce-cmd-mcp-start>` command.

       The first time the server starts, VS Code displays a notification asking 
       if you want to enable or disable auto-start. Your choice updates this 
       setting.

       When the MCP server is not running, use 
       the :ref:`MongoDB: Start MCP Server <vsce-cmd-mcp-start>`
       command to start the MCP server immediately.

     - ``prompt``

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Api Base URL`
     - If you're using a custom Atlas deployment, specify the API URL
       used by the MongoDB MCP server that enables Atlas MCP tools.
     - ``https://cloud.mongodb.com/``

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Api Client ID`
     - Atlas API client ID for authenticating against the Atlas API. Use a
       Service Account for programmatic access to Atlas APIs. Required
       for enabling Atlas tools in MongoDB MCP server.
       Store your ID securely and do not commit it to version control.
       
       To learn more, see :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-atlas-api-credentials`.

     - Empty

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Api Client Secret`
     - Atlas API client secret for authenticating against the Atlas API. Use a
       Service Account for programmatic access to Atlas APIs. Required
       for enabling Atlas tools in MongoDB MCP server.
       Store this securely and do not commit to version control.

       To learn more, see :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-atlas-api-credentials`.

     - Empty

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Disabled Tools`
     - Tool names, operation types (``create``, ``update``, ``delete``,
       ``read``, ``metadata``), or categories (``atlas``, ``mongodb``)
       to disable when using the MongoDB MCP server.
     - Empty
     
   * - :guilabel:`MCP Export Cleanup Interval Ms`
     - How often (in milliseconds) the MongoDB MCP server runs the export cleanup
       process to remove expired files. Default is 2
       minutes (120000ms).
     - ``120000``


   * - :guilabel:`MCP Exports Path`
     - The directory where the MongoDB MCP server exports data when
       using the export tool. Ensure that the path is available for
       writes or leave this setting empty to use the default path
       based on your operating system.

       Default paths:

       - Windows: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\mongodb\mongodb-mcp\exports``
       - macOS and Linux: ``~/.mongodb/mongodb-mcp/exports``
       
     - Empty

   * - :guilabel:`MCP Export Timeout Ms`
     - The maximum time in milliseconds an export operation can run 
       before MongoDB MCP server terminates it. Default is 5 minutes (300000ms).
     - ``300000``

   * - :guilabel:`MCP Index Check`
     - When enabled, the MongoDB MCP server enforces that query operations must
       use an index, and rejects queries that perform a collection scan. This
       helps prevent performance issues in production environments.
     - Disabled

   * - :guilabel:`MCP: Read Only`
     - When enabled, the MongoDB MCP server only allows read, connect,
       and metadata operation types. Create, update, and delete operations are disabled.
     - Enabled
