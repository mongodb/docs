.. dbcommand:: distinct

   The :dbcommand:`distinct` command finds the distinct values for a
   specified field across a single collection. The command returns a
   document that contains an array of the distinct values as well as
   the query plan and status. The command takes the following prototype
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { distinct: collection, key: <field>, query: <query> }

   The command fields are as follows:

   :field String collection:

          The name of the collection to query for distinct values.

   :field string field:

          Specifies the field for which to return the distinct values.

   :field document query:

          Optional. Specifies the selection ``query`` to determine the
          subset of documents from which to retrieve the distinct
          values.

   Consider the following examples of the :dbcommand:`distinct` command:

   - Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``ord_dt``
     from all documents in the ``orders`` collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand ( { distinct: 'orders', key: 'ord_dt' } )

   - Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``sku`` in the
     subdocument ``item`` from all documents in the ``orders``
     collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand ( { distinct: 'orders', key: 'item.sku' } )

   - Return an array of the distinct values of the field ``ord_dt``
     from the documents in the ``orders`` collection where the
     ``price`` is greater than ``10``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand ( { distinct: 'orders',
                          key: 'ord_dt',
                          query: { price: { $gt: 10 } }
                        } )

   .. note::

      - MongoDB also provides the shell wrapper method
        :method:`db.collection.distinct()` for the
        :dbcommand:`distinct` command. Additionally, many MongoDB
        :term:`drivers <driver>` also provide a wrapper method. Refer
        to the specific driver documentation.

      - When possible, the :dbcommand:`distinct` command will use an
        index to find the documents in the query as well as to return
        the data.
