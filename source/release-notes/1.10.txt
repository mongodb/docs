Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed Issues:

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.3.0 where descending indexes with
  key values between -1e-9 and 0 could incorrectly migrate
  as ascending.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.9.0 where the embedded verifier
  could incorrectly report failure if a TTL index was dropped on
  the source cluster during a migration.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused unversioned
  2dsphere indexes to migrate as v3 2dsphere indexes.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.9.0 where the embedded verifier
  incorrectly report failure for collections with TTLs where
  ``expireAfterSeconds: 0``.

- Mitigated an issue introduced in v1.0.0 that could result in
  ``mongosync`` timing out during initialization when sampling a
  source collection and pre-splitting the corresponding
  destination collection.

New Features:

- Added support for migrations with 4.4 and 5.0 source clusters.

- Added full support for embedded verification of reversible
  migrations. Previously, verification was only supported in the
  initial forward-direction of a reversible migration.

- Added support for embedded verification of sharded clusters.

- Added support for migrations from 6.0 and 7.0 sources to 8.0
  destinations.

- Added a new :option:`--disableVerification` option and
  :setting:`disableVerification` setting to ``mongosync``.

Performance Improvements:

- Improved the partitioning algorithm for large source
  collections. ``mongosync`` now directly samples documents from
  WiredTiger instead of scanning the whole ``_id`` index.

Other:

- ``mongosync`` now provides RHEL 9 builds.

- ``mongosync`` now disallows setting ``socketTimeoutMS`` in
  connection strings. This is a deprecated parameter.

- ``mongosync`` now disallows being restarted during commit when 
  verification is enabled.
