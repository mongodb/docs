Starting in version 1.2, ``mongosync`` can sync between clusters running 
some older (pre-6.0) releases of MongoDB Server. This feature requires
additional preparation and configuration in pre-6.0 releases.

If you would like to migrate pre-6.0 versions of MongoDB Server
using ``mongosync``, please `contact <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__
your account team to inquire about Professional Services.
