The geographical distribution of the {+appdb+} and |onprem|
instances might impact the performance of the |application| and backup and
restore processes. To learn more, see
:opsmgr:`Performance in Multi-Region Deployments </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability/#performance-in-multi-region-deployments>`.

To get all the benefits of increased resilience and availability from
deploying |onprem| across multiple |k8s| clusters, consider deploying all
components in the same geographical area.

The source of possible degraded performance might stem from increased
network latency (due to the physical distance) between the following components:

- The |application| serving the UI or API requests and a primary
  {+appdb+} node writing the data.
- The MongoDB database nodes and the |application| performing backup jobs.

If you plan to deploy the |application| and the {+appdb+} in
multiple, geographically distant regions, contact |mdb-support| for
further assistance.
