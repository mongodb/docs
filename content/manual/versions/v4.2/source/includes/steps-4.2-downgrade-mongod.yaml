  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

  a. Shut down your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. To safely terminate
     the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, you can connect a
     :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the instance and run:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

     For additional methods to safely terminate your
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, see
     :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes`.


  b. Replace the |newversion| binary with the downloaded |oldversion|
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary and restart.

title: If switching from ``zstd`` compression, restore data.

   Skip this step if you have not downgraded from a standalone that
   used :term:`zstd` compression.

   If you have downgraded from a standalone that used :term:`zstd`, you
   have created a dump of your data as a :ref:`prerequisite
   <downgrade-standalone-prereq-zstd>`. Use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   to restore that data to your |oldversion| standalone.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongorestore --host=<myhost> --port=<port>  mystandalone.uncompressed.fcv4.0
