# Contributing to `docs-ecosystem`üìù

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `docs-ecosystem`! In this
guide, you can find guidelines for contributing to the MongoDB Drivers
Ecosystem documentation.

You might want to contribute to this repository to fix a bug
or error in the documentation, or if you want to add information about a
feature or concept that is not currently covered. See the following
section to learn more about how you can suggest changes and additions.

> **NOTE:** This documentation is open-source but wholly managed by the Drivers &
> Connectors Documentation team at MongoDB. If you have any questions
> about the documentation, contributions, or other topics, you can
> contact someone on our team by emailing
> [deved-team\@10gen.com](mailto:deved-team@10gen.com).

## How can I contribute? üì§

The Drivers & Connectors Documentation team uses GitHub to manage and
review all changes. To suggest any changes, you should create a **ticket**
and then open a **pull request** against this repository.

### Creating a ticket ‚úâÔ∏è

Our team uses JIRA, a project management software, to track issues and
feature requests in the form of tickets. Before you make any changes,
consider looking for [an existing
ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/DOCS/issues/) in our JIRA
project that addresses your idea or bug fix request.

If you don't find an appropriate ticket, you can create a ticket in the
`DOCS` JIRA project that describes the bug, issue, or content request.
In your ticket, please include the following details:

- Who you are
- A description of the bug/issue/feature/explanation
- The changes you plan to make

Please also fill out the following ticket fields:

- Issue Type: Bug/Task
  - A bug is an error in the documentation. For example, if you notice a
    typo or an error in a code example, mark the ticket as a `Bug`
  - A `Task` is not a `Bug`. For example, if you want to add more detail to a
    topic explanation, mark the ticket as an `Improvement`.
- Summary: The ticket's title
- Component: `Drivers`

Once you create the ticket, you can either decide to let us process the
ticket and make the pull request, or open the PR yourself.

### Opening a PR üñáÔ∏è

To develop a PR, you can clone the `docs-ecosystem` repository and create a
branch off of `master`. It is helpful if your branch name contains some
details about the changes, such as `query-code-bug-fix` or
`add-timeseries-explanation`.

After you push your changes, open a PR against the `master` branch and
fill out the template with details such as the corresponding ticket link
and the self-review checklist.

> **NOTE:** You will not be able to see your changes in a staging
> environment. When a team member is reviewing your PR, we might be able
> to add a staging link so that we can visualize the changes.

Once you have created a pull request, **do not automatically merge**.
Wait for a team member to take further action.

### Next steps ‚è∞

You can expect that someone on our team will see the ticket and/or PR
**within one week**. After this, they will leave a review on the PR which
you can respond to, or they will take over the PR and manage it
internally by merging changes into a new PR or addressing the ticket
through a different approach.

Thank you again for being interested in our documentation! üôÇ
