Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client. When
access control, i.e. :doc:`authorization </core/authorization>`, is enabled,
MongoDB requires all clients to authenticate themselves in order to determine
their access.

Although authentication and :doc:`authorization </core/authorization>` are
closely connected, authentication is distinct from authorization.
Authentication verifies the identity of a user; authorization determines the
verified user's access to resources and operations.

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

MongoDB supports a number of :ref:`authentication mechanisms
<security-authentication-mechanisms>` that clients can use to verify
their identity. These mechanisms allow MongoDB to integrate into your
existing authentication system.

MongoDB supports multiple authentication mechanisms:

- :ref:`authentication-scram` (*Default*)

- :ref:`x.509 Certificate Authentication <security-auth-x509>`.

In addition to supporting the aforementioned mechanisms, MongoDB Enterprise
also supports the following mechanisms:

- :ref:`LDAP proxy authentication <security-auth-ldap>`, and

- :ref:`Kerberos authentication <security-auth-kerberos>`.

Internal Authentication
-----------------------

In addition to verifying the identity of a client, MongoDB can require
members of replica sets and sharded clusters to :ref:`authenticate
their membership <inter-process-auth>` to their respective
replica set or sharded cluster. See :ref:`inter-process-auth`
for more information.

Authentication on Sharded Clusters
----------------------------------

In sharded clusters, clients generally authenticate directly to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. However, some maintenance operations may require
authenticating directly to a specific shard. For more information on
authentication and sharded clusters, see :ref:`sharding-security`.
