To help you better understand the performance of your query, you can view 
your query's explain plan. 

About This Task 
---------------

On the :guilabel:`Explain Plan` modal, you can view the explain stages as a 
:guilabel:`Visual Tree`, where each query operation appears as a node on the 
tree. You can also view the explain details in raw JSON format by selecting 
the :guilabel:`Raw Output` view.

.. note:: 

   The :guilabel:`Explain Plan` doesn't show aggregation pipeline stages
   such as :pipeline:`$merge` and :pipeline:`$out` because
   |compass-short| ignores all out stages from the aggregation before 
   running the explain plan.

The explain plan includes a :guilabel:`Query Performance Summary` with 
information on the execution of your query such as: 

- Execution time 

- The number of returned documents 

- The number of examined documents 

- The number of examined index keys

.. BEGIN-COMPASS-ONLY
.. note:: 
  
  The :guilabel:`Explain Plan` is not available if you are connected
  to :atlas:`Data Lake </data-lake>`.
.. END-COMPASS-ONLY

         :alt: Query plan

   .. step:: Select a query operation
      
      By default, the explain stages are are shown as a :guilabel:`Visual Tree`.
      Each query operation appears as a node on the tree.

      For more detailed execution information about the query operation, click 
      the corresponding node.

      For example, the following explain plan provides detailed information on 
      a query that filters for ``{ title : "Jurassic Park" }``:
      
      .. figure:: /images/compass/explain-tree.png
         :alt: Detailed Visual Tree view
         :figwidth: 696px
         
   .. step:: (Optional) Select the :guilabel:`Raw Output` view. 
      
      To view your full explain plan as raw JSON, select the 
      :guilabel:`Raw Output` view.
