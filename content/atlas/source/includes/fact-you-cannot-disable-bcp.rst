.. important:: MongoDB Support must approve requests to disable a {+bcp+}

   After you enable a {+bcp+}, only MongoDB support can approve requests to 
   disable the {+bcp+} from the security or legal representative specified for the {+bcp+}. 
   After MongoDB Support approves the request, Project Owners can disable the {+bcp+}.
   
   To disable a {+bcp+}, the security or legal representative 
   specified for the {+bcp+} must open a case to :ref:`request support 
   <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification process.

   Before you enable a {+bcp+}, carefully review the 
   :ref:`prohibited actions <bcp-prohibited-actions>` and 
   :ref:`considerations <bcp-considerations>`. You can re-enable a 
   {+bcp+} at any time.
