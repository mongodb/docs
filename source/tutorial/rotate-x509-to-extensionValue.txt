Cluster members can use :ref:`x.509 certificates <internal-auth-x509>` 
for membership authentication to identify other servers in the same deployment. 
This tutorial describes how to perform a rolling update to migrate from using 
certificate Distinguished Name (DN) attributes to using extension values to identify 
members of a cluster. 

When a server configured with the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.extensionValue` setting
receives a connection request, it compares the the extension value string 
of the presented certificates to the configured values of the 
:setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.extensionValue` setting and
:parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter.
If the values match, it treats the connection as a cluster member. 

Clusters adopting new certificates can use the 
:parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter to accept x.509 certificates
with different DN attributes during the certificate rotation procedure. Once
all members use certificates with the new value, remove the override to begin
rejecting the now out of date certificates.

About This Task
---------------

Consider a replica set where member certificates,
set using the :setting:`~net.tls.clusterFile` and 
:setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFile` settings, 
have Distinguished Name (DN) attributes that use the ``MongoDB`` organization
and ``MongoDB Server`` organizational unit. These DN attributes are set using the
:setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting.

Steps
-----

These steps update member certificates to use new x.509 certificates 
on a cluster configured with the 
:setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting.

Initially, the clusters identify members using DN values. 
With the new certificates, the servers instead identify members
using the ``mongodb://example.mongodb.net`` extension value and ignore certificate attributes.

.. procedure::


   .. step:: Update the TLS Cluster Membership Configuration

      Update the configuration file of each server:

      * Change the :setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509` setting to match 
        the new certificate by replacing the  
        :setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting with the 
        the :setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.extensionValue` setting.

      * Set the :parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter to use the
        DN attributes of the old certificate.

      For example: 

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 9, 13

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                extensionValue:  mongodb://example.mongodb.net
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509
         setParameter:
            tlsClusterAuthX509Override: { attributes: O=MongoDB, OU=MongoDBServer }

   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set now accept peer connections from
      members using certificates with the new extension values as well as 
      the old DN attributes.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server in the replica set steps down and restarts as a
      secondary that now accepts peer connections from members using
      certificates with the new extension value as well as the old DN
      attributes.

   .. step:: Update the TLS Certificates

      Update the configuration file of each server:

      * Change the :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` setting to use the 
        new certificate.

      * Change the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` setting to use the 
        new certificate.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 4, 6

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server2.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster2.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                extensionValue:  mongodb://example.mongodb.net
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509
         setParameter:
            tlsClusterAuthX509Override: { attributes: O=MongoDB, OU=MongoDB Server }
         
   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set now use the new x.509 certificates.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server in the replica set steps down and restarts as a 
      secondary that uses the new x.509 certificate. 

   .. step:: Remove the DN Certification Override Configuration

      With all members of the cluster now using the new x.509 certificate, 
      update the configuration file to remove the :setting:`setParameter` 
      settings for the :parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                extensionValue:  mongodb://example.mongodb.net
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509

      This ensures that the server doesn't configure the old certificate
      settings on startup.

   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set restart and no longer accept
      connections from the old x.509 certificates.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server steps down and restarts as a secondary that no longer
      accepts connections from the old x.509 certificates.
