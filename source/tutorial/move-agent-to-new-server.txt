Overview
--------

When you deploy MongoDB as a :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded
cluster` on a group of servers, |mms| selects a server to run the
Monitoring Agent. If you enable |mms| Backup, |mms| also selects a server to
run the Backup Agent.

You can move the Monitoring and Backup Agents to different servers in the
deployment. You might choose to do this, for example, if you are
terminating a server.

You can add additional Monitoring Agents to provide failover and to distribute
monitoring assignments. To distribute monitoring assignments, you must run
Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0 or higher. For more information, see
:ref:`multiple-monitoring-agents`.

You can add additional Backup Agents as hot standbys for high availability. If
you run multiple Backup Agents, only one Backup Agent in your group's
deployment is the primary agent and performs backups. Any other agents are
standbys.

Move a Monitoring or Backup Agent to a Different Server
-------------------------------------------------------

To move an agent to a new server, you install a new instance of the agent
on the target server, and then remove the agent from its original server.
