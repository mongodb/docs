You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to manage documents inside
your collections. Documents are individual records in a MongoDB
collection and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.

Viewing documents and collections in the {+atlas-ui+} can provide a
high-level overview of your database schema. You can use the |service|
UI to ensure you are following MongoDB's core data modeling concepts,
such as utilizing embedded documents and arrays.

Required Roles
--------------

To :ref:`insert <atlas-ui-insert-documents>`, :ref:`edit <atlas-ui-edit-document>`,
or :ref:`delete documents <atlas-ui-delete-document>`, you must have been
granted access through one of the following roles:

- :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner`
- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin`
- :authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write`

.. _atlas-ui-insert-documents:

Insert Documents
----------------

To add one or more documents to a collection through the
{+atlas-ui+}, you can specify the documents to insert
from scratch or you can clone an existing document and modify its
fields and values as needed.

To insert documents into your collection, use one of the following methods in 
|service|:

- **JSON Mode :icon-lg:`CurlyBraces`**: Allows you to write or paste JSON 
  documents in the editor. Use this mode to insert multiple documents at once 
  as an array.

- **Field-by-Field Editor :icon-lg:`Menu`**: Allows you to select individual 
  field values and types for each inserted document. You can only insert one 
  document at a time using this method.

.. Attention writers: If you make changes to the following procedure
.. please check the related procedures in the following Server docs 
.. page(s) to see if they require changes as well:

.. www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/database-references/

.. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-ui-insert-document.rst

Clone Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can insert new documents by cloning the schema and values of
an existing document in a collection.

.. _atlas-ui-view-documents:

View Documents 
--------------

To view and manage documents, you can use one of the following views in the 
:guilabel:`Documents` tab:

- **List View :icon-lg:`Menu`**: The default document view. |service| shows 
  documents in a list. In this view, you can expand embedded objects and arrays.

- **JSON View :icon-lg:`CurlyBraces`**: |service| shows documents as 
  properly-formatted JSON objects. |service| uses extended JSON to display the 
  data types of each field.

- **Table View :icon-lg:`Table`**: |service| shows documents as rows of a table, 
  with document fields shown in the table columns. With this view, you can see 
  which documents contain specific field values.

Expand Embedded Objects and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To expand embedded objects and array elements, hover over the document 
      and click the arrow in the top-left corner.

      .. figure:: /images/atlas-ui/compass/expand-doc-list-view.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Expand embedded objects list

   .. tab:: JSON View
      :tabid: json

      To expand embedded objects and array elements, hover over the  
      document and click the top arrow on the left side of the document.

      To expand individual objects and arrays, click the arrow to
      the left of the desired field.

      .. figure:: /images/atlas-ui/compass/expand-doc-json-view.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Expand embedded objects JSON

   .. tab:: Table View
      :tabid: table-view

      To view nested object fields and array elements, hover your cursor
      over a field with a value type of ``Object`` or ``Array`` and
      click the button with outward-pointing arrows which appears on the
      right side of the field.

      |service| opens a new tab in the Table View corresponding
      to the nested element.

         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: View nested elements in Table view

      The following example displays the ``address``
      object nested within the ``restaurants`` collection documents. The
      new tab displays the five properties of the ``address`` object:

      .. figure:: /images/atlas-ui/compass/doc-table-view-nested.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Nested documents

      To return to the original table display, click the first tab
      in the Table View which displays the name of your collection.

Copy Documents to Clipboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::
   :hidden: true

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To copy a document to your clipboard, hover over the document
      and click the :guilabel:`Copy` icon:

      .. figure:: /images/atlas-ui/compass/copy-doc-list-view.png
         :figwidth: 696px

   .. tab:: JSON View
      :tabid: json

      To copy a document to your clipboard, hover over the document
      and click the :guilabel:`Copy` icon:

Number of Documents Displayed per Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-ui+} limits the *total byte size* of documents shown per
page. As a result, you may see varying numbers of documents per page,
especially if your documents vary significantly in size.
