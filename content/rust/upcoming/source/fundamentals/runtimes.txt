Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the {+driver-short+}'s :ref:`asynchronous <rust-runtimes-configure-async>`
and :ref:`synchronous <rust-runtimes-configure-sync>` APIs. This guide explains how to enable the available APIs
and structure your code to use each.

The {+driver-short+} supports the ``tokio`` asynchronous runtime crate, which is the default
runtime.

The driver also includes a synchronous API for use cases that require blocking, or when parallelism
is not necessary. You can select the synchronous API by adding feature flags to the ``mongodb`` dependency
in your ``Cargo.toml`` file.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`rust-runtimes-configure-async` shows how to configure your application to use the
  ``tokio`` asynchronous runtime

- :ref:`rust-runtimes-configure-sync` shows how to configure your application to use the
  ``sync`` and ``tokio-sync`` synchronous runtimes

- :ref:`rust-runtimes-configure-both` shows how to enable both the asynchronous and synchronous
  runtimes APIs in your application

- :ref:`rust-addtl-info-runtimes` provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. _rust-runtimes-configure-async:

Configure the Asynchronous Runtime
----------------------------------

The driver uses the ``tokio`` runtime by default, so you can use this runtime without specifying any
feature flags in your project's ``Cargo.toml`` file. For more information on installing the driver
and configuring your ``Cargo.toml`` file, see the :ref:`rust-quick-start-download-and-install` step
of the Quick Start.

.. important::

   Beginning in {+driver-short+} v3.0, the ``tokio`` runtime is the only asynchronous runtime crate that
   the driver supports. Previous versions of the driver also support the ``async-std`` runtime crate.
   
   If your application uses the ``async-std`` runtime, you can start a ``tokio`` runtime in the same
   application by creating a ``Runtime`` struct instance and wrapping driver operations with the ``Runtime::spawn()``
   method. Ensure that you use the same ``Runtime`` instance for instantiating a ``Client`` and calling
   driver methods on that ``Client`` instance.
   
   For an example that instantiates a ``Runtime`` and calls the ``spawn()`` method, see the `tokio documentation
   <https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/struct.Runtime.html#examples-2>`__.

Tokio Runtime Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``task`` module from the ``tokio`` crate
to create separate, concurrent tasks for multiple data operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/runtimes-tokio.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. _rust-runtimes-configure-sync:

Configure the Synchronous API
-----------------------------

The driver also provides a blocking, synchronous API.
To use the ``tokio`` synchronous API, add the ``"sync"`` feature flag to
the ``mongodb`` dependency, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = ["sync"]

Synchronous Code Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the synchronous API, use types from the ``mongodb::sync`` module to perform operations.
The following code uses the ``sync`` module to insert data into a collection using the synchronous API.
When the ``insert_one`` method runs inside the ``for`` loop, the driver waits for each request to complete before continuing.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/runtimes-sync.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. _rust-runtimes-configure-both:

Use Both Asynchronous and Synchronous APIs
------------------------------------------

You can use both asynchronous and synchronous APIs in the same application.
For example, to enable both ``tokio`` runtimes, you can add the ``tokio`` dependency
to your dependencies list and add the ``"sync"`` flag to the ``mongodb`` dependency:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependencies]
   futures = "0.3.28"
   tokio = {version = "1.32.0", features = ["full"]}

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = ["sync"]
