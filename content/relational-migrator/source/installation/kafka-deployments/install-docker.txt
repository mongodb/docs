You can install {+rel-mig+} with Kafka in a containerized environment 
using `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/>`__. This method configures Kafka 
to store data locally in Docker containers. Use this method if you want to learn 
how to configure your own multi-server Kafka environment. 

.. warning::

   This deployment method is ideal for quick evaluation. It is not recommended for 
   production workloads as it may not provide a resilient production environment.

About this Task
---------------

This deployment method uses a ``docker-compose`` file to set up a Kafka node, 
a Kafka Connect node, and a {+rel-mig+} node. 

Before you Begin
----------------

You must have Docker installed on your computer. For more information, see  
`Install Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the docker-compose file

      In the `Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__, 
      select :guilabel:`Docker` as the platform. Then select the :guilabel:`Kafka 
      reference implementation` file.

   .. step:: Configure environment variables

      a. Configure ``MIGRATOR_PATH_DATA``

         In your ``docker-compose`` file, configure the ``MIGRATOR_DATA_PATH`` variable to a 
         path where {+rel-mig+} saves data for persistence.

      b. (Optional) If your source database is MySQL or Oracle, configure ``MIGRATOR_PATH_DRIVER``

         {+rel-mig+} uses the JDBC driver of the respective source database to read 
         database schema. It bundles SQL Server and PostgreSQL JDBC drivers. For MySQL and 
         Oracle, you must add their drivers.

         In your ``docker-compose`` file, configure the ``MIGRATOR_PATH_DRIVER`` variable to 
         the location of the ``.jar`` file for the additional JDBC drivers. 

   .. step:: Download the Docker images

      Run the following command to download the Docker images for your setup:

      .. code-block::

         docker-compose -f docker-compose-migrator-kafka.yml pull

   .. step:: Launch {+rel-mig+} with Docker

      Run the following command to start {+rel-mig+} with Docker:

      .. code-block::

         docker-compose -f docker-compose-migrator-kafka.yml up
