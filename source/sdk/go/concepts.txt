===================================
Learn Concepts for the Atlas Go SDK
===================================

Introduction
------------

You can use the Atlas Go SDK to fetch or modify data from the Atlas Admin API.
The Atlas Go SDK is flexible because it accepts many different types of arguments.

Fetching Data from the Back End
-------------------------------

To fetch data, you can execute the ``{Api}.{Operation}WithParams()`` method:

.. code-block:: go

       // 1. Calling API method
       request := sdk.ProjectsApi.ListProjectsWithParams(ctx,
           // 2. We passing struct with all optional query parameters to the request
           &admin.ListProjectsApiParams{
               ItemsPerPage: admin.PtrInt(1),
               IncludeCount: admin.PtrBool(true),
               PageNum:      admin.PtrInt(1),
           })

       // 3. You can also supply values in requests using individual methods
       // This can be helpful when passing request objects to other methods. 
       projects, response, err := request.ItemsPerPage(10).Execute()
       examples.HandleErr(err, response)

Alternatively, you can use the shorter ``{Operation}()`` method with a builder pattern to supply all arguments:

.. code-block:: go

       projects, response, err := sdk.ProjectsApi.ListProjects(ctx).
           ItemsPerPage(1).Execute()

Note: The Atlas Go SDK requires path parameters and they must be provided directly in the ``{Operation}()`` method.

Note: The Atlas Go SDK supplies default values for both query and post objects.

Performing Data Modification
----------------------------

Use the ``{Operation}()`` method to perform modifications. For example:

.. code-block:: go

    groupInvitationRequest := *admin.NewGroupInvitationRequest() 
    resp, r, err := sdk.ProjectsApi.CreateProjectInvitation(context.Background(), groupId, &groupInvitationRequest).Execute()

Experimental Methods
--------------------

Please note that we have some methods marked as experimental, denoted by the [experimental] tag in the operation description. 
This signifies that the method might be changed in the future without compatibility guarantees.

If you encounter any problems with methods marked as experimental, feel free to raise a `Github issue <https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/issues/new/choose>`__ and the team will work to resolve it.

If you belive a method should be marked as stable, feel free to raise a PR appending the method's OperationId to our `operations.stable.json <https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/tools/transformer/src/operations.stable.json>`__ set.
