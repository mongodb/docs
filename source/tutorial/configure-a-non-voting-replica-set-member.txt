=======================================
Configure Non-Voting Replica Set Member
=======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Non-voting members allow you to add additional members for read
distribution beyond the maximum seven voting members. To configure a
member as non-voting, set its
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value to ``0``.

Example
-------

To disable the ability to vote in elections for the fourth, fifth, and
sixth replica set members, use the following command sequence in the
:program:`mongo` shell connected to the primary. You identify each
replica set member by its array index in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[3].votes = 0
   cfg.members[4].votes = 0
   cfg.members[5].votes = 0
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This sequence gives ``0`` votes to the fourth, fifth, and sixth members
of the set according to the order of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array in the output of
:method:`rs.conf()`. This setting allows the set to elect these members
as :term:`primary` but does not allow them to vote in elections. Place
voting members so that your designated primary or primaries can reach a
majority of votes in the event of a network partition.

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst

In general and when possible, all members should have only 1 vote. This
prevents intermittent ties, deadlocks, or the wrong members from
becoming primary. Use :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority`
to control which members are more likely to become primary.
