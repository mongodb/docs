Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a **change stream** to monitor real-time
changes to your data. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+} feature that
allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a collection, database,
or deployment.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can call the ``watch()`` method to return an
instance of ``ChangeStreamObservable``. Then, you can subscribe to the
``ChangeStreamObservable`` instance to see new data changes, such as updates,
insertions, and deletions.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your Scala application, create a ``MongoClient`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

.. tip::

   To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets,
   see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Some examples use instances of the ``LatchedObserver`` class to handle change
stream events. This class is a custom observer that prints change stream events
and continues monitoring data changes until the stream completes or generates
an error. To use the ``LatchedObserver`` class, paste the following code into
your application file:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-latched-observer
    :end-before: end-latched-observer

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method. The instance on which you
call the ``watch()`` method determines the scope of events that the change
stream monitors. You can call the ``watch()`` method on instances of the following
classes:

- ``MongoClient``: Monitors changes to all collections across all databases
  in a deployment, excluding :manual:`system collections </reference/system-collections/>`
  or collections in the ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config`` databases
- ``MongoDatabase``: Monitors changes to all collections in one database
- ``MongoCollection``: Monitors changes to one collection

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method to open a change stream on the
``restaurants`` collection. The code creates a ``LatchedObserver`` instance to
receive and output changes as they occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
   :start-after: start-open-change-stream
   :end-before: end-open-change-stream
   :language: scala
   :dedent:

To begin watching for changes, run the preceding code. Then, in a separate
shell, run the following code to update a document that has a ``name`` field
value of ``"Blarney Castle"``:

.. _scala-change-stream-update:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
   :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
   :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
   :language: scala
   :dedent:

When you run the preceding code to update the collection, the change stream
application prints the change as it occurs. The printed change event resembles
the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   ChangeStreamDocument{ operationType=update, resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
   namespace=sample_restaurants.restaurants, destinationNamespace=null, 
   fullDocument=null, fullDocumentBeforeChange=null, documentKey={"_id": {...}},
   clusterTime=Timestamp{...}, updateDescription=UpdateDescription{removedFields=[],
   updatedFields={"cuisine": "Irish"}, truncatedArrays=[], disambiguatedPaths=null},
   txnNumber=null, lsid=null, splitEvent=null, wallTime=BsonDateTime{...}}

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

To modify the change stream output, you can pass a list of pipeline stages as a
parameter to the ``watch()`` method. You can include the following stages in the
list:

- ``$addFields`` or ``$set``: Adds new fields to documents
- ``$match``: Filters the documents
- ``$project``: Projects a subset of the document fields
- ``$replaceWith`` or ``$replaceRoot``: Replaces the input document with the
  specified document
- ``$redact``: Restricts the contents of the documents
- ``$unset``: Removes fields from documents

The {+driver-short+} provides the ``Aggregates`` class, which includes helper methods
for building the preceding pipeline stages. 

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about pipeline stages and their corresponding ``Aggregates``
   helper methods, see the following resources:
   
   - :manual:`Aggregation Stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in the
     {+mdb-server+} manual
   - `Aggregates <{+driver-api+}/model/Aggregates$.html>`__ in the API
     documentation

The following example creates a pipeline that uses the ``Aggregates.filter()`` method
to build the ``$match`` stage. Then, the code passes this pipeline to the ``watch()``
method and instructs ``watch()`` to output events only when update operations occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
   :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
   :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
   :language: scala
   :dedent:

Modify watch() Behavior
-----------------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``watch()`` method by chaining
methods provided by the ``ChangeStreamObservable`` class. The following
table describes some of these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``fullDocument()``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document after the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see the :ref:`scala-change-stream-pre-post-image` section of this
         guide.

   * - ``fullDocumentBeforeChange()``
     - | Specifies whether to show the full document as it was before the change, rather
         than showing only the changes made to the document. To learn more about
         this option, see :ref:`scala-change-stream-pre-post-image`.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation.

   * - ``startAtOperationTime()``
     - | Instructs the change stream to provide only changes that occurred at or after
         the specified timestamp.

   * - ``collation()``
     - | Sets the collation to use for the change stream cursor.

For a full list of ``watch()`` options, see `ChangeStreamObservable
<{+driver-api+}/ChangeStreamObservable.html>`__ in the API
documentation.

.. _scala-change-stream-pre-post-image:

Include Pre-Images and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You can enable pre-images and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses {+mdb-server+} v6.0 or later.

By default, when you perform an operation on a collection, the
corresponding change event includes only the modified fields and
their values before and after the operation. 

You can instruct the ``watch()`` method to return the document's **pre-image**, the
full version of the document *before* changes, in addition to the modified fields. To
include the pre-image in the change stream event, chain the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange()``
method to ``watch()``. Pass one of the following values to the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange()``
method:

- ``FullDocumentBeforeChange.WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes a pre-image
  of the modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, this
  change event field has a ``null`` value.
- ``FullDocumentBeforeChange.REQUIRED``: The change event includes a pre-image
  of the modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, the
  server raises an error.  

You can also instruct the ``watch()`` method to return the document's **post-image**,
the full version of the document *after* changes, in addition to the modified fields.
To include the post-image in the change stream event, chain the ``fullDocument()``
method to ``watch()``. Pass one of the following values to the ``fullDocument()`` method:

- ``FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP``: The change event includes a
  copy of the entire changed document from some time after the change.
- ``FullDocument.WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes
  a post-image of the modified document for change events. If the post-image is not
  available, this change event field has a ``null`` value.
- ``FullDocument.REQUIRED``: The change event includes a post-image
  of the modified document for change events. If the post-image is not available, the
  server raises an error.

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method on a collection and includes the post-image
of updated documents by chaining the ``fullDocument()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.scala
   :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
   :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
   :language: scala
   :dedent:

With the change stream application running in a separate shell, updating a
document in the ``restaurants`` collection by using the :ref:`preceding update
example <scala-change-stream-update>` prints a change event that resembles the following
output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3-8

   ChangeStreamDocument{ operationType=update, resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
   namespace=sample_restaurants.restaurants, destinationNamespace=null,
   fullDocument=Iterable((_id,BsonObjectId{...}), (address,{"building": "202-24",
   "coord": [-73.9250442, 40.5595462], "street": "Rockaway Point Boulevard",
   "zipcode": "11697"}), (borough,BsonString{value='Queens'}),
   (cuisine,BsonString{value='Irish'}), (grades,BsonArray{values=[...]}),
   (name,BsonString{value='Blarney Castle'}), (restaurant_id,BsonString{...}),
   (blank,BsonString{value='Irish'})), fullDocumentBeforeChange=null,
   documentKey={"_id": {"$oid": "..."}}, clusterTime=Timestamp{...}, updateDescription=
   UpdateDescription{removedFields=[], updatedFields={"cuisine": "Irish"},
   truncatedArrays=[], disambiguatedPaths=null}, txnNumber=null, lsid=null,
   splitEvent=null, wallTime=BsonDateTime{...}}
