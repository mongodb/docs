Code examples demonstrate how to use our products programmatically.
High-quality, well-maintained code improves our documentation's usability, builds our
credibility with users, and reduces reported issues.

This documentation provides guidance for writing code examples. For instructions on
testing and maintaining code examples, see :ref:`grove-platform`.

What is a Code Example?
-----------------------

A **code example** is a block of code of any size that is set apart from regular
text through a code directive, such as ``literalinclude`` or ``io-code-block``.
For details on valid block-level code directives, see the :ref:`code-block-reference`
reference.

For example, the following is an example of Python code:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: hello.py

   print("Hello, World!")

The following is the source code to use the preceding code example in our docs:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. literalinclude:: /path/to/code/hello.py
      :language: python
      :category: usage example
      :copyable: true

The code example renders on the page as a *block* of code.

.. _code-examples-block-level-directives:

Block-Level Directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **block-level directive** (for example, ``literalinclude``) renders the code example
visually and functionally distinct from other page elements. It defines and displays
its content as code, instead of regular text.

It is also easier to read by human users and better interpreted by robot users
(such as screen readers, AI models, and crawlers).

- Use block-level directives that link directly to the code file
  (``literalinclude`` or ``io-code-block``) for all code examples.

  .. include:: /includes/note-hard-coded-code-examples.rst

- Do not use inline-level markup for code examples. Use inline code markup to
  format code-related references within text in ``monospace`` (such as method names),
  as directed in :ref:`text-formatting`.

Comparison of Inline and Block Markup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Inline code text (using inline formatting)
2. Block of code (using a block-level directive)
