Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to remove documents from your MongoDB
collections using delete operations.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection
from the ``sample_restaurants`` database. The documents in this
collection are modeled by the following ``Restaurant`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/crud/delete.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model

This collection is from the :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data>` provided
by Atlas. See the :ref:`<csharp-quickstart>` to learn how to create a free MongoDB cluster
and load this sample data.

Delete Operations
-----------------

Use delete operations to remove documents that match a **query filter**.
The query filter determines which records are selected for deletion
based on the criteria in :manual:`the query filter
document</core/document/#query-filter-documents>`. You can perform
delete operations in MongoDB with the following methods:

- ``DeleteOne()``, which deletes *the first document* that matches the query filter
- ``DeleteMany()``, which deletes *all documents* that match the query filter

Delete One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to use the asynchronous
``DeleteOneAsync()`` method or the synchronous ``DeleteOne()`` method to
delete one document.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: delete-one-async

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var result = await _restaurantsCollection.DeleteOneAsync(filter);

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: delete-one-sync

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var result = _restaurantsCollection.DeleteOne(filter);

Delete Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to use the asynchronous
``DeleteManyAsync()`` method or the synchronous ``DeleteMany()`` method to
delete all matched documents.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: delete-many-async

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var result = await _restaurantsCollection.DeleteManyAsync(filter);

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: delete-many-sync

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var result = _restaurantsCollection.DeleteMany(filter);

.. tip::

   Find runnable examples using these methods under :ref:`additional
   information <additional-info>`.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteOne()`` and ``DeleteMany()`` methods require you to pass a
query filter specifying which documents to match. More information
on how to construct a query filter is available in :manual:`the Query Documents
tutorial</tutorial/query-documents/>`.

Both methods optionally take a ``DeleteOptions`` type as an additional parameter,
which represents options you can use to configure the delete operation.
If you don't specify any ``DeleteOptions`` properties, the driver does
not customize the delete operation.

The ``DeleteOptions`` type allows you to configure options with the
following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``Collation``
     - | Gets or sets the type of language collation to use when sorting
         results. See :manual:`the delete
         statements</reference/command/delete/#std-label-deletes-array-collation>`
         for more information.

   * - ``Comment``
     - | Gets or sets the comment for the operation. See :manual:`the delete command
         fields</reference/command/delete/#command-fields>`
         for more information.

   * - ``Hint``
     - | Gets or sets the index to use to scan for documents. See :manual:`the delete
         statements</reference/command/delete/#std-label-deletes-array-hint>`
         for more information.

   * - ``Let``
     - | Gets or sets the let document. See :manual:`the delete command
         fields</reference/command/delete/#command-fields>`
         for more information.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``DeleteMany()`` method to search on the
"borough_1" index and delete all documents where the ``address.street``
field value includes the phrase "Pearl Street":

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: csharp

      var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter
          .Regex("address.street", "Pearl Street");

      DeleteOptions opts = new DeleteOptions { Hint = "borough_1" };

      WriteLine("Deleting documents...");
      var result = _restaurantsCollection.DeleteMany(filter, opts);
      
      WriteLine($"Deleted documents: {result.DeletedCount}");
      WriteLine($"Result acknowledged? {result.IsAcknowledged}");

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false
      
      Deleting documents...
      Deleted documents: 26
      Result acknowledged? True

.. tip::

   If the preceding example used the ``DeleteOne()`` method instead of
   ``DeleteMany()``, the driver would delete the first of the 26
   matched documents.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DeleteOne()`` and ``DeleteMany()`` methods return a
``DeleteResult`` type. This type contains the ``DeletedCount`` property,
which indicates the number of documents deleted, and the
``IsAcknowledged`` property, which indicates if the result is
acknowledged. If the query filter does not match any documents, no documents
are deleted and ``DeletedCount`` is 0.
