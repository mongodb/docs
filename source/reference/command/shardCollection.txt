Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   :doc:`Shards </sharding>` a collection to distribute its documents
   across shards. You must run :dbcommand:`enableSharding` on a
   database before running the :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command.
   The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command must be run against the
   ``admin`` database.

   .. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`shardCollection`

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.shardCollection` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-serverless.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

                
Syntax
------

.. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`shardCollection`

.. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

The command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       shardCollection: "<database>.<collection>",
       key: { <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... },
       unique: <boolean>,
       numInitialChunks: <integer>,
       presplitHashedZones: <boolean>,
       collation: { locale: "simple" }
   }

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:


.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 20 20 80

  * - Field

    - Type

    - Description

  * - ``shardCollection``

    - string

    - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to shard in the form
      ``<database>.<collection>``.
      
      

  * - ``key``

    - document

    - The document that specifies the field or fields to use as the
      :doc:`shard key </core/sharding-shard-key/>`.

      ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``

      Set the field values to either:
      
      - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`
      
      - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
        :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.
      
      :doc:`shard key </core/sharding-shard-key/>` must be
      supported by an index. Unless the collection is empty, the
      index must exist prior to the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
      command. If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the
      index prior to sharding the collection if the index that can
      support the shard key does not already exist.
      
      See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`
      
      

  * - ``unique``

    - boolean

    - Specify ``true`` to ensure that the underlying index
      enforces a unique constraint. Defaults to ``false``. 

      You cannot specify ``true`` when using :ref:`hashed shard keys 
      <sharding-hashed>`.

  * - ``numInitialChunks``

    - integer

    - Specifies the initial number of chunks to create across all shards in 
      the cluster when sharding an *empty* collection with a
      :ref:`hashed shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB
      will then create and balance chunks across the cluster. The
      ``numInitialChunks`` must result in less than ``8192`` per shard.
      
      If the collection is not empty or the shard key does not
      contain a hashed field, the operation returns an error.

      - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: true
        <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`,
        MongoDB attempts to evenly distribute the specified
        number of chunks across the zones in the cluster.

      - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
        <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
        no zones and zone ranges are defined for the empty
        collection, MongoDB attempts to evenly distributed the
        specified number of chunks across the shards in the cluster.

      - If sharding with :ref:`presplitHashedZones: false
        <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` or omitted and
        zones and zone ranges have been defined for the empty
        collection, ``numInitChunks`` has no effect.

  * - ``collation``

    - document

    - Optional. If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
      has a default :doc:`collation </reference/collation>`,
      you *must* include a collation document with
      ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or
      the ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
      whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
      collation.
      
      
  * - :ref:`presplitHashedZones 
      <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`

    - boolean

    - .. _cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones:
    
      Optional. Specify ``true`` to perform initial chunk creation
      and distribution for an empty or non-existing collection based
      on the defined zones and zone ranges for the collection. For
      :ref:`hashed sharding <sharding-hashed>` only.

      ``shardCollection`` with ``presplitHashedZones: true`` returns
      an error if any of the following are true:

      - The shard key does not contain a hashed field 
        (i.e. is not a :ref:`single field hashed index 
        <index-hashed-index>` or :ref:`compound hashed index
        <index-type-compound-hashed>`).

      - The collection has no defined zones or zone ranges.

      - The defined zone range or ranges do not meet the 
        :ref:`requirements 
        <shardCollection-zones>`.


Considerations
--------------

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

While you can :ref:`change your shard key <change-a-shard-key>`
later, it is important to carefully consider your shard key choice to
avoid scalability and perfomance issues.

.. seealso::

  - :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`
  - :ref:`sharding-shard-key`

.. _hashed-shard-keys:

Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` use a
:doc:`hashed index </core/index-hashed>` or a
:ref:`compound hashed index <index-type-compound-hashed>`
as the shard key.

Use the form ``field: "hashed"`` to specify a hashed shard key field.

.. include:: /includes/note-hashed-shard-key-during-chunk-migration.rst

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding`

.. _shardCollection-zones:

Zone Sharding and Initial Chunk Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-with-links.rst

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example` for an example. If sharding a
collection using a ranged or single-field hashed shard key, the
``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges have
been defined for the empty collection.

To shard a collection using a :ref:`compound hashed index
<index-type-compound-hashed>`, see
:ref:`shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed`.

.. _shardCollection-zones-compound-hashed:

Zone Sharding and Compound Hashed Indexes
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-hashed-short.rst

The ``numInitialChunks`` option has no effect if zones and zone ranges
have been defined for the empty collection *and*
:ref:`presplitHashedZones <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` is
``false``.

See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-hashed-example` for an example.

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`initial-chunks` 
   - :dbcommand:`balancerCollectionStatus`

Uniqueness
~~~~~~~~~~

If specifying ``unique: true``:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/shard-collection-unique-restriction-command.rst

<sharding-shard-key-unique>`

.. include:: /includes/fact-shardCollection-collation.rst

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-shard-collection.rst

Example
-------

The following operation enables sharding for the ``people`` collection
in the ``records`` database and uses the ``zipcode`` field as the
:ref:`shard key <shard-key>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "records.people", key: { zipcode: 1 } } )
