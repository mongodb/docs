Query Autocomplete Menu 
-----------------------

If the query bar is empty, you can click the filter bar to open the 
query autocomplete menu and view up to 50 of your most recent queries. To scroll 
through your most recent queries, you can use the :kbd:`↑` and :kbd:`↓` arrow 
keys. If a query is highlighted on the menu, it displays a pop-up panel that 
shows the filter, project, and sort stages of the query. To select a query from 
the autocomplete menu, press :kbd:`Enter`, press :kbd:`Tab`, or click the query. 

If you start typing into the filter bar, the autocomplete menu filters results 
to only display recent queries that include the specified string. If you start 
typing into the other option fields, such as :guilabel:`Project` or 
:guilabel:`Sort`, the autocomplete menu only displays recent queries that 
include those fields.
