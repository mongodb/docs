Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your |service| {+cluster+}. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. To
learn more about the documents in the sample collection, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection`. 

The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up and initialize the Go module.

      In your terminal, navigate to where you want to create your application, 
      then run the following command to create a directory called 
      ``atlas-search-project`` and initialize your project in that directory: 
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/field-types/initialize-project-go.sh
         :language: shell
         :copyable: true

      For more detailed installation instructions, see the
      :ref:`MongoDB Go Driver documentation <go-get-started>`.

   .. step:: Create and populate the collections.

      Create and populate the ``schools`` collection:
    
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/embedded-documents/sample-data.go
         :language: go
         :copyable:
         :linenos:

      .. include:: /includes/search-shared/find-connection-string.rst

   .. step:: Run the ``go`` program to create the collection.
      
      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: shell

            go run file_name.go

         .. output::
            :visible: false
