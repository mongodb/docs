|service| supports the following instance sizes.
|service| supports deploying ``M2`` and ``M5`` instances
into a subset of available regions. The documentation for
``providersettings.regionName`` includes a list of these regions.

Instance sizes with ``_NVME`` appended (for example:
``M40_NVME``) use locally attached :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`
for exceptional performance with the most IO-intensive workloads.
