Concise Terms
=============

Use shorter terms and phrases to convey an idea clearly. The following
table lists concise terms to use instead of their longer counterparts.
Use a longer counterpart only if the two terms or phrases are not
interchangeable because of context.

In addition to using concise terms, use the shorter of two approved
spellings. For example, *canceled* instead of *cancelled*.
