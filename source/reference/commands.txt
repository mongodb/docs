Command Reference

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document contains a reference to all :term:`database commands
<database command>`.

The MongoDB command interface provides access to all :term:`non CRUD
<crud>` database operations. Fetching server stats, initializing a
replica set, and running a map-reduce job are all accomplished by
running a command.

You specify a command first by constructing a standard :term:`BSON`
document whose first key is the name of the command. For example,
specify the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command using the following
:term:`BSON` document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { isMaster: 1 }

To execute this command, you send this document as a query on the
special :term:`$cmd` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.$cmd.findOne( {isMaster: 1} )

The JavaScript shell (i.e. :program:`mongo`,) provides a helper method for
running commands. Thus, you can also run the above command like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { isMaster: 1 } )

Many commands have their own shell helpers:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.isMaster();

You must run some commands on the ``admin`` database. Normally, that
looks like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( {buildInfo: 1} )

However, there's also a command helper that automatically switches to
this database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db._adminCommand( {buildInfo: 1} )

The ``_adminCommand`` helper is shorthand for
``db.getSisterDB("admin").runCommand();``.

All commands return, at minimum, a document with an ``ok`` field
indicating whether the command has succeeded:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 'ok': 1 }

If the command fails, the value of ``ok`` will be 0.

In the command descriptions below, we provide the document template
for each command. In some cases, we also show the relevant :program:`mongo`
shell helpers.

User Commands
-------------

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

.. seealso:: The ":wiki:`Sharding`" wiki page for more information
   about MongoDB's sharding functionality.

.. STUB ":doc:`/core/sharding`"

.. dbcommand:: addShard

   :option name: Optional. Unless specified, a name will be
                 automatically provided to uniquely identify
                 the shard.

   :option maxSize: Optional. Unless specified, shards will consume
                    the total amount of available space on their
                    machines if necessary. Use the ``maxSize`` value
                    to limit the amount of space the database can
                    use. Specify this value in megabytes.

   The :dbcommand:`addShard` command registers a new with a sharded
   cluster. You must run this command against a :program:`mongos`
   instance. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { addShard: "<hostname>:<port>" }

   Replace ``<hostname>:<port>`` with the hostname and port of the
   database instance you want to add as a shard. Because the
   :program:`mongos` instances do not have state and distribute
   configuration in the :term:`config database`, send this
   command to only one :program:`mongos` instance.

   .. note::

      Specify a ``maxSize`` when you have machines with different disk
      capacities, or if you want to limit the amount of data on some
      shards.

.. dbcommand:: listShards

   Use the :dbcommand:`listShards` command to return a list of
   configured shards. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { listShards: 1 }

.. dbcommand:: enableSharding

   The :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command enables sharding on a per-database
   level. Use the following command form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { enableSharding: 1 }

   Once you've enabled sharding in a database, you can use the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
   command to begin the process of distributing data among the shards.

.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command marks a collection for sharding and
   will allow data to begin distributing among shards. You must run
   :dbcommand:`enableSharding` on a database before running the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardcollection: "<db>.<collection>", key: "<shardkey>" }

   This enables sharding for the collection specified by
   ``<collection>`` in the database named ``<db>``, using the key
   ``<shardkey>`` to distribute documents among the shard.

   Choosing the right shard key to effectively distribute load among
   your shards requires some planning.

   .. seealso:: The ":wiki:`Sharding`" wiki page  for more information
      related to sharding and the choice of shard key.

   .. STUB ":doc:`/core/sharding`"

   .. warning::

      There's no easy way to disable sharding once you've enabled it. In addition,
      shard keys are immutable. If you must revert a sharded cluster to a single
      node or replica set, you'll have to make a single backup of the entire cluster
      and then restore the backup to the standalone :program:`mongod`.

.. dbcommand:: shardingState

   The :dbcommand:`shardingState` command returns ``true`` if the
   :program:`mongod` instance is a member of a sharded cluster. Run the
   command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardingState: 1 }

   .. admin-only

.. dbcommand:: removeshard

   Starts the process of removing a shard from a :term:`shard
   cluster`. This is a multi-stage process. Begin by issuing the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { removeshard : "[shardName]" }

   The balancer will then migrating chunks from the shard specified by
   ``[shardName]``. This process happens slowly to avoid placing
   undue load on the overall cluster.

   The command returns immediately, with the following message:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg : "draining started successfully" , state: "started" , shard: "shardName" , ok : 1 }

   If you run the command again, you'll see the following progress
   output:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg: "draining ongoing" , state: "ongoing" , remaining: { chunks: 23 , dbs: 1 }, ok: 1 }

   The ``remaining`` :term:`document` specifies how many chunks and
   databases remain on the shard. Use :dbcommand:`printShardingStatus`
   to list the databases that you must move from the shard.

   Each database in a sharded cluster has a primary shard. If the
   shard you want to remove is also the primary of one the cluster's
   databases, then you must manually move the database to a new
   shard. This can be only after the shard is empty. See the
   :dbcommand:`moveprimary` command for details.

   After removing all chunks and databases from the shard, you
   may issue the command again, to return:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { msg: "remove shard completed successfully , stage: "completed", host: "shardName", ok : 1 }

.. dbcommand:: moveprimary

   In a :term:`shard cluster`, this command reassigns a databases
   primary shard.  The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { moveprimary : "test", to : "shard0001" }

   When the command returns, the database's primary location will
   shift to the designated :term:`shard`. To fully decomission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeshard` command.

   .. warning:: Do not use :dbcommand:`moveprimary` if you have
      sharded collections and the :term:`draining` process has not
      completed.

.. dbcommand:: printShardingStatus

   Returns data regarding the status of a :term:`shard cluster` and
   includes information regarding the distribution of
   :term:`chunks <chunk>`. :dbcommand:`printShardingStatus` is only available
   when connected to a :term:`shard cluster` via a
   :program:`mongos`. Typically, you will use the
   :func:`sh.status()` :program:`mongo` shell wrapper to access
   this data.

Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: group

   The :dbcommand:`group` command returns an array of grouped items. :dbcommand:`group`
   provides functionality analogous to the ``GROUP BY`` statement in
   SQL. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.runCommand( { group:
                             { key: { school_id: true },
                               cond: { active: 1 },
                               reduce: function(obj, prev) { obj.total += 1; },
                               initial: { total: 0 }
                              } } );

   More typically, in the :program:`mongo` shell, you will call the
   :dbcommand:`group` command using the :func:`group()`
   method. Consider the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.group( { key: { school_id: true },
                        cond: { active: 1 },
                        reduce: function(obj, prev) { obj.total += 1; },
                        initial: { total: 0 }
                       } );

   In these examples :dbcommand:`group` runs against the collection
   ``users`` and counts the total number of active users from each
   school. Fields allowed by the group command include:

   :field document key: Specify one or more fields to group by. Use the
                        form of a :term:`document`.

   :field reduce: Specify a reduce function that operates over all the
                  iterated objects. Typically these aggregator
                  functions perform some sort of summing or
                  counting. The reduce function takes two arguments:
                  the current document and an aggregation counter
                  object.

   :field inital: The starting value of the aggregation counter
                  object.

   :field keyf: Optional. A function that returns a "key
                object" for use as the grouping key. Use
                ``keyf`` instead of ``key`` to specify a key
                that is not a single/multiple existing
                fields. For example, use ``keyf`` to group by
                day or week in place of a fixed ``key``.

   :field cond: Optional. A statement that must evaluate to true for
                the :func:`db.collection.group()` to process this
                document. Essentially this argument specifies
                a query document (as for
                :func:`db.collection.find()`). Unless specified,
                :func:`db.collection.group()` runs the "reduce" function
                against all documents in the collection.

   :field finalize: Optional. A function that runs each item
                    in the result set before
                    :func:`db.collection.group()` returns the final
                    value. This function can either modify
                    the document by computing and adding an
                    average field, or return compute and
                    return a new document.

   .. note::

      The result set of the :func:`db.collection.group()` must fit
      within the size :ref:`maximum BSON document
      <limit-bson-document-size>`. Furthermore, you must ensure that
      there are fewer then 10,000 unique keys. If you have more than
      this, use :dbcommand:`mapReduce`.

   .. warning::

      :func:`group()` does not work in :term:`shard environments
      <shard cluster>`. Use the :term:`aggregation framework` or
      :term:`map-reduce` (i.e. :command:`mapReduce` in :term:`sharded
      environments <sharding>`.

   .. read-lock

.. dbcommand:: count

   The :dbcommand:`count` command counts the number of documents in a collection. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.count():

   In the :program:`mongo` shell, this returns the number of documents in the
   collection (e.g. ``collection``). You may also run this command
   using the :func:`db.runCommand()` functionality, with the following results:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        > db.runCommand( { count: "collection" } );
        { "n" : 10 , "ok" : 1 }

   The collection in this example has 10 documents.

   .. read-lock

.. dbcommand:: mapReduce

   The :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command allows you to run
   map-reduce-style aggregations over a collection.

   :option map: A JavaScript function that performs the "map" step of
                the map-reduce operation. This function references the
                current input document and calls the
                ``emit(key,value)`` method that supplies values to
                the reduce function. Map functions may call
                ``emit()``, once, more than once, or not at all
                depending on the type of aggregation.

   :option reduce: A JavaScript function that performs the "reduce"
                   step of the MapReduce operation. The reduce
                   function receives an array of emitted values from
                   the map function, and returns a single
                   value. Because it's possible to invoke the reduce
                   function more than once for the same key, the
                   structure of the object returned by function must
                   be identical to the structure of the emitted
                   function.

   :option out: Specifies the location of the out of the reduce stage
                of the operation. Specify a string to write the output
                of the Map/Reduce job to a collection with that
                name. The map-reduce operation will replace the
                content of the specified collection in the current
                database by default. See below for additional options.

   :option query: Optional. A query object, like the query used by the
                  :func:`db.collection.find()` method. Use this to
                  filter to limit the number of documents
                  enter the map phase of the aggregation.

   :option sort: Optional. Sorts the input objects using this key. This
                 option is useful for optimizing the
                 job. Common uses include sorting by the emit
                 key so that there are fewer reduces.

   :option limit: Optional. Species a maximum number of objects to
                  return from the collection.

   :option finalize: Optional. Specifies an optional "finalize"
                     function to run on a result, following
                     the reduce stage, to modify or control
                     the output of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
                     operation.

   :option scope: Optional. Place a :term:`document` as the contents of
                  this field, to place fields into the global
                  javascript scope.

   :option Boolean jsMode: Optional. The ``jsMode`` option defaults to
                           ``false``.

   :option Boolean verbose: Optional. The ``verbose`` option provides
                            statistics on job execution times.

   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` only require ``map`` and ``reduce`` options,
   all other fields are optional. You must write all ``map`` and
   ``reduce`` functions in JavaScript.

   The ``out`` field of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, provides a
   number of additional configuration options that you may use to
   control how MongoDB returns data from the map-reduce job. Consider
   the following 4 output possibilities.

   .. versionadded: 1.8

   :param replace: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out:
                   { replace: collectionName } }``) where the output
                   of the map-reduce overwrites the contents of the
                   collection specified (i.e. ``collectionName``) if
                   there is any data in that collection. This is the
                   default behavior if you only specify a collection
                   name in the ``out`` field.

   :param merge: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out: {
                 merge: collectionName } }``) where the
                 map-reduce operation writes output to an
                 existing collection
                 (i.e. ``collectionName``,) and only
                 overwrites existing documents when a new
                 document has the same key as an "old"
                 document in this collection.

   :param reduce: Optional. This operation behaves as the ``merge``
                  option above, except that when an existing
                  document has the same key as a new
                  document, ``reduce`` function from the
                  map reduce job will run on both values and
                  MongoDB writes the result of this function
                  to the new collection. The specification
                  takes the form of ``{ out: { reduce:
                  collectionName } }``, where
                  ``collectionName`` is the name of the
                  results collection.

   :param inline: Optional. Indicate the inline option (i.e. ``{ out:
                  { inline: 1 } }``) to perform the map
                  reduce job in ram and return the results at
                  the end of the function. This option is
                  only possible when the entire result set
                  will fit within the :ref:`maximum size of a
                  BSON document <limit-bson-document-size>`.
                  When performing map-reduce jobs on
                  secondary members of replica sets, this is
                  the only available option.

   :param db: Optional. The name of the database that you want the
              map-reduce operation to write its output. By default
              this will be the same database as the input collection.

   :param sharded: Optional. If ``1``, *and* the output mode writes to a
                   collection, and the output database has sharding
                   enabled, the map-reduce operation will shard the
                   results collection according to the ``_id`` field.

   .. seealso:: ":func:`mapReduce()`" and ":term:`map-reduce`."

      Also, the ":wiki:`MapReduce` page, provides a greater overview
      of MognoDB's map-reduce functionality. Consider the
      ":wiki:`Simple application <Aggregation>`" support for basic
      aggregation operations and ":doc:`/applications/aggregation`"
      for a more flexible approach to data aggregation in MongoDB.

   .. slave-ok

.. dbcommand:: findAndModify

   The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command atomically modifies and
   returns a single document. The shell and many :term:`drivers
   <driver>` provide a :func:`findAndModify()` helper method. The
   command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { findAndModify: "collection", <options> }

   Replace, ``collection`` with the name of the collection
   containing the document that you want to modify, and specify
   options, as a sub-document that specifies the following:

   :field query: A query object. This statement might resemble the
                  :term:`document` passed to :func:`db.collection.find()`, and
                  should return *one* document from the database.

   :field sort: Optional. If the query selects multiple documents, the
                first document given by this sort clause will be the
                one modified.

   :field remove: When ``true``, :dbcommand:`findAndModify` removes
                  the selected document.

   :field update: an :ref:`update operator <update-operators>` to
                  modify the selected document.

   :field new: when ``true``, returns the modified document rather
               than the original. :dbcommand:`findAndModify` ignores
               the ``new`` option for ``remove`` operations.

   :field fields: a subset of fields to return. See ":ref:`projection
                  operators <projection-operators>`" for more
                  information.

   :field upsert: when ``true``, creates a new document if the
                  specified ``query`` returns no documents. The
                  default is ``false``.


   For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { findAndModify: "people",
        { query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
          sort: { rating: 1 },
          update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
          }
        }

   This operation, finds a document in the ``people`` collection
   where the ``name`` field has the value ``Tom``, the
   ``active`` value in the ``state`` field and a value in the
   ``rating`` field :operator:`greater than <$gt>` 10. If there is
   more than one result for this query, MongoDB sorts the results of
   the query in descending order, and :operator:`increments <$inc>`
   the value of the ``score`` field by 1. Using the shell helper,
   this same operation can take the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.findAndModify( {
          query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
          sort: { rating: 1 },
          update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
          } );

   .. warning::

      When using :dbcommand:`findAndModify` in a :term:`sharded
      <sharding>` environment, the ``query`` must contain the
      :term:`shard key` for all operations against the shard
      cluster. :dbcommand:`findAndModify` operations issued against
      :program:`mongos` instances for non-sharded collections function
      normally.

.. dbcommand:: distinct

   The :dbcommand:`distinct` command returns an array of distinct values for a
   given field across a single collection. The command takes the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { distinct: collection, key: age, query: { query: { field: { $exists: true } } } }

   This operation returns all distinct values of the field (or
   ``key``) ``age`` in documents that match the query ``{ field: {
   $exists: true }``.

   .. note::

      The query portion of the :dbcommand:`distinct` is optional.

   The shell and many :term:`drivers <driver>` provide a helper method that provides
   this functionality. You may prefer the following equivalent syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.distinct("age", { field: { $exists: true } } );

   The :dbcommand:`distinct` command will use an index to locate and
   return data.

.. dbcommand:: eval

   The :dbcommand:`eval` command evaluates JavaScript functions
   on the database server. Consider the following (trivial) example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { eval: function() { return 3+3 } }

   The shell also provides a helper method, so you can express the
   above as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.eval( function { return 3+3 } } );

   Note the shell's Java Script interpreter evaluates functions
   entered directly into the shell. If you want to use the server's
   interpreter, you must run :dbcommand:`eval`.

   Note the following behaviors and limitations:

   - ``eval`` does not work in :term:`sharded <sharding>`
     environments.

   - The ``eval`` operation take a write lock by default. This means
     that writes to database aren't permitted while it's running. You
     can, however, disable the lock by setting the ``nolock`` flag to
     ``true``. For example:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { eval: function() { return 3+3 }, nolock: true }

     .. warning::

        Do not disable the write lock if the operation may modify the
        contents of the database in anyway.

     There are some circumstances where the :dbcommand:`eval()`
     implements a strictly-read only operation that need not block
     other operations when disabling the write lock may be useful. Use
     this functionality with extreme caution.

.. dbcommand:: aggregate

   .. versionadded:: 2.1.0

   :dbcommand:`aggregate` implements the :term:`aggregation
   framework`. Consider the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { aggregate: "[collection]", pipeline: ["pipeline"] }

   Where ``[collection]`` specifies the name of the collection that
   contains the data that you wish to aggregate. The ``pipeline``
   argument holds an array that contains the specification for the
   aggregation operation. Consider the following example from the
   :doc:`aggregation documentation </applications/aggregation>`.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand(
      { aggregate : “article”, pipeline : [
        { $project : {
           author : 1,
           tags : 1,
        } },
        { $unwind : “$tags” },
        { $group : {
           _id : { tags : 1 },
           authors : { $addToSet : “$author” }
        } }
       ] }
      );

   More typically this operation would use the :func:`aggregate`
   helper in the :program:`mongo` shell, and would resemble the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.article.aggregate(
        { $project : {
           author : 1,
           tags : 1,
        } },
        { $unwind : “$tags” },
        { $group : {
           _id : { tags : 1 },
           authors : { $addToSet : “$author” }
        } }
      );

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/core/replication`" for more information regarding
   replication.

.. dbcommand:: resync

   The :dbcommand:`resync` command forces an out-of-date slave
   :program:`mongod` instance to re-synchronize itself. Note
   that this command is relevent to master-slave replication only. It does
   no apply to replica sets.

   .. write-lock, slave-ok, admin-only.

.. dbcommand:: replSetFreeze

   The :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` command prevents a replica set
   member from seeking election for the specified number of
   seconds. Use this command in conjunction with the
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command to make a different node in
   the replica set a primary.

   The :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` command uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetFreeze: <seconds> }

   If you want to unfreeze a replica set member before the specified number
   of seconds has elapsed, you can issue the command with a seconds
   value of ``0``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetFreeze: 0 }

   Restarting the :program:`mongod` process also unfreezes a replica
   set member.

   :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` is an administrative command, and you
   must issue the it against the ``admin`` database.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

.. dbcommand:: replSetGetStatus

   The ``replSetGetStatus`` command returns the status of the replica
   set from the point of view of the current server. You must run the
   command against the admin database. The command has the following
   prototype format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetGetStatus: 1 }

   However, you can also run this command from the shell like so:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.status()

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

   .. seealso:: ":doc:`/reference/replica-status`" and ":doc:`/core/replication`"

.. dbcommand:: replSetInitiate

   The :dbcommand:`replSetInitiate` command initializes a new replica set. Use the
   following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetInitiate : <config_document> }

   The ``<config_document>`` is a :term:`document` that specifies
   the replica set's configuration. For instance, here's a config document
   for creating a simple 3-member replica set:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          _id : <setname>,
           members : [
               {_id : 0, host : <host0>},
               {_id : 1, host : <host1>},
               {_id : 2, host : <host2>},
           ]
      }

   A typical way of running this command is to assign the config document to
   a variable and then to pass the document to the
   :func:`rs.initiate()` helper:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      config = {
          _id : "my_replica_set",
           members : [
               {_id : 0, host : "rs1.example.net:27017"},
               {_id : 1, host : "rs2.example.net:27017"},
               {_id : 2, host : "rs3.example.net", arbiterOnly: true},
           ]
      }

      rs.initiate(config)

    Notice that omitting the port cause the host to use the default port
    of 27017. Notice also that you can specify other options in the config
    documents such as the ``arbiterOnly`` setting in this example.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

   .. seealso:: ":doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`,"
      ":doc:`/administration/replica-sets`," and ":ref:`Replica Set
      Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. dbcommand:: replSetReconfig

   The :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command modifies the configuration of an existing
   replica set. You can use this command to add and remove members, and to
   alter the options set on existing members. Use the following
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetReconfig: <new_config_document>, force: false }

   You may also run the command using the shell's :func:`rs.reconfig()` method.

   Be aware of the following :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` behaviors:

   - You must issue this command against the admin database of the current
     primary member of the replica set.

   - You can optionally force the replica set to accept the new
     configuration by specifying ``force: true``. Use this option if
     the current member is not primary or if a majority of the members
     of the set are not accessible.

     .. warning::

        Forcing the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command can lead to a
        :term:`rollback` situation. Use with caution.

   - A majority of the set's members must be operational for the
     changes to propagate properly.

   - This command can cause downtime as the set renegotiates
     primary-status. Typically this is 10-20 seconds, but could
     be as long as a minute or more. Therefore, you should attempt
     to reconfigure only during scheduled maintenance periods.

   - In some cases, :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` forces the current primary to
     step down, initiating an election for primary among the members of
     the replica set. When this happens, the set will drop all current
     connections.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   The :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command forces a replica set
   primary to relinquish its status as primary. This initiates an
   election for primary. You may specify a number of seconds for the
   node to avoid election to primary:

   .. code-block:: javascript



        { replSetStepDown: <seconds> }

   If you do not specify a value for ``<seconds>``, ``replSetStepDown`` will attempt to avoid reelection
   to primary for 60 seconds.

   .. warning:: This will force all clients currently connected to the
      database to disconnect. This help to ensure that clients maintain
      an accurate view of the replica set.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

Geospatial Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: geoNear

   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command provides an alternative to the
   :dbcommand:`$near` operator. In addition to the
   functionality of :operator:`$near`, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the distance of
   each item from the specified point along with additional diagnostic
   information. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { geoNear : "places" , near : [50,50], num : 10 }

   Here, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the 10 items nearest to the coordinates
   ``[50,50]``. `geoNear` provides the following options (specify
   all distances in the same units as the document coordinate system:)

   :field near: Takes the coordinates (e.g. ``[ x, y ]``) to use as
                the center of a geospatial query.

   :field num: Specifies the maximum number of documents to return.

   :field maxDistance: Limits the results to those falling within
                       a given distance of the center coordinate.

   :field query: Further narrows the results using any standard
                 MongoDB query operator or selection. See :func:`db.collection.find()`
                 and ":doc:`/reference/operators`" for more
                 information.

   :field distanceMultipler: Specifies a factor to multiply
                             all distances returned by
                             :dbcommand:`geoNear`. For example, use
                             ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert from
                             spherical queries returned in radians to
                             linear units (i.e. miles or kilometers)
                             by multiplying by the radius of the
                             Earth.

   .. read-lock, slave-ok

.. dbcommand:: geoSearch

   The :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command provides an interface to
   MongoDB's :term:`haystack index` functionality. These indexes are
   useful for returning results based on location coordinates *after*
   collecting results based on some other query (i.e. a "haystack.")
   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { geoSearch : "foo", near : [33, 33], maxDistance : 6, search : { type : "restaurant" }, limit : 30 }

   The above command returns all documents with a ``type`` of
   ``restaurant`` having a maximum distance of 6 units from the
   coordinates ``[30,33]`` up to a maximum of 30 results.

   Unless specified otherwise, the :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command
   limits results to 50 documents.

   .. read-lock, slave-ok

Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: drop

   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { drop: <collection_name> }

   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper
   method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.drop();

   Note that this command also removes any indexes associated with the
   dropped collection.

.. dbcommand:: cloneCollection

   The :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` command copies a collection from a
   remote server to the server where you run the command.

   :opt from: Specify a resolvable hostname, and optional port number
              of the remote server where the specified collection resides.

   :opt query: Optional. A query document, in the form of a
               :term:`document`, that filters the documents
               in the remote collection that
               :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` will copy to the
               current database. See :func:`db.collection.find()`.

   :opt Boolean copyIndexes: Optional. ``true`` by default. When set
                              to ``false`` the indexes on the
                              originating server are *not* copied with
                              the documents in the collection.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { cloneCollection: "app.users", from: "db.example.net:27017", query: { active: true }, copyIndexes: false }

   This operation copies the "users" collection from the "app"
   database on the server at ``db.example.net``. The operation only
   copies documents that satisfy the query ``{ active: true }`` and
   does not copy indexes. :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` copies indexes
   by default, but you can disable this behavior by setting ``{
   copyIndexes: false }``. The ``query`` and ``copyIndexes``
   arguments are optional.

   :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` creates a collection on the current
   database with the same name as the origin collection. If, in the
   above example, the ``users`` collection already exists, then
   MongoDB appends documents in the remote collection to the
   destination collection.

.. dbcommand:: create

   The ``create`` command explicitly creates a collection. The command
   uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { create: <collection_name> }

   To create a :term:`capped collection` limited to 40 KB, issue command in
   the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { create: "collection", capped: true, size: 40 * 1024 }

   The options for creating capped collections are:

   :option capped: Specify ``true`` to create a :term:`capped collection`.

   :option size: The maximum size for the capped collection. Once a
                 capped collection reaches its max size, MongoDB will
                 drop old documents from the database to make way for
                 the new documents. You must specify a ``size``
                 argument for all capped collections.

   :option max: The maximum number of documents to preserve in the
                capped collection. This limit is subject to the
                overall size of the capped collection. If a capped
                collection reaches its maximum size before it contains
                the maximum number of documents, the database will
                remove old documents. Thus, if you use this option,
                ensure that the total size for the capped collection
                is sufficient to contain the max.

   The :func:`db.createCollection` provides a wrapper function that
   provides access to this functionality.

.. dbcommand:: convertToCapped

   The :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command converts an existing,
   non-capped collection to a :term:`capped collection`. Use the
   following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {convertToCapped: "collection", size: 100 * 1024 }

   This command coverts ``collection``, an existing collection, to a
   capped collection, with a maximum size of 100 KB. This command
   accepts the ``size`` and ``max`` options. See the
   :dbcommand:`create` command for additional details.

.. dbcommand:: emptycapped

   The ``emptycapped`` command removes all documents from a capped
   collection. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { emptycapped: "events" }

   This command removes all records from the capped collection named
   ``events``.

.. dbcommand:: renameCollection

   The :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command changes the name of an existing
   collection. Use the following form to rename the collection
   named "things" to "events":

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { renameCollection: "store.things", to: "store.events" }

   You must run this command against the admin database. and thus
   requires you to specify the complete namespace (i.e., database name
   and collection name.)

   The shell helper :func:`renameCollection()` provides a more
   simple interface for this functionality. The following is
   equivalent to the previous example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.things.renameCollection( "events" )

   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` operates by changing the metadata
   associated with a given collection. The duration of the command is
   constant and not related to the size of the collection or the
   indexes; however, the operation will invalidate open cursors which
   will interrupt queries that are currently returning data.

   You may safely use :dbcommand:`renameCollection` in production
   environments.

.. dbcommand:: collStats

   The :dbcommand:`collStats` command returns a variety of storage statistics
   for a given collection. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { collStats: "database.collection" , scale : 1024 }

   Specify a namespace ``database.collection`` and
   use the ``scale`` argument to scale the output. The above example
   will display values in kilobytes.

   Examine the following example output, which uses the
   :func:`db.collection.stats()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      > db.users.stats()
      {
              "ns" : "app.users",             // namespace
              "count" : 9,                    // number of documents
              "size" : 432,                   // collection size in bytes
              "avgObjSize" : 48,              // average object size in bytes
              "storageSize" : 3840,           // (pre)allocated space for the collection
              "numExtents" : 1,               // number of extents (contiguously allocated chunks of datafile space)
              "nindexes" : 2,                 // number of indexes
              "lastExtentSize" : 3840,        // size of the most recently created extent
              "paddingFactor" : 1,            // padding can speed up updates if documents grow
              "flags" : 1,
              "totalIndexSize" : 16384,       // total index size in bytes
              "indexSizes" : {                // size of specific indexes in bytes
                      "_id_" : 8192,
                      "username" : 8192
              },
              "ok" : 1
      }

   .. note::

      The scale factor rounds values to whole numbers. This can
      produce unpredictable and unexpected results in some situations.

   .. seealso:: ":doc:`/reference/collection-statistics`."

.. dbcommand:: compact

   The :dbcommand:`compact` command rewrites and defragments a single
   collection. Additionally, the command forces all indexes on the collection
   to be rebuilt. The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { compact: "users" }

   This command compacts the collection named ``users``. Note the
   following command behaviors:

   - During a :dbcommand:`compact`, the database blocks all other activity.

   - In a :term:`replica set`, :dbcommand:`compact` will refuse to run on the
     primary node unless you also specify ``{ force: true }``.
     For example:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { compact: "collection", force: true }

   - If you have journaling enabled, your data will be safe even
     if you kill the operation or restart the server before it has
     finished. However, you may have to manually rebuild the indexes.
     Without journaling enabled, the :dbcommand:`compact` command is much less safe,
     and there are no guarantees made about the safety of your data in the
     event of a shutdown or a kill.

     .. warning::

        Always have an up-to-date backup before performing server
        maintenance such as the :dbcommand:`compact` operation.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` requires a small amount of additional diskspace while
     running but unlike :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` it does *not* free
     space equal to the total size of the collection.

   - the :dbcommand:`compact` command blocks until the operation is
     complete.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` removes any :term:`padding factor` in the collection,
     which may impact performance if documents grow regularly.

   - :dbcommand:`compact` commands do not replicate. They must be run on slaves
     and replica set members independently.

   - It is not possible to compact :term:`capped collections <capped
     collection>`.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: fsync

   :dbcommand:`fsync` is an administrative command that forces the
   :program:`mongod` process to flush all pending writes to the data
   files. The server already runs its own fsync every 60 seconds, so
   running :dbcommand:`fsync` in the course of normal operations is
   not required. The primary use of this command is to flush and
   lock the database for backups.

   The :dbcommand:`fsync` operation blocks all other write operations for a
   while it runs. To toggle a write-lock using :dbcommand:`fsync`, add a lock
   argument, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   This will sync the data files and lock the database against writes. Later,
   you must run the following query to unlock the database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").$cmd.sys.unlock.findOne();

   In the shell, you may use the following helpers to simplify
   the process:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncLock();
      db.fsyncUnlock();

   .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
      The :func:`db.fsyncLock()` and :func:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
      helpers in the shell.

.. dbcommand:: dropDatabase

   The :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` command drops a database, deleting
   the associated data files. :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` operates on the
   current database.

   In the shell issue the ``use <database>``
   command, replacing ``<database>`` with the name of the database
   you wish to delete. Then use the following command form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dropDatabase: 1 }

   The :program:`mongo` shell also provides the following equivalent helper method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.dropDatabase();

   .. write-lock

.. dbcommand:: dropIndexes

   The :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command drops one or all indexes from the current collection.
   To drop all indexes, issue the command like so:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dropIndexes: "collection", index: "*" }

   To drop a single, issue the command by specifying the name
   of the index you want to drop. For example, to drop the index
   named ``age_1``, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dropIndexes: "collection", index: "age_1" }

   The shell provides a useful command helper. Here's the equivalent command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.dropIndex("age_1");

.. dbcommand:: clone

   The :dbcommand:`clone` command clone a database from a
   remote MongoDB instance to the current host. :dbcommand:`clone` copies the
   database on the remote instance with the same name as the current
   database. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { clone: "db1.example.net:27017" }

   Replace ``db1.example.net:27017`` above with the resolvable hostname for the
   MongoDB instance you wish to copy from. Note the following
   behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`clone` can run against a :term:`slave` or a
     non-:term:`primary` member of a :term:`replica set`.

   - :dbcommand:`clone` does not snapshot the database. If the copied database
     is updated at any point during the clone operation, the resulting
     database may be inconsistent.

   - You must run :dbcommand:`clone` on the **destination server**.

   - The destination server is not locked for the duration of the
     :dbcommand:`clone` operation. This means that :dbcommand:`clone` will occasionally yield to
     allow other operations to complete.

   See :dbcommand:`copydb`  for similar functionality.

.. dbcommand:: repairDatabase

   The :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command checks and repairs errors and
   inconsistencies with the data storage. The command is analogous to
   a ``fsck`` command for file systems.

   If your :program:`mongod` instance is not running with journaling
   and you experience an unexpected system restart or crash, you
   should run the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command to ensure that
   there are no errors in the data storage.

   As a side effect, the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command will
   compact the database, providing functionality equivalent to the
   :dbcommand:`compact` command. Use the following syntax.

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { repairDatabase: 1 }

   Be aware that this command can take a long time to run if your
   database is large. In addition, it requires a quantity of free disk
   space equal to the size of your database. If you lack sufficient
   free space on the same volume, you can mount a separate volume and
   use that for the repair. In this case, you must run the command
   line and use the :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
   switch to specify the folder in which to store the temporary repair
   files.

   This command is accessible via a number of different avenues. You
   may:

   - Use the shell to run the above command, as above.

   - Run :program:`mongod` directly from your system's shell. Make sure
     that :program:`mongod` isn't already running, and that you issue
     this command as a user that has access to MongoDB's data
     files. Run as: ::

           $ mongod --repair

     To add a repair path: ::

           $ mongod --repair --repairpath /opt/vol2/data

     .. note::

        This command will fail if your database is not a master or
        primary. If you need to repair a secondary or slave node,
        first restart the node as a standalone mongod by omitting the
        :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` or :option:`--slave
        <mongod --slave>` options, as necessary.

   - You may use the following shell helper:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.repairDatabase();

   .. note::

      When using :term:`journaling <journal>`, there is almost never any need to
      run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`. In the event of an unclean
      shutdown, the server will be able restore the data files to a
      pristine state automatically.

.. dbcommand:: shutdown

   The :dbcommand:`shutdown` command cleans up all database resources
   and then terminates the process. The command has the following
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shutdown: 1 }

   .. note::

      Run the :dbcommand:`shutdown` against the admin database. When
      using :dbcommand:`shutdown`, the connection must originate from
      localhost **or** use an authenticated connection.

   If the node you're trying to shut down is a :doc:`replica set </core/replication>`
   primary, then the command will succeed only if there exists a secondary node
   whose oplog data is within 10 seconds of the primary. You can override this protection
   using the ``force`` option:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shutdown: 1, force: true }

   Alternatively, the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command also supports a ``timeoutSecs`` argument
   which allows you to specify a number of seconds to wait for other
   members of the replica set to catch up:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shutdown: 1, timeoutSecs: 60 }

   The equivalent :program:`mongo` shell helper syntax looks like this:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.shutdownServer({timeoutSecs: 60});

.. dbcommand:: copydb

   The :dbcommand:`copydb` command copies a database from a remote
   host to the current host. The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { copydb: 1:
        fromhost: <hostname>,
        fromdb: <db>,
        todb: <db>,
        slaveOk: <bool>,
        username: <username>,
        password: <password>,
        nonce: <nonce>,
        key: <key> }

   All of the following arguments are optional:

   - slaveOK
   - username
   - password
   - nonce
   - key

   Be aware of the following behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`copydb` can run against a :term:`slave` or a
     non-:term:`primary` member of a :term:`replica set`. In this case,
     you must set the ``slaveOk`` option to ``true``.

   - :dbcommand:`copydb` does not snapshot the database. If the state
     of the database changes at any point during the operation, the
     resulting daatbase may be inconsistent.

   - You must run :dbcommand:`copydb` on the **destination server**.

   - The destination server is not locked for the duration of the
     :dbcommand:`copydb` operation. This means that
     :dbcommand:`copydb` will occasionally yield to allow other
     operations to complete.

   - If the remote server has authentication enabled, then you must
     include a username and password. You must also include a nonce
     and a key. The nonce is a one-time password that you request from
     the remote server using the :dbcommand:`copydbgetnonce`
     command. The ``key`` is a hash generated as follows:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        hex_md5(nonce + username + hex_md5(username + ":mongo:" + pass))

     If you need to copy a database and authenticate, it's easiest to use the
     shell helper:

     .. code-block:: javascript

         db.copyDatabase(<remove_db_name>, <local_db_name>, <from_host_name>, <username>, <password>)

.. dbcommand:: logout

   The :dbcommand:`logout` command terminates the current
   authenticated session:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { logout: 1 }

   .. note::

      If you're not logged in and using authentication, this command will
      have no effect.

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` is an admin only command that allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too
   much disk space. Use the following syntax: ::

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   The rotated files will have a timestamp appended to the filneame.

   .. note::

     The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is not available to mongod instances
     running on windows systems.

.. dbcommand:: setParameter

   :dbcommand:`setParameter` is an administrative command for
   modifying options normally set on the command line. You must issue
   the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command must against the ``admin``
   database, and it has form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { setParameter: 1, <option>: <value> }

   Replace the ``<option>`` with one of the following options
   supported by this command:

   :option integer journalCommitInterval: Specify an integer between 1
                                          and 500 specifying the
                                          number of milliseconds (ms)
                                          between journal commits.

   :option integer logLevel: Specify an integer between ``0`` and
                             ``5`` signifying the verbosity of the
                             logging, where larger is more verbose.

   :option boolean notablescan: If ``true``, queries that do not
                                using an index will fail.

   :option boolean quiet: Enables a quiet logging mode when
                          ``true``. Use ``false`` to
                          disable. Quiet logging removes the following
                          messages from the log: connection events;
                          the :dbcommand:`drop`, :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`,
                          :dbcommand:`diagLogging`, :dbcommand:`validate`, and
                          :dbcommand:`clean`; and replication
                          synchronization activity.

   :option integer syncdelay: Specify the interval, in seconds,
                              between :term:`fsyncs <fsync>` (i.e.,
                              flushes of memory to disk). By default,
                              :program:`mongod` will flush memory to
                              disk every 60 seconds. Do not change
                              this value unless you see a background
                              flush average greater than 60 seconds.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

.. dbcommand:: getParameter

   :dbcommand:`getParameter` is an administrative command for
   retrieving the value of options normally set on the command
   line. Issue commands against the ``admin`` database as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { getParameter: 1, <option>: 1 }

   The values specified for ``getParameter`` and ``<option>`` do not
   affect the output. The command works with the following options:

   - **quiet**
   - **notablescan**
   - **logLevel**
   - **syncdelay**

   .. seealso:: :dbcommand:`setParameter` for more about ese parameters.

   .. slave-ok, admin-only

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: dbStats

   The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command returns storage statistics for a
   given database. The command takes the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dbStats: 1, scale: 1 }

   The value of the argument (e.g. ``1`` above) to ``dbStats`` does
   not affect the output of the command. The ``scale`` option allows
   you to specify how to scale byte values. For example, a ``scale``
   value of ``1024`` will display the results in kilobytes rather
   than in bytes.

   The time required to run the command depends on the total size of the database.
   Because the command has to touch all data files, the command may take several
   seconds to run.

   In the :program:`mongo` shell, the :func:`db.stats()` function provides
   a wrapper around this functionality. See the
   ":doc:`/reference/database-statistics`" document for an overview of
   this output.

.. dbcommand:: connPoolStats

   The command :dbcommand:`connPoolStats` returns information
   regarding the number of open connections to the current database
   instance, including client connections and server-to-server
   connections for replication and clustering. The command takes the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { connPoolStats: 1 }

   The value of the argument (e.g. ``1`` above) does not affect the
   output of the command.

.. dbcommand:: getCmdLineOpts

   The :dbcommand:`getCmdLineOpts` command returns a document containing
   command line options used to start the given :program:`mongod`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { getCmdLineOpts: 1 }

   This command returns a document with two fields, ``argv`` and
   ``parsed``. The ``argv`` field contains an array with each item
   from the command string used to invoke :program:`mongod`. The document
   in the ``parsed`` field includes all runtime options, including
   those parsed from the command line and those specified in the
   configuration file (if specified.)

.. dbcommand:: validate

   The ``validate`` command checks the contents of a namespace by
   scanning a collection's data and indexes for correctness. The command
   can be slow, particularly on larger data sets:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { validate: "users" }

   This command will validate the contents of the collection named
   ``users``. You may also specify one of the following
   options:

   - ``full: true`` provides a more thorough scan of the data.

   - ``scandata: false`` skips the scan of the base collection
     without skipping the scan of the index.

   The :program:`mongo` shell also provides a wrapper:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.validate();

   Use one of the following forms to perform the full collection
   validation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.validate(true)
      db.runCommand( { validate: "collection", full: true } )

   .. warning:: This command is resource intensive and may have an
      impact on the performance of your MongoDB instance.

.. dbcommand:: top

   The :dbcommand:`top` command returns raw usage of each database,
   and provides amount of time, in microseconds, used and a count of
   operations for the following event types:

   - total
   - readLock
   - writeLock
   - queries
   - getmore
   - insert
   - update
   - remove
   - commands

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { top: 1 }

.. dbcommand:: buildInfo

   The :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command returns a build summary for the current
   :program:`mongod`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { buildInfo: 1 }

    The information provided includes the following:

   - The version of MongoDB currently running.
   - The information about the system that built the
     ":program:`mongod`" binary, including a timestamp for the build.
   - The architecture of the binary (i.e. 64 or 32 bits)
   - The maximum allowable :term:`BSON` object size in bytes (in the field
     ``maxBsonObjectSize``.)

   You must issue the :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command against the ``admin`` database.

.. dbcommand:: getLastError

   The :dbcommand:`getLastError` command returns the error status of
   the last operation on the *current connection*. By default MongoDB
   does not provide a response to confirm the success or failure of a
   write operation, clients typically use :dbcommand:`getLastError` in
   combination with write operations to ensure that the write
   succeeds.

   Consider the following prototype form.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { getLastError: 1 }

   The following options are available:

   :option boolean j: If ``true``, wait for the next journal commit
                      before returning, rather than a full disk
                      flush. If :program:`mongod` does not have
                      journaling enabled, this option has no effect.

   :option w: When running with replication, this is the number of
              servers to replica to before returning. A ``w`` value of
              1 indicates the primary only.  A ``w`` value of 2
              includes the primary and at least one secondary, etc.
              In place of a number, you may also set ``w`` to
              ``majority`` to indicate that the command should wait
              until the latest write propagates to a majority of
              replica set members. If using ``w``, you should also use
              ``wtimeout``. Specifying a value for ``w`` without also
              providing a ``wtimeout`` may cause
              :dbcommand:`getLastError` to block indefinitely.

   :option integer wtimeout: (Milliseconds; Optional.) Specify a value
                             in milliseconds to control how long the
                             to wait for write propagation to
                             complete. If replication does not
                             complete in the given timeframe, the
                             :dbcommand:`getLastError` command will
                             return with an error status.

   .. seealso:: ":ref:`Replica Set Write Concern <replica-set-write-concern>`"
      and ":func:`db.getLastError()`."

.. dbcommand:: getLog

   The :dbcommand:`getLog` command returns a document with a ``log``
   array that contains recent messages from the :program:`mongod`
   process's log. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { getLog: <log> }

   Replace ``<log>`` with one of the following values:

   - ``startupWarnings`` - to generate logs that *may* contain
     errors or warnings from MongoDB's log from the when the current
     process started.

   - ``global`` - to generate the most recent log events from the
     database. This is equivalent to running the ``tail`` command on
     the :program:`mongod` log in the system shell.

.. dbcommand:: listDatabases

   The :dbcommand:`listDatabases` command provides a list of existing
   databases along with basic statistics about them:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { listDatabases: 1 }

   The value (e.g. ``1``) does not effect the output of the
   command. :dbcommand:`listDatabases` returns a document for each database
   Each document contains a ``name`` field
   with the database name, a ``sizeOnDisk`` field with the total
   size of hte database file on disk in bytes, and an ``empty``
   field specifying whether the database has any data.

.. dbcommand:: cursorInfo

   The :dbcommand:`cursorInfo` command returns information about current cursor
   allotment and use. Use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { cursorInfo: 1 }

   The value (e.g. ``1`` above,) does not effect the output of the
   command.

   :dbcommand:`cursorInfo` returns the total number of open cursors
   (``totalOpen``,) the size of client cursors in current use
   (``clientCursors_size``,) and the number of timed out cursors
   since the last server restart (``timedOut``.)

.. dbcommand:: isMaster

   The :dbcommand:`isMaster` command provides a basic overview of the current
   replication configuration. MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` and
   :term:`clients <client>` use this command to determine what kind of
   node they're connected to and to discover additional members of a
   :term:`replica set`.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { isMaster: 1 }

   This command returns a :term:`document` containing the
   following fields:

   .. data:: isMaster.setname

      The name of the current replica set, if applicable.

   .. data:: isMaster.ismaster

      A boolean value that reports when this node is writable. If
      ``true``, then the current node is either a :term:`primary`
      node in a :term:`replica set`, a :term:`master` node in a
      master-slave configuration, of a standalone :program:`mongod`.

   .. data:: isMaster.secondary

      A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the
      current node is a :term:`secondary` member of a :term:`replica
      set`.

   .. data:: isMaster.hosts

      An array of strings in the format of "[hostname]:[port]" listing
      all nodes in the :term:`replica set` that are not ":term:`hidden
      <hidden member>`".

   .. data:: isMaster.primary

      The ``[hostname]:[port]`` for the current
      :term:`replica set` :term:`primary`, if applicable.

   .. data:: isMaster.me

      The ``[hostname]:[port]`` of the node responding to this
      command.

   .. data:: isMaster.maxBsonObjectSize

      The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` object in bytes for
      this :program:`mongod` process. If not provided, clients should
      assume a max size of "4 * 1024 * 1024."

   .. data:: isMaster.localTime

      .. versionadded:: 2.1.1

      Returns the local server time for the current system.

.. dbcommand:: ping

   The :dbcommand:`ping` command is a no-op used to test whether a
   server is responding to commands. This command will return
   immediately even if the server is write-locked:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { ping: 1 }

   The value (e.g. ``1`` above,) does not impact the behavior of the
   command.

.. dbcommand:: journalLatencyTest

   :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest` is an admin command that tests the
   length of time required to write and perform a file system sync
   (e.g. :term:`fsync`) for a file in the journal directory. The
   command syntax is:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { journalLatencyTest: 1 }

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above), does not affect the operation of the
   command.

.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database process's state. Most
   monitoring applications run this command at a regular interval to
   collection statistics about the instance:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { serverStatus: 1 }

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above), does not affect the operation of the
   command.

   .. seealso:: :func:`db.serverStatus()` and ":doc:`/reference/server-status`"

.. dbcommand:: resetError

   The :dbcommand:`resetError` command resets the last error status.

   .. seealso:: :func:`db.resetError()`

.. dbcommand:: getPrevError

   The :dbcommand:`getPrevError` command returns the errors since the
   last :dbcommand:`resetError` command.

   .. seealso:: :func:`db.getPrevError()`

.. dbcommand:: forceerror

   The :dbcommand:`forceerror` command is for testing purposes
   only. Use :dbcommand`forceerror` to force a user assertion
   exception. This command always returns an ``ok`` value of 0.

.. dbcommand:: profile

   Use the :dbcommand:`profile` command to enable, disable, or change
   the query profiling level. This allows administrators to capture
   data regarding performance. The database profiling system can
   impact performance and can allow the server to write the contents
   of queries to the log, which might information security
   implications for your deployment. Consider the following prototype
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { profile: <level> }

   The following profiling levels are available:

   =========  ==================================
   **Level**  **Setting**
   ---------  ----------------------------------
      0       Off. No profiling.
      1       On. Only includes slow operations.
      2       On. Includes all operations.
   =========  ==================================

   You may optionally set a threshhold in milliseconds for profiling using
   the ``slowms`` option, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { profile: 1, slowms: 200 }


   :program:`mongod` writes the output of the database profiler to the
   ``system.profile`` collection.

   :program:`mongod` records a record of queries that take longer than
   the :setting:`slowms` to the log even when the database profiler is
   not active.

   .. seealso:: Additional documentation regarding database profiling
                :ref:`Database Profiling <database-profiling>`.

   .. seealso:: ":func:`db.getProfilingStatus()`" and
                ":func:`db.setProfilingLevel()`" provide wrappers
                around this functionality in the :program:`mongo`
                shell.

.. dbcommand:: listCommands

   The :dbcommand:`listCommands` command generates a list of all
   database commands implemented for the current :program:`mongod`
   instance.

   .. slave-ok

Other Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. dbcommand:: reIndex

   The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command rebuilds all indexes for a
   specified collection. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { reIndex: "collection" }

   Normally, MongoDB compacts indexes during routine updates. For most
   users, the :dbcommand:`reIndex` is unnecessary. However, it may be worth
   running if the collection size has changed significantly or if the
   indexes are consuming a disproportionate amount of disk space.

   Note that the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command will block the server against
   writes and may take a long time for large collections.

   Call :dbcommand:`reIndex` using the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.reIndex();

.. dbcommand:: filemd5

   The :dbcommand:`filemd5` command returns the :term:`md5` hashes for a single
   files stored using the :term:`GridFS` specification. Client libraries
   use this command to verify that files are correctly written to MongoDB.
   The command takes the ``files_id`` of the file in question and the
   name of the GridFS root collection as arguments. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { filemd5: ObjectId("4f1f10e37671b50e4ecd2776"), root: "fs" }

:program:`mongos` Commands
--------------------------

.. dbcommand:: flushRouterConfig

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` clears the current cluster
   information cached by a :program:`mongos` instance and reloads all
   :term:`shard cluster` metadata from the configuration database.

   This force an update when the configuration database holds data
   that is newer that the data cached in the :program:`mongos`
   process.

   .. warning:: Do not modify the configuration database, except as
      explicitly documented. Configuration database cannot typically
      tolerate manipulation.

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is an administrative command that is
   only available for :program:`mongos` instances.

.. dbcommand:: isdbGrid

   Use this command to determine if the process is a :program:`mongos`
   or a :program:`mongod`. Consider the following command prototype:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { isdbGrid: 1 }

   If connected to a :program:`mongos`, the response document
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "isdbgrid" : 1, "hostname" : "arendt.tychoish.net", "ok" : 1 }

   You can also use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command, which when
   connected to a :program:`mongos`, contains the string
   ``isdbgrid`` in the ``msg`` field of its output document.

.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   .. warning:: Only use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` in an offline
      system, and only when you need to remove a :term:`shard` from a
      cluster.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` changes the primary shard for this
   database. The primary shard holds all un-sharded collections in a
   database.

   .. note::

      Exercise care when using :dbcommand:`movePrimary` in a
      system that already holds data. You must drain this shard before
      running this command because it will move all collections in
      the database.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command that is
   only available for :program:`mongos` instances.

.. dbcommand:: split

   The :dbcommand:`split` command creates new :term:`chunks <chunk>`
   in a :term:`sharded <sharding>` environment. While splitting is
   typically managed automatically by the :program:`mongos` instances,
   this command makes it possible for administrators to manually
   create splits.

   .. note::

      In normal operation there is no need to manually split chunks.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , find : { _id : 99 } } )

   This command inserts a new split in the collection named
   ``people`` in the ``test`` database. This will split the chunk
   that contains the document that matches the query ``{ _id : 99
   }`` in half. If the document specified by the query does not (yet)
   exist, the :dbcommand:`split` will divide the chunk where that
   document *would* exist.

   The split divides the chunk in half, and does *not* split the chunk
   using the identified document as the middle. To define an arbitrary split
   point, use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , middle : { _id : 99 } } )

   This form is typically used when :term:`pre-splitting` data in a
   collection.

   :dbcommand:`split` is an administrative command that is only
   available for :program:`mongos` instances.

   The above command places the :program:`mongod` instance in a
   "write-lock" state for a specified (i.e. ``<seconds>``) number of
   seconds. Without arguments, :dbcommand:`sleep`, causes a "read
   lock" for 100 seconds.
