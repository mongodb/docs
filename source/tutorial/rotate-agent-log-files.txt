======================
Rotate Agent Log Files
======================

.. default-domain:: mms

Overview
--------

During normal operation, the Monitoring Agent and Backup Agent report a live
account of all activity and operations to a log file. When a log file reaches a
user-specified limit, the system must replace or rotate the log file.

On Linux systems, the ``logrotate`` command automatically copies,
renames, compresses, and removes older archived log files.

For programs that do not have an interface to close the log file, use
``copytruncate`` command to rotate log files without stopping the process.
For MMS, this allows you to rotate log files without restarting the backup
and Monitoring Agents.

Log Rotation With ``logrotate``
-------------------------------

``logrotate`` is available on most Linux systems. Check the
:file:`logrotate.conf` configuration file exists in the ``/etc`` folder or install
the ``logrotate`` package.

Configure the behavior of the ``logrotate`` command in the
:file:`logrotate.conf` configuration file. Open this file then add entries and
directives for the monitoring and Backup Agent log files.

The :file:`logrotate.conf` file includes a set of directives in a structured
format, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   #sample configuration file
   compress

   <backup agent log file path> {
       size 10M
       copytruncate
   }

   <monitoring agent log file path> {
       daily
       copytruncate
   }

In this example, the entries and directives in the :file:`logrotate.conf`
configuration file will rotate the Backup Agent log file once it exceeds 10MB
in size and compress the old file using gzip (default). ``logrotate``
rotates the log files for the Monitoring Agent
daily and compresses previous log files with ``gzip``. The ``copytruncate``
directive ensures permits log rotation without restarting the agent
process.

Common logrotate Configuration Directives
-----------------------------------------

See the :ref:`logrotate-additional-information` section below for
links to complete documentation of ``logrotate``.

``compress``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets a :ref:`global option <logrotate-global-option>` to compress log
files after rotating each file. Place ``compress`` within directive
blocks if only some log files require compression.

``<backup agent log file path>`` or ``<monitoring agent log file path>``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sets commands specific to the Backup Agent or Monitoring Agent log
file. You set the name and location of the agent log files when you
installed the agents. The default log file path with agents installed
from the ``.rpm`` and ``.deb`` packages is
``/var/log/mongodb-mms/monitoring-agent.log`` or
``/var/log/mongodb-mms/backup-agent.log``. For agents installed from
``.tar.gz`` archives the default log files are at
``/log/mms-agent/monitoring-agent.log`` and
``/log/mms-agent/backup-agent.log``.

``size``
~~~~~~~~

Rotates the log file once it exceeds 10 megabytes in size. The file size is
configurable.

``copytruncate``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rotates the log file without shutting down the agent software. This directive
copies the contents of the current log file to a new archive file then deletes
the contents of the current log file. The process adds new log
messages to the, now empty, log file. Use this directive to rotate
logs file without restarting the Backup and Monitoring Agents.

When using ``copytruncate`` the ``create`` option has no
effect because the old log file stays in place. There also is a small time
window between copying the log file and emptying it. In this mode,
``logrotate`` may lose some logging
information.

``daily``, ``weekly``, ``monthly``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you must rotate logs every day, week, or month, then use the
``daily``, ``weekly``, ``monthly`` directives and remove the ``size``
directive. ``size`` is not compatible with frequency-based log
rotation.

.. _logrotate-global-option:

Global and Local Scope for Configuration Directives
---------------------------------------------------

Configuration directives have either a global scope or local scope.

In the example above, ``compress`` is a global configuration directive and
``size`` and ``copytruncate`` local directives. Place global
directives at the top of the :file:`logrotate.conf` file and apply to
all log files defined within the file. Local directives appear only in
a specific log file definition in the :file:`logrotate.conf`
file. Local configuration directives have no effect on other log files.
