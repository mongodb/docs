  a. Create a new directory called ``simple-query-example`` and
     initialize your project with the ``dotnet new`` command.

     .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir simple-query-example
        cd simple-query-example
        dotnet new console

  #. Add the .NET/C# Driver to your project as a dependency.

     .. code-block:: bash

        dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver

  #. Replace the contents of the the ``Program.cs``  file with the
     following code.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Searches for the word ``baseball`` in
       the ``plot`` field. It includes a: 
       
       - :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage 
         to limit the output to 5 results 
       - :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
         stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``plot``

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
