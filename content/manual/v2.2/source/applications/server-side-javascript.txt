MongoDB supports server-side execution of JavaScript code within the
database process.

.. note::

   The JavaScript code execution takes a JavaScript lock: each
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` can only execute a single JavaScript operation at
   a time.

.. _server-side-map-reduce:

Map-Reduce
----------

MongoDB performs the execution of JavaScript functions for
:doc:`/applications/map-reduce` operations on the server. Within these
JavaScript functions, you must not access the database for any reason,
including to perform reads.

See the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` and the
:doc:`/applications/map-reduce` documentation for more information,
including examples of map-reduce. See :ref:`map-reduce concurrency
<map-reduce-concurrency>` section for concurrency information for
map-reduce.

.. _server-side-eval:

``eval`` Command
----------------

The :dbcommand:`eval` command, and the corresponding :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell method :method:`db.eval()`, evaluates JavaScript functions on the
database server. This command may be useful if you need to touch a lot
of data lightly since the network transfer of the data could become a
bottleneck if performing these operations on the client-side.

.. warning::

   By default, :dbcommand:`eval` command requires a write lock. As
   such :dbcommand:`eval` will block all other read and write
   operations while it runs. Because only a single JavaScript process
   can run at a time, *do not* run :dbcommand:`mapReduce`,
   :dbcommand:`group`, queries with the :query:`$where` or any
   other operation that requires JavaScript execution within
   :dbcommand:`eval` operations.

See :dbcommand:`eval` command and :method:`db.eval()` documentation for
more information, including examples.

.. _running-js-scripts-in-mongo-on-mongod-host:

Running ``.js`` files via a ``mongo`` shell Instance on the Server
------------------------------------------------------------------

Running a JavaScript (``.js``) file using a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
instance on the server is a good technique for performing batch
administrative work. When you run :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell on the
server, connecting via the localhost interface, the connection is fast
with low latency.  Additionally, this technique has the advantage over
the :dbcommand:`eval` command since the command :dbcommand:`eval`
blocks all other operations.

.. _server-side-where:

``$where`` Operator
-------------------

To perform :doc:`/core/read-operations`, in addition to the standard
operators (e.g. :query:`$gt`, :query:`$lt`), with the
:query:`$where` operator, you can also express the query condition
either as a string or a full JavaScript function that specifies a
SQL-like ``WHERE`` clause. However, use the standard operators whenever
possible since :query:`$where` operations have significantly slower
performance.

.. warning::

   Do not write to the database within the :query:`$where`
   JavaScript function.

See :query:`$where` documentation for more information, including
examples.

.. _storing-server-side-javascript:

Storing Functions Server-side
-----------------------------

.. note::

   We do **not** recommend using server-side stored functions if
   possible.

There is a special system collection named ``system.js`` that can store
JavaScript functions for reuse.

To store a function, you can use the :method:`db.collection.save()`, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.js.save(
      {
        _id : "myAddFunction" ,
        value : function (x, y){ return x + y; }
      }
   );

- The ``_id`` field holds the name of the function and is unique per
  database.

- The ``value`` field holds the function definition

Once you save a function in the ``system.js`` collection, you can use
the function from any JavaScript context (e.g. :ref:`eval
<server-side-eval>`, :ref:`$where <server-side-where>`,
:ref:`map-reduce <server-side-map-reduce>`).

Consider the following example from the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell that
first saves a function named ``echoFunction`` to the ``system.js``
collection and calls the function using :ref:`db.eval()
<server-side-eval>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.js.save(
                      { _id: "echoFunction",
                        value : function(x) { return x; }
                      }
                    )

   db.eval( "echoFunction( 'test' )" )

See `<http://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/jstests/storefunc.js>`_ for a full example.

.. versionadded:: 2.1
   In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can use
   :method:`db.loadServerScripts()` to load all the scripts saved in
   the ``system.js`` collection for the current db. Once loaded, you
   can invoke the functions directly in the shell, as in the following
   example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.loadServerScripts();

   echoFunction(3);

   myAddFunction(3, 5);

Concurrency
-----------

Refer to the individual method or operator documentation for any
concurrency information. See also the :ref:`concurrency table
<faq-concurrency-operations-locks>`.
