You can use the |mms| UI to interact with data in the following ways:

- View databases, collections, and indexes in your cluster.

- Create and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

- Insert/edit/delete documents.

- Create and run aggregation pipelines to process your data.

|mms| UI Read Behavior
------------------------------

The |mms| UI reads from the primary unless the primary is
unavailable. If the primary is unavailable, the |mms| UI
reads from a non-hidden, non-delayed secondary member.

The |mms| UI uses the {+aagent+} to retrieve all data. No |mms|
configuration changes are required to access data in the |mms| UI.
