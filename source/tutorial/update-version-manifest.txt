You can use Automation to install and update MongoDB instances in your
deployment. You need to give |onprem| a list of which versions can be
installed. The complete list of all possible MongoDB versions is called
the :term:`version manifest`.

When your |onprem| installation is connected to the internet, the 
:term:`version manifest` is updated automatically from MongoDB, Inc. 
If you configure |onprem| to 
:doc:`not use the internet </tutorial/configure-local-mode>`, you need 
to update the version manifest manually.

Follow this procedure to download and install the version manifest to 
your |onprem| installation.
