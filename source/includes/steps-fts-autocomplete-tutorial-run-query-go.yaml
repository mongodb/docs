title: "Run an |fts| query with the ``autocomplete`` operator on the ``movies`` collection."
content: |

  a. Create a file named ``autocomplete-query.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the 
     ``autocomplete-query.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:
      
     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following autocomplete clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-autocomplete-constant-desc.rst 
       
       The query uses the following pipeline stages:

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-autocomplete-stages.rst 
     
     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
        
     .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts-tutorial/autocomplete/tutorial.go
        :language: go
        :linenos:
        :dedent:

  #. .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the following command to query your collection: 
  
     .. code-block:: sh 

        go run autocomplete-query.go

  When you run ``autocomplete-query.go``, the program prints 
  the following documents to your terminal:

  .. code-block:: none 
     :copyable: false 
     :linenos:
