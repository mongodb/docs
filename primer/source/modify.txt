MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.update()` method to update
documents of a single collection and the
:method:`db.collection.remove()` method to remove documents from a
single collection.

In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
document. If a single update operation modifies multiple documents of a
collection or if a single remove operation removes multiple documents
from a collection, the operation can interleave with other write
operations on that collection.
