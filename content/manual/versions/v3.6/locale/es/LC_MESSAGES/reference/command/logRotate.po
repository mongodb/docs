"The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that "
"allows you to rotate the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from "
"consuming too much disk space."

"You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the "
":binary:`~bin.mongod` process. If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has a "

#: ../source/reference/command/logRotate.txt:50

msgid ""
"When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod "
"--logRotate>` are set to ``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` follows the "
"typical Linux/Unix behavior, and simply closes the log file, and then "
"reopens a log file with the same name. With ``reopen``, "
":binary:`~bin.mongod` expects that another process renames the file prior"
" to the rotation, and that the reopen results in the creation of a new "
"file."
