offer major version upgrade support to help ensure a smooth transition
without interruption to your MongoDB application.

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Version Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to |newversion|, you must be
running a |oldseries| release.

To upgrade from a version earlier than the |oldseries|, you must
successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to
|oldseries|. For example, if you are running a |olderseries|, you must
|upgradefirst| *before* you can upgrade to |newversion|.

Check Driver Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you upgrade MongoDB, check that you're using a MongoDB 
|newversion|-compatible driver. Consult the :driver:`driver documentation
</>` for your specific driver to verify 
compatibility with MongoDB |newversion|. 

Upgraded deployments that run on incompatible drivers might encounter 
unexpected or undefined behavior.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before beginning your upgrade, see the |compatibility| document to
ensure that your applications and deployments are compatible with
MongoDB |newversion|. Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment 
before starting the upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.

Downgrade Consideration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot downgrade your deployment's binary version without assistance from 
support.

To learn more, see :ref:`8.0-downgrade`.
