|service| provides an option to deploy one Free Tier replica set per group.
Free Tier clusters use |service| ``M0`` instances and are an ideal development
sandbox, providing access to a subset of |service| features and functionality.
Paid clusters use |service| ``M10+`` instances and provide full access to

|service| :ref:`group <create-group>` can have multiple ``M10+`` MongoDB
clusters.
