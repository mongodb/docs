db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Performs a preliminary check for upgrade preparedness to 2.6. The
   helper, available in the 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell, can run
   connected to either a 2.4 or a 2.6 server in the ``admin`` database.

   The method cycles through all the databases and checks for:

   - documents with index keys :ref:`longer than the index key limit
     <2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility>`,

   - documents with :limit:`illegal field names
     <Restrictions on Field Names>`,

   - collections without an ``_id`` index, and

   - indexes with invalid specifications, such as an index key with an
     empty or illegal field name.

   Additional 2.6 changes that affect compatibility with older versions
   require manual checks and intervention. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for details.

Behavior

.. |method| replace:: :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()`

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgradeCheck-behavior.rst

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, a user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`listDatabases` action on all databases and
the :authaction:`find` action on all collections, including the
:doc:`system collections </reference/system-collections>`.

Example
-------

The following example connects to a secondary running on ``localhost``
and runs :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()` against the ``admin``
database. Because the output from the method can be quite large, the
example pipes the output to a file.

.. code-block:: sh

   ./mongo --eval "db.getMongo().setSlaveOk(); db.upgradeCheckAllDBs();" localhost/admin | tee /tmp/upgradecheckalldbs.txt
