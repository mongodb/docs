This tutorial describes how to limit the text search to scan only those
documents with a field value.

The :dbcommand:`text` command includes the ``filter`` option to further
restrict the results of a text search. For a ``filter`` that specifies
equality conditions, this tutorial demonstrates how to perform text
searches on only those documents that match the ``filter`` conditions,
as opposed to performing a text search first on all the documents and
then matching on the ``filter`` condition.

Consider a collection ``inventory`` that contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, dept: "tech", description: "a fun green computer" }
   { _id: 2, dept: "tech", description: "a wireless red mouse" }
   { _id: 3, dept: "kitchen", description: "a green placemat" }
   { _id: 4, dept: "kitchen", description: "a red peeler" }
   { _id: 5, dept: "food", description: "a green apple" }
   { _id: 6, dept: "food", description: "a red potato" }

A common use case is to perform text searches by individual
departments, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.runCommand( "text", {
                                      search: "green",
                                      filter: { dept : "kitchen" }
                                    }
                          )

To limit the text search to scan only those documents within a specific
``dept``, create a compound index that specifies an
ascending/descending index key on the field ``dept`` and a ``text``
index key on the field ``description``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.ensureIndex(
                             {
                               dept: 1,
                               description: "text"
                             }
                           )

.. important:: 

   - The ascending/descending index keys must be listed before, or
     prefix, the ``text`` index keys. 

   - By prefixing the ``text`` index fields with ascending/descending
     index fields, MongoDB will **only** index documents that have the
     prefix fields.

   - You cannot include :ref:`multi-key <index-type-multi-key>` index
     fields or :ref:`geospatial <index-feature-geospatial>` index
     fields.

   - The :dbcommand:`text` command **must** include the ``filter``
     option that specifies an **equality** condition for the prefix
     fields.

Then, the text search within a particular department will limit the
scan of indexed documents. For example, the following :dbcommand:`text`
command scans only those documents with ``dept`` equal to ``kitchen``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.runCommand( "text", {
                                      search: "green",
                                      filter: { dept : "kitchen" }
                                    }
                          )

The returned result includes the statistics that shows that the command
scanned 1 document, as indicated by the ``nscanned`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {

     "queryDebugString" : "green||||||",
     "language" : "english",
     "results" : [
                   {
                     "score" : 0.75,
                     "obj" : {
                               "_id" : 3,
                               "dept" : "kitchen",
                               "description" : "a green placemat"
                             }
                   }
                 ],
     "stats" : {
                 "nscanned" : 1,
                 "nscannedObjects" : 0,
                 "n" : 1,
                 "nfound" : 1,
                 "timeMicros" : 211
               },
     "ok" : 1
   }
