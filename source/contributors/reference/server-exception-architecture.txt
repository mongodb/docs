MongoDB code uses the following types of assertions that are available
for use:

- ``uassert`` 
     Checks for per-operation user errors. Operation-fatal.
- ``massert`` 
     Checks per-operation invariants. Operation-fatal.  Usage of this is rare.  You probably want uassert or fassert.
- ``fassert`` 
     Checks fatal process invariants. Process-fatal.  Use to detect unexpected situations (such as
     a system function returning an unexpected error status).  Typically, use severe() to output an explanatory message first.
- ``invariant``
     Checks process invariant.  Process-fatal.  Use to detect code logic errors 
     ("pointer should never be null", "we should always be locked")

.. note::

   Calling C function ``assert`` is not allowed. Use one of the above instead.

The following assertion types are *deprecated* for use and listed only
for completeness:

- ``dassert``
     Calls ``verify`` but only in debug mode. Do not use!
- ``verify`` [deprecated]
     Checks per-operation invariants. A synonym for ``massert`` but
     doesn't require an error code.  Do not use for new code; use invariant or fassert instead.

Considerations
--------------

When per-operation invariant checks fail, the current operation fails,
but the process and connection persist. This means that ``massert``,
``uassert`` and ``verify`` only terminate the current operation, not
the whole process. Be careful not to corrupt process state by
mistakenly using these assertions midway through mutating process
state. Examples of this include ``uassert`` and ``massert`` inside of
constructors and destructors.

``fassert`` failures will terminate the entire process; this is used
for low-level checks where continuing might lead to corrupt data or
loss of data on disk.

Both ``massert`` and ``uassert`` take error codes, so that all errors
have codes associated with them. These error codes
are assigned incrementally; the numbers have no meaning other than a
way to associate a log message with a line of code. SCons checks for
duplicates, but if you want the next available code you can run:

.. code-block:: sh

   python buildscripts/errorcodes.py

Exception
---------

A failed operation-fatal assertion throws an ``AssertionException`` or
a child of that. The inheritance hierarchy resembles:

- ``std::exception``

  - ``mongo::DBException``

    - ``mongo::AssertionException``

      - ``mongo::UserException``

      - ``mongo::MsgAssertionException``

See :file:`util/assert_util.h`.

Generally, code in the server should be prepared to catch a
``DBException``. The code should also expect
``UserException``. We use `Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization`_ heavily.

Gotchas
-------

Gotchas to watch out for:

- Generally, do not throw an ``AssertionException`` directly. Functions
  like ``uasserted()`` do work beyond just that. In particular,
  it makes sure that the ``getLastError`` structures are set up properly.
- Think about the location of your asserts in constructors, as the destructor
  would not be called. But at a minimum, use ``wassert`` a lot therein,
  we want to know if something is wrong.
- Do **not** throw in destructors or allow exceptions to leak out (if you call a function that may throw).
