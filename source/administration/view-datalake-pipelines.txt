View {+adl+} Pipelines 
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can view all of your {+dl+} pipelines and view the details of a specified 
{+dl+} Pipeline in your project through the |service| |ui|, {+dl+} Pipelines |api|, 
and the {+atlas-cli+}. You can also retrieve all of your completed {+dl+} pipeline 
data ingestion jobs from the |api| and the {+atlas-cli+}.

      To retrieve all your {+dl+} pipelines for a project through the |api|, 
      send a ``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} 
      </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``pipelines`` endpoint. To learn more about 
      the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax and parameters for retrieving all of 
      your {+dl+} pipelines, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return All Data Lake 
      Pipelines from One Project </listPipelines>`.

      To retrieve one of your {+dl+} pipelines through the |api|, send a 
      ``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` 
      ``pipelines`` endpoint with the name of the {+dl+} pipeline that you 
      want to retrieve. To learn more about the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax 
      and parameters for retrieving one of your {+dl+} pipelines, see 
      :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Data Lake Pipeline 
      </getPipeline>`.

      View {+adl+} Pipeline Runs
      `````````````````````````````````````````````````````

      To retrieve all the completed {+dl+} pipeline data ingestion jobs for a 
      project through the |api|, send a ``GET`` request to the 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``runs`` endpoint. To 
      learn more about the |api| syntax and options for the ``runs`` 
      endpoint, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return All Data Lake Pipeline Runs from 
      One Project </listPipelineRuns>`.

      To retrieve the details of one of your completed {+dl+} pipeline data 
      ingestion jobs through the |api|, send a ``GET`` request to the 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``runs`` endpoint with 
      the unique identifier of the completed {+dl+} pipeline data ingestion 
      job that you want to retrieve. To learn more about the |api| syntax and 
      options for the ``runs`` endpoint, see :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Data

        .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

        .. include:: /includes/atlas-nav/steps-data-lake.rst

        .. step::  View {+dl+} pipelines.

            The page displays all the {+dl+} pipelines in the project. For 
            each {+dl+} pipeline, the service also displays the following 
            information: 

            .. list-table:: 
              :widths: 20 80 
              :header-rows: 1

              * - Column Name 
                - Description 

              * - Pipeline Name
                - Name of your {+dl+} pipeline. Each pipeline can produce 
                  multiple datasets. You can expand the name to view the 
                  datasets in the pipeline.

              * - Data Source
                - Source for the data in the pipeline datasets. For data 
                  from a collection on the |service| cluster, this column 
                  shows the cluster name, the database name, and the 
                  collection name separated by ``|``.
                
              * - Data Size
                - Size of data for each dataset.
                
              * - :guilabel:`Last Run Time`
                - Date and time when the pipeline ran to ingest data for 
                  each dataset.
                
              * - :guilabel:`Status`
                - Status of the pipeline. Value can be one of the following 
                  for a pipeline: 

                  - ``Active`` - indicates that the pipeline is active
                  - ``Paused`` - indicates that data ingestion for the 
                    pipeline is paused
                
              * - :guilabel:`Frequency`
                - Frequency at which cluster data is ingested and stored 
                  for querying.
                
              * - :guilabel:`Actions`
                - Actions you can take for each pipeline. You can click 
                  one of the following: 

                  - :guilabel:`||` to pause data ingestion and 
                    :icon-fa5:`arrow-right` to resume data ingestion. You 
                    can't pause on-demand ingestion of data.
                  - :icon-fa4:`pencil` to edit the data ingestion schedule for 
                    the pipeline. 
                  - :icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v` to do the following:
                  
                    - Delete a pipeline. You can't undo this action. If you 
                      delete a pipeline, {+adl+} deletes the datasets, 
                      including the data, and removes the datasets from the 
                      {+fdi+}\s where they are referenced. If you delete a 
                      dataset inside a pipeline, {+adl+} removes the dataset 
                      from the {+fdi+} storage configuration where the 
                      dataset is referenced.
