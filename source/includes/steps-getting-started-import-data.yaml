  Go to the :guilabel:`Clusters` view. Click the :guilabel:`Connect`
  button for the Free Tier cluster you created for this procedure.
  
  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog provides instructions for configuring the
  :ref:`group whitelist <whitelist>` to allow access to your cluster, as well
  as providing the :manual:`URI connection string
  </reference/connection-string>` for connecting to the cluster.

  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`group's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the group whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` dialog under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of your client on the list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address. 
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
    
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| group being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.

  From the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog:
  
  #. Click :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.
  #. Copy the :guilabel:`URI Connection String`.
  #. Paste the URI connection string into a text editor.
  #. Replace the ``<PASSWORD>`` with the password for the MongoDB user.
  #. Replace ``<DATABASE>`` with ``guidebook``.
  #. Copy the updated URI connection string.

  :program:`mongoimport <bin.mongoimport>` 3.4.7 adds support for a MongoDB
  :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>` via the
  ``--uri`` option. Go to the `MongoDB Download Center
  <http://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs>`_ to download MongoDB
  Server 3.4.7 or later. The server package includes :program:`mongoimport
  <bin.mongoimport>`. For :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` and :abbr:`OSX
  (Apple OSX)` users, you *must* download the MongoDB package with SSL support.

  The following operation imports data from ``primer-dataset.json`` into the
  ``restaurants`` collection in the ``guidebook`` database. It uses the 
  ``--uri`` option along with the modified URI connection string from the
  previous step to connect to the Free Tier cluster.
  
  .. class:: copyable-code
  .. code-block:: shell
  
     wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json | 
       mongoimport --collection "restaurants" \
       --uri "mongodb://admin:mysecretpassword@mongo1.example.net:27017,mongo2.example.net:27017,mongo3.example.net:27017/guidebook?ssl=true&replicaSet=GettingStarted&authSource=admin" \
       primer-dataset.json
  
  Alternatively, you can enter in the cluster connection details manually.
  From the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog, click :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`,
  then :guilabel:`Copy` to copy the URI connection string. 
  Using the URI connection string, do the following:
  
  a. Extract the host string. For example, consider the following URI:
     
     .. code-block:: shell
     
        mongodb://admin:<PASSWORD>@mongo1.example.net:27017,mongo2.example.net:27017,mongo3.example.net:27017/<DATABASE>?ssl=true&replicaSet=GettingStarted&authSource=admin
     
     The Host String consists of the comma separated list between the 
     ``@`` symbol and the ``/`` symbol:
       
     .. code-block:: shell
     
        mongo1.example.net:27017,mongo2.example.net:27017,mongo3.example.net:27017
        
  #. Extract the replica set name. In the URI connection string, the replica 
     set name is associated to the ``replicaSet`` query parameter:
       
     .. code-block:: shell
     
        replicaSet=GettingStarted

  #. Assemble the cluster host string in 
     ``replicaSetName/<host1>,<host2>,<host3>`` format. For example,
     given the information retrieved in the previous steps, the Free Tier
     cluster host string would look as follows:
       
     .. code-block:: shell
     
        GettingStarted/mongo1.example.net:27017,mongo2.example.net:27017,mongo3.example.net:27017

  The following operation imports data from ``primer-dataset.json`` into the
  ``restaurants`` collection in the ``guidebook`` database. Make the following
  changes:
    
  - Replace the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` with the administrative
    username and password you chose during cluster creation. 
    
  - Replace the ``<clusterHostString>`` with the cluster host string assembled
    in the previous step.
