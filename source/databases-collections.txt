Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to interact with MongoDB databases and
collections by using the {+driver-short+}.

MongoDB organizes data into a hierarchy of the following levels:

- **Databases**: Top-level data structures in a MongoDB deployment that store collections.
- **Collections**: Groups of MongoDB documents. They are analogous to tables in relational databases.
- **Documents**: Units that store literal data such as string, numbers, dates, and other embedded documents.
  For more information about document field types and structure, see the
  :manual:`Documents </core/document/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Access a Database
-----------------

Access a database by calling the ``getDatabase()`` method on a ``MongoClient`` instance.

The following example accesses a database named ``"test_database"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-access-database
   :end-before: end-access-database
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:


Access a Collection
-------------------

Access a collection by calling the ``getCollection()`` method on a ``MongoDatabase``
instance.

The following example accesses a collection named ``"test_collection"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-access-collection
   :end-before: end-access-collection
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   If the provided collection name does not already exist in the database,
   MongoDB implicitly creates the collection when you first insert data
   into it.

Create a Collection
-------------------

Use the ``createCollection()`` method on a ``MongoDatabase`` instance to explicitly create
a collection in a database.

The following example creates a collection named ``"example_collection"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-create-collection
   :end-before: end-create-collection
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

You can specify collection options, such as maximum size and document
validation rules, by passing a ``CreateCollectionOptions`` instance to the
``createCollection()`` method. For a full list of
optional parameters, see the :manual:`create command </reference/command/create>`
documentation in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Get a List of Collections
-------------------------

You can query for a list of collections in a database by calling the
``listCollections()`` method of a ``MongoDatabase`` instance.

The following example lists all collections in a database:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-find-collections
      :end-before: end-find-collections
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Iterable((name,BsonString{value='test_collection'}), (type,BsonString{value='collection'}), ... )
      Iterable((name,BsonString{value='example_collection'}), (type,BsonString{value='collection'}), ... )

To query for only the names of the collections in the database, call the
``listCollectionNames()`` method as follows:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
      :language: scala
      :start-after: start-find-collection-names
      :end-before: end-find-collection-names
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      test_collection
      example_collection

.. tip::

   For more information about iterating over a ``Future`` instance, see :ref:`scala-observables-futures`
   in the Access Data From an Observable guide. 

Delete a Collection
-------------------

You can delete a collection by calling the ``drop()`` method on a
``MongoCollection`` instance.

The following example deletes the ``"test_collection"`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-delete-collection
   :end-before: end-delete-collection
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. warning:: Dropping a Collection Deletes All Data in the Collection

   Dropping a collection from your database permanently deletes all
   documents and all indexes within that collection.

   Drop a collection only if the data in it is no longer needed.

Configure Read and Write Operations
-----------------------------------

You can control how the driver routes read operations by setting a **read preference**.
You can also control options for how the driver waits for acknowledgment of
read and write operations on a replica set by setting a **read concern** and a
**write concern**.

By default, databases inherit these settings from the ``MongoClient`` instance,
and collections inherit them from the database. However, you can change these
settings on your database by using the ``withReadPreference()`` method.

The following example accesses a database while specifying the read preference of the
database as ``secondary``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-database-read-prefs
   :end-before: end-database-read-prefs
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

You can also change the read and write settings on your collections by using the ``withReadPreference()``
method. The following example shows how to access a collection while specifying the read
preference of the collection as ``secondary``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-collection-read-prefs
   :end-before: end-collection-read-prefs
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   To see the types of available read preferences, see the
   `API documentation <{+driver-api+}/ReadPreference$.html>`__. 

To learn more about the read and write settings, see the following guides in the
{+mdb-server+} manual:

- :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`
- :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>`
- :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`

Tag Sets
~~~~~~~~

In the {+mdb-server+}, you can apply key-value :manual:`tags
</core/read-preference-tags/>` to replica-set
members according to any criteria you choose. You can then use
those tags to target one or more members for a read operation.

By default, the {+driver-short+} ignores tags when choosing a member to read from. To
instruct the {+driver-short+} to prefer certain tags, pass a ``TagSet`` instance to the
``ReadPreference`` constructor, then pass the ``ReadPreference`` instance to the
``MongoClientSettings`` you use to instantiate a ``MongoClient``.

In the following code example, the tag set passed to the ``ReadPreference``
constructor instructs the {+driver-short+} to prefer reads from the
New York data center (``'dc': 'ny'``) and to fall back to the San Francisco data
center (``'dc': 'sf'``):

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-tags
   :end-before: end-tags
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Local Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple replica-set members match the read preference and tag sets you specify,
the {+driver-short+} reads from the nearest replica-set members, chosen according to
their ping time.

By default, the driver uses only those members whose ping times are within 15 milliseconds
of the nearest member for queries. To distribute reads between members with
higher latencies, use the ``localThreshold()`` method within the ``ClusterSettings.Builder``
block provided by the ``applyToClusterSettings()`` method of the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder``
class. Alternatively, include the ``localThresholdMS`` parameter in your connection string
URI.

The following example connects to a MongoDB deployment running on ``localhost:27017``
and specifies a local threshold of 35 milliseconds:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/databases-collections/databases-collections.scala
   :start-after: start-local-threshold
   :end-before: end-local-threshold
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

In the preceding example, the {+driver-short+} distributes reads between matching members
within 35 milliseconds of the closest member's ping time.
