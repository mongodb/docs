   |mms| provides a new organizations and projects hierarchy to
   help you manage your |mms| deployments. Groups are now
   known as projects. You can create many projects in an
   organization.

.. _organizations:

Organizations
-------------

In the organizations and projects hierarchy, an organization can
contain many projects (previously referred to as groups). Under
this structure, you can:

- Use the same billing settings across multiple projects in your
  organization.

- View all projects within an organization, create teams of users,
  and assign teams to projects. See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-organizations`.

- Connect to |service-short| as part of :ref:`live migration <migrate-to-atlas>`
  to |service-short|. See :ref:`Connect to Atlas <connect-to-atlas-lm>`.

.. _projects:

Projects
--------

Groups are now projects. Previously, users managed
deployments by groups, where each group was managed separately even if
a user belonged to multiple groups.

Existing Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have existing groups, organizations have been automatically
created for your groups (now projects), and your groups have been
placed under these organizations.

If your groups share the same billing settings, they have been placed
in the same organization.

Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments are now associated with projects. As before, deployments
must have unique names within projects. See
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-projects`
and :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`.

.. _teams:

Teams
-----

You can create teams of users and then assign teams of users to
projects. See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users`.

Invitations to Organizations and Projects
-----------------------------------------

You can view and accept invitations to organizations
and projects. See :doc:`/invitations`.
