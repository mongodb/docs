Change Replica Set to WiredTiger
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available. Also, replica sets may
   have members with different storage engines.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engine of a
member of a :term:`replica set` to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

Replica sets can have members with different storage engines. As such,
you can update members to use the WiredTiger storage engine in a rolling
fashion. Before changing all the members to use WiredTiger, you may
prefer to run with mixed storage engines for some period. However,
performance can vary according to workload.

Procedure
---------

This procedure completely removes a :term:`secondary` replica set
member's data, starts :program:`mongod` with WiredTiger, and performs an
:doc:`initial sync </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`.

To update all members of the replica set to use WiredTiger, update the
:term:`secondary` members first. Then step down the :term:`primary`, and
update the stepped-down member.
