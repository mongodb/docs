Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.addShard(<url>)

   Adds a shard replica set to a :term:`sharded cluster`. This method
   must be run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``host``
   
        - string
   
        - The replica set name, hostname, and port of at least one member of
          the shard's replica set. Any additional replica set member hostnames
          must be comma separated. For example:
          
          .. code-block:: sh
          
             <replica_set>/<hostname><:port>,<hostname><:port>, ...
          
          
   


   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShard("<replica_set>/<hostname><:port>")

   .. warning::

      Do not use ``localhost`` for the hostname unless your
      config server
      is also running on ``localhost``.

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method is a helper for the
   :dbcommand:`addShard` command. The :dbcommand:`addShard` command has
   additional options which are not available with this helper.

Example
-------

To add a shard, specify the name of the replica set and
the hostname of at least one member of the replica set, as a seed. If
you specify additional hostnames, all must be members of the same
replica set.

The following example adds a replica set named ``repl0`` and specifies
one member of the replica set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard("repl0/mongodb3.example.net:27327")
