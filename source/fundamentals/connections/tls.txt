Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the TLS protocol to secure 
your connection to a MongoDB deployment. To configure your connection to
use TLS, enable the TLS option and provide your certificates for
validation when creating a client.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Enable TLS <golang-enable-tls>` describes ways to enable TLS on
  your connection

- :ref:`Configure Certificates <golang-configure-tls-certificates>`
  describes the certificates required to configure TLS

- :ref:`Reference Certificates in a Client <golang-client-tls-connect>`
  provides an example of how to create a ``Config`` struct to configure your
  TLS options

- :ref:`Additional Information <golang-tls-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about TLS, see the Wikipedia entry on
   :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <w/index.php?title=Transport_Layer_Security&oldid=1184063676>`.

.. _golang-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in one of the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string
- Passing an empty ``Config`` struct to the ``SetTLSConfig()``
  method when creating a ``ClientOptions`` instance

Select from the following :guilabel:`Connection String` and
:guilabel:`ClientOptions` tabs to see a corresponding code sample:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection string tls true

      .. code-block:: go
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         uri := "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>?tls=true"
         opts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri)
         client, _ := mongo.Connect(opts)

   .. tab:: ClientOptions
      :tabid: clientoptions tls true
      
      .. code-block:: go
         :emphasize-lines: 2
         
         uri := "<connection string>"
         opts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetTLSConfig(&tls.Config{})
         client, _ := mongo.Connect(opts)

.. note::
   
   If your connection string uses a DNS SRV record by including
   the ``mongodb+srv`` prefix, TLS is enabled on your connection by
   default.

To view a full list of client options, see :ref:`golang-connection-options`.

.. _golang-configure-tls-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

To successfully initiate a TLS request, your application must present 
cryptographic certificates to prove its identity. Your application's
certificates must be stored as PEM files to enable TLS when connecting.

.. important::

   For production use, we recommend that your MongoDB deployment use valid
   certificates generated and signed by the same certificate authority.
   For testing, your deployment can use self-signed certificates.

The following list describes the components that your client must
present to establish a TLS-enabled connection:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - TLS Component
     - Description

   * - Certificate Authority (CA)
     - One or more certificate authorities to
       trust when making a TLS connection.

   * - Client Certificate
     - A digital certificate that allows the server to verify the identity
       of your application to establish an encrypted network connection.

   * - Certificate Key
     - The client certificate private key file. This key is often
       included within the certificate file itself.

   * - Passphrase
     - The password to decrypt the private client key if it is encrypted.

.. _golang-client-tls-connect:

Reference Certificates in a Client
----------------------------------

You must reference your certificates in your ``ClientOptions``
object so that the server can validate them before the client connects.
We recommend that you set the ``TLSConfig`` field of your
``ClientOptions`` instance to a ``Config`` struct to configure your
TLS connection. ``Config`` structs are native to Go and allow you to keep
all your TLS options in a single reusable object.

To create a ``Config`` instance, import the ``crypto/tls`` and
``crypto/x509`` packages. Next, create a ``Config`` struct instance and
set the relevant struct fields for your configuration.

Within your ``Config`` instance, you can set optional
fields to configure TLS on your connection. For **testing purposes**,
you can set the ``InsecureSkipVerify`` field to ``true``.
   
.. warning::

   Setting the ``InsecureSkipVerify`` field to ``true`` disables
   both certificate and hostname validation.
   
   Specifying this option in a production environment makes
   your application insecure and potentially
   vulnerable to expired certificates and foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.

To learn more about the ``Config`` struct, see the `tls.Config API
documentation <https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#Config>`__.

.. _golang-tls-config-full-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

This example performs the following actions to create a ``Config``
instance and a ``Client`` instance with TLS enabled:

1. Creates variables to reference the certificate filepaths

#. Creates a CA file pool by using the ``x509.NewCertPool()`` method
   and appends the contents of the CA file

#. Loads the client certificate files by using the
   ``tls.LoadX509KeyPair()`` method

#. Instantiates a ``Config`` struct and sets the ``RootCAs`` and
   ``Certificates`` fields

#. Passes the ``Config`` instance to the ``SetTLSConfig()`` method to
   set the ``TLSConfig`` field of the ``ClientOptions``
