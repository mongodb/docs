title: Start MongoDB without access control.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: start-without-auth
pre: |

   Start a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance without access
   control.
  
   For example, open a terminal and issue the following:

action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb
---
stepnum: 2
title: Connect to the instance.
level: 4
ref: connect
pre: |

   For example, open a new terminal and connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
   to the instance:

action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongosh --port 27017 
post: |
   Specify additional command line options as appropriate to connect
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to your deployment, such as ``--host``.

stepnum: 3
title: Create the user administrator.
level: 4
ref: create-user-admin
pre: |

  From :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, add a user with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role in the ``admin`` database. Include additional roles as
  needed for this user. For example, the following
  creates the user ``myUserAdmin`` in the ``admin`` database with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role and the
  :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` role.

action:
  pre: |

    .. tip::

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myUserAdmin",
        pwd: passwordPrompt(), // or cleartext password
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ]
      }
    )
post: |
   .. note::
      The database where you create the user (in this example,
      ``admin``) is the user's :ref:`authentication database
      <user-authentication-database>`. Although the user would
      authenticate to this database, the user can
      have roles in other databases; i.e. the user's authentication
      database does not limit the user's privileges.

  a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. For example, from
     :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, issue the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

  #. Exit :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

  #. Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with access control enabled.

     - If you start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the command line, add
       the :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` command line option:

       .. code-block:: bash

          mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb

     - If you start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` using a
       :ref:`configuration file <configuration-options>`, add the
       :setting:`security.authorization` configuration file setting:

       .. code-block:: bash

          security:
              authorization: enabled

  Clients that connect to this instance must now authenticate
  themselves as a MongoDB user. Clients can only perform actions as
  determined by their assigned roles.

   .. note::
      The database where you create the user (in this example,
      ``test``) is that user's :ref:`authentication database
      <user-authentication-database>`. Although the user would
      authenticate to this database, the user can have roles in other
      databases; i.e. the user's authentication database does not limit
      the user's privileges.

   After creating the additional users, disconnect
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

title: Insert a document as ``myTester``.

ref: insert-as-mytester
content: |

   As ``myTester``, you have privileges to perform read and write
   operations in the ``test`` database (as well as perform read
   operations in the ``reporting`` database). Once authenticated as
   ``myTester``, insert a document into a collection in ``test``
   database. For example, you can perform the following insert
   operation in the ``test`` database:
          
   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.insert( { x: 1, y: 1 } )
...
