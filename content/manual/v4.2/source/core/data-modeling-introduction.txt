The key challenge in data modeling is balancing the needs of the
application, the performance characteristics of the database engine, and
the data retrieval patterns. When designing data models, always
consider the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and
processing of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data
itself.

Flexible Schema
---------------

Unlike SQL databases, where you must determine and declare a table's
schema before inserting data, MongoDB's :term:`collections
<collection>`, by default, do not require their :doc:`documents
</core/document>` to have the same schema. That is:

- The documents in a single collection do not need to have the same set
  of fields and the data type for a field can differ across documents
  within a collection.

- To change the structure of the documents in a collection, such as add
  new fields, remove existing fields, or change the field values to a
  new type, update the documents to the new structure.

This flexibility facilitates the mapping of documents to an entity or
an object. Each document can match the data fields of the represented
entity, even if the document has substantial variation from other
documents in the collection.

In practice, however, the documents in a collection share a similar
structure, and you can enforce :doc:`document validation rules
</core/schema-validation>` for a collection during update and insert
operations. See :doc:`/core/schema-validation` for details.

Document Structure
------------------

The key decision in designing data models for MongoDB applications
revolves around the structure of documents and how the application
represents relationships between data. MongoDB allows related data to
be embedded within a single document.

Embedded Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded documents capture relationships between data by storing
related data in a single document structure. MongoDB documents make it
possible to embed document structures in a field or
array within a document. These *denormalized* data models allow
applications to retrieve and manipulate related data in a single
database operation.

For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model is optimal.

See :ref:`data-modeling-embedding` for the strengths and weaknesses of
embedding documents.

References
~~~~~~~~~~

References store the relationships between data by including
links or *references* from one document to another. Applications can
resolve these :doc:`references </reference/database-references>` to
access the related data. Broadly, these are *normalized* data models.

See :ref:`data-modeling-referencing` for the strengths and weaknesses of
using references.

Atomicity of Write Operations
-----------------------------

Single Document Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single
document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents
*within* a single document.

A denormalized data model with embedded data combines all related data
in a single document instead of normalizing across multiple documents
and collections. This data model facilitates atomic operations.

For details regarding transactions in MongoDB, see the
:doc:`/core/transactions` page.

Data Use and Performance
------------------------

When designing a data model, consider how applications will use your
database. For instance, if your application only uses recently
inserted documents, consider using :doc:`/core/capped-collections`. Or
if your application needs are mainly read operations to a collection,
adding :ref:`indexes <indexes>` to support common queries can improve performance.

See :doc:`/core/data-model-operations` for more information on these
and other operational considerations that affect data model designs.
