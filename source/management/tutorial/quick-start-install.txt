============================
MMS Quick Start Installation
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| is a service to monitor and back up a MongoDB infrastructure. This
tutorial describes the basic process to install and configure the service.

At a high level, a basic installation will look like the following.
The estimated setup time is less than an hour.

#. Install a standalone local MongoDB server backed by a fast, large storage volume.

#. Install an SMTP email server as appropriate for your environment.

#. Install the MMS server RPM package.

#. Configure the MMS server's URL and email addresses.

#. Start up MMS server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Contact a MongoDB representative to obtain the current stable |monitoring|
release. MMS is available in DEB packages for Debian, Ubuntu, and related
systems; RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and related
systems; as well as ``tar.gz`` and ``zip`` packages.

You can also download the latest On-Prem Monitoring releases from
<http://www.mongodb.com/commercialsupport/downloads> as an RPM package.

Confirm your environment meets the :doc:`/management/tutorial/hardware-software-requirements`.

Procedure
---------

Prepare Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. For AWS users, prepare MongoDB Storage:

   *If you are not using AWS, skip this step and continue to the next
   step.*

   If using an AWS EBS volume for MongoDB storage, create and
   attach the volume to your EC2 instance. Once the volume is
   successfully attached, issue the following command to determine the
   name of the new EBS volume: ::

      sudo fdisk -l

   Create a filesystem on this volume using the name you found in the
   previous, command, using the following form: ::

      sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvd<letter>

   Replace ``<letter>`` with the identifier for the volume, as in the
   following example: ::

      sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

   You only need to create a filesystem the first time you initiate
   the drive.

   Create a directory to use as the mount point: ::

      sudo mkdir /mnt/ebs-mount-dir

   Mount the volume with a command that resembles the following: ::

      sudo mount /dev/xvd<letter> /mnt/ebs-mount-dir

   Replace ``<letter>`` with the identifier for the volume, as in the
   following example: ::

      sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/ebs-mount-dir

#. Set Linux Kernel parameters. All users must complete this step to
   ensure optimal performance. Begin by using the following commands
   to change the parameters of running instance: ::

      sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.core.netdev_max_backlog=30000
      sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216
      sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216

   Edit the ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` file and append the lines below to
   ensure that these parameters are always applied following a system
   reboot: ::

      net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 30000
      net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
      net.core.rmem_max = 16777216

Install and Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section assumes you're installing MongoDB on an instance running
Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux: Use the `Install Mongodb on
Red Hat, CentOS, or Fedora Linux
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat-centos-or-fedora-linux/>`_
tutorial for more information.

#. Add MongoDB repositories to the system's package management tool.

   Create the ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb.repo`` file and add the
   following information about the repository:

   .. code-block:: ini

       [mongodb]
       name=MongoDB Repository
       baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64
       gpgcheck=0
       enabled=1

#. Install the MongoDB packages using the following operations:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

#. Configure data and logging directories for MongoDB.

   Create directories for MongoDB's log and data. This example assumes
   that the path for all MongoDB data is beneath
   ``/mnt/ebs-mnt-dir/mongo/``. Use the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ebs-mount-dir/mongo/data
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ebs-mount-dir/mongo/logs

   Issue the following command to ensure that the ``mongod`` process
   owns all paths below the ``/mnt/ebs-mnt-dir/mongo/`` path:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo chown -R mongod:mongod /mnt/ebs-mount-dir/mongo

   Edit the ``/etc/mongod.conf`` to include the following settings:

   .. code-block:: ini

      logpath=/mnt/ebs-mount-dir/mongo/logs/mongod.log
      dbpath=/mnt/ebs-mount-dir/mongo/data

   This will configure the paths for the log and data
   directories. Adjust the paths as needed.

#. Start MongoDB.

   Issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongod start

   .. note::

      If using EBS, starting MongoDB *may* take several minutes to
      pre-allocate the journal files. This is normal behavior.

Install the MMS Software Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RPM Install
```````````

Install the RPM by issuing command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rpm -ivh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

Replace ``<version>`` with the version of the ``.rpm`` you
obtained. When installed, the base directory for the MMS software is
``/opt/mongodb/mms/``. The RPM will also create a new system user
``mongodb-mms`` under which the server will run.

DEB Install
```````````

Install the DEB by issuing command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo dpkg --install mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.deb

Replace ``<version>`` with the version of the ``.deb`` you
obtained. When installed, the base directory for the MMS software is
``/opt/mongodb/mms/``. The DEB package will also create a new system
user ``mongodb-mms`` under which the server will run.

``tar.gz`` and ``zip`` Install
``````````````````````````````

You can install |monitoring| from the provided ``tar.gz`` or ``zip``
archive without making any changes to the underlying system
(i.e. without creating users.)  To install, extract the package, as in
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    tar -zxf mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz

Optionally create a symlink in ``/etc/init.d`` to the included control
script for convenience, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo ln -s <install_dir>/bin/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/

Note, when the app is first started, it will create and store an encryption
key in ``$HOME/.mongodb-mms`` for the app user.

Configure On-Prem MMS Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required Configuration
``````````````````````

.. note::

   By default, |monitoring| will use a local SMTP server listening on port 25.

Configure MMS properties, by editing the
``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file. Edit the following
properties according to the needs of your deployment, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: ini

   mms.centralUrl=http://mms.example.com:8080

   mms.fromEmailAddr=MMS Alerts <mms-alerts@example.com>
   mms.replyToEmailAddr=mms-no-reply@example.com
   mms.adminFromEmailAddr=MMS Admin <mms-admin@example.com>
   mms.adminEmailAddr=mms-admin@example.com
   mms.bounceEmailAddr=bounce@example.com

These properties are blank initially, and you **must** define them
before the |monitoring| instance will start.

In addition, whether or not you enable backup, define these properties if
you use authentication:

.. code-block:: ini

   mongo.mongoUri=<SetToValidUri>
   mongo.replicaSet=<ValidRSIfUsed>

Otherwise, MMS will fail while trying to connect to the default 127.0.0.1:27017
URL.

If you use the MMS :program:`<install_dir>/bin/credentialstool` to encrypt the
password used in the ``mongo.mongoUri`` value, also add the
``mongo.encryptedCredentials`` key to the
``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file and set the value for this
property to true:

.. code-block:: ini

   mongo.encryptedCredentials=true

Configure Email Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to your SMTP provider's documentation for the appropriate
settings or for how to configure a local SMTP server as a relay. You
may configure authentication if you want to send mail using existing
email infrastructure (i.e. SMTP,) or a service such as ``Gmail`` or
``Sendgrid`` .

Set the following value in the
``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

   mms.emailDaoClass=com.xgen.svc.core.dao.email.JavaEmailDao

Then, to the same file, set the following values as defined by your
provider. Defaults specified inline:

.. code-block:: ini

   mms.mail.transport=<smtp/smtps> # (defaults to smtp)
   mms.mail.hostname=<mail.example.com> # (defaults to localhost)
   mms.mail.port=<number> # (defaults to 25)
   mms.mail.tls=<true/false> # (defaults to false)

The following two values are optional,
and unless set default to disabled authentication:

.. code-block:: ini

   mms.mail.username=
   mms.mail.password=

Start the On-Prem MMS Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you installed from a ``tar.gz`` or ``zip`` archive, you must create
   a symlink located at the path ``/etc/init.d/mongodb-mms`` that points
   to the ``<install_dir>/bin/mongodb-mms``.

After configuring your |monitoring| deployment, you can start the MMS
server with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

The On-Prem MMS server logs its output to a ``logs`` directory inside
the installation directory. You can view this log information with the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo less <install_dir>/logs/mms0.log

If the server starts successfully, you will see content in this file
that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   [main] INFO  ServerMain:202 - Starting mms...
   [main] WARN  AbstractConnector:294 - Acceptors should be <=2*availableProcessors: SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:0
   [null] LoginService=HashLoginService identityService=org.eclipse.jetty.security.DefaultIdentityService@1eb3319f
   [main] INFO  AppConfig:46 - Starting app for env: hosted
   [main] INFO  MmsAppConfig:67 - Not loading backup components
   [main] INFO  GraphiteSvcImpl:67 - Graphite service not configured, events will be ignored.
   [main] INFO  TwilioSvcImpl:48 - Twilio service not configured, SMS events will be ignored.
   [main] INFO  OpenDMKSnmpTrapAgentSvcImpl:91 - SNMP heartbeats hosts not configured, no heartbeat traps will be sent.
   [main] INFO  ServerMain:266 - Started mms in: 24979 (ms)

You can now use the |monitoring| instance by visiting the URL specified
in the ``mms.centralUrl`` parameter (e.g. http://mms.example.com:8080)
to continue configuration:

Unlike the SaaS version of MMS, |monitoring| stores user accounts in the
local MongoDB instance. When you sign
into the |monitoring| instance for the first time, the system will
prompt you to register and create a new "group" for your deployment.

After completing the registration process, you will arrive at the "MMS
Hosts," page.

Because there are no Monitoring agents attached to your account, the
first page you see in |monitoring| will provide instructions for
downloading the Monitoring agent. Click the "download agent" link to
download a pre-configured agent for your account. Continue reading this
document for installation and configuration instructions for the MMS
agent.

Stop the On-Prem MMS Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stopping the On-Prem MMS server is as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms stop
