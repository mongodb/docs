A database is a container for :ref:`collections <compass-collection-tab>`.
Each database gets its own set of files on the host file system.
A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.

Databases Tab
-------------

The :guilabel:`Databases` tab lists the existing databases for your
MongoDB deployment. To access the :guilabel:`Databases` tab, click the
deployment name in the :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar`.

   :alt: Databases View

From this view, you can click a database name in the sidebar to view its
collections. Alternatively, you can view database collections by clicking the 
desired database in the left-hand navigation.

You can also :ref:`create <compass-create-database>` or
:ref:`drop databases <compass-drop-database>` from this view.
