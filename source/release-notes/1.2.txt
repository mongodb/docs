===============================
Release Notes for MongoDB 1.2.x
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

New Features
------------

- More indexes per collection

- Faster index creation

- Map/Reduce

- Stored JavaScript functions

- Configurable fsync time

- Several small features and fixes

DB Upgrade Required
-------------------

There are some changes that will require doing an upgrade if your
previous version is <= 1.0.x. If you're already using a version >= 1.1.x
then these changes aren't required. There are 2 ways to do it:

- ``--upgrade``

  - stop your :program:`mongod` process

  - run ``./mongod --upgrade``

  - start :program:`mongod` again

- use a slave

  - start a slave on a different port and data directory

  - when its synced, shut down the master, and start the new slave on
    the regular port.

Ask in the forums or IRC for more help.

Replication Changes
-------------------

- There have been minor changes in replication. If you are upgrading a
  master/slave setup from <= 1.1.2 you have to update the slave first.

mongoimport
-----------

- ``mongoimportjson`` has been removed and is replaced with
  :doc:`mongoimport </reference/program/mongoimport>` that can do json/csv/tsv

field filter changing
---------------------

- We've changed the semantics of the field filter a little bit.
  Previously only objects with those fields would be returned. Now the
  field filter only changes the output, not which objects are returned.
  If you need that behavior, you can use :doc:`$exists </reference/operator/query/exists>`
