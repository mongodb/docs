msgid "Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With multiple copies of data on different database servers, replication protects a database from the loss of a single server. Replication also allows you to recover from hardware failure and service interruptions. With additional copies of the data, you can dedicate one to disaster recovery, reporting, or backup."

msgid "In some cases, you can use replication to increase read capacity. Clients have the ability to send read and write operations to different servers. You can also maintain copies in different data centers to increase the locality and availability of data for distributed applications."

msgid "A replica set is a group of :program:`mongod` instances that host the same data set. One :program:`mongod`, the primary, receives all write operations. All other instances, secondaries, apply operations from the primary so that they have the same data set."

msgid "The **primary** accepts all write operations from clients. Replica set can have only one primary. Because only one member can accept write operations, replica sets provide **strict consistency**. To support replication, the primary logs all changes to its data sets in its :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>`. See :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` for more information."

If the primary is unavailable, the replica set will elect a secondary to be primary. By default, clients read from the primary, however, clients can specify a :doc:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` to send read operations to secondaries.
