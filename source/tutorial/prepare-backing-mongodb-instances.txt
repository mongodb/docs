Prepare Backing MongoDB Instances
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Backing MongoDB instances are dedicated instances that store data to
support |onprem| operations and **store no other data**. |onprem| requires
a separate backing instance for each of the two backing databases: the
:ref:`mms-application-database` and the
:ref:`mms-backup-blockstore-database`. Run each backing instance as a
:term:`replica set`, for high availability.

A backing MongoDB instance:

- Stores data in support of |onprem| operations and **stores no other data**.

- Must run MongoDB 2.4.9 or later.

- Must have the MongoDB ``security.javascriptEnabled`` set to ``true``, which
  is the default. The |application| uses the :query:`$where` query and
  requires this setting be enabled on the |application| database.

- Must **not** run the MongoDB ``notablescan`` option.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prior to installation, you must deploy servers that comply with the
:manual:`Production Notes </administration/production-notes>` in the
MongoDB manual and that meet the hardware requirements described below.

If a server hosts |onprem| components as well, you must sum the
:doc:`hardware requirements </core/requirements>` for each component to
determine the requirements for the server. For deployment diagrams, see
:doc:`/core/deployments`.

Ensure that firewall rules allow access to the :doc:`ports
</reference/on-prem>` that the instances runs on.

Configure as many servers as needed for your deployment. As needs change,
you can later add capacity by provisioning additional backing servers.

Procedure
---------

Do **not** use MongoDB instances that store other data.

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install MongoDB on each server. See :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>`
in the MongoDB manual.

Deploy the Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy a replica set for each database using the :manual:`Deploy a Replica
Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` procedure in the MongoDB manual.
