Delete a deployment.

The command prompts you to confirm the operation when you run the command without the --force option. 
		
Deleting an Atlas deployment also deletes any backup snapshots for that cluster.
Deleting a Local deployment also deletes any local data volumes.

To use this command, you must authenticate with a user account or an API key that has the Project Owner role.
