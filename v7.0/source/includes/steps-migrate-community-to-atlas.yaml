  To add credentials for :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>`:

  a. Create the credentials to the deployment. See 
     :ref:`Required Access for Monitoring <mms-req-cred-monitoring>`.
  #. Add the credentials based on your project's authentication mechanism. 
     See :ref:`add-auth-credentials-imported-deployment`. 
  
  .. note::
     
     If you're adding your MongoDB deployment 
     to monitoring so that you can live migrate it 
     to |service-short|, you don't need to add credentials for 
     Automation and Backup.
     To learn more, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.
