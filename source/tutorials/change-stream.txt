MongoDB 3.6 introduces new ``$changeStream`` aggregation pipeline
operator.

Change streams provide a way to watch changes to documents in a
collection. To improve the usability of this new stage, the
``MongoCollection`` type includes a new ``watch()`` method. The
``ChangeStreamPublisher`` instance sets up the change stream and automatically
attempts to resume if it encounters a potentially recoverable error.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must set up the following components to run the code examples in
this guide:

- A ``test.restaurants`` collection populated with documents from the
  ``restaurants.json`` file in the `documentation assets GitHub
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/drivers/restaurants.json>`__.

- The following import statements:

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClient;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoCollection;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoDatabase;
    
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.changestream.FullDocument;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.changestream.ChangeStreamDocument;
   
   import org.bson.Document;

.. important::

   This guide uses the ``Subscriber`` implementations, which are
   described in the :ref:`Quick Start Primer <javars-primer>`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

First, connect to a MongoDB deployment and declare and define
``MongoDatabase`` and ``MongoCollection`` instances.

The following code connects to a standalone
MongoDB deployment running on ``localhost`` on port ``27017``. Then, it
defines the ``database`` variable to refer to the ``test`` database and
the ``collection`` variable to refer to the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create();
   MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("test");
   MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("restaurants");

To learn more about connecting to MongoDB deployments,
see the :ref:`javars-connect` tutorial.

Watch for Changes on a Collection
---------------------------------

To create a change stream use one of the ``MongoCollection.watch()``
methods.

In the following example, the change stream prints out all changes it
observes:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.watch().subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Watch for Changes on a Database
-------------------------------

Applications can open a single change stream to watch all non-system
collections of a database. To create such a change stream, use one of the
``MongoDatabase.watch()`` methods.

In the following example, the change stream prints out all the changes
it observes on the given database:

.. code-block:: java

   database.watch().subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Watch for Changes on All Databases
----------------------------------

Applications can open a single change stream to watch all non-system
collections of all databases in a MongoDB deployment. To create such a
change stream, use one of the ``MongoClient.watch()`` methods.

In the following example, the change stream prints out all the changes
it observes on the deployment to which the ``MongoClient`` is connected:

.. code-block:: java

   client.watch().subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Filtering Content
-----------------

You can pass a list of aggregation stages to the  ``watch()`` method to
modify the data returned by the ``$changeStream`` operator.

.. note::
   
   Not all aggregation operators are supported. See
   :manual:`Change Streams </changeStreams/>` in the Server manual to learn more.

In the following example, the change stream prints out all changes it
observes corresponding to ``insert``, ``update``, ``replace`` and
``delete`` operations.

First, the pipeline includes a ``$match`` stage to filter for documents
where the ``operationType`` is either an ``insert``, ``update``, ``replace`` or
``delete``. Then, it sets the ``fullDocument`` to
``FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP``, so that the document after the update is
included in the results:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.watch(
       asList(
           Aggregates.match(
               Filters.in("operationType", asList("insert", "update", "replace", "delete"))
           )
       )
   ).fullDocument(FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP).subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());
