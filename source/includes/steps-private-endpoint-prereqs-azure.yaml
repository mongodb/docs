  `Create the endpoint
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-endpoint?view=azure-cli-latest#az_network_private_endpoint_create>`__
  in |azure| with the following information:

  - The name of the resource group that contains the VNet that you want
    to use to connect to |service|.

  - The name of the VNet that you want to use to connect to |service|.

  - The **privateLinkServiceName** and **privateLinkServiceResourceId**
    of the private endpoint service that you created with 
    :doc:`/groups/{GROUP-ID}/privateEndpoint/endpointService
    </reference/api/private-endpoints-service-create-one>`.

    Retrieve these fields with 
    :doc:`/groups/{GROUP-ID}/privateEndpoint/{CLOUD-PROVIDER}/endpointService/{ENDPOINT-SERVICE-ID}
    </reference/api/private-endpoints-service-get-one>`.

  - The name or ID of the subnet in your |azure| VNet.

  .. important::

     You must add the ``--manual-request true`` parameter to the
     |azure| CLI command that you use to create the private endpoint.

     If you receive the following error when you created the private
     endpoint, you ran the request without the ``--manual-request true``
     parameter:

     .. code-block:: sh

        ServiceError: code: LinkedAuthorizationFailed - , The client has permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Network/privateLinkServices/PrivateEndpointConnectionsApproval/action' on scope '/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/privatelink/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/jww-privatelink', however the current tenant '<tenant-id>' is not authorized to access linked subscription '<tenant-id>'.
