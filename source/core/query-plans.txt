For any given query, the MongoDB query planner chooses and caches the
most efficient query plan given the available indexes. To evaluate the
efficiency of query plans, the query planner runs all candidate plans
during a trial period. In general, the winning plan is the query plan
that produces the most results during the trial period while performing
the least amount of work.

The associated plan cache entry is used for subsequent queries with the
same query shape.

The following diagram illustrates the query planner logic:

.. include:: /images/general-query-planner-logic.rst

.. _cache-entry-state:

Plan Cache Entry State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each plan cache query shape is associated with one of three states in 
the cache:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - State
     - Description
   
   * - :ref:`Missing <cache-entry-missing>`
   
     - .. _cache-entry-missing:

       No entry for this shape exists in the cache.
       
       For a query, if the cache entry state for a query shape is
       :ref:`Missing <cache-entry-missing>`:

       #. Candidate plans are evaluated and a winning plan is selected.

       #. The cache creates an entry for the query shape in state
          :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>` with a value that
          quantifies the amount of work required by the plan. 
       
   * - :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>`

     - .. _cache-entry-inactive:

       The entry in the cache is a placeholder entry for this shape.
       That is, the planner has seen the shape, calculated a value that
       quantifies the amount of work required by the plan and stored the
       shape placeholder entry but the query shape is **not** used to
       generate query plans.
    
       For a query, if the cache entry state for a shape is
       :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>`:

       #. Candidate plans are evaluated and a winning plan is selected.
  
       #. The selected plan's value that quantifies the amount of work
          required by the plan is compared to the :ref:`Inactive
          <cache-entry-inactive>` entry's. If the selected plan's value is:
     
          - Less than or equal to the :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>` entry's:
               The selected plan replaces the placeholder :ref:`Inactive
               <cache-entry-inactive>` entry and has an :ref:`Active
               <cache-entry-active>` state.
       
               If before the replacement happens, the :ref:`Inactive
               <cache-entry-inactive>` entry becomes :ref:`Active
               <cache-entry-active>` (for example, due to another query
               operation), the newly active entry will only be replaced
               if its value that quantifies the amount of work required
               by the plan is greater than the selected plan.

          - Greater than the :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>` entry's:
               The :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>` entry remains
               but its value that quantifies the amount of work required
               by the plan is incremented.

   * - :ref:`Active <cache-entry-active>`

     - .. _cache-entry-active:

       The entry in the cache is for the winning plan. The planner can
       use this entry to generate query plans.

       For a query, if the cache entry state for a shape is :ref:`Active
       <cache-entry-active>`:

       The active entry is used to generate query plans.

       The planner also evaluates the entry's performance and if its
       value that quantifies the amount of work required by the plan no
       longer meets the selection criterion, it will transition to
       :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>` state.

See :ref:`query-plans-plan-cache-flushes` for additional scenarios that trigger
changes to the plan cache.


Query Plan and Cache Information
--------------------------------

To view the query plan information for a given query, you can use
:method:`db.collection.explain()` or the :method:`cursor.explain()` .

To view plan cache information for a collection, you can use the 
:pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage.

.. _query-plans-query-revision:

.. _query-plans-plan-cache-flushes:

Plan Cache Flushes
------------------

The query plan cache does not persist if a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
restarts or shuts down. In addition:

- Catalog operations like index or collection drops clear the plan
  cache.

- Least recently used (LRU) cache replacement mechanism clears the
  least recently accessed cache entry, regardless of state.

Users can also:

- Manually clear the entire plan cache using the
  :method:`PlanCache.clear()` method.

- Manually clear specific plan cache entries using the
  :method:`PlanCache.clearPlansByQuery()` method.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`query-hash-plan-cache-key`

Plan Cache Debug Info Size Limit
--------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the
:doc:`plan cache </core/query-plans>` will save full ``plan cache``
entries only if the cumulative size of the ``plan caches`` for all
collections is lower than 0.5 GB. When the cumulative size of the
``plan caches`` for all collections exceeds this threshold, additional
``plan cache`` entries are stored without the following debug
information:

- :ref:`createdFromQuery <plancachestats-createdFromQuery>`
- :ref:`cachedPlan <plancachestats-cachedPlan>`
- :ref:`creationExecStats <plancachestats-creationExecStats>`
- :ref:`candidatePlanScores <plancachestats-candidatePlanScores>`

The estimated size in bytes of a ``plan cache`` entry is available in
the output of :pipeline:`$planCacheStats`.

.. _query-hash-plan-cache-key:

``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``
----------------------------------

.. _query-hash:

``queryHash``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-query-shapes.rst

.. _plan-cache-key:

``planCacheKey``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-plan-cache-key.rst

For example, consider a collection ``foo`` with the following indexes:
 
.. code-block:: javascript

   db.foo.createIndex( { x: 1 } )
   db.foo.createIndex( { x: 1, y: 1 } )
   db.foo.createIndex( { x: 1, z: 1 }, { partialFilterExpression: { x: { $gt: 10 } } } )

The following queries on the collection have the same shape:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.foo.explain().find( { x: { $gt: 5 } } )  // Query Operation 1
   db.foo.explain().find( { x: { $gt: 20 } } ) // Query Operation 2

Given these queries, the index with the :ref:`partial filter expression
<partial-index-query-coverage>` can support query operation 2 but *not*
support query operation 1. Since the indexes available to support query operation 1
differs from query operation 2, the two queries have different
``planCacheKey``.

If one of the indexes were dropped, or if a new index ``{ x: 1, a: 1
}`` were added, the ``planCacheKey`` for both query operations will
change.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey`` are available in:

- :doc:`explain() output </reference/explain-results>` fields:
  :data:`queryPlanner.queryHash <explain.queryPlanner.queryHash>` and
  :data:`queryPlanner.planCacheKey <explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey>`

- :doc:`profiler log messages </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
  and :doc:`diagnostic log messages (i.e. mongod/mongos log
  messages)</reference/log-messages>` when logging slow queries.

- :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage

- ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()``
  method/``planCacheListQueryShapes`` command

- ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()``
  method/``planCacheListPlans`` command

.. _index-filters:

Index Filters
-------------

Index filters are set with the :dbcommand:`planCacheSetFilter` command
and determine which indexes the optimizer evaluates for a :term:`query
shape`. A query shape consists of a combination of query, sort, and
projection specifications. If an index filter exists for a given query
shape, the optimizer only considers those indexes specified in the
filter.

When an index filter exists for the query shape, MongoDB ignores the
:method:`~cursor.hint()`. To see whether MongoDB applied an index
filter for a query shape, check the :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.indexFilterSet`
field of either the :method:`db.collection.explain()` or the
:method:`cursor.explain()` method.

Index filters only affect which indexes the optimizer evaluates; the
optimizer may still select the collection scan as the winning plan for
a given query shape.

Index filters exist for the duration of the server process and do not
persist after shutdown. MongoDB also provides a command to manually remove
filters.

Because index filters override the expected behavior of the optimizer
as well as the :method:`~cursor.hint()` method, use index filters
sparingly.

See :dbcommand:`planCacheListFilters`,
:dbcommand:`planCacheClearFilters`, and :dbcommand:`planCacheSetFilter`.
