  Validates each :term:`BSON` object before outputting it in :term:`JSON`
  format. By default, {{program}} enables {{role}}.
  For objects with a high degree of sub-document nesting,
  {{role}} can have a small impact on performance.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.4
     MongoDB enables {{role}} by default, to prevent any
     client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
     database.
