|service-fullname| has a robust set of built-in tools, alerts, charts,
integrations, and logs that help you to monitor and enhance your
|service| deployment and detect and respond to threats in real time.

Monitoring your deployment allows you to:

- Understand the current capacity of your |service| {+cluster+}.
- Observe the utilization of resources.
- Observe the presence of abnormal behavior and performance issues.
- Detect and react to real-time issues to improve your application stack.
- Comply with your data protection and governance requirements.

|service| provides several metrics for monitoring and alerting. You can
track the health, availability, consumption, and performance of your 
deployments in visual dashboards and by |api|.  

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Monitoring and Alerts
------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| provides several ways and tools to monitor your deployment and
improve performance. You can view various {+cluster+} metrics, monitor your
database performance, configure alerts and alert notification, and
download activity logs. 

Features 
~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80 
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metrics 
     - Deployment metrics provide insight into hardware performance and
       database operation efficiency. |service| collects metrics for
       your servers, databases, and MongoDB processes and stores metrics
       data at various granularity levels. For each granularity level,
       |service| computes metrics as averages of the reported metrics at
       the next finer granularity level. Many metrics have a burst
       reporting equivalent. 
       
       You can view metrics by using the {+atlas-ui+} Real-Time
       Performance Panel, Query Profiler, Performance Advisor, and
       Namespace Insights page, {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

   * - Alerts 
     - |service| provides alerts for over 200 event types, allowing you
       to tailor alerts for precise monitoring. |service| issues alerts
       for the database and server conditions that you configure in your
       alert settings. When a condition triggers an alert, |service|
       displays a warning symbol on the {+cluster+} and sends alert
       notifications. 
       
       You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, {+atlas-cli+},
       and integrated Terraform resource to configure alerts and alert
       notification.  

   * - Charts 
     - |service| monitoring charts provide insights into various key
       metrics, including hardware performance and database operation
       efficiency. Tools such as real-time performance panels for
       network and operation visibility, query profilers for tracking
       efficiency trends, and automated index suggestions allow you to
       monitor and troubleshoot issues more effectively, driving
       greater operational efficiency. For example, these charts can
       help you understand the impact of server restarts and elections
       on database performance.  

   * - Logs 
     - |service| provides logs for each process in the {+cluster+}. Each
       process keeps an account of its activity in its own log file. 
       
       You can download logs by using the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+},
       {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

Recommendations for Monitoring by Using Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To monitor your {+cluster+} performance, you can view the {+cluster+}
metrics. For your databases, you can view historical throughput,
performance, and utilization metrics. The following table lists some
important categories of metrics to monitor: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 30 70 
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - |service| {+Cluster+} Operations and Connection Metrics 
     - - Opcounters 
       - Operation Execution Times 
       - Query Executors and Query Targeting 
       - Connections 
       - Queues 
       - Scan and Order

   * - Hardware Metrics
     - - Normalised System CPU 
       - Normalised Process CPU 
       - Disk Latency 
       - Disk IOPS 
       - Disk Space Free 
       - System Memory 
       - Swap Usage

   * - Replication Metrics
     - - Replication Lag 
       - Replication Oplog Window 
       - Replication Headroom 
       - Oplog GB/Hour 
       - Opcounters -repl 

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, and {+atlas-cli+} to
view |service| {+cluster+} metrics. You can also integrate with
third-party tools for visualizing these metrics.

To learn more, see :ref:`monitor-cluster-metrics`. 

Recommendations for Monitoring by Configuring Alerts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| integrates alert notification with third-party tools like
:atlas:`Microsoft Teams </tutorial/integrate-msft-teams>`,
:ref:`PagerDuty <pagerduty-integration>`, :ref:`DataDog 
<datadog-integration>`, :ref:`Prometheus <prometheus-integration>`,
:atlascli:`Opsgenie </command/atlas-integrations-create-OPS_GENIE/>`,
:atlascli:`Splunk On-Call </command/atlas-integrations-create-VICTOR_OPS/>`, 
and so on, enhancing collaboration and unifying application performance
management within your existing workflows for optimal efficiency. For
example, you can configure to send alerts from your project to your: 

- PagerDuty dashboard. |service| PagerDuty integration can record
  incidents and notify on-call responders. Additionally, the integration
  allows for automatic incident resolution in PagerDuty when an |service|
  alert is closed. 
- Slack channel.
- Atlassian Opsgenie. You will need an active Opsgenie API Key to
  configure alert notification.
- VictorOps. You will need an VictorOps API Key and a VictorOps Routing
  Key to configure alert notification. 

Configure alerts and notifications for security events, such as failed
login attempts, unusual access patterns, and data breaches. In dev and
test environments, we recommend configuring alerts on {+clusters+} after
seven days of inactivity to save costs. 

At the minimum, we recommend configuring the following alerts: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80 
   :stub-columns: 1 

   * - Opcounters 
     - Gives a basic overview of what the system is doing including
       number of queries, updates, inserts, deletes, and so on commands
       per second. Excessive Opcounter levels typically indicate that
       load has increased unexpectedly in some dimension. So set an
       alert for around X% of the expected peaks. 

   * - Tickets 
     - Tickets represent the number of concurrent operations allowed
       into the storage engine. There are separate tickets for read and
       write operations. When this value reaches zero, new requests may
       queue until a ticket becomes available. Unless the load is known
       to be highly concurrent, this value should remain close to the
       default (``128``) and mustn't dip much, or frequently. We
       recommend setting the following alert thresholds:

       < 100 tickets available for more than 2 minutes
       < 50 tickets available for more than 1 minute
       < 10 tickets available at any time

   * - Replication Lag 
     - Replication lag is calculated between the last operation time on
       the primary and the time of the last operation received by the
       secondary. Excessive replication lag diminishes the worth of
       failover nodes and adversely affects the latency for write
       operations using a majority write concern or any value greater
       than one. We recommend setting an alert to trigger if lag exceeds
       more than a few tens of seconds persistently for more than a few
       minutes. 

   * - Replication Oplog Window 
     - Represents how long a Secondary can be down before losing its
       ability to catch up to the Primary. We recommend a minimum value
       of 72 to 96 hours for this metric. Note that a value less than 24
       hours might be risky. 

   * - Connections 
     - Represents the number of connected sockets the server is actively
       servicing, including sockets used for heartbeats and replication
       between members. Configure an alert to X% above the peak
       observed. Value must never be zero.

       If the connections have increased:

       - Due to slowly increasing workload, re-evaluate the alert threshold.
       - Suddenly, pinpoint the cause in time on the graph to the
         nearest 10 seconds and investigate the cause for the change.
       - Because of other factors such as slow query response, the, the
         increase might be because an application response to slow
         queries which could trigger a connection storm. Review your
         application connection limits.

   * - Query Targeting 
     - Ratio of number of keys and documents scanned to the number of
       documents returned, averaged by second. A high level of this
       metric means that the query subsystem has to perform many
       inefficient scans to fulfill queries, probably because there are
       no appropriate indexes to support queries, or new queries have
       been introduced, or new data has been added to the system that
       the performance threshold is noticeable. Use the Performance
       Advisor to observe the specific operations that are noticeably
       contributing to the alert.  

   * - System CPU (%)
     - Measure of CPU utilization on the host operating system.
       Configure an alert if there is a spike in X% of steady state
       value after several minutes. If CPU changes dramatically, it
       could be due to a change in load patterns, which indicates that a
       larger CPU might be needed to handle the extra load. 

   * - Disk Space Used (%)
     - Measure of used disk space for MongoDB related files. We
       recommend an alert at a threshold that would indicate the system
       is running out of free space. Check the usage by using MongoDB
       Compass or the Data Explorer in your |service| {+cluster+}. Use

   * - Disk I/O Utilization (%)
     - Measure of disk IO utilization on the host operating system. High
       disk utilization could be the results of memory exhaustion, high
       write load, or unusual load churn. Writes can't complete until
       the disk confirms receipt of the data, which means that large
       data import or other batch job might become limited by the speed
       of the disk. Configure an alert for sustained utilization over
       80% for several minutes. Check the Opcounters and Query Targeting
       graphs to get some insight into what sort of unexpected load is
       occurring. 

   * - No Primary, Mongos
     - |service| has an alerting mechanism if a deployment doesn't have
       a primary or Mongos.

Recommendations for Monitoring by Using the {+atlas-ui+} 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| provides several tools that allow you to proactively monitor and
improve the performance of your database. 

Real-Time Performance Panel
```````````````````````````

The Real-Time Performance Panel (RTPP) in the {+atlas-ui+} provides
insights into current network traffic, database operations, and hardware
statistics about the hosts at a one second granularity in the
{+atlas-ui+}. We recommend that you use :abbr:`RTPP (Real-Time
Performance Panel)` to:   

- Visually identify relevant database operations
- Evaluate query execution times 
- Evaluate the ratio of documents scanned to documents returned
- Monitor network load and throughput
- Discover potential replication lag on secondary members of replica sets
- Kill operations before they have completed to free up valuable resources

To learn more, see :ref:`real-time-metrics-status-tab`.

Query Profiler 
``````````````

The Query Profiler identifies slow queries and bottlenecks, and suggests
index refinement and query restructuring to improve the performance of
your database. It provides visibility into the slowest operations over 
a 24-hour window in the {+atlas-ui+}, making it easier to identify
trends and outliers in query efficiency. We recommend that you use this
data to pinpoint and troubleshoot poorly performing queries, reducing 
performance overhead. 

To learn more, see :ref:`query-profiler`.

Performance Advisor 
```````````````````

The Performance Advisor automatically analyzes logs for slow-running
queries and recommends indexes to create and drop. It analyzes slow
queries and provides index suggestions for individual collections,
ranked by a calculated impact score, and tailored to your workload. This
gives you an easy, instantaneous way to make high-impact performance
improvements. We recommend that you monitor regularly, focus on slow
queries, and enable the profiler selectively to minimize overhead.

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+}, and the {+atlas-admin-api+}
to view slow queries and suggestions for improving the performance of
your queries from the Performance Advisor.

To learn more, see :ref:`performance-advisor`.

Namespace Insights 
``````````````````

The Namespace Insights page in the {+atlas-ui+} allows you to monitor
collection-level performance and usage metrics. It displays metrics
(such as the number of CRUD operations on the collection) and statistics
(like average query execution time) for certain hosts and operation
types for the collections that you pin for monitoring. This gives you
more granular visibility into collection-level performance, which you
can use to optimize database performance, resolve issues, and make
decisions about scaling, indexing, and query tuning. 

To learn more, see :ref:`namespace-insights`.
