This tutorial takes you through the steps of setting up and querying
an |fts| index. You will use a collection with movie data
from the |service| :ref:`sample data set <sample-data>`.

.. note:: Feature Unavailable in {+Serverless-Instances+}

   {+Serverless-instances+} don't support this feature at this time. To 
   learn more, see :ref:`{+Serverless-Instance+} Limitations 
   <serverless-instance-limitations>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial you will need:

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version 4.2 or higher

- The :ref:`sample datasets <sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  {+cluster+}

- One of the following clients to run queries on your |service|
  {+cluster+}:

  - :ref:`Search Tester <atlas-search-query-ui>`
  - {+mongosh+}
  - {+Compass+}
  - :driver:`C# Driver </csharp/current/>`
  - :driver:`Go Driver </go/current/>`
  - :driver:`Java Sync Driver </java/sync/current/>`
  - :driver:`Kotlin Coroutine Driver </kotlin/coroutine/current/>`
  - :driver:`Node.js Driver </node/current/>`
  - :driver:`PyMongo Driver </pymongo/>`
  - :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} </install-atlas-cli/>`

Next Steps 
----------

Choose one of the following ways to create your |fts| index:

- :ref:`fts-tutorial-index-creation-ui`
- :ref:`fts-tutorial-index-creation-api`
- :ref:`fts-tutorial-index-creation-atlas-cli`
- :ref:`fts-tutorial-index-creation-compass`
- :ref:`mongosh <fts-tutorial-index-creation-programatically>`
- :ref:`MongoDB Driver <fts-tutorial-index-creation-programatically>`

.. note:: 

   To learn more about |fts|, you can take Unit 1 of the
   :mdbu-course:`Atlas Search Course on MongoDB University
   </learning-paths/atlas-search>`. The 2.25
   hour unit includes an overview of |fts| and lessons on how to create
   |fts| indexes, use :pipeline:`$search` with different operators, and
   generate search :ref:`facets <fts-facet-ref>`. 

**Prefer to learn by watching?**

Watch an overview of |service| and |fts| and get started setting up
|fts| for your data. The video demonstrates how to load sample data on
your {+cluster+}, create an |fts| index, and run a sample query using
:guilabel:`Search Tester` and :guilabel:`Data Explorer`.
