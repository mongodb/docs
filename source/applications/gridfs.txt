.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`GridFS` is a specification for storing and retrieving files
that exceed the :term:`BSON`\-document :ref:`size limit
<limit-bson-document-size>` of 16MB.

Instead of storing a file in an single document, GridFS divides a file
into parts, or chunks, [#chunk-disambiguation]_ and stores each of
those chunks as a separate document. By default GridFS limits chunk
size to 256k. GridFS uses two collections to store files. One
collection stores the file chunks, and the other stores file metadata.

When you query a GridFS store for a file, the driver or client will
reassemble the chunks as needed. You can perform range queries on
files stored through GridFS.  You also can access information from
arbitrary sections of files, which allows you to "skip" into the
middle of a video or audio file.

GridFS is useful not only for storing files that exceed 16MB but also
for storing any files for which you want access without having to load
the entire file into memory. For more information on the indications
of GridFS, see :ref:`faq-developers-when-to-use-gridfs`.

.. [#chunk-disambiguation] The use of the term *chunks* in the context
   of GridFS is not related to the use of the term *chunks* in
   the context of sharding.

Implement GridFS
----------------

To store and retrieve files using :term:`GridFS`, use either of the following:

- A MongoDB driver. See the :doc:`drivers</applications/drivers>`
  documentation for information on using GridFS with your driver.

- The :program:`mongofiles` command-line tool in the :program:`mongo`
  shell. See :doc:`/reference/mongofiles`.

GridFS Collections
------------------

:term:`GridFS` stores files in two collections:

- ``chunks`` stores the binary chunks. For details, see
  :ref:`gridfs-chunks-collection`.

- ``files`` stores the file's metadata. For details, see
  :ref:`gridfs-files-collection`.

GridFS places the collections in a common bucket by prefixing each
with the bucket name. By default, GridFS uses two collections with
names prefixed by ``fs`` bucket:

- ``fs.files``
- ``fs.chunks``

You can choose a different bucket name than ``fs``, and create
multiple buckets in a single database.

.. index:: GridFS; chunks collection
.. _gridfs-chunks-collection:

The ``chunks`` Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in the ``chunks`` collection represents a distinct chunk
of a file as represented in the :term:`GridFS` store. The following is a
prototype document from the ``chunks`` collection.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : <string>,
     "files_id" : <string>,
     "n" : <num>,
     "data" : <binary>
   }

A document from the ``chunks`` collection contains the following fields:

.. data:: chunks._id

   The unique :term:`ObjectID` of the chunk.

.. data:: chunks.files_id

   The ``_id`` of the "parent" document, as specified in the ``files``
   collection.

.. data:: chunks.n

   The sequence number of the chunk. GridFS numbers all chunks,
   starting with 0.

.. data:: chunks.data

   The chunk's payload as a :term:`BSON` binary type.

The ``chunks`` collection uses a :term:`compound index` on
``files_id`` and ``n``, as described in :ref:`gridfs-index`.

.. index:: GridFS; files collection
.. _gridfs-files-collection:

The ``files`` Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in the ``files`` collection represents a file in the
:term:`GridFS` store. Consider the following prototype of a document in
the ``files`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : <ObjectID>,
     "length" : <num>,
     "chunkSize" : <num>
     "uploadDate" : <timestamp>
     "md5" : <hash>

     "filename" : <string>,
     "contentType" : <string>,
     "aliases" : <string array>,
     "metadata" : <dataObject>,
   }

Documents in the ``files`` collection contain some or all of the
following fields. Applications may create additional arbitrary fields:

.. data:: files._id

   The unique ID for this document. The ``_id`` is of the data type you
   chose for the original document. The default type for MongoDB
   documents is :term:`BSON` :term:`ObjectID`.

.. data:: files.length

   The size of the document in bytes.

.. data:: files.chunkSize

   The size of each chunk. GridFS divides the document into chunks of
   the size specified here. The default size is 256 kilobytes.

.. data:: files.uploadDate

   The date the document was first stored by GridFS. This value has the
   ``Date`` type.

.. data:: files.md5

   An MD5 hash returned from the filemd5 API. This value has the ``String``
   type.

.. data:: files.filename

   Optional. A human-readable name for the document.

.. data:: files.contentType

   Optional. A valid MIME type for the document.

.. data:: files.aliases

   Optional. An array of alias strings.

.. data:: files.metadata

   Optional. Any additional information you want to store.

.. index:: GridFS; index
.. _gridfs-index:

GridFS Index
------------

:term:`GridFS` uses a :term:`unique <unique index>`, :term:`compound
<compound index>` index on the ``chunks`` collection for ``files_id``
and ``n``. The index allows efficient retrieval of chunks using the
``files_id`` and ``n`` values, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cursor = db.fs.chunks.find({files_id: myFileID}).sort({n:1});

See the relevant :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation
for the specific behavior of your GridFS application. If your driver
does not create this index, issue the following operation using the
:program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fs.chunks.ensureIndex( { files_id: 1, n: 1 }, { unique: true } );

Example Interface
-----------------

The following is an example of the GridFS interface in Java. The example
is for demonstration purposes only. For API specifics, see the relevant
:doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation.

By default, the interface must support the default GridFS bucket, named
``fs``, as in the following: 

.. code-block:: java

   GridFS myFS = new GridFS(myDatabase); // returns default GridFS bucket (e.g. "fs"  collection)
   myFS.storeFile(new File("/tmp/largething.mpg")); // saves the file to "fs" GridFS bucket

Optionally, interfaces may support other additional GridFS buckets as
in the following example: 

.. code-block:: java

   GridFS myContracts = new GridFS(myDatabase, "contracts"); // returns GridFS bucket named "contracts" 
   myFS.retrieveFile("smithco", new File("/tmp/smithco.pdf")); // retrieve GridFS object "smithco"
