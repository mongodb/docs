  Use the :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/get-one-host-by-hostname-port`
  resource to find the process and retrieve the ``id`` value.
 
  Learn What This Step Does
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/get-one-host-by-hostname-port`
  resource uses the hostname and port you specify to find the process. Then, it
  returns information about this process. You can find the ``id`` needed for the
  next step in the response.

  Issue This Command
  ++++++++++++++++++

  Copy the following curl command. Paste it into your preferred terminal or
  console. Replace the displayed placeholders with these values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 25 75

     * - Placeholder
       - Description

     * - ``{PUBLIC-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-public-key.rst

     * - ``{PRIVATE-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-private-key.rst

     * - ``{PROJECT-ID}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-project-id.rst

     * - ``{HOSTNAME}``
       - Primary hostname that |mms| uses to connect to the instance.
         This may be a hostname, an |fqdn|, an |ipv4| address, or an |ipv6|
         address.

     * - ``{PORT}``
       - Port on which the process listens.
  
  Replace the placeholders in the command, then execute it.
 
  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --request GET "https://{+cloudmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/hosts/byName/{HOSTNAME}:{PORT}"

  Copy the Host's ID
  ++++++++++++++++++

  In the response body, copy the value returned in the ``id`` field. You need the
  value for the next step.

  .. example::

     .. code-block:: json
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 12

        {
          "alertsEnabled" : true,
          "aliases": [ "server1.example.com:27017", "203.0.113.3:27017" ],
          "authMechanismName" : "SCRAM-SHA-1",
          "clusterId" : "<cluster-ID-1>",
          "created" : "2021-04-22T19:56:50Z",
          "groupId" : "<project-ID-1>",
          "hasStartupWarnings" : false,
          "hidden" : false,
          "hostEnabled" : true,
          "hostname" : "server1.example.com",
          "id" : "{HOST-ID}",
          "ipAddress": "203.0.113.3",
        }

title: "Stop monitoring the process that matches the host ID."
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: use-id-remove-process-api
content: |

  Use the :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/delete-one-host` resource
  to stop monitoring the host.

  Learn What This Step Does
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/delete-one-host` resource
  doesn't actually delete the host.
  The resource deletes the host from the list of hosts that |mms| monitors. This
  removes the process from monitoring.

  Issue This Command
  ++++++++++++++++++

  Copy the following curl command. Paste it into your preferred terminal or
  console. Replace the displayed placeholders with these values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 25 75

     * - Placeholder
       - Description

     * - ``{PUBLIC-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-public-key.rst

     * - ``{PRIVATE-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-private-key.rst

     * - ``{PROJECT-ID}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-project-id.rst
  
     * - ``{HOST-ID}``
       - Unique identifier of the host for the process. Use the ``id`` from
         step 1.
  
  Replace the placeholders in the command, then execute it.

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --request DELETE "https://{+cloudmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/hosts/{HOST-ID}"

title: "Verify that |mms| no longer monitors the process."
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: verify-no-longer-monitor-api
content: |

  Use the :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/get-one-host-by-hostname-port`
  resource again to attempt to find the process using its hostname and port. Then, verify
  that ``details`` returns ``No host with hostname
  and port {HOSTNAME}:{PORT} exists in group {PROJECT-ID}``.
  
  Learn What This Step Does
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The :doc:`/reference/api/hosts/get-one-host-by-hostname-port`
  resource uses the hostname and port you specify to find the process. Then, it
  returns information about this process. You can tell that |mms| doesn't monitor
  the process if the ``details`` value in the response is ``No host with hostname
  and port {HOSTNAME}:{PORT} exists in group {PROJECT-ID}``.
  This means that |mms| can't find the host in the
  list of processes that it monitors.

  Issue This Command
  ++++++++++++++++++

  Copy the following curl command. Paste it into your preferred terminal or
  console. Replace the displayed placeholders with these values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 25 75

     * - Placeholder
       - Description
       
     * - ``{PUBLIC-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-public-key.rst

     * - ``{PRIVATE-KEY}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-private-key.rst

     * - ``{PROJECT-ID}``
       - .. include:: /includes/api/list-tables/tutorials/list-rows/list-table-placeholders-project-id.rst

     * - ``{HOSTNAME}``
       - Primary hostname that |mms| uses to connect to this
         instance. This may be a hostname, an FQDN, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6
         address.
                
     * - ``{PORT}``
       - Port on which the process listens.
   
  Replace the placeholders in the command, then execute it.

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --request GET "https://{+cloudmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/hosts/byName/{HOSTNAME}:{PORT}"

  Check the Response Details
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  In the response body, check the value returned in the ``details`` field. If
  ``details`` returns ``No host with hostname
  and port {HOSTNAME}:{PORT} exists in group {PROJECT-ID}``, you succeeded. |mms| no longer monitors the process.
