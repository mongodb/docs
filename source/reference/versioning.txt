MongoDB Versioning
==================

.. important:: 

   Always upgrade to the latest stable revision of your release series.

MongoDB versioning has the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y`` refers to the
release series and ``Z`` refers to the patch number.

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, MongoDB is released as two different release
series:

- Long Term Support (LTS) Releases
- Continuous Releases

Long Term Support (LTS) Releases
--------------------------------

Long Term Support (LTS) Releases are made available approximately once
a year, and generally mark the introduction of new features and
improvements that may break backwards compatibility. Long Term Support
Releases are appropriate for all MongoDB deployments.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0``
- ``6.0``

Continuous Releases
-------------------

Continuous Releases are made available approximately once each quarter
that does not contain an :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` release, and
generally mark the introduction of new features and improvements.
Continuous Releases are designed for use with `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`_, and are not
generally supported for use in an on-premise capacity. Continuous
Releases are not available for use with `MongoDB Ops Manager
<https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/?tck=docs_server>`_, and
are not supported for :ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>`. If
arbiters are part of your MongoDB deployment, use the most recent
:abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` release instead.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.1``
- ``5.2``
- ``5.3``

Patch Releases
--------------

Patch Releases are made available as needed to both
:abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` and Continuous Releases, and generally
include bug fixes and backwards-compatible changes.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.1`` (an LTS patch release)
- ``5.2.1`` (a Continuous patch release)

Release Candidate (RC) Releases
-------------------------------

In advance of new :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` or Continuous
Releases, Release Candidates are made available for early testing. A
Release Candidate represents a version of the upcoming release that is
stable enough to begin testing, but is not suitable for production
deployment.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.0-rc0``
- ``5.0.0-rc1``
- ``5.1.2-rc5``

Driver Versions
---------------

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the :ecosystem:`MongoDB drivers </drivers>`.

MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
---------------------------

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, the `MongoDB Shell
<https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/>`__ (``mongosh``) is released
separately from the MongoDB Server, and uses its own version numbering
system.

Database Tools
--------------

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the `MongoDB Database Tools
<https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools>`__ are released separately
from the MongoDB Server, and use their own version numbering system.
