.. Substitute with either Upgrade or Downgrade

|action| Procedure
------------------

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you have ``text`` or ``2dsphere`` indexes,
you can only downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or later.

**Except** as described on this page, moving between 2.4 and 2.6 is a
drop-in replacement:
