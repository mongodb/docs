You can require that the {+mdbagent+} verifies the signature file after it 
downloads the MongoDB binary by enabling a setting in the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`. 
Once you enable signature verification, the {+mdbagent+} requires signature files 
for all MongoDB deployments that your |onprem| instance manages. 
You can enable signature verification for 
:ref:`local or remote deployments <om-local-mode>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your |onprem| server must run over |https| so the {+mdbagent+} downloads the 
signature files. To learn more, see :ref:`config-https`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step::

      In the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`, add 
      :opsmgrkube:`spec.configuration.mms.featureFlag.automation.verifyDownloads` and set to ``enabled``. 
      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         spec:
           configuration:
             mms.featureFlag.automation.verifyDownloads=enabled

      .. note::
      
         Once you enable signature verification, the {+mdbagent+} requires signature 
         files for all MongoDB binaries that it downloads. 

   .. step::

      Ensure the {+mdbagent+} can locate the MongoDB binary and its signature (.sig) 
      file from the same directory, the location of which depends on whether your 
      deployment is :ref:`local or remote <om-local-mode>`.

      .. tabs::

           .. tab:: Remote
              :tabid: remote

              If your |onprem| instance can access the Internet or a custom |https| 
              server and you download the MongoDB binary from the official sources, 
              the {+mdbagent+} automatically downloads the signature file along with 
              the MongoDB binary.

              If you don't download the MongoDB binary from the official sources, 
              configure your |https| server to locate the MongoDB binary and its 
              signature file from the same link.

           .. tab:: Local
              :tabid: local

              If your |onprem| instance can't access the Internet, the MongoDB binary 
              and its signature file are stored in ``/mongodb-ops-manager/mongodb-releases/``
              by default. Ensure the signature file is named the same as the MongoDB 
              binary and both are in the same directory. For example: 

              .. code-block:: sh

                 /mongodb-ops-manager/mongodb-releases/mongodb-linux-x86_64-rhel80-8.0.0.tgz.sig
                 /mongodb-ops-manager/mongodb-releases/mongodb-linux-x86_64-rhel80-8.0.0.tgz

   .. step::

      Save and apply the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`.

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl apply -f <my-ops-manager-resource-specification>.yaml
      
      After you've applied the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`, the {+mdbagent+} performs a 
      :ref:`rolling restart <rolling-restart-faq>` on the cluster nodes, reconciling 
      the changes.
