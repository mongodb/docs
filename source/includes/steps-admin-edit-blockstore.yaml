  In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection` column, update any values that
  need to be changed in the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Field

       - Contents

     * - <hostname>:<port>

       - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the blockstore
         database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

         .. important::

            If these hosts are changed, the blockstore database they
            host must have the same data as the original blockstore
            database. Changing the host to a new blockstore
            databases results in data loss.

         - If the blockstore database is a Replica Set or Sharded
           Cluster, type a comma-separated list of :program:`mongod`
           instances (for a Replica Set) or :program:`mongos`
           instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

           .. example::

              ``host1.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27018``

         - If the blockstore database is a standalone MongoDB
           instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

     * - MongoDB Auth Username

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-username.rst

     * - MongoDB Auth Password

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-password.rst

         .. include:: /includes/warning-plaintext-password.rst

         .. note::

            |onprem| doesn't display the existing
            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.

     * - Encrypted Credentials

       - Select if the Username and Password for the database were
         encrypted using the :doc:`credentialstool </tutorial/encrypt-user-credentials>`.

     * - Use TLS/SSL

       - Select if the blockstore database requires |tls| encryption.

         Beyond this checkbox, to connect this blockstore using |tls|,
         you must enable
         :manual:`TLS on the blockstore database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

     * - Connection Options

       - Type any additional :ref:`connection string options
         <connections-connection-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
         This field supports unescaped values only.

     * - Assignment Labels

       - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
         blockstores to specific projects.

     * - Blockstore Max Capacity (GB)

       - Type a maximum size for a blockstore.

     * - Load Factor

       - Type any positive integer that expresses how much backup work
         you want this snapshot store to perform compared to another
         snapshot store.

         .. important::
            If you have only one snapshot store, skip this setting.

         Backup work includes running backups, restoring snapshots or
         :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores. The term of backup work
         ratio assigned to a single snapshot store is called its *Load
         Factor*.

         By default, |mms| assigns each snapshot store a
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1``. This means each snapshot
         store would perform the same amount of backup work.

         As a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` increases, it
         performs more backup work compared to another snapshot store.
         If the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store ``A`` is set
         to ``2`` and the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store
         ``B`` is set to ``1``, ``A`` performs two times the backup
         work of ``B``.

         .. example:: **How to estimate Load Factor**

            Consider a five-shard sharded cluster with the
            following backup storage configuration:

            - File system store (``F``) manages the backup work for
              one shard in the cluster. ``F`` is running on a single
              two-core physical server.

            - Blockstore (``B``) manages the backup work for four
              shards in the cluster. ``B`` is running as a four-node
              sharded cluster on four physical servers with two cores
              on each server.

            In this example, ``B`` has four times the capability of
            ``F``. ``B`` should receive the greater part of the ratio
            of backup work: ``4:1``. For every one backup task ``F``
            performs, ``B`` performs ``4``.

            Set the Load Factors of ``B`` to ``4`` and ``F`` to ``1``.

         Snapshot stores with greater compute or storage performance
         should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`:

         - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB of RAM can
           back up more databases in less time than a file system
           store with only 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM.

         - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
           up more databases and groom more databases than a
           blockstore backed by a single replica set.

         :guilabel:`Load Factor` can be set to ``0``. When one
         snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, it
         performs no backup work at all. If a snapshot store's
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while backup work is in
         progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
         are allowed to finish. All future backup work then is re-
         distributed among the remaining snapshot stores with a
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and have
         :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected.

     * - Write Concern

       - Select your preferred
         :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

  Select if you want to enable this blockstore after creating it. This

  If you change any connection string values or the Write Concern,
  restart all the |onprem| instances including those running Backup
  Daemons.

  .. warning::

     Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for
     an existing blockstore requires you to restart all |onprem|
     components, including those only running the Backup Daemon to
     apply those changes. Connection parameters include:

     - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
     - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`
     - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`
     - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
     - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

     If you change to another blockstore host, the data on the existing
     blockstore is not copied automatically to the other blockstore.
