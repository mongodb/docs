You can insert multiple documents into a collection by calling the ``insert()``
method on an Eloquent model or a query builder.

To insert multiple documents, call the ``insert()`` method and specify the new documents
as an array inside the method call. Each array entry contains a single document's field
values.

.. tip::

   To learn more about insert operations, see the
   :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-insert-documents` section 
   of the Write Operations guide.

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database 
      - Inserts documents into the ``movies`` collection
      - Prints whether the insert operation succeeds
      
      The example calls the ``insert()`` method to insert documents that represent
      movies released in ``2023``. If the insert operation is
      successful, it returns a value of ``1``. If the operation fails, it throws
      an exception.
      
      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true
      
         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/InsertManyTest.php
            :start-after: begin-eloquent-insert-many
            :end-before: end-eloquent-insert-many
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Insert operation success: yes

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Inserts documents into the ``movies`` collection
      - Prints whether the insert operation succeeds

      The example calls the ``insert()`` method to insert documents that represent
      movies released in ``2023``. If the insert operation is
      successful, it returns a value of ``1``. If the operation fails, it throws
      an exception.

            :end-before: end-qb-insert-many

            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false

            Insert operation success: yes
