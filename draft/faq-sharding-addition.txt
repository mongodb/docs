For high-volume inserts, when is it necessary to first pre-split data?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether to pre-split before a high-volume insert depends on the
:term:`shard key`, the existing distribution of :term:`chunks <chunk>`,
and how evenly distributed the insert operation is.

In the following cases, we recommend pre-splitting before a large insert:

- Inserting data into an empty collection

  If a collection is empty, the database takes time to determine the
  optimal key distribution. If you insert many documents in rapid
  succession, MongoDB initially directs writes to a single chunk, which
  can affect performance. Predefining splits improves write performance
  in the early stages of a bulk import by eliminating the database's
  "learning" period.

- Data is not evenly distributed

  Even if the sharded collection contains existing documents balanced
  over multiple chunks, :term:`pre-splitting` is beneficial if the write
  operation itself isn't evenly distributed, i.e., if the inserts
  include shard-key values that are contained on only a small number of
  chunks. By pre-splitting and using an increasing shard key, you can
  prevent writes from monopolizing a single :term:`shard`.

- Monotonically increasing shard key.

  If you attempt to insert data with monotonically increasing shard
  keys, the writes will always occur on the last chunk in the
  collection. Predefining splits helps to cycle a large write operation
  around the cluster; however, pre-splitting in this instance will not
  prevent consecutive inserts from hitting a single shard.

Pre-splitting might *not* be necessary in the following cases:

- If data insertion is not rapid, MongoDB may have enough time to split
  and migrate chunks without affecting performance.

- If the collection already has chunks with an even key distribution,
  pre-splitting may not be necessary.
