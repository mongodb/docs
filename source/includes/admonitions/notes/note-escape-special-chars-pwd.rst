.. note::
        The connection string displayed in the console uses a placeholder
        value for the password. Replace that placeholder with the password
        specified when you created your database user.

        If the password contains reserved URI characters, you must
        escape the characters. For example,
        if your password is ``@bc123``, you must escape the ``@``
        character when specifying the password in the connection
        string, such as ``%40bc123``. To learn
        more, see :ref:`special-pass-characters`.
