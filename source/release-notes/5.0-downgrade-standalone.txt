Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control
--------------

If your deployment has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required privileges.
      
Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings. These include:

1. Cluster Default Read and Write Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 5.0 changed the default value for cluster-wide read and write
concerns, and downgrading to MongoDB 4.4 might change those defaults
back. Consider manually configuring your cluster's default read and
write concern before downgrading:

- To manually configure a default value for a cluster's read or write
  concern, use the :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` command.

- If your cluster includes an :doc:`arbiter
  </core/replica-set-arbiter>`, and you had previously disabled
  ``"Majority"`` read concern to prevent cache pressure in certain
  situations, you may want to configure
  :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern false
  <mongod --enableMajorityReadConcern>` or
  :setting:`replication.enableMajorityReadConcern: false
  <replication.enableMajorityReadConcern>` once you downgrade.

2. Document Fields with ``.`` or ``$`` Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 5.0 adds support for including the ``.`` or ``$`` characters in
document field names. You must delete any documents containing field
names that include the ``.`` or ``$`` characters before downgrading
to MongoDB 4.4.

3. Slim-format Timezone Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 5.0 enables support for slim-format timezone data files. If
using slim-format timezone data files in your deployment, as provided
to MongoDB with the :option:`--timeZoneInfo <mongod --timeZoneInfo>`
command line option or :setting:`processManagement.timeZoneInfo`
configuration file setting, you must downgrade to MongoDB 4.4.7 or
later, or else revert your timezone data files to use the previous
non-slim-format data files.

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

.. _5.0-downgrade-feature-compatibility-standalone:

4. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your standalone:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/5.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

5. Remove fCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

Time-series Collections
  Remove all :ref:`time series collections
  <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Runtime Audit Filter Management
  - Disable Runtime Audit Filter Management by setting  
    ``auditLog.runtimeConfiguration`` to ``false`` in the node's
    configuration file.

  - Update the audit filters for this instance in the local
    configuration file.

.. |binary| replace:: the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

6. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- If any view definitions include 5.0 operators, such as
  :expression:`$dateAdd` or :expression:`$sampleRate`, they must be
  removed. See :ref:`5.0-rel-notes-new-agg-operators` for the full list.

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that the
   prerequisites have been completed.
