Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover
=====================================

   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the
member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`.
A rollback is necessary only if the primary had accepted write
operations that the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not**
successfully replicated before the primary stepped down. When the
primary rejoins the set as a secondary, it reverts, or "rolls back," its
write operations to maintain database consistency with the other
members.

MongoDB attempts to avoid rollbacks, which should be rare. When a
rollback does occur, it is often the result of a network
partition. Secondaries that can not keep up with the throughput of
operations on the former primary, increase the size and impact of the
rollback.

A rollback does *not* occur if the write operations replicate to another
member of the replica set before the primary steps down *and* if that
member remains available and accessible to a majority of the replica
set.

Collect Rollback Data
---------------------

When a rollback does occur, MongoDB writes the rollback data to
:term:`BSON` files in the ``rollback/`` folder under the database's
:setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory. The names of rollback files have
the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <database>.<collection>.<timestamp>.bson

For example:

.. code-block:: none

   records.accounts.2011-05-09T18-10-04.0.bson

To read the contents of the rollback files, use :doc:`bsondump
</reference/program/bsondump>`. Based on the content and the knowledge
of their applications, administrators can decide the next course of
action to take.

Avoid Replica Set Rollbacks
---------------------------

For replica sets, the default :doc:`write concern {w: 1}
</reference/write-concern>` only provides acknowledgement of write
operations on the primary. With the default write concern, data may be
rolled back if the primary steps down before the write operations have
replicated to any of the secondaries.

To prevent rollbacks of data that have been acknowledged to the client,
run all voting members with journaling enabled and use :ref:`w:
majority write concern <wc-w>` to guarantee that the write operations
propagate to a majority of the replica set nodes before returning with
acknowledgement to the issuing client.

Rollback Considerations
-----------------------

Background Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB waits for any in-progress
:ref:`background index builds <index-creation-background>` to finish
before starting a rollback.

Size Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB has no limit on the amount of data
that can be rolled back.

In previous versions, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance will not
roll back more than 300 megabytes of data and requires manual
intervention if more than 300 megabytes of data need to be rolled back.


Time Elapsed Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Starting in version 4.0, the server parameter
:parameter:`rollbackTimeLimitSecs` allows the setting of the maximum
time allowed from the common point to the last point in the oplog of the
replica set member that is indicated for rollback.

In previous versions, the rollback time limit is not configurable and is
set to 30 minutes.
