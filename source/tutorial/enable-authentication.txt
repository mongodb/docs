Overview
--------

Enabling access control on a MongoDB deployment enforces
authentication, requiring users to identify themselves. When accessing
a MongoDB deployment that has access control enabled, users can only
perform actions as determined by their roles.

For authentication, MongoDB supports various
:doc:`/core/authentication-mechanisms`.

The following tutorial enables access control on a standalone
:program:`mongod` instance and uses the :ref:`default authentication
mechanism <authentication-mechanism-default>`.

Replica sets and sharded clusters
---------------------------------

Replica sets and sharded clusters require internal authentication
between members when access control is enabled. For more details,
please see :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication`.

User Administrator
------------------

With access control enabled, ensure you have a user with
:authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role in the
``admin`` database. This user can administrate user and roles such as:
create users, grant or revoke roles from users, and create or modify
customs roles.

You can create users either before or after enabling access control. If
you enable access control before creating any user, MongoDB provides a
:ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` which allows you to
create a user administrator in the ``admin`` database. Once created,
you must authenticate as the user administrator to create additional
users as needed.

Procedure
---------

The following procedure first adds a user administrator to a MongoDB
instance running without access control and then enables access control.
