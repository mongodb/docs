   .. step:: Generate embeddings from your data. 

      You can use an embedding model provider to generate ``float``,
      ``int8``, and ``int1`` embeddings for your data and then use the
      :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </drivers/java/sync/current/>` to
      convert your native vector embedding to |bson| vectors. The
      following sample code uses Cohere's ``embed`` |api| to generate
      full-precision vectors.  

      a. Create a new file named ``GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings.java``
         in your Java project. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings.java

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the
         ``GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings.java`` file. 
      
         This code does the following:

         - Generates the ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``ubinary`` vector
           embeddings by using Cohere's ``embed`` |api|.
         - Converts the embeddings to |bson| ``binData`` vectors by using
           :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </drivers/java/sync/current/>`. 
         - Creates a file named ``embeddings.json`` and saves the data
           with embeddings in the file to upload to |service|.  

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/bson-bindata-vectors/get-convert-embeddings-new-data.java
            :language: java
            :caption: GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings.java
            :linenos: 
            :copyable: true
     
      #. Replace the ``COHERE_API_KEY`` placeholder value in the code
         if you didn't set the environment variable and save
         the file. 

      #. Compile and run the file using your application run
         configuration.
         
         If you are using a terminal, run the following commands to
         compile and execute your program. 

         .. io-code-block:: 
            :copyable: true 

            .. input:: 
               :language: shell 

               javac GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings.java 
               java GenerateAndConvertEmbeddings

            .. output:: 
               :language: shell 

               BSON embeddings saved to embeddings.json

      #. Verify the embeddings in the ``embeddings.json`` file.

      To learn more about generating embeddings and converting the
      embeddings to ``binData`` vectors, see :ref:`create-vector-embeddings`.

   .. step:: Ingest the data and create an {+avs+} index. 

      You must upload your data and embeddings to a collection in your
      |service| {+cluster+} and create an {+avs+} index on the data to
      run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries against the data. 

      a. Create a new file named ``UploadDataAndCreateIndex.java``
         in your Java project. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch UploadDataAndCreateIndex.java

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the
         ``UploadDataAndCreateIndex.java`` file. 
      
         This code does the following:

         - Uploads the data in the ``embeddings.json`` file to your
           |service| {+cluster+}. 
         - Creates an {+avs+} index on the ``embeddings_float32``,
           ``embeddings_int8``, and ``embeddings_int1`` fields. 

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/bson-bindata-vectors/upload-create-index-new-data.java
            :language: java
            :caption: UploadDataAndCreateIndex.java
            :linenos: 
            :copyable: true

      #. Replace the following placeholder values in the code and save
         the file. 

         .. list-table:: 
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - ``MONGODB_URI``
              - Your |service| {+cluster+} connection string if you
                didn't set the environment variable. 

            * - ``<DATABASE-NAME>``
              - Name of the database in your |service| {+cluster+}. 

            * - ``<COLLECTION-NAME>``
              - Name of the collection where you want to upload the data. 

            * - ``<INDEX-NAME>``
              - Name of the {+avs+} index for the collection. 

      #. Compile and run the file using your application run
         configuration.
         
         If you are using a terminal, run the following commands to
         compile and execute your program. 

         .. io-code-block:: 
            :copyable: true 

            .. input:: 
               :language: shell 

               javac UploadDataAndCreateIndex.java 
               java UploadDataAndCreateIndex

            .. output:: 
               :language: shell 

               Inserted documents into MongoDB
               Successfully created vector index named: <INDEX_NAME>
               It may take up to a minute for the index to leave the BUILDING status and become queryable.
               Polling to confirm the index has changed from the BUILDING status.
               <INDEX_NAME> index is ready to query

      #. Log in to your |service| {+cluster+} and verify the following:
      
         - Data in the namespace.
         - {+avs+} index for the collection.

   .. step:: Create and run a query against the collection. 

      To test your embeddings, you can run a query against your
      collection. Use an embedding model provider to generate ``float``,
      ``int8``, and ``int1`` embeddings for your query text. The
      following sample code uses Cohere's ``embed`` |api| to generate
      full-precision vectors. After generating the embeddings, use the
      :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </drivers/java/sync/current/>` to
      convert your native vector embedding to |bson| vectors and run
      :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` query against the collection.

      a. Create a new file named ``CreateEmbeddingsAndRunQuery.java``
         in your Java project. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch CreateEmbeddingsAndRunQuery.java

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the
         ``CreateEmbeddingsAndRunQuery.java`` file. 
      
         This code does the following:

         - Generates the ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``ubinary`` vector
           embeddings by using Cohere's ``embed`` |api|.
         - Converts the embeddings to |bson| ``binData`` vectors by using
           :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </drivers/java/sync/current/>`. 
         - Runs the query against your collection.

      #. Replace the following placeholder values in the code and save
         the file. 

         .. list-table:: 
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - ``MONGODB_URI``
              - Your |service| {+cluster+} connection string if you
                didn't set the environment variable. 

            * - ``COHERE_API_KEY``
              - You Cohere |api| key if you didn't set the environment variable. 

            * - ``<DATABASE-NAME>``
              - Name of the database in your |service| {+cluster+}. 

            * - ``<COLLECTION-NAME>``
              - Name of the collection where you ingested the data. 

            * - ``<INDEX-NAME>``
              - Name of the {+avs+} index for the collection. 

            * - ``<DATA-FIELD-NAME>``
              - Name of the field that contain the text from which you
                generated embeddings. For this example, use ``text``. 

            * - ``<QUERY-TEXT>``
              - Text for the query. For this example, use ``science fact``. 

      #. Compile and run the file using your application run
         configuration.
      
         If you are using a terminal, run the following commands to
         compile and execute your program.
