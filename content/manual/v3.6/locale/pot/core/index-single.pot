msgid "MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a :term:`collection` of :term:`documents <document>`. By default, all collections have an index on the :ref:`_id field <index-type-id>`, and applications and users may add additional indexes to support important queries and operations."

msgid "You can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields differ from :ref:`indexes on embedded documents <index-embedded-documents>`, which include the full content up to the maximum :limit:`index size <Index Key>` of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields allow you to use a \"dot notation,\" to introspect into embedded documents."
