Rotate Log Files
================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When used with the :option:`--logpath` option or :setting:`systemLog.path` setting,
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances report
a live account of all activity and operations to a log file. 
When reporting activity data to a log file, by default, MongoDB only rotates logs
in response to the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command, or when the
:program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` process receives a ``SIGUSR1``
signal from the operating system.

MongoDB's standard log rotation approach archives the current
log file and starts a new one. To do this, the :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` instance renames the current log file by appending a
UTC timestamp to the filename, in :term:`ISODate` format. It then
opens a new log file, closes the old log file, and sends all new log
entries to the new log file.

You can also configure MongoDB to support the Linux/Unix
logrotate utility
by setting :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or
:option:`--logRotate` to ``reopen``. With ``reopen``, :program:`mongod`
or :program:`mongos` closes the log file, and
then reopens a log file with the same name, expecting that another
process renamed the file prior to rotation.

Finally, you can configure :program:`mongod` to send log data to the
``syslog``. using the :option:`--syslog` option. In this case, you can
take advantage of alternate logrotation tools.

   :ref:`monitoring-standard-loggging` section.

Default Log Rotation Behavior
-----------------------------

By default, MongoDB uses the
:option:`--logRotate rename <--logRotate>` behavior. 
With ``rename``, :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` renames the current log file by appending a UTC 
timestamp to the filename, opens a new log file, closes the old log file,
and sends all new log entries to the new log file.

Log Rotation with ``--logRotate reopen``
----------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

Log rotation with :option:`--logRotate reopen <--logRotate>` closes and opens
the log file following the typical Linux/Unix log rotate behavior.

.. include:: /includes/steps/log-rotate-reopen.rst

Syslog Log Rotation
-------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.2

With syslog log rotation, :program:`mongod` sends log data to the syslog
rather than writing it to a file.

.. include:: /includes/steps/log-rotate-syslog.rst

Forcing a Log Rotation with ``SIGUSR1``
---------------------------------------

For Linux and Unix-based systems, you can use the ``SIGURS1`` signal
to rotate the logs for a single process, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   kill -SIGUSR1 <mongod process id>
