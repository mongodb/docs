.. pipeline:: $cachedLookup

The :pipeline:`$cachedLookup` stage performs a left outer join of the
stream of messages from your :pipeline:`$source` to an {+service+}
collection in your :ref:`Connection Registry
<atlas-sp-manage-connections>`.

This stage functions similarly to the :ref:`$lookup
<atlas-sp-agg-lookup>` stage, but caches the results of your queries
according to configurable parameters.

.. important::

   ``$cachedLookup`` doesn't support the ``let`` or ``pipeline`` fields.

To learn more, see :manual:`$lookup Syntax 
</reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#syntax>`.

The following prototype form illustrates all available fields:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "$lookup": {
      "ttl": {
        "size": <int>,
        "unit": "ms" | "second" | "minute" | "hour" | "day"
      },
      "maxMemUsageBytes": <int>,
      "from": {
        "connectionName": "<registered-atlas-connection>",
        "db": "<registered-database-name>",
        "coll": "<atlas-collection-name>"
      },
      "localField": "<field-in-source-messages>",
      "foreignField": "<field-in-from-collection>",
      "as": "<output-array-field>"
    }  
  } 

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$cachedLookup` uses some of the same fields as the
generalized version of :pipeline:`$lookup`. ``$cachedLookup`` includes
fields for configuring query caching behavior, and provides a
modified syntax for the ``from`` field for querying data over a
:ref:`connection <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` from your connection
registry.

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ttl
     - document
     - Required
     - Document that specifies the TTL of your cached queries.

   * - ttl.size
     - int
     - Required
     - Size of the TTL of your cached queries in ``units``.

   * - ttl.unit
     - string
     - Required
     - Unit of time in which to measure the TTL of your cached
       queries. Must be one of the following:

       - "ms"
       - "second"
       - "minute"
       - "hour"
       - "day"

   * - maxMemUsageBytes
     - int
     - Required
     - Maximum memory, in bytes, to allocate to query caching. If the
       size of the cache exceeds this value, {+atlas-sp+} first evicts older
       results to free space. If there are not enough expired results to 
       get below this threshold, {+atlas-sp+} randomly evicts cached queries
       until the cache size is below the threshold.

       Defaults to 10% of the available RAM in your {+spw+}.
       You can't set ``maxMemUsageBytes`` to more than
       12.5% of the available RAM in your {+spw+}.

   * - from
     - document 
     - Required
     - Document that specifies a collection in an {+service+} database
       to join to messages from your :pipeline:`$source`. You must 
       specify a collection only from your Connection Registry.

       If you specify this field, you must specify values for all
       fields in this document.

   * - from.connectionName
     - string 
     - Required
     - Name of the connection in your Connection Registry.

   * - from.db
     - string 
     - Required
     - Name of the {+service+} database that contains the 
       collection you want to join.

   * - from.coll
     - string 
     - Required
     - Name of the collection you want to join.

   * - localField
     - string
     - Required
     - Field from your ``$source`` messages to join on.

   * - foreignField
     - string
     - Required
     - Field from documents in the ``from`` collection to join on.

   * - as
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the new array field to add to the input documents. This
       new array field contains the matching documents from the 
       ``from`` collection. If the specified name already exists as a 
       field in the input document, that field is overwritten.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$cachedLookup` performs a left outer join of messages from
your ``$source`` and the documents in a specified {+service+}
collection. This version behaves similarly to the :pipeline:`$lookup`
stage available in a standard MongoDB database. However, this version
requires that you specify an {+service+} collection from your
:ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` as the value
for the ``from`` field.

Additionally, ``$cachedLookup`` caches the results of your queries for
a configurable length of time. Use this functionality for queries
against infrequently-changed data to improve efficiency. When a cached
entry's TTL elapses, {+atlas-sp+} evicts that entry. If the total size
of cached entries equals ``maxMemoryUsageBytes`` when you make a new
query, {+atlas-sp+} evicts entries until there is space to cache the
new query.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A streaming data source generates detailed weather reports from
various locations, conformant to the schema of the :ref:`Sample
Weather Dataset <sample-weather>`. A collection named
``humidity_descriptions`` contains documents of the form:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     'dew_point': 16.2,
     'relative_humidity': 79,
     'condition': 'sticky, oppressive'
   }

Where the ``relative_humidity`` field describes the relative humidity at
room temperature (20 Celsius), and ``condition`` lists verbal
descriptors appropriate to that level of humidity. You can use the
:ref:`$cachedLookup <atlas-sp-agg-cachedlookup>` stage to enrich the streaming
weather reports with suggested descriptors for meteorologists to use
in weather broadcasts.

The following aggregation has four stages:

1. The :pipeline:`$source` stage establishes a connection with the
   {+kafka+} broker collecting these reports in a topic named
   ``my_weatherdata``, exposing each record as it is ingested to the
   subsequent aggregation stages. This stage also overrides the name
   of the timestamp field it projects, setting it to
   ``ingestionTime``.

2. The ``$cachedLookup`` stage joins the records from the
   ``humidity_descriptions`` database into the weather reports on the
   ``dewPoint`` field. Each query has a ``5 minute`` TTL, and
   {+atlas-sp+} stores up to 200 MB of results.

3. The :pipeline:`$match` stage excludes documents that have an empty
   ``humidity_info`` field, and passes along documents with a populated
   ``humidity_info`` field to the next stage.

4. The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output to an {+service+}
   collection named ``enriched_stream`` in the
   ``sample_weatherstream`` database. If no such database or
   collection exist, {+service+} creates them.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true
   
   {
     '$source': {
       connectionName: 'sample_weatherdata',
       topic: 'my_weatherdata',
       tsFieldName: 'ingestionTime'
     }
   },
   {
     '$cachedLookup': {
       "ttl": {
         "size": 5,
         "unit": "minute"
       },
       "maxMemUsageBytes": 209715200,
     
       from: {
         connectionName: 'weatherStream',
         db: 'humidity',
         coll: 'humidity_descriptions'
       },
       'localField':'dewPoint.value',
       'foreignField':'dewPoint',
       'as': 'humidity_info'
     }
   },
   { '$match': { 'humidity_info': { '$ne': [] } } },
   {
     '$merge': {
       into: {
         connectionName: 'weatherStream',
         db: 'sample_weatherstream',
         coll: 'enriched_stream'
       }
     }
   }

To view the documents in the resulting ``sample_weatherstream.enriched_stream``
collection, connect to your {+service+} cluster and run the following command:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: json

      db.getSiblingDB("sample_weatherstream").enriched_stream.find()
