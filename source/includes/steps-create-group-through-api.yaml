title: Use the API to create a group.
stepnum: 1
ref: create-group-via-api
pre: |
  Use the Public API to send a :doc:`groups </reference/api/groups>`
  document to create the new group. Issue the following command, replacing
  ``<user@example.net>`` with the credentials of the :ref:`global owner
  <global-owner-role>`, ``<api_key>`` with your API key,
  ``<app-example.net>`` with the |mms| URL, and
  ``<group_name>`` with the name of the new group:
action:
  language: none
  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups" --digest -i -X POST --data '
    {
       "name": "<group_name>"
    }'
post: |
  The API returns a document that includes the group's ``agentApiKey`` and
  ``id``. The API automatically sets the ``publicApiEnabled`` field to
  ``true`` to allow subsequent API-based configuration.

  Record these values for use in this procedure and in other procedures in
  this tutorial.

title: Use the API to create a user in the new group.
stepnum: 3
ref: create-user-via-api
pre: |
  Use the ``/users`` endpoint to add a user to the new group. 
  
  The body
  of the request should contain a :doc:`users </reference/api/users>`
  document with the user's information. Set the user's
  ``roles.roleName`` to ``GROUP_OWNER``, and the user's
  ``roles.groupId`` set to the new group's' ``id``.
action:
  language: none
  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/users" --digest -i -X POST --data '
    {
       "username": "<new_user@example.com>",
       "emailAddress": "<new_user@example.com>",
       "firstName": "<First>",
       "lastName": "<Last>",
       "password": "<password>",
       "roles": [{
         "groupId": "<group_id>",
         "roleName": "GROUP_OWNER"
       }]
    }'

title: "Remove global owner from the group. (Optional)"
stepnum: 4
ref: remove-global-owner
pre: |
  The :ref:`global owner <global-owner-role>` that you used to create the
  group is also automatically added to the group. You can remove the
  global owner from the group without losing the ability to make changes to the
  group in the future. As long as you have the group's ``agentApiKey`` and
  ``id``, you have full access to the group when logged in as the global
  owner.
action:
  - pre: |
      ``GET`` the global owner's ID. Issue the following command to
      request the group's users, replace the credentials, API key,
      URL, and group ID, with the relevant values:
    language: none
    code: |
      curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/users" --digest -i
  - pre: |
      The API returns a document that lists all the group's users.
      Locate the user with ``roles.roleName`` set to ``GLOBAL_OWNER``.
      Copy the user's ``id`` value, and issue the following to remove the
      user from the group, replacing ``<user_id>``
      with the user's ``id`` value:
    language: none
    code: |
      curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/users/<user_id>" --digest -i -X DELETE
  - pre: |
      Upon successful removal of the user, the API returns the HTTP ``200
      OK`` status code to indicate the request has succeeded.
