`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_
supports proxying authentication requests to a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-ldap.rst

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Enterprise supports simple and SASL binding to Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers via ``saslauthd`` and operating system
libraries:

- MongoDB Enterprise for Linux can bind to an LDAP server either via
  ``saslauthd`` or, starting in MongoDB 3.4, through the operating system
  libraries.

- Starting in MongoDB version 3.4, MongoDB Enterprise for Windows can
  bind to an LDAP server through the operating system libraries.

The :manual:`LDAP Proxy Authentication </core/security-ldap>` and
:manual:`LDAP Authorization </core/security-ldap-external>` sections in
the MongoDB manual provide more information about LDAP and MongoDB.
Setting up LDAP and SASL is beyond the scope of this document.

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable LDAP
authentication when using Automation. If |mms| doesn't manage
{+magent+} or {+bagent+}, you must manually configure them to use
|ldap|. To configure |ldap|, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap`
