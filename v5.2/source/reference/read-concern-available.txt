Read Concern ``"available"``
============================

.. meta::
   :description: Using read concern available returns data with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).  Read concern available can return orphan documents. 
   :keywords: read concern, available read concern, read isolation

.. versionadded:: 3.6

A query with read concern ``"available"`` returns data from the instance
with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the
replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).

**For a sharded cluster**, :readconcern:`"available"` read concern
provides greater tolerance for partitions since it does not wait to
ensure consistency guarantees. That is, read concern
:readconcern:`"available"` does not contact the shard's primary nor the
config servers for updated :doc:`metadata
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`. However, this means that a
query with :readconcern:`"available"` read concern may return
:term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` if the shard is
undergoing chunk migrations. 

**For unsharded collections** (including collections in a standalone
deployment or a replica set deployment), :readconcern:`"local"` and
:readconcern:`"available"` read concerns behave identically.

Availability
------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"available"` is :red:`unavailable for use`
with causally consistent sessions and transactions.

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"available"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.
