If :setting:`MongoDB Usage UI` is set to :guilabel:`On`, you can
trigger this endpoint which tells |onprem| to:

- **Generate a snapshot.** This snapshot of all deployments belonging
  to all projects and organizations includes the current information
  for each |mongod| and |mongos| process:

  - memory statistics
  - date
  - organization
  - project
  - |ipaddr|
  - |iana| port

- **Calculate assignments.** This populates the ``assignment``
  collection. The endpoint makes |onprem| review the snapshot for that
  day and copy each process with an assigned server type. |onprem|
  discovers the process's server type from its host. The host's server
  type could have been set in the admin page. If the host's server type
  was not set, |onprem| assigns the project's default server type when
  the host was created to that host.

You might call this endpoint if you have no assignments in the
``assignments`` collection but want to view the MongoDB Usage Admin UI.
This may happen in the following cases:

1. You enabled :setting:`MongoDB Usage Data Collection` but the
   automated job that collects the data has yet run for the first time.
2. You dropped or emptied the ``assignments`` collection.
3. You did not enable :setting:`MongoDB Usage Data Collection` because
   you wanted to collect usage data one time, not every day.
