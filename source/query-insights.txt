Monitor collection-level :manual:`query latency </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>` with Query Insights. 
The :guilabel:`Query Insights` page displays two charts and a table 
with information for each top or pinned :term:`namespace`. The 
information includes query latency metrics and statistics for certain 
hosts and operation types. You can manage pinned namespaces and choose 
up to five namespaces to show in the corresponding query latency charts.

Considerations
--------------

- The :guilabel:`Query Insights` page is supported only for 
  MongoDB 4.4.2 or later and the {+mdbagent+} 13.8.1.8563-1 or later.

- If you have :manual:`Queryable Encryption 
  </core/queryable-encryption/>` enabled for a collection, Query 
  Insights doesn't display the collection in this location. |mms| 
  redacts this information.

- |mms| displays top namespaces by default. Depending on the time 
  range, a namespace might fall in and out of the monitored list. 
  |mms| interpolates missing data when at least one host metric 
  exists in both ends of the time range. If |service| encounters 
  missing data, dotted lines connect the available data points.

- If you reach the data limit for a page load, the following error 
  message appears:

  .. code-block::

     Chart data limit reached. Try a smaller time window or fewer hosts.

Access Query Insights
---------------------

To access Query Insights:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

   .. step:: Go to :guilabel:`Query Insights`. 

      a. Click :guilabel:`View Monitoring` for that instance in the 
         project panel.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.

Filter Query Insights
---------------------

You can filter Namespace Insights by host state, hosts, time intervals, 
and a time range.

To filter Query Insights:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: (Optional) Filter by host state, shard, or host.

      .. note::

         Filters apply to the host state and shards at the time of 
         metric collection.

      Do one of the following:

      - Filter by host state:

        a. Expand the :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` drop-down menu.

        #. Click the :guilabel:`Select Primaries` or 
           :guilabel:`Select Secondaries` checkbox.

      - Filter by shard:

        a. Specify a shard in the :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` search 
           box.

        #. Select a shard from the :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` 
           drop-down menu.

      - Filter by hosts:

        a. Specify hosts in the :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` search box.

        #. Select hosts from the :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` drop-down 
           menu.

   .. step:: (Optional) Filter by time interval.

      Select one of the following time intervals to filter by:

      - 7 days
      - 24 hours
      - 12 hours
      - 8 hours
      - 1 hour

   .. step:: (Optional) Filter by time range.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`Filter by time range` drop-down menu.

      #. Specify a time range.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Apply Dates`.

      The data in the charts and table that Query Insights displays 
      refreshes.

View Chart Metrics
------------------

You can view different metrics and operations.

To adjust the metrics and operation types:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select the metrics to display.

      Select one of the following metrics:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 20 80
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Metric
           - Description 

         * - Total latency
           - Rate that indicates the total combined server operation 
             duration on a collection (total combined server operation 
             duration / collection interval in seconds).

         * - Average latency
           - Total server operation duration divided by the total 
             server operation count.

         * - P50 latency
           - 50th percentile in the :manual:`latency histogram 
             </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>`.

         * - P95 latency
           - 95th percentile in the :manual:`latency histogram 
             </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>`.

         * - P99 latency
           - 99th percentile in the :manual:`latency histogram 
             </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>`.

         * - Operation count
           - Rate that indicates the total number of server operations 
             performed on a collection  (total server operations / collection 
             interval)

   .. step:: Select the operation type to display.

      Select one of the following operation types:

      - All operation types
      - Read
      - Write
      - Command

Manage Pinned Namespaces from the Dialog
----------------------------------------

You can search and pin a maximum of five namespaces to the top of the 
table from the :guilabel:`Pinned Namespace` dialog.

To manage pinned namespaces from the dialog:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Pinned Namespaces` dialog.

      - If you have no pinned namespaces, click the 
        :guilabel:`Pin namespaces` button that appears in the top 
        center of the table.

      - If you have pinned namespaces, click the 
        :guilabel:`Manage pinned namespaces` button that appears in the 
        upper-right corner of the table.

      search box.

   .. step:: Pin the namespace.

      Click the namespace that you want to pin.

      .. note::

         You can pin a maximum of five namespaces. If you have five 
         namespaces and want to pin another, you must unpin one. You 
         can also pin planned namespaces that don't exist yet.

   .. step:: (Optional) Unpin a namespace.

      Click :guilabel:`Unpin` next to the namespace that you want to 
      unpin.
