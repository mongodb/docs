This page describes how to troubleshoot common issues that you
might encounter when :ref:`integrating <amazon-bedrock>` {+avs+} 
with {+aws-bedrock+}.

To troubleshoot issues that are not covered on this page, 
contact |mdb-support|.

General Troubleshooting 
-----------------------

Refer to the following steps for general troubleshooting guidance.

Knowledge Base Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience issues when creating the knowledge base, 
check the following:

- Use the correct hostname and ensure that it
  contains a ``-pl`` suffix on the {+cluster+} if using PrivateLink.

  The hostname is the |url| for your |service| {+cluster+}
  located in its :manual:`connection string
  </reference/connection-string/#find-your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>`.
  The hostname uses the following format:

  .. code-block::

     <clusterName>.mongodb.net

- Specify the same database, collection, and vector index names as the names you specified in |service|.
  Ensure that the database user has access to the database in |service|.

- Specify the correct username and password keys in Secrets Manager, and ensure the |arn|\s are correct.
  To learn more, see :aws:`AWS Secrets Manager concepts </secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html>`.
  
- If you're using PrivateLink, enter the correct PrivateLink service name 
  when configuring the knowledge base in {+aws-bedrock+}.
    
  .. important::

     The PrivateLink service endpoint must be in the same account as the 
     knowledge base.

- If you encounter permission-related issues, see
  `How do I troubleshoot permission errors that I get when I create a knowledge base in {+aws-bedrock+}?
  <https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/bedrock-knowledge-base-permission-errors>`__.

Data Sync and Retrieval Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience issues when syncing or retrieving data from the 
knowledge base, check the following:

- Ensure that the data you want to ingest is in a format
  supported by the foundation model.
  For example, if you're using a text-based model, 
  ensure that the data is in text format.
  
- Ensure that you can connect to your {+cluster+} and that
  its credentials and network access haven't changed.

- Ensure that you specify the correct number of dimensions in your {+avs+} index
  corresponding to the foundation model you've chosen.
  
- If attempting to filter your data, ensure that you've defined 
  metadata fields as :ref:`pre-filters <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter>` 
  in your index definition and that they correspond to the actual fields in 
  your data source.

.. note::

   Each time you add, modify, or remove files from the |s3| bucket for a data source, 
   you must sync the data source so that it's re-indexed to the knowledge base. 
   Syncing is incremental, so {+aws-bedrock+} only processes the objects in your |s3| bucket 
   that you've added, modified, or deleted since the last sync. 
   To learn more, refer to the :aws:`{+aws-bedrock+} documentation <bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-sync-ingest.html>`.

Specific Errors
---------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 55 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error Message
     - Troubleshooting Steps
   
   * - When setting up a knowledge base:
       
       ``AccessDeniedException: User ... is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateRole on resource ... because no identity-based policy allows the iam:CreateRole action``

     - Ensure that you have the IAM permissions to create IAM roles and policies. To learn more, see the 
       :aws:`{+aws-bedrock+} documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/iam-permissions.html>`.

   * - When trying to sync a data source for a knowledge base:
 
       ``ConflictException: You cannot start an ingestion job on a knowledgeBase with status CREATING.``

     - This occurs when you attempt to sync a data source for a knowledge base 
       that is still in the process of being created. Ensure that the knowledge base 
       is in a **Ready** state before syncing a data source for it.

       To learn how to view the status of your knowledge base, see the
       :aws:`{+aws-bedrock+} documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-info.html>`.

   * - When attempting to add a knowledge base to an agent:
      
       ``You must save your agent with Agent Resource Role defined before adding a knowledge base.``

     - This occurs if you attempt to add a knowledge base to a new agent 
       that you're creating before you've saved the agent. You must save the agent first, 
       and then add the knowledge base to the agent.

   * - When testing an agent:
       
       ``Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request.``

     - This error occurs when you attempt to use a foundation model that you do not
       have access to. You must request access to {+aws-bedrock+} models before they're available 
       for use. To learn how to request or modify model access, refer to the 
       :aws:`{+aws-bedrock+} documentation </bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html>`.

   * - When using the Amazon Titan Text Embedding model:
     
       ``BSON field '$vectorSearch.queryVector.####' is the wrong type 'int', expected type 'double'``
       
     - This is a known issue when using {+avs+} with this model. To resolve this issue, 
       contact |mdb-support|.

   * - Error with index creation and filter fields.
     - If you followed the :ref:`tutorial <amazon-bedrock>` 
       and previously created an index with the filter field ``page_number``, 
       you must update your index definition to use the new filter field name 
       ``x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number`` instead. {+aws-bedrock+} has 
       updated the field name, and indexes using the old field name no longer 
       work correctly with {+aws-bedrock+} knowledge bases.
