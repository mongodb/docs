The Performance pillar of the {+waf+} includes features, such
as automated scaling and tiered {+cluster+} storage, that allow your data
operations to achieve low latency and high throughput, and scale your
deployments to meet increasing demand.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resource to learn about performance
in {+service+}:

      :headline: Scalability
      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/architecture/scalability/
      :icon: atlas_autoscaling
      :icon-alt: Atlas auto-scaling icon

      Use auto-scaling to dynamically allocate resources based on growing workload
      demands. For horizontal and vertical scaling, use {+service+} deployment templates.
