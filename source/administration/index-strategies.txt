Indexing Strategies
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The best indexes for your application are based on a number of factors,
including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to writes,
and the amount of free memory on your system.

When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep
understanding of your application's queries. Before you build indexes,
map out the types of queries you will run so that you can build indexes
that reference those fields.

Inspect the current indexes created for your collections to ensure they
are supporting your current and planned queries. If an index is no
longer used, drop the index.

Indexes come with a performance cost, but are more than worth the cost
for frequent queries on large data set. Consider the relative frequency
of each query in the application and whether the query justifies an
index.

The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety
of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be
running in production to see which configurations perform best.

MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given
operation. However, each clause of an :operator:`$or` query may use a
different index.
