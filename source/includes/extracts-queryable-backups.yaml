   |mms| provisions these queryable snapshots as *read-only* MongoDB
   instances. Specifically, |mms| spins up a :program:`mongod` with
   data from the selected snapshot store.

   .. important::

      By default, these instances are available for up to 24 hours. You
      can configure the duration using 
      :setting:`Expiration (Hours) <Expiration>`.
      For other queryable backup settings, see

   MongoDB Version Compatibility between Snapshot and Target Database
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can only query snapshots made from
   :term:`replica sets <replica set>` or
   :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` with
   :abbr:`CSRS (replica set config servers)` running MongoDB 3.2 or
   later.

   For a queryable backup to succeed, the MongoDB instance that is the
   target of a restore must run a compatible MongoDB version.
   The following table lists the compatibility requirements for each
   deployment type and MongoDB version.

   **Sharded Clusters**

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Snapshot Data MongoDB Version
        - Compatible MongoDB Version for Target Database
        - Platform

      * - 3.6.x
        - 3.6.5 Enterprise or later
        - Any

      * - 3.4.x
        - 3.4.11 Enterprise or later
        - Windows

      * - 3.4.x
        - 3.4.2 Enterprise or later
        - Linux or macOS

   **Replica Sets**

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Snapshot Data MongoDB Version
        - Compatible MongoDB Version for Target Database
        - Platform

      * - 3.6.x
        - 3.4.11 Enterprise or later
        - Windows

      * - 3.6.x
        - 3.4.2 Enterprise or later
        - Linux or macOS

      * - 3.4.x
        - 3.4.11 Enterprise or later
        - Windows

      * - 3.4.x
        - 3.4.2 Enterprise or later
        - Linux or macOS

      * - 3.2
        - 3.4.11 Enterprise or later
        - Windows

      * - 3.2.x
        - 3.4.2 Enterprise or later
        - Linux or macOS

   PEM File Location
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   For the queryable backup host, you must specify the location of the
   PEM file (which contains both a public key certificate and its
   associated private key) using the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File`
   setting. If you have not already set up the queryable backup
   settings:

   #. Click on :guilabel:`Admin` on the upper-right hand corner. From 
      the :guilabel:`Admin` screen, click on :guilabel:`General`
      :icon:`arrow-right` :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`
      :icon:`arrow-right` :guilabel:`Backup`.

   #. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Queryable Snapshot Configuration` and
      specify the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` that the tunnel or
      clients can use to connect to the queryable :program:`mongod`
      instance.

      If the file is encrypted, specify the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File Password`.

   #. Optional. Update other queryable snapshot settings as
      appropriate. For description of the settings, see
      :ref:`queryable-snapshot-settings`.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-proxy-requirements.rst

   Open Ports for App Server
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The app server requires that ports 27700-27719 be open for
   communication with queryable backup snapshots.

   To learn more about port requirements, see
   :doc:`Firewall Configuration </reference/firewall-configuration>`.


   Sufficient Workers for the |mms| Backup Daemon
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-workers.rst

   Hostname
   ~~~~~~~~

   The |fqdn| that hosts the :binary:`~bin.mongod` for the queryable
   backup must match the one found the :guilabel:`Daemons` page. To
   find that hostname, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link, then click
   :guilabel:`Backup`, and then click :guilabel:`Daemons`.

   Queryable backups are available for MongoDB 3.2 or later replica
   sets or MongoDB 3.2 or later sharded clusters with replica set
   config servers (CSRS).

---
ref: queryable-backup-workers
edition: onprem
content: |

  To query a snapshot of a :term:`sharded cluster`, the
  :term:`Backup Daemon` requires at least one worker for the
  :manual:`config server</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`, one
  worker for each :term:`shard`, and one worker for each
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

  To query a snapshot of a :term:`replica set`, the Backup Daemon
  requires at least one worker for the replica set.

  .. example::

     If you restore a queryable backup from a 3-shard cluster with
     1 shard router (:program:`mongos`), you would need this value to
     be at least ``5``:

     - 1 per shard (``3``) +
     - 1 for the config server (``1``) +
     - 1 for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`

     When the queryable backup begins, the Backup Daemon spins
     up 5 or more workers to manage these components.

   :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` has the following restrictions:

   - The PEM should use a key length greater than 512-bit. Using a
     2048-bit RSA key is recommended.

   - The PEM should use a message digest stronger than ``sha1``, such as ``sha256``.
