Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $limit

   Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the
   :term:`pipeline`.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``$limit``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$limit` stage has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: <positive 64-bit integer> }

:pipeline:`$limit` takes a positive integer that specifies the
maximum number of documents to pass along.

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :pipeline:`$limit` pipeline aggregation 
   has a 64-bit integer limit. Values passed to the pipeline which 
   exceed this limit will return a invalid argument error.

Behavior
--------

Using $limit with Sorted Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using the :pipeline:`$limit` stage with any of:

- the :pipeline:`$sort` aggregation stage,
- the :method:`~cursor.sort()` method, or
- the ``sort`` field to the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command or the
  :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` shell method,

be sure to include at least one field in your sort that contains
unique values, before passing results to the :pipeline:`$limit` stage.

Sorting on fields that contain duplicate values may return an
inconsistent sort order for those duplicate fields over multiple
executions, especially when the collection is actively receiving writes.

The easiest way to guarantee sort consistency is to include the
``_id`` field in your sort query.

See the following for more information on each:

- :ref:`Consistent sorting with $sort (aggregation)
  <sort-aggregation-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the sort() shell method
  <sort-cursor-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the findAndModify command
  <findandmodify-command-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the findAndModify() shell method
  <findandmodify-method-consistent-sorting>`

Example
-------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.article.aggregate([
      { $limit : 5 }
   ]);

This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it
by the pipeline. :pipeline:`$limit` has no effect on the content
of the documents it passes.
