View or Modify Project Settings
-------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-modify-project-settings.rst

Project settings apply to all the users in the project
[#user-settings]_. The :guilabel:`Project ID` displayed at the top of
the page is used by the |service| |api|.

You can set the following:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 40 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Setting

    - Description

  * - :guilabel:`Project Name`

    - Sets your project's name.

      .. note::

          Only a user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project or the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the project's organization can edit the project name.

  * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

    - Sets your project's time zone. This does not affect the
      timezones set for individual user accounts. [#user-settings]_

  * - :guilabel:`Using Custom DNS on AWS with VPC peering`

    - Allows you to expose a second connection string for your
      dedicated Atlas clusters on AWS that resolves to private IPs.

      Enable this setting if you use custom DNS that cannot take
      advantage of AWS built-in split-horizon DNS across a VPC peering
      connection.

      .. note::

         |service| displays this setting only when you
         :doc:`enable network peering on AWS </security-vpc-peering>`.

  * - :guilabel:`Connect via Peering Only (GCP and Azure)`

    - Allows you to enable or disable connections between MongoDB
      Atlas dedicated clusters and public |ipaddr| addresses outside
      of the peered |vpc|/VNet. You can only enable or disable this
      setting when there are no active dedicated GCP or Azure clusters
      in your Project.

      .. admonition:: Feature Deprecated
         :class: important

         This feature has been deprecated. Existing clusters can
         continue to use this feature. Use both Standard and Private
         IP for Peering connection strings to connect to your project.
         These connection strings allow you to connect using both
         |vpc|/VNet Peering and whitelisted public IP addresses. To
         learn more about support for multiple connection strings, see
         :dochub:`this FAQ <atlas-horizon-faq>`.

  * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

    - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
      statistics in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.


  * - :guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time`

    - Set which hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
      maintenance on your cluster.

      If you toggle to :guilabel:`On`, click :icon:`pencil-alt` to set
      the :guilabel:`Maintenance Start Time`. |service| displays this
      time in the time zone you set in your :guilabel:`Profile`.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-urgent-maintenance.rst

      When maintenance is required, |service|:

      - Displays a banner in your cluster list showing the date and
        time when the maintenance is scheduled.

      - Sends a notification email to all users in the project between
        48 and 72 hours before the scheduled maintenance.

        .. note::

           To configure how you receive scheduled maintenance window
           notifications, see :ref:`configure-mw-alert`.

        With this information, you can choose one of three options:

        1. Do nothing. The maintenance occurs during your scheduled
           maintenance window.

        2. Select :guilabel:`Begin Maintenance Now`. The scheduled
           maintenance starts immediately. If you choose this option,
           you are asked to confirm it in a separate modal.
           
        3. Select :guilabel:`Defer Maintenance for One Week`. The   
           scheduled maintenance starts during your preferred
           maintenance window one week after the given scheduled
           maintenance date and time. If you choose this option, you are
           asked to confirm it in a separate modal.

    - .. include:: /includes/fact-delete-charts-warning.rst
      
      Allows :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` to delete the
      |charts| instance associated with your project. This setting is
      only visible if you have

      project.
