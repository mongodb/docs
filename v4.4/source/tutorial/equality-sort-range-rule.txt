The ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) Rule

An index that references multiple fields is a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>`. Compound indexes can dramatically improve query
response times.

Index keys correspond to document fields. In most cases, applying the
ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) Rule to arrange the index keys helps to
create a more efficient :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`.

This page introduces the ESR Rule. For more information on tuning
queries, see :dbcommand:`explain` and 
:ref:`query-plans-query-optimization`. 

.. tip::

   To force MongoDB to use a particular index, use :ref:`cursor-hint`
   when testing indexes.

.. _esr-rule-equality:

Equality
--------

"Equality" refers to an exact match on a single value. The following
exact match queries scan the ``cars`` collection for documents whose
``model`` field exactly matches ``Cordoba``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cars.find( { model: "Cordoba" } )
   db.cars.find( { model: { $eq: "Cordoba" } } )

Index searches make efficient use of exact matches to limit the number
of documents that need to be examined to satisfy a query. Place fields
that require exact matches first in your index.

An index may have multiple keys for queries with exact matches. The
index keys for equality matches can appear in any order. However, to
satisfy an equality match with the index, all of the index keys for
exact matches must come before any other index fields. MongoDB's search
algorithm eliminates any need to arrange the exact match fields in a
particular order.

Exact matches should be selective. To reduce the number of index keys
scanned, ensure equality tests eliminate at least 90% of possible
document matches.

.. _esr-rule-sort:

Sort
----

"Sort" determines the order for results. Sort follows equality matches
because the equality matches reduce the number of documents that need
to be sorted. Sorting after the equality matches also allows MongoDB to
do a non-blocking sort.

An index can support sort operations when the query fields are a subset
of the index keys. Sort operations on a subset of the index keys are
only supported if the query includes equality conditions for all of the
prefix keys that precede the sort keys. For more information see:
:ref:`Sort and Non-prefix Subset of an Index
<sort-index-nonprefix-subset>`.

The following example queries the ``cars`` collection. The output is
sorted by ``model``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cars.find( { manufacturer: "GM" } ).sort( { model: 1 } )

To improve query performance, create an index on the ``manufacturer``
and ``model`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cars.createIndex( { manufacturer: 1, model: 1 } )

- ``manufacturer`` is the first key because it is an equality match.
- ``model`` is indexed in the same order ( ``1`` ) as the query. 

.. _esr-rule-range:

Range
-----

"Range" filters scan fields. The scan doesn't require an exact match,
which means range filters are loosely bound to index keys. To improve
query efficiency, make the range bounds as tight as possible and use
equality matches to limit the number of documents that must be scanned.

Range filters resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cars.find( { price: { $gte: 15000} } )
   db.cars.find( { age: { $lt: 10 } } )
   db.cars.find( { priorAccidents: { $ne: null } } )

MongoDB cannot do an index sort on the results of a range filter.
Place the range filter after the sort predicate so MongoDB can use a
non-blocking index sort. For more information on blocking sorts, see
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()`.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

- Inequality operators such as :query:`$ne` or :query:`$nin` are range
  operators, not equality operators.

- :query:`$regex` is a range operator.

- :query:`$in` can be an equality operator or a range operator.

  - When ``$in`` is used alone, it is an equality operator that performs a 
    series of equality matches. 
  - When ``$in`` is used with ``.sort()``, ``$in`` can act like a range 
    operator.

Example
-------

The following query searches the ``cars`` collection for vehicles
manufactured by Ford that cost more than $15,000 dollars. The results
are sorted by model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cars.find(
      {
          manufacturer: 'Ford',
          cost: { $gt: 15000 }
      } ).sort( { model: 1 } )


The query contains all the elements of the ESR Rule:

- ``manufacturer: 'Ford'`` is an equality based match
- ``cost: { $gt: 15000 }`` is a range based match, and
- ``model`` is used for sorting

Following the ESR rule, the optimal index for the example query is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { manufacturer: 1, model: 1, cost: 1 }
