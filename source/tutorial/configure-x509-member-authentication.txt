Use x.509 Certificate for Membership Authentication

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. Sharded cluster
members and replica set members can use x.509 certificates to verify
their membership to the cluster or the replica set instead of using
:ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>`. The membership authentication is
an internal process.

.. |binary| replace:: MongoDB

Enabling internal authentication also enables 
:doc:`/core/authorization`. Clients must authenticate as a user in order to 
connect and perform operations in the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles` tutorial for 
  instructions on adding users to the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` tutorial 
  for instructions on using x.509 certificates for user authentication.

Member x.509 Certificate
------------------------

.. note::

   You must have valid x.509 certificates.

Member Certificate and ``PEMKeyFile``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure Replica Set/Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------------

Outside of rolling upgrade procedures, every component of a :term:`replica
set` or :term:`sharded cluster` should use the same
``--clusterAuthMode`` setting to ensure it can securely connect to all
other components in the deployment.

For :term:`replica set` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
members of the replica set.

For :term:`sharded cluster` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. 

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/default-bind-ip-security.rst

Use Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the x.509 certificate for internal cluster member
authentication, append the additional TLS/SSL options
``--clusterAuthMode`` and ``--sslClusterFile``, as in the
following example for a member of a replica set:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode x509 --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to TLS/SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

Include any additional options, TLS/SSL or otherwise, that are required
for your specific configuration. For instance, if the membership key is
encrypted, set the ``--sslClusterPassword`` to the passphrase to
decrypt the key or have MongoDB prompt for the passphrase. See
:ref:`ssl-certificate-password` for details.

.. include:: /includes/warning-x509-requires-sslCAfile.rst

Use Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the configuration for MongoDB
in a :doc:`YAML formatted </reference/configuration-options>`
configuration file, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      clusterAuthMode: x509
   net:
      ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: <path to TLS/SSL certificate and key PEM file>
         CAFile: <path to root CA PEM file>
         clusterFile: <path to x.509 membership certificate and key PEM file>
      bindIp: localhost,<ip address>

See :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode`, :setting:`net.ssl.mode`,
:setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile`, :setting:`net.ssl.CAFile`, and
:setting:`net.ssl.clusterFile` for more information on the settings.


Additional Information
----------------------

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to x.509 internal
authentication, see
