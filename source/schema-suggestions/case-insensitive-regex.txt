If your queries rely on inefficient regex matching, 
:ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` that use the :ref:`$search 
<query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline stage can significantly 
improve the performance of text queries and offer more options for 
customizing query parameters.

.. _case-insensitive-regex-anti-pattern:

Avoid Inefficient Regex Matching
--------------------------------

If you frequently run case-insensitive regex queries (utilizing the 
``i`` option), we recommend :ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` 
that use the :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline 
stage. Alternatively, you can create a :manual:`case-insensitive index 
</core/index-case-insensitive/>` to support your queries. You can 
also specify a :manual:`collation </reference/collation/>` on an index 
to define language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules 
for lettercase and accent marks. However, :manual:`collation 
</reference/collation/>` can cause some functionality loss compared to 
:ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>`. While a case-insensitive 
index improves performance for case-insensitive queries, 
:ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` more significantly improve 
the performance of text queries and offer more options for customizing 
query parameters.

Example
-------

Consider an ``employees`` collection with the following documents. This
collection has no indexes besides the default ``_id`` index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // employees collection

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "first_name": "Hannah",
     "last_name": "Simmons",
     "dept": "Engineering"
   },
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "first_name": "Michael",
     "last_name": "Hughes",
     "dept": "Security"
   },
   {
     "_id": 3,
     "first_name": "Wendy",
     "last_name": "Crawford",
     "dept": "Human Resources"
   },
   {
     "_id": 4,
     "first_name": "MICHAEL",
     "last_name": "FLORES",
     "dept": "Sales"
   }

If your application frequently queries the ``first_name`` field, you may
want to run case-insensitive regex queries to more easily find matching
names. Case-insensitive regex also matches against differing data
formats, as in the example above where you have ``first_names`` of both
"Michael" and "MICHAEL". However, we recommend 
:ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` that use the :ref:`$search 
<query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline stage.

If a user searches for the string "michael", the application may run
the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.find( { first_name: { $regex: /michael/i } } )

Since this query specifies the
:manual:`$regex </reference/operator/query/regex/>` option ``i``, it is
case-insensitive. The query returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 2, "first_name" : "Michael", "last_name" : "Hughes", "dept" : "Security" }
   { "_id" : 4, "first_name" : "MICHAEL", "last_name" : "FLORES", "dept" : "Sales" }

Although this query does return the expected documents, case-insensitive
regex queries with no index support are not very performant.

To improve performance, :ref:`create an 
Atlas Search index <ref-create-index>`. While you can create a
:manual:`case-insensitive index </core/index-case-insensitive/>` on the
``first_name`` field, :ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` more 
significantly improve the performance of text queries and offer more 
options for customizing query parameters.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Regex Index
     - |fts| Index
   
   * - .. code-block:: javascript

          db.employees.createIndex(
            { first_name: 1 }, 
            { collation: { locale: 'en', strength: 2 } }
          )

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          {
            "mappings": {
              "dynamic": true
            }
          }

:manual:`Collation </reference/collation/>` can cause some 
functionality loss. When the ``strength`` field of an index's 
``collation`` document is ``1`` or ``2``, the index is 
case-insensitive. For a detailed description of the collation document 
and the different ``strength`` values, see :manual:`Collation Document
</reference/collation/#collation-document>`.

For the application to use the case-insensitive index, you must also 
specify the *same* collation document from the index in the regex 
query. While you can remove the ``$regex`` operator from the previous 
:method:`~db.collection.find()` method and use the newly 
created index, we recommend that you use an :ref:`Atlas Search query 
<searching-ref>` that uses the :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` 
aggregation pipeline stage.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Regex Query
     - |fts| Query
   
   * - .. code-block:: javascript

          db.employees.find( { first_name: "michael" } ).collation( { locale: 'en', strength: 2 } )

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          db.employees.aggregate([
            {
              $search: {
                "index": "default",
                "text": {
                  "path": "first_name",
                  "query": "michael"
                }
              }
            }
          ])

.. important::

   Do not use the :manual:`$regex </reference/operator/query/regex/>`
   operator when using a case-insensitive index for your query. The
   ``$regex`` implementation is not collation-aware and cannot utilize
   case-insensitive indexes. Instead, we recommend 
   :ref:`Atlas Search queries <searching-ref>` that use the 
   :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline stage.
