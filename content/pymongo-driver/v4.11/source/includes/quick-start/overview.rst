This guide shows you how to create an application that uses PyMongo, the MongoDB
Python driver,
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB
using a different driver or programming language, see our
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

PyMongo lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters
from a Python application.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your
own free (no credit card required) cluster.

Follow the steps below to connect your Python application to a MongoDB Atlas
cluster.
