|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled snapshot or from a
selected point between snapshots. For sharded clusters you can restore
from checkpoints between snapshots. For replica sets, you can restore
from selected points in time. For information on backup,
:doc:`/backup-cluster`.

Restore a Cluster
-----------------

To restore a cluster, go to :guilabel:`Backup` view. In the
:guilabel:`Overview`, hover over the :guilabel:`Status` field of the
cluster backup to display the :guilabel:`Restore` button. Click the
:guilabel:`Restore` button or click the ellipsis button under
:guilabel:`Options` and select :guilabel:`Restore`.

Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to download
your backup or have |service| restore to a selected cluster. |service|
can only restore to same cluster or another cluster with the same
topology in the same |service| group.

.. warning::
   Restore requires **downtime** for the target cluster.
