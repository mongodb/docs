.. important:: :doc:`Replica sets </core/replication>` replace
   :term:`master`\-:term:`slave` replication for most use cases. If
   possible, use replica sets rather than master-slave replication for
   all new production deployments This documentation remains to
   support legacy deployments and for archival purposes, *only*.

Replica sets provide functional super-set of master-slave and are more
robust for production use. Master-slave replication preceded replica
and makes it possible have a large number of non-master (i.e. slave)
and to *only* replicate operations for a single database; however,
master-slave replication provides less redundancy, and does not
automate failover. See :ref:`replica-set-equivalent` for a replica set
configuration that is equivalent to master-slave replication.

Fundamental Operations
----------------------

Initial Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a :term:`master`\-:term:`slave` deployment, start two
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances: one in :setting:`master` mode, and the
other in :setting:`slave` mode.

To start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in :setting:`master` mode,
invoke :binary:`~bin.mongod` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongod --master --dbpath /data/masterdb/

With the :option:`--master <mongod --master>` option, the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` will create a :data:`local.oplog.$main` collection,
which the "operation log" that queues operations that the slaves will
apply to replicate operations from the master. The
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` is optional.

To start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in :setting:`slave` mode,
invoke :binary:`~bin.mongod` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongod --slave --source <masterhostname><:<port>> --dbpath /data/slavedb/

Specify the hostname and port of the master instance to the
:option:`--source <mongod --source>` argument. The
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` is optional.

For :setting:`slave` instances, MongoDB stores data about the source
server in the :data:`local.sources` collection.

Configuration Options for Master-Slave Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to specifying the :option:`--source <mongod --source>`
run-time option, can add a document to :data:`local.sources`
specifying the :setting:`master` instance, as in the following
operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   use local
   db.sources.find()
   db.sources.insert( { host: <masterhostname> <,only: databasename> } );

In line 1, you switch context to the ``local`` database. In line 2,
the :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation should return no
documents, to ensure that there are no documents in the ``sources``
collection. Finally, line 3 uses :method:`db.collection.insert()` to
insert the source document into the :data:`local.sources`
collection. The model of the :data:`local.sources` document is as
follows:

.. describe:: host

   The host field specifies the :setting:`master`\ :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance, and holds a resolvable hostname, i.e. IP address, or
   a name from a ``host`` file, or preferably a fully qualified domain
   name.

   You can append ``<:port>`` to the host name if the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` is not running on the default ``27017`` port.

.. describe:: only

   Optional. Specify a name of a database. When specified, MongoDB
   will only replicate the indicated database.

Operational Considerations for Replication with Master Slave Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Master instances store operations in an :term:`oplog` which is a
:doc:`capped collection </core/capped-collections>`. As a result, if a
slave falls too far behind the state of the master, it cannot
"catchup" and must re-sync from scratch. Slave may become out of sync
with a master if:

- The slave falls far behind the data updates available from that
  master.

- The slave stops (i.e. shuts down) and restarts later after the
  master has overwritten the relevant operations from the master.

When slaves, are out of sync, replication stops. Administrators must
intervene manually to restart replication. Use the :dbcommand:`resync`
command. Alternatively, the :option:`--autoresync <mongod --autoresync>`
allows a slave to restart replication automatically,
after ten second pause, when the slave falls out of sync with the
master. With :option:`--autoresync <mongod --autoresync>` specified,
the slave will only attempt to re-sync once in a ten minute period.

To prevent these situations you should specify a larger oplog when
you start the :setting:`master` instance, by adding the
:option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>` option when starting
:binary:`~bin.mongod`. If you do not specify
:option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>`, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will
allocate 5% of available disk space on start up to the oplog, with a
minimum of 1GB for 64bit machines and 50MB for 32bit machines.

Run time Master-Slave Configuration
-----------------------------------

MongoDB provides a number of run time configuration options for
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in :term:`master`\-:term:`slave`
deployments. You can specify these options in :doc:`configuration
files </administration/configuration>` or on the command-line. See
documentation of the following:

- For *master* nodes:

  - :setting:`master`

  - :setting:`slave`

- For *slave* nodes:

  - :setting:`source`

  - :setting:`only`

  - :setting:`slaveDelay`

Also consider the :ref:`Master-Slave Replication Command Line Options
<cli-mongod-master-slave>` for related options.

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

On a :term:`master` instance, issue the following operation in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to return replication status from the
perspective of the master:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.printReplicationInfo()

On a :term:`slave` instance, use the following operation in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to return the replication status from the
perspective of the slave:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()

Use the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` as in the following operation, to
return status of the replication:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.serverStatus()

See :ref:`server status repl fields <server-status-repl>` for
documentation of the relevant section of output.

Security
--------

When running with :setting:`auth` enabled, in
:term:`master`\-:term:`slave` deployments, you must create a user
account for the local database on both :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances. Log in, and authenticate to the ``admin`` database on the
*slave* instance, and then create the ``repl`` user on the ``local``
database, with the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.addUser('repl', <replpassword>)

Once created, repeat the operation on the *master* instance.

The slave instance first looks for a user named ``repl`` in the
:data:`local.system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection. If
present, the slave uses this user account to authenticate to the
``local`` database in the ``master`` instance. If the ``repl`` user
does not exist, the slave instance attempts to authenticate using the
first user document in the :data:`local.system.users
<<database>.system.users>` collection.

The ``local`` database works like the ``admin`` database: an account for
local has access to the entire server.

Ongoing Administration and Operation of Master-Slave Deployments
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. _replica-set-equivalent:

Deploy Master-Slave Equivalent using Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want a replication configuration that resembles
:term:`master`\-:term:`slave` replication, using :term:`replica sets
<replica set>` replica sets, consider the following replica
configuration document. In this deployment hosts ``<master>`` and
``<slave>`` [#host-are-hostnames]_ provide replication that is roughly
equivalent to a two-instance master-slave deployment:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id : 'setName',
     members : [
       { _id : 0, host : "<master>", priority : 1 },
       { _id : 1, host : "<slave>", priority : 0, votes : 0 }
     ]
   }

See :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` for more information about
replica set configurations.

.. [#host-are-hostnames] In replica set configurations, the
   :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` field must hold a resolvable
   hostname.

Failing over to a Slave (Promotion)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To permanently failover from a unavailable or damaged :term:`master`
(``A`` in the following example) to a :term:`slave` (``B``):

1. Shut down ``A``.

2. Stop :binary:`~bin.mongod` on ``B``.

3. Back up and move all data files that begin with ``local`` on ``B``
   from the :setting:`dbpath`.

   .. warning::

      Removing ``local.*`` is irrevocable and cannot be
      undone. Perform this step with extreme caution.

4. Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` on ``B`` with the :option:`--master
   <mongod --master>` option.

.. note:: This is a one time operation, and is not reversible. ``A``
   cannot become a slave of ``B`` until it completes a full resync.

Inverting Master and Slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a :term:`master` (``A``) and a :term:`slave` (``B``) and
you would like to reverse their roles, follow this procedure. The
procedure assumes ``A`` is healthy, up-to-date and available.

If ``A`` is not healthy but the hardware is okay (power outage, server
crash, etc.), skip steps 1 and 2 and in step 8 replace all of ``A``'s
files with ``B``'s files in step 8.

If ``A`` is not healthy and the hardware is not okay, replace ``A`` with
a new machine. Also follow the instructions in the previous paragraph.

To invert the master and slave in a deployment:

1. Halt writes on ``A`` using the :term:`fsync` command.

2. Make sure ``B`` is up to date with the state of ``A``.

3. Shut down ``B``.

4. Back up and move all data files that begin with ``local`` on ``B``
   from the :setting:`dbpath` to remove the existing
   ``local.sources`` data.

   .. warning::

      Removing ``local.*`` is irrevocable and cannot be
      undone. Perform this step with extreme caution.

5. Start ``B`` with the :option:`--master <mongod --master>` option.

6. Do a write on ``B``, which primes the :term:`oplog` to provide a new
   sync start point.

7. Shut down ``B``. ``B`` will now have a new set of data files that
   start with ``local``.

8. Shut down ``A`` and replace all files in the :setting:`dbpath` of
   ``A`` that start with ``local`` with a copy of the files in the
   :setting:`dbpath` of ``B`` that begin with ``local``.

   Considering compressing the ``local`` files from ``B`` while you
   copy them, as they may be quite large.

9. Start ``B`` with the :option:`--master <mongod --master>` option.

10. Start ``A`` with all the usual slave options, but include
    :option:`fastsync <mongod --fastsync>`.

Creating a Slave from an Existing Master's Disk Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can stop write operations to the :term:`master` for an indefinite
period, you can copy the data files from the master to the new
:term:`slave` and then start the slave with :option:`--fastsync <mongod --fastsync>`.

.. warning::

   Be careful with :option:`--fastsync <mongod --fastsync>`.  If the
   data on both instances is identical, a discrepancy will exist
   forever.

:setting:`fastsync` is a way to start a slave by starting with an
existing master disk image/backup. This option declares that the
administrator guarantees the image is correct and completely up-to-date
with that of the master. If you have a full and complete copy of data
from a master you can use this option to avoid a full synchronization
upon starting the slave.

Creating a Slave from an Existing Slave's Disk Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can just copy the other :term:`slave's <slave>` data file snapshot
without any special options. Only take data snapshots when a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process is down or locked using
:method:`db.fsyncLock()`.

Resyncing a Slave that is too Stale to Recover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Slaves <slave>` asynchronously apply write operations from the
:term:`master` that the slaves poll from the master's
:term:`oplog`. The oplog is finite in length, and if a slave is too
far behind, a full resync will be necessary. To resync the slave,
connect to a slave using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` and issue the
:dbcommand:`resync` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { resync: 1 } )

This forces a full resync of all data (which will be very slow on a
large database). You can achieve the same effect by stopping
:binary:`~bin.mongod` on the slave, deleting the entire content of the
:setting:`dbpath` on the slave, and restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Slave Chaining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Slaves <slave>` cannot be "chained." They must all connect to the
:term:`master` directly.

If a slave attempts "slave from" another slave you will see the
following line in the :binary:`~bin.mongod` long of the shell:

.. code-block:: none

   assertion 13051 tailable cursor requested on non capped collection ns:local.oplog.$main

Correcting a Slave's Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change a :term:`slave's <slave>` source, manually modify the
slave's :data:`local.sources` collection.

.. example::

   Consider the following: If you accidentally set an incorrect hostname
   for the slave's :setting:`source`, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave --source prod.mississippi

   You can correct this, by restarting the slave without the
   :option:`--slave <mongod --slave>` and
   :option:`--source <mongod --source>` arguments:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod

   Connect to this :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance using the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and update the :data:`local.sources`
   collection, with the following operation sequence:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use local

      db.sources.update( { host : "prod.mississippi" }, { $set : { host : "prod.mississippi.example.net" } } )

   Restart the slave with the correct command line arguments or with no
   :option:`--source <mongod --source>` option.
   After configuring :data:`local.sources` the
   first time, the :option:`--source <mongod --source>` will have no
   subsequent effect. Therefore, both of the following invocations are
   correct:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave --source prod.mississippi.example.net

   or

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave

   The slave now polls data from the correct :term:`master`.
