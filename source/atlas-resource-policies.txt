{+arps+} are controls that enable :authrole:`Organization Owners <Organization Owner>` 
to constrain the specific 
configuration options available to developers when they create or configure 
|service| {+clusters+}. 

With resource policies, you can:

* Limit cluster deployment to specific cloud platforms (|aws|, |gcp|, |azure|).
* Restrict cluster deployment to designated regions within a cloud provider. For example, ``aws:us-east-1``.
* Prohibit the use of the wildcard IP (``0.0.0.0/0``) to enforce stricter network controls.
* Prevent users from provisioning, updating, or :ref:`auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` {+clusters+} to a tier above or below a specified threshold.
* Require that a project has a :ref:`maintenance window <configure-maintenance-window>` configured.
* Prevent modifications to |vpc| peering and private endpoint connections across cloud providers. 

You create {+arps+} at the organization level and they apply to all projects and clusters
within that organization.

In addition to the {+atlas-ui+} and the :ref:`{+atlas-admin-api+} <atlas-admin-api>`, you can use the
:ref:`atlas-programmatic-access-terraform-overview`, :ref:`atlas-programmatic-access-cloudformation-overview`,
or `AWS CloudFormation <https://constructs.dev/packages/awscdk-resources-mongodbatlas/v/3.9.0/api/CfnResourcePolicy?lang=typescript>`__
to configure and manage {+arps+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Ensure your |service| user has the appropriate organization role:
  
  - To view {+arps+}, you must have at least :authrole:`Organization Read Only` or 
    :authrole:`Organization Member` access to |service|.

  - To create, update, or delete an {+arp+}, you must have :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
    access to |service|. 

* To use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to create or manage {+arps+}, locate your public and private |api| keys so you can authenticate to the 
  :ref:`{+atlas-admin-api+} <atlas-admin-api>`. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-admin-api-access`.


Limitations
-----------

* {+arps+} are allow-by-default. If no {+arps+} exist, users can perform all actions on |service| {+clusters+}
  that their :ref:`Atlas user role <user-roles>` allows.

* {+arps+} ensure compliance with defined goals but do not enforce intermediate 
  or transitional states. For example, if a downstream component fails, the policy 
  may temporarily enter a non-compliant intermediate state. You should proactively 
  monitor your list of non-compliant resources using the 
  :oas-atlas-op:`/orgs/{ORG-ID}/nonCompliantResources </getResourcesNonCompliant>` endpoint. 

* Our implemented version of {+cedar+} supports only one Cedar policy per ``.cedar`` file, but you 
  can list multiple Cedar policies (``.cedar`` files) in your {+arp+}. 
  Each ``.cedar`` file is identified in the :ref:`{+atlas-admin-api+} <atlas-admin-api>` 
  response as a unique 24-hexadecimal character string after ``policies.id``.

* Each {+arp+} must have a unique name. If you attempt to create an {+arp+} with an existing name, the server responds 
  with a ``400 (Bad Request)`` status code.

* If the :ref:`auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` limits on your existing {+cluster+}
  don't match the new {+arp+}, the {+cluster+} might exceed the policy's defined boundaries. 
  To address this issue, use the :oas-atlas-op:`/orgs/{ORG-ID}/nonCompliantResources` 
  endpoint to identify and monitor non-compliant resources so you can update them to meet 
  policy requirements.

* Before enabling network-layer controls, review your existing :ref:`IP access list <access-list>` 
  to ensure it contains all necessary access points.

* Private endpoint definitions in {+cedar+} require that you enter individual IP addresses, 
  as wildcard operations are not supported.

Using the Cedar Policy Language 
-------------------------------

MongoDB uses the open-source {+cedar+} to define {+arps+}. 
Cedar's design balances expressiveness with simplicity, employing a concise syntax 
that streamlines both writing and understanding resource policies.

To quickly create an {+arp+}, adapt the :ref:`examples <arp-examples>` and add to |service|
using the {+atlas-ui+} or {+atlas-admin-api+} by following :ref:`procedure-create-atlas-resource-policy`.

To learn more about {+cedar+}, see:

- :ref:`key-cedar-elements`
- :ref:`example-cedar-policy`
- `Cedar GitHub Repository <https://github.com/cedar-policy>`__.

Key Cedar Syntax Elements for |service|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 30 40 30

   * - Cedar Element
     - Descripton
     - {+arp+} Options

   * - ``forbid``
     - Denies the specified action if conditions in the ``when`` clause are met. 
       The converse element, ``permit``, is not allowed in {+arps+}.
     - Example: ``forbid (principal, action, resource) when { ... };``

   * - ``principal``
     - Defines the user affected by the policy. 
     - Applied universally by default. Do not change or omit.

   * - ``action``
     - Represents the action being controlled in the policy. 
     - Available actions:
  
       - Restrict IP access list: ``ResourcePolicy::Action::"project.ipAccessList.modify"``
       - Restrict cluster attributes: ``ResourcePolicy::Action::"cluster.modify"``
       - Modify maintenance window: ``ResourcePolicy::Action::"project.maintenanceWindow.modify"``

   * - ``ResourcePolicy::Cluster::"<CLUSTER-ID>"``
     - Refers to a specific {+cluster+}
     - To find your {+cluster+} ID, use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to 
       :oas-atlas-op:`return all {+clusters+} in a project </listClusters>`.
  
   * - ``ResourcePolicy::Project::"<PROJECT-ID>"``
     - Refers to a specific project. For example, ``ResourcePolicy::Project::"6217f7fff7957854e2d09179"``
     - To find your project ID, see :ref:`atlas-modify-project-settings`.

   * - ``context.cluster.project``
     -  Specifies the project to which the {+cluster+} belongs. 
     -  To find your project ID, see :ref:`atlas-modify-project-settings`.

   * - ``context.cluster.cloudProviders``
     -  Specifies the allowed cloud providers. 
     -  Available options: 
  
        - ``ResourcePolicy::CloudProvider::"aws"`` 
        - ``ResourcePolicy::CloudProvider::"azure"``
        - ``ResourcePolicy::CloudProvider::"gcp"``

   * - ``context.cluster.regions``
     - Limits access based on deployment regions. 
     - For example, ``ResourcePolicy::Region::"aws:us-east-1"``. For a list of available 
       regions by cloud provider see :ref:`amazon-aws`, :ref:`google-gcp`, 
       or :ref:`microsoft-azure`.

   * - ``context.cluster has <PROPERTY>``
     - Checks if a specific property exists within the cluster context.
     - Available properties:

       - Minimum General class :ref:`cluster tier <create-cluster-instance>`: ``minGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue``
       - Maximum General class :ref:`cluster tier <create-cluster-instance>`: ``maxGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue``
   
   * - ``context.cluster.minGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue``
     - Sets the minimum :ref:`cluster tier <create-cluster-instance>` for scaling the {+cluster+} down to.
     - For example, ``context.cluster.minGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue < 30`` matches {+clusters+} 
       whose current tier or minimum :ref:`auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` size is less than ``M30``. 

   * - ``context.cluster.maxGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue``
     - Sets the maximum :ref:`cluster tier <create-cluster-instance>` for scaling the {+cluster+} up to.
     - For example, ``context.cluster.maxGeneralClassInstanceSizeValue < 60`` matches {+clusters+} 
       whose current tier or maximum :ref:`auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` size is less than ``M60``. 

   * - ``context.project.hasDefinedMaintenanceWindow``
     - Requires that a project has a :ref:`maintenance window <configure-maintenance-window>` configured.
     - For example, ``context.project.hasDefinedMaintenanceWindow == false`` checks 
       if the project has no maintenance window configured.
   
   * - ``context.project.ipAccessList``
     - Specifies the IP addresses that can access the {+cluster+}. 
     - You can block a wildcard IP ``ip("0.0.0.0/0")`` to enhance security.

   * - ``context.project.peeringConnections``
     - Refers to a specific |vpc| peering connection.
     - To format for your specific cloud provider, see :ref:`prevent-peering-modifications`.

   * - ``context.project.privateEndpoints``
     - Refers to a specific private endpoint.
     - To format for your specific cloud provider, see :ref:`prevent-private-endpoint-modifications`.

   * - ``containsAny`` and ``containsAll``
     - Checks for inclusion of one or more elements (``containsAny``) or all 
       elements (``containsAll``) from a list.
     - Example: ``context.cluster.regions.containsAny([ResourcePolicy::Region::"aws:us-east-1"])``
   
   * - ``unless``
     - Specifies exceptions to a policy. Actions are forbidden unless certain conditions are met.
     - Example: ``forbid (principal, action, resource) unless { condition };``

   * - Logical Operators (``&&``, ``||``)
     - Combine multiple conditions in a policy.
     - Available options:

       - ``&&`` (AND): Requires all conditions to be true.
       - ``||`` (OR): Requires at least one condition to be true.

   * - IP Addressing (``ip``)
     - Refers to specific IP addresses or ranges in policies. 
     - Available options: 

       - ``ip("0.0.0.0/0")`` for wildcard IP.
       - ``ip("1.2.3.4/32")`` for specific IP addresses.

..
   * - ``isEmpty``
     - Checks whether a list is empty. For example, enforcing no access over public 
       networks requires that the IP access list is empty.
     - ``forbid (principal, action == ResourcePolicy::Action::"project.ipAccessList.modify", resource) unless { context.project.ipAccessList.isEmpty() };``

.. _procedure-create-atlas-resource-policy:

Create an Atlas Resource Policy Configuration
---------------------------------------------

To create an {+arp+}, use the following procedure to construct a policy using {+cedar+} 
and add to |service| using the {+atlas-ui+} or the {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. warning::

   We recommend that you test this feature in a non-production environment by creating 
   a new organization with a fresh {+cluster+}. 
   This ensures you can assess the feature safely without impacting your existing systems as you skill up.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To create an {+arp+} using the {+atlas-admin-api+}, construct a policy using 
      {+cedar+} and pass it in to the {+atlas-admin-api+} via a ``POST`` request 
      using the ``policies`` parameter.
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Construct the policy in the Cedar policy language.

            Specify the rules for restricting resources using {+cedar+}. You can copy
            and modify the following example policies for your organization:
      
            * :ref:`restrict-cloud-provider`
            * :ref:`restrict-region`
            * :ref:`example-cedar-policy`
            * :ref:`restrict-ip-addresses`
            * :ref:`restrict-cluster-tier`
            * :ref:`require-maintenance-window`
            * :ref:`prevent-peering-modifications`
            * :ref:`prevent-private-endpoint-modifications`
  
            .. note::
         
               We recommend creating multiple, simple {+arps+} to make tracking easier. 
               For example, if you want to restrict cloud provider and multiple regions, 
               consider creating one {+arp+} that restricts the cloud provider and another 
               {+arp+} that restricts the regions. 
        
         .. step:: Send a ``POST`` request.

            Use the ``POST`` verb to create an {+arp+} for your organization. 
            The request must include:

            * ``name``: The name of the {+arp+}.
            * ``policies``: The {+cluster+} restrictions you defined in {+cedar+} in the previous step. If       you use quotes (``"``) in ``policies.body``, escape with a backslash (``\``).
      
            Example ``POST`` request:

            .. include:: /includes/arp-api-post-example.rst

            Example response:

            .. include:: /includes/arp-api-post-example-response.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To create an {+arp+} using the new {+atlas-ui+} editor, use the following 
      procedure to copy and paste an example policy into the editor, then modify 
      it for your organization.

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
      
         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-resource-policy.rst

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create policy`.

         .. step:: Name, describe, and define your {+arp+}.

            a. Give your {+arp+} a unique name.
            #. (Optional) Add a description.
            #. Copy and modify the following example policies for your organization, 
               then paste the code in the :guilabel:`Cedar Policy` field.
      
               * :ref:`restrict-cloud-provider-ui`
               * :ref:`restrict-region-ui`
               * :ref:`restrict-ip-addresses-ui`
               * :ref:`restrict-cluster-tier-ui`
               * :ref:`require-maintenance-window-ui`
               * :ref:`prevent-peering-modifications-ui`
               * :ref:`prevent-private-endpoint-modifications-ui`
  
               .. note::
         
                  We recommend creating multiple, simple {+arps+} to make tracking easier. 
                  For example, if you want to restrict cloud provider and multiple regions, 
                  consider creating one {+arp+} that restricts the cloud provider and another 
                  {+arp+} that restricts the regions. 
         
         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create policy`.

      This {+arp+} applies to all new {+clusters+}. For existing {+clusters+} that
      do not comply with the {+arp+}, |service| only allows users to make
      changes to the {+cluster+} which brings the {+cluster+} into compliance.
      For example, if ``cluster0`` runs on |aws| and you apply an {+arp+} that blocks 
      {+clusters+} on |aws|, the only change users could make to ``cluster0`` while 
      it is non-compliant is switching the cloud provider to |azure| or |gcp|.
      
      To return a list of existing {+clusters+} that do not conform to your {+arp+}, 
      use the ``GET`` 
      :oas-atlas-op:`/orgs/{ORG-ID}/nonCompliantResources </getResourcesNonCompliant>` resource.

      |service| generates an :ref:`activity feed event <view-activity-feed>` when 
      you create, update, or delete an {+arp+}. To help identify your activity feed events
      and make tracking easier, we recommend creating multiple, simple {+arps+}.
      For example, if you want to restrict the usage of a cloud provider and multiple regions,
      consider creating one {+arp+} that restricts the cloud provider and another 
      {+arp+} that restricts the regions.

Copy and modify the following example policies to use for your organization.
All examples use {+cedar+}, but for the {+atlas-admin-api+}, the examples are wrapped 
in |json| so you can paste them directly into your |api| calls.
