Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: logout

   .. deprecated:: 5.0

   Attempting to use the :dbcommand:`logout` command will write an 
   error message to the log once per logout attempt.
   
   This command will be removed in a future release.   

   .. note::

      This command was used when you could log in as multiple users on a single physical connection.
      Because this is no longer possible, running ``logout`` may cause connections to fail.
      Going forward, you can achieve the same results by closing your connection.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        logout: 1 
      }
   )


Example
-------

.. |operation-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`logout`
.. include:: /includes/note-logout-namespace.rst

.. example::

  .. include:: /includes/fact-change-database-context.rst

  When you have set the database context and ``db`` object, you
  can use the |operation-name| to log out of database as in the
  following operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { logout: 1 } )
