  A query expression to filter the list of collections.

  You can specify a query expression on any of the :ref:`fields
  returned <list-collection-output>` by {{role}}.

   A flag to indicate whether the command should return just the
   collection/view names and type or return both the name and other information.

   Returning just the name and type (``view`` or ``collection``) does
   not take collection-level locks whereas returning full collection
   information locks each collection in the database.

   The default value is ``false``.

   .. note::

      When ``nameOnly`` is ``true``, your ``filter`` expression can only
      filter based on a collection's name and type. No other fields are
      available.

name: authorizedCollections
type: boolean
description: |

   A flag, when set to ``true`` and used with ``nameOnly: true``, that
   allows a user without the required privilege (i.e.
   :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database) to run the
   command when access control is enforced.

   When both ``authorizedCollections`` and ``nameOnly`` options are set
   to true, the command returns only those collections for which the user
   has privileges. For example, if a user has :authaction:`find` action
   on specific collections, the command returns only those collections; or,
   if a user has :authaction:`find` or any other action, on the
   database resource, the command lists all collections in the database.

   The default value is ``false``. That is, the user must have
   :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database to run the
   command.

   For a user who has :authaction:`listCollections` action on the
   database, this option has no effect since the user has privileges to
   list the collections in the database.

   When used without ``nameOnly: true``, this option has no effect.
   That is, the user must have the required privileges to run the
   command when access control is enforced. Otherwise, the user is
   unauthorized to run the command.
