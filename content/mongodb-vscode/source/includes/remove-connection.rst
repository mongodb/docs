|vsce| provides two methods to remove a connection to a deployment from
|vscode-short|. You can:

- Remove a connection from the :guilabel:`MongoDB` view in the 
  :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.
- Remove a connection with the Command Palette.

.. important::

   Removing a connection from |vscode-short| removes it both from the 
   current workspace and from |vscode-short| globally.
