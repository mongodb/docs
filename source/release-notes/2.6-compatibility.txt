====================================
Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 2.6
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. important:: The MongoDB 2.6.0-rc series, which will become MongoDB
   2.6, is for testing and development **only**. All identifiers,
   names, interfaces are subject to change. Do **not** use a MongoDB
   2.6.0-rc release in production situations.

The following 2.6 changes can affect the compatibility with older
versions of MongoDB. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6` for the full list of
the 2.6 changes.

Index Changes
-------------

.. _2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility:

Enforce Index Key Length Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 implements a stronger enforcement of the limit on
   :limit:`index key length <Index Key>`.

   Creating indexes will error if an index key in an existing document
   exceeds the limit:

   - :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`,
     :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`, and
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` will error and not create the index.
     Previous versions of MongoDB would create the index but not index
     such documents.

   - Because :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`,
     and :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` drop *all* the indexes from a
     collection and then recreate them sequentially, the error from the
     index key limit prevents these operations from rebuilding any
     remaining indexes for the collection and, in the case of the
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command, from continuing with the
     remainder of the process.

   Inserts will error:

   - :method:`db.collection.insert()` and other operations that perform
     inserts (e.g. :method:`db.collection.save()` and
     :method:`db.collection.update()` with ``upsert`` that result in
     inserts) will fail to insert if the new document has an indexed
     field value that exceeds the limit. Previous versions of MongoDB
     would insert but not index such documents.

   - :program:`mongorestore` and :program:`mongoimport` will fail to
     insert if the new document has an indexed field value that exceeds
     the limit.

   Updates will error:

   - :method:`db.collection.update()` and
     :method:`db.collection.save()` operations on an indexed field will
     error if the new value for the field exceeds the limit.

   - If an existing document contains a value for the indexed field
     that exceeds the limit, updates on other fields that result in the
     relocation of a document on disk will error.

   Chunk Migration will fail:

   - Migrations will fail for a chunk that has a document with an
     indexed field that exceeds the index key length limit.

   - If left unfixed, the chunk will repeatedly fail migration,
     effectively ceasing chunk balancing for that collection. Or, if
     chunk splits occur in response to the migration failures, this
     response would lead to unnecessarily large number of chunks and an
     overly large config databases.

   Secondary members of replica sets will warn:

   - Secondaries will continue to replicate documents with an indexed
     field value that exceeds the limit on initial sync but will print
     warnings in the logs.

   - Secondaries allow index build and rebuild operations on a
     collection that contains an indexed field value that exceeds the
     limit but with warnings in the logs.

   - With *mixed version* replica sets where the secondaries are
     version 2.6 and the primary is version 2.4, secondaries will
     replicate documents inserted or updated on the 2.4 primary, but
     will print error messages in the log if the documents contain
     indexed field value that exceeds the limit.

Solution
   Run :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()` to find current keys that violate this
   limit and correct as appropriate. Preferably, run the test before
   upgrading; i.e. connect the 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell to your
   MongoDB 2.4 database and run the method.

If you have an existing data set and want to disable the default index
key length validation so that you can upgrade before resolving these
indexing issues, use the :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` parameter.

Index Specifications Validate Field Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   In MongoDB 2.6, create and re-index operations fail when the index
   key refers to an empty field, e.g. ``"a..b" : 1`` or the field name
   starts with a dollar sign (``$``).

   - :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will not create a new index
     with an invalid or empty key name.

   - :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`, and
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` will error if an index exists with an
     invalid or empty key name.

   Previous versions of MongoDB allow the index.

Solution
   Run :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()` to find current keys that violate this
   limit and correct as appropriate. Preferably, run the test before
   upgrading; i.e. connect the 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell to your
   MongoDB 2.4 database and run the method.

``ensureIndex`` and Existing Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` now errors:

   - if you try to create an existing index but with different
     options; e.g. in the following example, the second
     :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will error.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { x: 1 } )
        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { x: 1 }, { unique: 1 } )

   - if you specify an index name that already exists but the key
     specifications differ; e.g. in the following example, the second
     :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will error.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { name: "myIdx" } )
        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { z: 1 }, { name: "myIdx" } )

   Previous versions did not create the index but did not error.

Security Changes
----------------

.. _authentication-incompatibility:

New Authorization Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 :ref:`authorization model <authorization>` changes how
   MongoDB stores and manages user privilege information:

   - Before the upgrade, MongoDB 2.6 requires at least one user in the
     admin database.

   - MongoDB versions using older models cannot create/modify users or
     create user-defined roles.

Solution
   Ensure that at least one user exists in the admin database. If no
   user exists in the admin database, add a user. Then upgrade to
   MongoDB 2.6. Finally, upgrade the user privilege model. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

   .. important::

      .. include:: /includes/important-upgrade-auth-model-prerequisites.rst

.. seealso:: :ref:`2.6-relnotes-security`

.. _ssl-hostname-validation:

SSL Certificate Hostname Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   The SSL certificate validation now checks the Common Name (``CN``)
   and the Subject Alternative Name (``SAN``) fields to ensure that
   either the ``CN`` or one of the ``SAN`` entries matches the hostname
   of the server. As a result, if you currently use SSL and *neither*
   the ``CN`` nor any of the ``SAN`` entries of your current SSL
   certificates match the hostnames, upgrading to version 2.6 will
   cause the SSL connections to fail.

Solution
   To allow for the continued use of these certificates, MongoDB
   provides the :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting. The
   setting is available for:

   - :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` to bypass the validation
     of SSL certificates on other servers in the cluster.

   - :program:`mongo` shell, :ref:`MongoDB tools that support SSL
     <mongodb-tools-support-ssl>`, and the C++ driver to bypass the
     validation of server certificates.

   When using the :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB
   logs as a warning the use of the invalid certificates.

   .. warning:: The :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting
      bypasses the other certificate validation, such as checks for
      expiration and valid signatures.

Package Configuration Changes
-----------------------------

.. _2.6-default-bindip-incompatibility:

Default ``bind_ip`` for RPM/DEB Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   In the official MongoDB packages in RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora
   Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives),
   the default :setting:`bind_ip` value attaches MongoDB components to
   the localhost interface *only*. These packages set this default in
   the default configuration file (i.e. ``/etc/mongodb.conf``.)

Solution
   If you use one of these packages and have *not* modified the default
   ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` file, you will need to set :setting:`bind_ip`
   before or during the upgrade.

There is no default ``bind_ip`` setting in any other official MongoDB
packages.

.. _2.6-snmp-iana-mib-incompatibility:

SNMP Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   - The IANA enterprise identifier for MongoDB changed from
     37601 to 34601.

   - MongoDB changed the MIB field name ``globalopcounts`` to
     ``globalOpcounts``.

Solution
   - Users of SNMP monitoring must modify their SNMP configuration
     (i.e. MIB) from 37601 to 34601.

   - Update references to ``globalopcounts`` to ``globalOpcounts``.

Replica Set/Sharded Cluster Validation
--------------------------------------

.. _2.6-metadata-check-incompatibility:

Shard Name Checks on Metadata Refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   For sharded clusters, MongoDB 2.6 disallows a shard from refreshing
   the metadata if the shard name has not been explicitly set.

   For mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4
   and version 2.6 shards, this change can cause errors when migrating
   chunks **from** version 2.4 shards **to** version 2.6 shards if the
   shard name is unknown to the version 2.6 shards. MongoDB does not
   support migrations in mixed sharded cluster deployments.

Solution
   Upgrade all components of the cluster to 2.6. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

.. _2.6-repl-set-vote-incompatibility:

Replica Set Vote Configuration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB now deprecates giving any :term:`replica set` member more
   than a single vote. During configuration,
   :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].votes` should only have a
   value of 1 for voting members and 0 for non-voting members. MongoDB
   treats values other than 1 or 0 as a value of 1 and produces a
   warning message.

Solution
   Update :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].votes` with values
   other than 1 or 0 to 1 or 0 as appropriate.

Remove Method Signature Change
------------------------------

``remove()`` Method Requires a Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   :method:`db.collection.remove()` requires a query document as a
   parameter. In previous versions, the method invocation without a
   query document deleted all documents in a collection.

Solution
   For existing :method:`db.collection.remove()` invocations without a
   query document, modify the invocations to include an empty document
   :method:`db.collection.remove({})`.

Update Operator Changes
-----------------------

.. _update-operations-incompatibility:

Enforce Field Name Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   - Updates cannot use :doc:`update operators (e.g $set)
     </reference/operator/update>` to target fields with empty field
     names (i.e. ``""``).

   - Updates no longer support saving field names that contain a dot
     (``.``) or a field name that starts with a dollar sign (``$``).

Solution
   - For existing documents that currently have fields with empty names
     ``""``, replace the whole document. See
     :method:`db.collection.update()` and
     :method:`db.collection.save()` for details on replacing an
     existing document.

   - :update:`Unset <$unset>` or :update:`rename <$rename>` existing
     fields with names that contain a dot (``.``) or that start with a
     dollar sign (``$``). Run :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()` to find fields
     whose names contain a dot or starts with a dollar sign.

See :ref:`rel-notes-write-operations` for all changes to the write
operations, including updates.

Query and Sort Changes
----------------------

.. _query-field-name-incompatibility:

Enforce Field Name Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   Queries cannot specify conditions on fields with names that start
   with a dollar sign (``$``).

Solution
   :update:`Unset <$unset>` or :update:`rename <$rename>` existing
   fields whose names start with a dollar sign (``$``). Run
   :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDbs()` to find fields whose names start
   with a dollar sign.

.. _2.6-sort-value-incompatibility:

``sort()`` Specification Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   The :method:`~cursor.sort()` method **only** accepts the following
   values for the sort keys:

   - ``1`` to specify ascending order for a field,

   - ``-1`` to specify descending order for a field, or

   - :projection:`$meta` expression to specify sort by the text search
     score.

   Any other value will result in an error.

   Previous versions also accepted either ``true`` or ``false`` for
   ascending.

Solution
   Update sort key values that use ``true`` or ``false`` to ``1``.

.. _2.6-skip-incompatibility:

``skip()`` and ``_id`` Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   Equality match on the ``_id`` field obeys :method:`~cursor.skip()`.

   Previous versions ignored :method:`~cursor.skip()` when performing
   an equality match on the ``_id`` field.

.. _2.6-explain-query-plan-incompatibility:

``explain()`` Retains Query Plan Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   :method:`~cursor.explain()` no longer clears the :doc:`query plans
   </core/query-plans>` cached for that :term:`query shape`.

   In previous versions, :method:`~cursor.explain()` would have the
   side effect of clearing the query plan cache for that query shape.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/method/js-plan-cache`

.. _2.6-sparse-index-incompatibility:

Sparse Index and Incomplete Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   If a :doc:`sparse index </core/index-sparse>` results in an
   incomplete result set for queries and sort operations, MongoDB will
   not use that index unless a :method:`~cursor.hint()` explicitly
   specifies the index.

Solution
   To override the behavior to use the sparse index and return
   incomplete results, explicitly specify the index with a
   :method:`~cursor.hint()`.

See :ref:`sparse-index-incomplete-results` for an example that details
the new behavior.

Geospatial Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _2.6-2dsphere-version-incompatibility:

``2dsphere`` Index Version 2
````````````````````````````

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 introduces a version 2 of the :doc:`2dsphere index
   </core/2dsphere>`. If a document lacks a ``2dsphere``
   index field (or the field is ``null`` or an empty array), MongoDB
   does not add an entry for the document to the ``2dsphere`` index.
   For inserts, MongoDB inserts the document but does not add to the
   ``2dsphere`` index.

   Previous version would not insert documents where the ``2dsphere``
   index field is a ``null`` or an empty array. For documents that lack
   the ``2dsphere`` index field, previous versions would insert and
   index the document.

Solution
   To revert to old behavior, create the ``2dsphere`` index with ``{
   "2dsphereIndexVersion" : 1 }`` to create a version 1 index. However,
   version 1 index cannot use the new GeoJSON geometries.

.. seealso:: :ref:`2dsphere-v2`

.. _2.6-geo-maxDistance-incompatibility:

``$maxDistance`` Changes
````````````````````````

Description
   - For :query:`$near` queries on GeoJSON data, if the queries specify
     a :query:`$maxDistance`, :query:`$maxDistance` must be inside of
     the :query:`$near` document.

     In previous version, :query:`$maxDistance` could be either inside
     or outside the :query:`$near` document.

   - :query:`$maxDistance` must be a positive value.

Solution
   - Update any existing :query:`$near` queries on GeoJSON data that
     currently have the :query:`$maxDistance` outside the
     :query:`$near` document

   - Update any existing queries where :query:`$maxDistance` is a
     negative value.

.. _2.6-uniqueDocs-incompatibility:

Deprecated ``$uniqueDocs``
``````````````````````````

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 deprecates :query:`$uniqueDocs`, and geospatial queries
   no longer return duplicated results when a document matches the
   query multiple times.

.. _2.6-geospatial-validation-incompatibility:

Stronger Validation of Geospatial Queries
`````````````````````````````````````````

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 enforces a stronger validation of geospatial queries,
   such as validating the options or GeoJSON specifications, and errors
   if the geospatial query is invalid. Previous versions
   allowed/ignored invalid options.

Query Operator Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _2.6-not-incompatibility:

``$not`` Query Behavior Changes
```````````````````````````````

Description
   - Queries with :query:`$not` expressions on an indexed field now match
     those documents that are missing the indexed
     field. Previous versions would not return these documents.

   - The :query:`$not` now matches documents whose the field contains a
     type that differs from that of the specified value, in addition to
     matching documents that do not match the operator expression or
     are missing the field.

     Previous versions only matched those documents whose fields did
     not match the operator expression or are missing the field.

   - MongoDB 2.6 allows chaining of :query:`$not` expressions.

.. _2.6-all-incompatibility:

``$all`` Operator Behavior Change
`````````````````````````````````

Description
   - The :query:`$all` operator is now equivalent to an :query:`$and`
     operation of the specified values. This change in behavior can
     allow for more matches than previous versions when passed an array
     of a single nested array (e.g. ``[ [ "A" ] ]``). When passed an
     array of a nested array, :query:`$all` can now match documents
     where the field contains the nested array as an element (e.g.
     ``field: [ [ "A" ], ... ]``), *or* the field equals the nested
     array (e.g. ``field: [ "A", "B" ]``). Earlier version could only
     match documents where the field contains the nested array.

   - The :query:`$all` operator returns no match if the array field
     contains nested arrays (e.g. ``field: [ "a", ["b"] ]``) and
     :query:`$all` on the nested field is the element of the nested
     array (e.g. ``"field.1": { $all: [ "b" ] }``). Previous versions
     would return a match.

.. _2.6-mod-operator-incompatibility:

``$mod`` Operator Enforces Strict Syntax
````````````````````````````````````````

Description
   The :query:`$mod` operator now only accepts an array with exactly
   two elements, and errors when passed an array with fewer or more
   elements. See :ref:`mod-not-enough-elements` and :ref:`mod-too-many-elements`
   for details.

   In previous versions, if passed an array with one element, the
   :query:`$mod` operator uses ``0`` as the second element, and if
   passed an array with more than two elements, the :query:`$mod`
   ignores all but the first two elements. Previous versions do return
   an error when passed an empty array.

Solution
   Ensure that the array passed to :query:`$mod` contains exactly two
   elements:

   - If the array contains the a single element, add ``0`` as the
     second element.

   - If the array contains more than two elements, remove the extra
     elements.

.. _2.6-where-incompatibility:

``$where`` Must Be Top-Level
````````````````````````````

Description
   :query:`$where` expressions can now only be at top level and cannot be
   nested within another expression, such as :query:`$elemMatch`.

Solution
   Update existing queries that nest :query:`$where`.

``null`` Comparison Queries
````````````````````````````

Description
   - :query:`$lt` and :query:`$gt` comparisons to null no
     longer match documents that are missing the field.

   - ``null`` equality conditions on array elements (e.g. ``"a.b":
     null``) no longer match document missing the nested field ``a.b``
     (e.g. ``a: [ 2, 3 ]``)

.. _2.6-min-max-key-equality-match-incompatibility:

``MinKey`` and ``MaxKey`` Queries
`````````````````````````````````

Description
   Equality match for either ``MinKey`` or
   ``MaxKey`` no longer match documents missing the field.

.. COMMENT will wait to doc the following in case the resolution
   matches the 2.4 behavior. :query:`$elemMatch` against nested arrays
   - SERVER-12496

Log Messages
------------

Timestamp Format Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
  Each message now starts with the timestamp formatted in
  ``iso8601-local``, i.e. ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.mmm<+/-Offset>``. For
  example, ``2014-03-04T20:13:38.944-0500``. Previous versions used
  ``ctime`` format.

Solution
  MongoDB adds a new option :option:`--timeStampFormat` which supports
  timestamp format in :option:`ctime <--timeStampFormat>`,
  :option:`iso8601-utc <--timeStampFormat>`, and :option:`iso8601-local
  <--timeStampFormat>` (new default).

.. Commenting out the others for now -- they're just placeholders and notes for self
.. Other
   ~~~~~
   - ``query`` log messages add new field ``planSummary`.
   - ``getmore`` log messages now omit the ``query`` field.
   - :program:`mongo` shell now calls :dbcommand:`isMaster` command
     instead of the ``admin`` command :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`
     during the construction of the shell prompt. Log messages change
     accordingly, as in the following
     .. code-block:: none
        command: { isMaster: 1.0, forShell: 1.0 } keyUpdates:0 numYields:0  reslen:178 0ms
   - In 2.6, remove operations use the new :dbcommand:`delete` command.
     For a remove operation, MongoDB now logs a remove message and a
     ``delete`` command message, as in the following example:
     .. code-block:: none
     2014-03-04T21:16:21.992-0500 [conn1] remove test.server12774 query: { a: { $lt: 3.0 } } ndeleted:2 keyUpdates:0 numYields:0 locks(micros) w:344 0ms
     2014-03-04T21:16:21.993-0500 [conn1] command test.$cmd command: { delete: "myCollection", deletes: [ { q: { a: { $lt: 3.0 } }, limit: 0.0 } ], ordered: true } keyUpdates:0 numYields:0  reslen:40 0ms
     in shell, no longer automatic getlasterror message
   - Other write commands
   - MongoDB removes the two blank lines preceding and following the:
     ``***** SERVER RESTARTED *****`` message.
   - ``writeback`` error message and ``FlushViewOfFile`` error message
     removes the space between the duration time and ``ms``.
