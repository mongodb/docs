================================
Remove Processes from Monitoring
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove processes from monitoring by |mms|, in which case |mms| no
longer manages the processes nor displays them in the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page

This procedure *does not* shut down the processes. If you *unmanage*
running processes, the processes continue to run. If
you also intend to stop the processes, do that first. See
:doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.

Consideration
-------------

Instead of removing processes from monitoring, you can optionally
disable their alerts, which allows you to continue to view the processes in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.

Prerequisite
------------

If the processes are no longer needed for any purpose, shut them down
before removing them. Otherwise they will continue to
run, even though |mms| no longer monitors them. See
:doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.

Procedure
---------
