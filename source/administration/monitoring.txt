Monitoring is a critical component of all database administration. A
firm grasp of MongoDB's reporting will allow you to assess the state
of your database and maintain your deployment without crisis.
Additionally, a sense of MongoDB's normal operational parameters will
allow you to diagnose problems before they escalate to failures.

This document presents an overview of the available monitoring utilities
and the reporting statistics
available in MongoDB. It also introduces diagnostic strategies
and suggestions for monitoring replica sets and
sharded clusters.

Monitoring Strategies
---------------------

There are three methods for collecting data about the state of a
running MongoDB instance:

- First, there is a set of utilities distributed with MongoDB that
  provides real-time reporting of database activities.

- Second, :doc:`database commands </reference/command>` return
  statistics regarding the current database state with greater
  fidelity.

- Third, |mms-home|, a hosted
  service, and :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
  </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`,
  provide monitoring to collect data from running MongoDB deployments
  as well as providing visualization and alerts based on that data.

Each strategy can help answer different questions and is useful in
different contexts. These methods are complementary.

MongoDB Reporting Tools
-----------------------

This section provides an overview of the reporting methods distributed
with MongoDB. It also offers examples of the kinds of questions that
each method is best suited to help you address.

Utilities
~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB distribution includes a number of utilities that quickly
return statistics about instances' performance and activity. Typically,
these are most useful for diagnosing issues and assessing normal
operation.

``mongostat``
`````````````

:program:`mongostat` captures and returns the counts of database
operations by type (e.g. insert, query, update, delete, etc.). These
counts report on the load distribution on the server.

Use :program:`mongostat` to understand the distribution of operation types
and to inform capacity planning. See the :doc:`mongostat manual
</reference/program/mongostat>` for details.

``mongotop``
````````````

:program:`mongotop` tracks and reports the current read and write
activity of a MongoDB instance, and reports these statistics on a per
collection basis.

Use :program:`mongotop` to check if your database activity and use
match your expectations. See the :doc:`mongotop manual
</reference/program/mongotop>` for details.

.. _http-console:

HTTP Console
````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

MongoDB provides a web interface that exposes diagnostic
and monitoring information in a simple web page. The web interface is
accessible at ``localhost:<port>``, where the
``<port>`` number is **1000** more than the :program:`mongod` port .

For example, if a locally running :program:`mongod` is using the
default port ``27017``, access the HTTP console at
``http://localhost:28017``.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB includes a number of commands that report on the state of the
database.

These data may provide a finer level of granularity than the utilities
discussed above. Consider using their output in scripts and programs to
develop custom alerts, or to modify the behavior of your application in
response to the activity of your instance. The :method:`db.currentOp`
method is another useful tool for identifying the database instance's
in-progress operations.

``serverStatus``
````````````````

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command, or :method:`db.serverStatus()`
from the shell, returns a general overview of the status of the
database, detailing disk usage, memory use, connection, journaling,
and index access. The command returns quickly and does not impact
MongoDB performance.

:dbcommand:`serverStatus` outputs an account of the state of a MongoDB
instance. This command is rarely run directly. In most cases, the data
is more meaningful when aggregated, as one would see with monitoring
tools including |mms-home| and :products:`Ops Manager
</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`. Nevertheless, all
administrators should be familiar with the data provided by
:dbcommand:`serverStatus`.

``dbStats``
```````````

The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command, or :method:`db.stats()` from the shell,
returns a document that addresses storage use and data volumes. The
:dbcommand:`dbStats` reflect the amount of
storage used, the quantity of data contained in the database, and
object, collection, and index counters.

Use this data to monitor the state and storage capacity
of a specific database. This output also allows you to compare
use between databases and to determine the average
:term:`document` size in a database.

``collStats``
`````````````

The :dbcommand:`collStats` or :method:`db.collection.stats()` from the
shell that provides statistics that resemble :dbcommand:`dbStats` on
the collection level, including a count of the objects in the
collection, the size of the collection, the amount of disk space used
by the collection, and information about its indexes.

``replSetGetStatus``
````````````````````

The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command (:method:`rs.status()` from
the shell) returns an overview of your replica set's status. The :doc:`replSetGetStatus
</reference/command/replSetGetStatus>` document details the
state and configuration of the replica set and statistics about its members.

Use this data to ensure that replication is properly configured,
and to check the connections between the current host and the other members
of the replica set.

Third Party Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of third party monitoring tools have support for MongoDB,
either directly, or through their own plugins.

Self Hosted Monitoring Tools
````````````````````````````

These are monitoring tools that you must install, configure and maintain
on your own servers. Most are open source.

Process Logging
---------------

During normal operation, :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
instances report a live account of all server activity and operations
to either
standard output or a log file. The following runtime settings
control these options.

- :setting:`~systemLog.quiet`. Limits the amount of information written to the
  log or output.

- :setting:`~systemLog.verbosity`. Increases the amount of information written to
  the log or output. You can also modify the logging verbosity during
  runtime with the :parameter:`logLevel` parameter or the
  :method:`db.setLogLevel()` method in the shell.

- :setting:`~systemLog.path`. Enables logging to a file, rather than the standard
  output. You must specify the full path to the log file when adjusting
  this setting.

- :setting:`~systemLog.logAppend`. Adds information to a log
  file instead of overwriting the file.

.. note::

   You can specify these configuration operations as the command line
   arguments to :doc:`mongod </reference/program/mongod>` or :doc:`mongos
   </reference/program/mongos>`

   For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log --logappend

   Starts a :program:`mongod` instance in :setting:`verbose
   <systemLog.verbosity>` mode, appending data to the log file at
   ``/var/log/mongodb/server1.log/``.

The following :term:`database commands <database command>` also
affect logging:

- :dbcommand:`getLog`. Displays recent messages from the
  :program:`mongod` process log.

- :dbcommand:`logRotate`. Rotates the log files for :program:`mongod`
  processes only. See :doc:`/tutorial/rotate-log-files`.

Diagnosing Performance Issues
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/intro-performance.rst

.. _replica-set-monitoring:

Replication and Monitoring
--------------------------

Beyond the basic monitoring requirements for any MongoDB instance, for
replica sets, administrators must monitor *replication
lag*. "Replication lag" refers to the amount of time that it takes to
copy (i.e. replicate) a write operation on the :term:`primary` to a
:term:`secondary`. Some small delay period may be acceptable, but two
significant problems emerge as replication lag grows:

- First, operations that occurred during the period of lag are not
  replicated to one or more secondaries. If you're using replication
  to ensure data persistence, exceptionally long delays may impact the
  integrity of your data set.

- Second, if the replication lag exceeds the length of the operation
  log (:term:`oplog`) then MongoDB will have to perform an initial
  sync on the secondary, copying all data from the :term:`primary` and
  rebuilding all indexes. This is uncommon under normal circumstances,
  but if you configure the oplog to be smaller than the default,
  the issue can arise.

  .. note::

     The size of the oplog is only configurable during the first
     run using the :option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>` argument to
     the :program:`mongod` command, or preferably, the
     :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` setting
     in the MongoDB configuration file. If you do not specify this on the
     command line before running with the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
     option, :program:`mongod` will create a default sized oplog.

     By default, the oplog is 5 percent of total available disk space
     on 64-bit systems. For more information about changing the oplog
     size, see the :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`

For causes of replication lag, see :ref:`Replication Lag
<replica-set-replication-lag>`.

Replication issues are most often the result of network connectivity
issues between members, or the result of a :term:`primary` that does not
have the resources to support application and replication traffic. To
check the status of a replica, use the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` or
the following helper in the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status()

The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` reference provides a more in-depth
overview view of this output. In general, watch the value of
:data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.optimeDate`, and pay particular attention
to the time difference between the :term:`primary` and the
:term:`secondary` members.

Sharding and Monitoring
-----------------------

In most cases, the components of :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
benefit from the same monitoring and analysis as all other MongoDB
instances. In addition, clusters require further monitoring to ensure
that data is effectively distributed among nodes and that sharding
operations are functioning appropriately.

.. seealso:: See the :doc:`/core/sharding` documentation for more
   information.

Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`config database` maintains a map identifying which
documents are on which shards. The cluster updates this map as
:term:`chunks <chunk>` move between shards. When a configuration
server becomes inaccessible, certain sharding operations become
unavailable, such as moving chunks and starting :program:`mongos`
instances. However, clusters remain accessible from already-running
:program:`mongos` instances.

Because inaccessible configuration servers can seriously impact
the availability of a sharded cluster, you should monitor your
configuration servers to ensure that the cluster remains well
balanced and that :program:`mongos` instances can restart.

|mms-home| and :products:`Ops Manager
</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>` monitor config servers and can
create notifications if a config server becomes inaccessible. See the
|mms-docs| and :opsmgr:`Ops Manager documentation
</application>` for more information.

Balancing and Chunk Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most effective :term:`sharded cluster` deployments evenly balance
:term:`chunks <chunk>` among the shards. To facilitate this, MongoDB
has a background :term:`balancer` process that distributes data to ensure that
chunks are always optimally distributed among the :term:`shards <shard>`.

Issue the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` or :method:`sh.status()`
command to the :program:`mongos` by way of the :program:`mongo`
shell. This returns an overview of the entire cluster including the
database name, and a list of the chunks.

Stale Locks
~~~~~~~~~~~

In nearly every case, all locks used by the balancer are automatically
released when they become stale. However, because any long lasting
lock can block future balancing, it's important to ensure that all
locks are legitimate. To check the lock status of the database,
connect to a :program:`mongos` instance using the :program:`mongo`
shell. Issue the following command sequence to switch to the
``config`` database and display all outstanding locks on the shard database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.locks.find()

For active deployments, the above query can provide insights.
The balancing process, which originates on a randomly selected
:program:`mongos`, takes a special "balancer" lock that prevents other
balancing activity from transpiring. Use the following command, also
to the ``config`` database, to check the status of the "balancer"
lock.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.locks.find( { _id : "balancer" } )

If this lock exists, make sure that the balancer process is actively
using this lock.
