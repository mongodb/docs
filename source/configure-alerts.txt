         When you configure an alert, you select how notifications are
         sent. You can select multiple notification methods, such as
         email, text message, or team collaboration tools.

         |service| supports Slack as a notification method. From the
         organization's :guilabel:`Settings` menu, click
         :guilabel:`Add to Slack` in :guilabel:`Slack` Settings and
         log in to your preferred Slack workspace.

         |service| supports configuring all of the following
         notification methods during alert configuration:

         - |service| Organization

         - |service| User

         - Email

         notification methods in the project's :guilabel:`Settings`.
         If the notification method's value becomes invalid, |service|
         sends an email to the project owner. The following
         notification methods require set up in the project's
         :guilabel:`Settings`:
