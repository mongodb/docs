An |ipaddr| is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. In |govcloud|, you can only connect to a cluster from a trusted
IP address. Within |govcloud-short|, you can create a list of trusted IP
addresses, referred to as a IP access list, that can be used to connect
to your cluster and access your data.

Procedure
---------

You must add your IP address to the IP access list before you can 
connect to your cluster. To add your IP address to the IP access list:

.. include:: /includes/steps/allow-ip.rst

.. seealso:: |service| documentation

   :atlas:`Configure IP Access List Entries </security/ip-access-list/>`

Next Steps
----------

Now that you've added your connection IP address to the IP access list,
proceed to
:ref:`Create a Database User for Your Cluster <create-dbuser>`.
