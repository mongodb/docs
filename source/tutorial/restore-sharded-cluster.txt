Restore a Sharded Cluster from a Backup
=======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

When you restore a cluster from a backup, |mms| provides you with a
restore files for the selected restore point. For an overview of the
restore process, please see :doc:`/core/restore-overview`.

Prerequisites

Snapshots when Agent Cannot Stop Balancer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| displays a warning next to cluster snapshots taken while the
:term:`balancer <balancer>` is enabled. If you restore from such a
snapshot, you run the risk of lost or orphaned data. For more information,
see :ref:`snapshot-while-balancer-enabled`.

Procedures
----------

To have |mms| automatically restore the backup, perform the :ref:`select
the snapshot <select-snapshot-sharded-cluster>` procedure.

To instead manually restore the backup, perform all the procedures below
in sequence. You will select the snapshot, distribute the restore files to
the target servers, start and configure each shard's replica set, and then
start and configure the cluster. If you restore to existing hardware, use
different data directories than used previously.

Restore Each Shard's Primary
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For *all* shards, restore the primary. You must have a copy of the
snapshot on the server that provides the primary. Use this procedure only
for manual restores.

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-primary.rst

Restore All Secondaries
+++++++++++++++++++++++

After you have restored the primary for a shard you can restore all
secondaries. You must have a copy of the snapshot on all servers that
provide the secondaries. Use this procedure only for manual restores.

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-secondary.rst

Restore Each Config Server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Perform this procedure separately for each :term:`config server`. Each
config server must have a copy of the tar file with the config server
data. Use this procedure only for manual restores.

Start the ``mongos``
++++++++++++++++++++

Start the cluster's :program:`mongos` bound to your new config servers.
