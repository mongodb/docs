Modifiers that can be misinterpreted as being associated with a word
other than the one intended, or with no particular word at all, are
called *misplaced* or *dangling modifiers*.

In general, move the modifier closer to the noun or phrase it modifies
to increase clarity.

Misplaced Modifiers
-------------------

Simple adverbs used to convey limits (such as *almost*, *hardly*,
*nearly*, *just*, *only*, or *merely*) can change the meaning of your
writing depending on their placement in the sentence. Ensure that these
modifiers are placed correctly so that they convey your intended
meaning.

In the following examples, the placement of *only* greatly affects the
meaning of the sentence:

   * - Example
     - Meaning

   * - The ``db.collection.createIndex`` method **only** creates an
       index if an index of the same specification does not already
       exist.
     - The ``db.collection.createIndex`` method could create other
       things, but if an index of the same specification does not
       already exist, it will create an index. If an index of the same
       specification already exists, the method could do something
       else.

   * - The ``db.collection.createIndex`` method creates an index
       **only** if an index of the same specification does not already
       exist.
     - The ``db.collection.createIndex`` method can create an index
       when an index of the same specification does not already exist.
       If an index of the same specification exists, it will not create
       an index.

   * - **Only** the ``db.collection.createIndex`` method creates an
       index if an index of the same specification does not already
       exist.
     - No other method can create an index if an index of the same
       specification does not already exist. Another method could
       create an index if an index of the same specification exists.

The placement of phrases or clauses can tweak your meaning or make things ambiguous as well:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
     - Avoid Meaning

   * - On Monday, MongoDB announced that they would release a new
       feature.
       *or*
       MongoDB announced that they would release a new feature on
       Monday.
     - MongoDB announced on Monday they would release a new feature.
     - *Does this mean MongoDB made an announcement on Monday? Or that
       a new feature would be released on Monday?*

   * - You must increase the storage size of the instance when it's at
       full capacity.
     - When at full capacity, you must increase the storage size of the
       instance.
     - *This means the user is at full capacity, not the instance.*

Dangling Modifiers
------------------

Modifier clauses at the beginning or end of a sentence should modify
the subject of the main clause. When the subject is missing or the
clause modifies another object in the sentence, the clause is called a
:wikipedia:`dangling modifier <Dangling_modifier?oldid=877876557>`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
     - Avoid Meaning

   * - When you log in to Atlas, your clusters are displayed.
     - Logging in to Atlas, your clusters display.
     - This sentence means that your clusters are logging in, not the
       user.

   * - The replica set elects a new primary after you force an
       election.
     - The replica set elects a new primary after forcing an election.
     - This sentence means that the replica set itself forced an
       election, not the user.
