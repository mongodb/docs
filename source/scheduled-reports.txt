Scheduled Reports
-----------------

You can create, edit, and delete scheduled reports for your dashboard. 
A scheduled report automatically sends a snapshot of dashboard data to 
a group of users at a regular frequency.

To view your scheduled reports, click :guilabel:`Reports` in the 
sidebar of the |charts-short| UI, under :guilabel:`Scheduling`.

Required Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create, edit, and delete scheduled reports for a dashboard, you must 
have:

- The :guilabel:`Owner` 
  :ref:`dashboard permission <dashboard-permissions>` 
  role for your |charts-short| dashboard.
- Write access to your |service| project through an |service| 
  :atlas:`user role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`.

.. note:: 
   
   If you have the :authrole:`Project Owner` user role, you can view all of the 
   scheduled reports in a project. To edit and delete reports for that dashboard, 
   you must also have the :guilabel:`Owner` dashboard role.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- For ``M0`` {+clusters+}, you can create one scheduled report per 
  project.

- For ``M2`` and higher tier {+clusters+}, you can create up to 100 
  scheduled reports per project.

- At this time, scheduled reports can only be sent by email.
