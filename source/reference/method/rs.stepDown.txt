.. method:: rs.stepDown(stepDownSecs, secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs)

   .. |command-method| replace:: method
   .. |stepdown-secs| replace:: ``stepDownSecs``
   .. |behavior-ref| replace:: :ref:`rs.stepDown-behavior`

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``stepDownSecs``
   
        - number
   
        - The number of seconds to step down the primary, during which time the
          stepdown member is ineligible for becoming primary. If you specify a
          non-numeric value, the command uses ``60`` seconds.
          
          The stepdown period starts from the time that the
          :binary:`~bin.mongod` receives the command. The stepdown period must
          be greater than the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs``.
          
          
   
      * - ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The number of seconds that ``mongod`` will wait for an
          electable secondary to catch up to the primary.
          
          When specified, ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` 
          overrides the default wait time of ``10`` seconds.
