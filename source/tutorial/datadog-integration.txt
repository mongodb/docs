You can configure |service| to send metric data about your
project to your |datadog| dashboards.

.. note::

   If you configure your |service| project to send alerts and events
   to Datadog, you do not need to follow this procedure. |service|
   sends project metrics to Datadog through the same integration used
   to send :ref:`alerts and events <notification-options>`.

You can also configure |datadog| to receive |service| alerts. To learn
more, see :ref:`notification-options`.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access
to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add 
themselves to the project as a ``Project Owner``.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| integration is available only on ``M10+`` clusters.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/note-tags-datadog.rst

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have a Datadog account
and a Datadog |api| key. Datadog grants you an |api| key when you first
create a Datadog account.

If you do not have an existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
`<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.
