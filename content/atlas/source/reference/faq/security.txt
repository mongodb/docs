How does |service| encrypt my data?
-----------------------------------

|service| uses whole volume (disk) encryption for any data at rest,
including your cluster data and backups of that data.

|service| also requires |tls| encryption for client data and
intra-cluster network communications.

If your organization requires more specific information regarding
|service| encryption, please contact |service| |mdb-support|:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-support.rst

   .. step:: Request support.

Can I disable TLS on my deployment?
-----------------------------------

No.

.. _faq-tls-1.0-deprecation:

What versions of TLS does |service| support?
-------------------------------------------- 

|service| requires |tls| connections for all |service| clusters. 
After July 2020, |service| enabled Transport Layer Security  (|tls|)
protocol version 1.2 by default for all new |service|  clusters
regardless of the MongoDB version.

MongoDB 7.0 and later disabled support for TLS 1.0 where |tls| 1.1+ is available.
You can manually configure |tls| 1.1 or 1.0 by 
:ref:`editing your cluster configuration 
<scale-cluster-more-configuration-options>`. 

.. include:: /includes/tls-deprecation.rst

You can read more about timing and reasons for the change from the
`Payment Card Industry (PCI) <https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls>`_
as well as the
`National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
<https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2014/04/nist-revises-guide-use-transport-layer-security-tls-networks>`_.

If you have questions about |tls| support or cannot update your
applications to support |tls| 1.2, please contact |service| 
|mdb-support|.

How do I know if my applications support TLS 1.2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications whose underlying programming languages or security 
libraries predate |tls| 1.2 may require updating to a more recent 
version to support |tls| 1.2. You may also need to update the 
application host operating system to support |tls| 1.2.

MongoDB and |service| don't provide services to audit external
applications for which versions of |tls| support they support.
Third party services, such as
`howsmyssl.com <https://www.howsmyssl.com/s/api.html>`_
may provide the appropriate tooling. MongoDB doesn't endorse this
service, and its reference is only informational. Use your
organization's procedures for selecting the vendor or service for auditing
your applications.

What do I have to do to update my clusters for TLS 1.2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Conduct an audit of your applications for support of |tls| 1.2.
- Udate all components of your technology stack that don't support
  |tls| 1.2.
- :ref:`Modify <scale-cluster-more-configuration-options>` your cluster
  configuration to use |tls| 1.2.

Can I force enable TLS 1.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| allows you to manually configure |tls| 1.0 during
:ref:`cluster modification <scale-cluster-more-configuration-options>`.

Enabling |tls| 1.0 for any |service| cluster carries significant risks.
Consider enabling |tls| 1.0 only for as long as required to update your
application stack to support |tls| 1.2.

.. _faq-tls-ca:

Which certificate authority signs MongoDB Atlas TLS certificates?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

|service-fullname| uses `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`__ as
the |certauth| for |tls| certificates for all {+clusters+}.

Starting in June of 2025, we are adding Google Trust Services as an
additional |certauth| for |service| {+clusters+} to improve availability.
With this addition, |service| signs |tls| certificates for your {+clusters+}
with the :guilabel:`GTS Root R1`, :guilabel:`GTS Root R2`, :guilabel:`GTS Root R3`, 
or :guilabel:`GTS Root R4` root |certauth| from Google Trust Services, 
*in addition* to the :guilabel:`ISRG Root X1` root |certauth| from Let's Encrypt.

|service| will use the :guilabel:`GTS Root R3` and :guilabel:`GTS Root R4` root CA certificates
for |tls| 1.3 support in the future.

.. note:: 
   
   Most application environments already have Let's Encrypt and Google Trust
   Services in their trusted |certauth| list.

To download the |certauth| certificates, see the
`Google Trust Services repository <https://pki.goog/repository/>`__ and 
`ISRG Root X1 <https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/>`__.

.. note:: 

   |service| automatically rotates the certificates. You don't need to
   run the :dbcommand:`rotateCertificates` command. Use the
   ``rotateCertificates`` command only if you want to rotate the
   certificates manually.

How often does an Atlas Cluster rotate TLS certificates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|tls| certificates are valid for 90 days from the day it is issued.
Certificates are rotated 42 days before the certificate's expiration
date.

Use the following command to check expiration of your |tls| certificate
of a node:

.. code-block::

   echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $HOSTNAME:$PORT 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -enddate

.. _tls-change-hard-code:

Hard-coded Certificate Authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't recommend hard-coding or pinning `intermediate certificates
<https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#intermediate-certificates>`__
because it introduces an operational burden and availability risk. If
Let's Encrypt or Google Trust Services rotates or replaces your pinned
intermediate certificate, your application might fail to connect, which
results in an outage.

If you must pin a certificate, pin it to |certauth| certificates and not
to any intermediate certificates.

Java Users
~~~~~~~~~~

Let's Encrypt's ISRG root certificate and Google Trust Services root
certificates are both available in the default trust store of `Java
version 7 after the 7u391 update
<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/7-support-relnotes.html#JDK-8307134>`__
and `Java version 8 after the 8u381 update
<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u381-relnotes.html#JDK-8307134>`__.
Use a Java release after 18 July 2023.

Ensure your Java client software is up-to-date. Use the latest Java
versions to utilize many improvements beyond these new |certauth|
requirements for our |tls| certificates.

If you have your own trust store, add the Let's Encrypt and Google Trust
Services certificates to it. To learn more, see
:ref:`faq-tls-ca`

Windows Server Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ISRG Root X1, GTS Root R1 and GTS Root R2 root |certauth| aren't
included by default in Windows Server, but it is available in the
`Microsoft Trusted Root Program
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/participants-list>`__.


To configure Windows Server to download trusted root certificates, see
`Windows Documentation
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn265983(v=ws.11)>`__.

Amazon Linux AMI Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some versions of `Amazon Linux AMI
<https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/>`__  may not have both ISRG
Root X1 and GTS Root R1 and R2 certificates. Please migrate to a newer
version of Amazon Linux for required root certificates. After June 2025,
we will require the support of ISRG Root X1, GTS Root R1 and R2
certificates for |service| to avoid certificate compatibility issues.

If you must use an older Amazon Linux AMI, manually install the ISRG
Root X1, GTS Root R1 and R2 root |certauth|.

Everyone Else
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change shouldn't impact you if you use a recent programming
language and operating system version.
