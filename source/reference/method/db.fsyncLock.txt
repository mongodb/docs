.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Forces the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to flush all pending write operations to
   disk and locks the *entire* :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to prevent
   additional writes until the user releases the lock with a corresponding
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` command. 

   .. important::

      The :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
      operations maintain a lock count. :method:`db.fsyncLock()`
      increments the lock count, and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
      decrements the lock count.

      To unlock a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for writes, the lock count
      must be zero. That is, for a given number of
      :method:`db.fsyncLock()` operations, you must issue a
      corresponding number of :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` operations to
      unlock the instance for writes.

   :method:`db.fsyncLock()`  has the syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncLock()

   The operation returns a document with the following fields:

   - ``info`` - Information on the status of the operation

   - ``lockCount`` (*New in version 3.4*)- The number of locks currently on the instance.

   - ``seeAlso`` - Link to the :dbcommand:`fsync` command documentation.

   - ``ok`` - The status code.
   
   
   This command provides a simple wrapper around a :dbcommand:`fsync`
   database command with the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1, lock: true } 

   :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an administrative command. You can use
   this operation to locks the database and create a window for
   :doc:`backup operations </core/backups>`.

Behavior

Example
-------

The following operation runs :method:`db.fsyncLock()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fsyncLock()

The operation returns the following status document that includes the
``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(1),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

If you run :method:`db.fsyncLock()` again, the operation increments the
``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(2),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

To unlock the instance for writes, you must run
:method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` twice to reduce the ``lockCount`` to 0.
