==================
Replace a Document
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can replace a single document using the ``replaceOne()`` method on
a ``MongoCollection`` object. This method removes all the existing fields
and values from a document (except the ``_id`` field) and substitutes it
with your replacement document.

The ``replaceOne()`` method accepts a query filter that matches the
document you want to replace and a replacement document that contains the
data you want to save in place of the matched document. The ``replaceOne()``
method only updates the first document that matches the filter.

You can optionally pass an instance of ``ReplaceOptions`` to the method in
order to specify the method behavior. For example, if you set the ``upsert``
field of the ``ReplaceOptions`` object to ``true``, the operation inserts
a new document from the fields in the replacement document if no documents
match the query filter. See the link to the ``ReplaceOptions`` API
documentation at the bottom of this page for more information.

Upon successful execution, the ``replaceOne()`` method returns an instance
of ``UpdateResult``.  You can retrieve information such as the number of
documents modified calling the ``getModifiedCount()`` method. You can also
retrieve the value of the document's ``_id`` field by calling the
``getUpsertedId()`` method if you set ``upsert(true)`` in the
``UpdateOptions`` instance and the operation resulted in an upsert.

If your replacement operation fails, the driver raises an exception.
For example, if you try to specify a value for the immutable field
``_id`` in your replacement document that differs from the original
document, the method throws a ``MongoWriteException`` with the message:

.. code-block:: none

   After applying the update, the (immutable) field '_id' was found to have been altered to _id: ObjectId('...)

If your replacement document contains a change that violates unique index
rules, the method throws a ``MongoWriteException`` with the error
message that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   E11000 duplicate key error collection: ...

For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific
conditions, see the API documentation for ``replaceOne()``, linked at the
bottom of this page.

Example
-------

In this example, we replace the first match of our query filter in the
``movies`` collection of the ``sample_mflix`` database with a replacement
document. All the fields except for the ``_id`` field are deleted from the
original document and are substituted by the replacement document.

Before the ``replaceOne()`` operation runs, the original document contains
several fields describing the movie. After the operation runs, the resulting
document contains only the fields specified by the replacement document
(``title`` and ``fullplot``) and the ``_id`` field.

The following snippet uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed in the ``replaceOne()`` method. The ``eq``
  filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text
  ``'Music of the Heart'``.

- A **replacement document** that contains the document that replaces the
  matching document if it exists.

- A **ReplaceOptions** object with the ``upsert`` option set to ``true``.

If you are using the **legacy API**, see (TODO: FAQ ?) to determine what
changes you need to make to this code example.

After you run the example, you should see output that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: none

   Modified document count: 1

If you query the replaced document, it should resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Document {
     { _id=...,
       title=50 Violins,
       fullplot=A dramatization of the true story of Roberta Guaspari who co-founded the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music
     }
   }
