ref: deploy-sharded-cluster-name
content: |
  Specify the name of your sharded cluster deployment. You cannot
  change this once set.
---
ref: deploy-sharded-csrs-name
content: |
  Specify the name of your :manual:`Config Server Replica Set
  </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`. You cannot
  change this once set. This setting corresponds to the
  :rsconf:`_id <rsconf._id>` replica configuration option.

  |mms| only displays this option if you selected
  MongoDB 3.2 or later as the :guilabel:`Version` of your
  configuration servers.

---
ref: deploy-sharded-shard-name
content: |
  Specify the prefix of each :manual:`shard </reference/glossary/#std-term-shard>` in the cluster. |mms|
  names each shard in the cluster using the ``<prefix_n>`` format,
  where ``n`` is a 0-indexed, monotonically increasing integer.
---
ref: deploy-sharded-process-name
content: |

  Hostname and port of a |mongod| or |mongos| associated to the
  sharded cluster. This hostname can be a hostname, an |fqdn|, an
  |ipv4| address, or an |ipv6| address.

  |mms| groups |mongod| processes under their parent replica set
  name, and |mongos| processes under :guilabel:`mongoses`. |mms| then
  groups all the cluster components under the cluster name. Click the
  :icon:`caret-right` to the left of a grouping to list its
  sub-groups or processes. Modifying any of the available settings
  for a grouping changes the corresponding value in its sub-groups
  and processes.

  .. note::

     For clusters running MongoDB 3.0 or earlier, |mms| groups
     the config server |mongod| processes under
     :guilabel:`configServers`.
