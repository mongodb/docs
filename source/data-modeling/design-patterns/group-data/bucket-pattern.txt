Group Data with the Bucket Pattern
==================================

The bucket pattern separates long series of data into distinct objects.
Separating large data series into smaller groups can improve query
access patterns and simplify application logic. Bucketing is useful when
you have similar objects that relate to a central entity, such as stock
trades made by a single user.

You can use the bucket pattern for pagination by grouping your data
based on the elements that your application shows per page. This
approach uses MongoDB's flexible data model to store data according to
the data your applications needs.

.. tip::

   :ref:`Time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>` apply
   the bucket pattern automatically, and are suitable for most
   applications that involve bucketing time series data.

About this Task
---------------

Consider the following schema that tracks stock trades. The initial
schema does not use the bucket pattern, and stores each trade in an
individual document.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.trades.insertMany(
     [
       {
         "ticker" : "MDB", 
         "customerId": 123,
         "type" : "buy", 
         "quantity" : 419, 
         "date" : ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z") 
       },
       { 
         "ticker" : "MDB",
         "customerId": 123, 
         "type" : "sell", 
         "quantity" : 29, 
         "date" : ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z") 
       },
       { 
         "ticker" : "GOOG",
         "customerId": 456, 
         "type" : "buy", 
         "quantity" : 50, 
         "date" : ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z") 
       }
     ]
   )

The application shows stock trades made by a single customer at a time,
and shows 10 trades per page. To simplify the application logic, use the
bucket pattern to group the trades by ``customerId`` in groups of 10.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Group the data by customerId

      Reorganize the schema to have a single document for each
      ``customerId``:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {
           "customerId": 123,
           "history": [
             {
               "type": "buy",
               "ticker": "MDB",
               "qty": 419,
               "date": ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z")
             },
             {
               "type": "sell",
               "ticker": "MDB",
               "qty": 29,
               "date": ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z")
             }
           ]
         },
         { 
           "customerId": 456,
           "history": [
             {
               "type" : "buy", 
               "ticker" : "GOOG",
               "quantity" : 50, 
               "date" : ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z") 
             }
           ]
         }

      With the bucket pattern:
      
      - Documents with common ``customerId`` values are condensed into a
        single document, with the ``customerId`` being a top-level
        field.
        
      - Trades for that customer are grouped into an embedded array
        field, called ``history``.

   .. step:: Add an identifier and count for each bucket

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 6,8,25,27
         :linenos:

         db.trades.drop()
         
         db.trades.insertMany(
           [
             {
               "_id": "123_1698349623",
               "customerId": 123,
               "count": 2,
               "history": [
                 {
                   "type": "buy",
                   "ticker": "MDB",
                   "qty": 419,
                   "date": ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z")
                 },
                 {
                   "type": "sell",
                   "ticker": "MDB",
                   "qty": 29,
                   "date": ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z")
                 }
               ]
             },
             {
               "_id": "456_1698765362",
               "customerId": 456,
               "count": 1,
               "history": [
                 {
                   "type" : "buy", 
                   "ticker" : "GOOG",
                   "quantity" : 50, 
                   "date" : ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z") 
                 }
               ]
             },
           ]
         )
      
      The ``_id`` field value is a concatenation of the ``customerId``
      and the first trade time in seconds (since the :term:`unix epoch`)
      in the ``history`` field.

      The ``count`` field indicates how many elements are in that
      document's ``history`` array. The ``count`` field is used to
      implement pagination logic.

Next Steps
----------

After you update your schema to use the bucket pattern, update your
application logic for reading and writing data. See the following
sections:

- :ref:`bucket-pattern-next-steps-query`

- :ref:`bucket-pattern-next-steps-insert`

.. _bucket-pattern-next-steps-query:

Query for Data with the Bucket Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the updated schema, each document contains data for a single page in
the application. You can use the ``_id`` and ``count`` field to
determine how to return and update data.

To query for data on the appropriate page, use a regex query to return
data for a specified ``customerId``, and use :method:`skip
<cursor.skip()>` to return to the data for the correct page. The regex
query on ``_id`` uses the :ref:`default _id index <index-type-id>`,
which results in performant queries without the need for an additional
index.

The following query returns data for the first page of trades for
customer ``123``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.trades.find( { "_id": /^123_/ } ).sort( { _id: 1 } ).limit(1)

To return data for later pages, specify a ``skip`` value of one less
than the page you want to show data for. For example, to show data for
page 10, run the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.trades.find( { "_id": /^123_/ } ).sort( { _id: 1 } ).skip(9).limit(1)

.. note::

   The preceding query returns no results because the sample data only
   contains documents for the first page.

.. _bucket-pattern-next-steps-insert:

Insert Data with the Bucket Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the schema uses the bucket pattern, update your application
logic to insert new trades into the correct bucket. Use an update
command to insert the trade into the bucket with the appropriate
``customerId`` and bucket.

The following command inserts a new trade for ``customerId: 123``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.trades.updateOne( { "_id": /^123_/, "count": { $lt: 10 } },
      { 
         "$push": { 
            "history": {
            "type": "buy",
            "ticker": "MSFT",
            "qty": 42,
            "date": ISODate("2023-11-02T11:43:10")
          }
       },
       "$inc": { "count": 1 },
       "$setOnInsert": { "_id": "123_1698939791", "customerId": 123 }
      },
      { upsert: true }
   )

The application displays 10 trades per page. The update filter searches
for a document for ``customerId: 123`` where the ``count`` is less than
10, meaning that bucket does not contain a full page of data.

- If there is a document that matches ``"_id": /^123_/`` and its
  ``count`` is less than 10, the update command pushes the new trade
  into the matched document's ``history`` array.

- If there is **not** a matching document, the update command inserts a
  new document with the new trade (because ``upsert`` is ``true``). The
  ``_id`` field of the new document is a concatenation of the
  ``customerId`` and the time in seconds since the unix epoch of
  the trade.

The logic for update commands avoids :term:`unbounded arrays <unbounded
array>` by ensuring that no ``history`` array contains more than 10
documents.

After you run the update operation, the ``trades`` collection has the
following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: '123_1698349623',
       customerId: 123,
       count: 3,
       history: [
         {
           type: 'buy',
           ticker: 'MDB',
           qty: 419,
           date: ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z")
         },
         {
           type: 'sell',
           ticker: 'MDB',
           qty: 29,
           date: ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z")
         },
         {
           type: 'buy',
           ticker: 'MSFT',
           qty: 42,
           date: ISODate("2023-11-02T11:43:10.000Z")
         }
       ]
     },
     {
       _id: '456_1698765362',
       customerId: 456,
       count: 1,
       history: [
         {
           type: 'buy',
           ticker: 'GOOG',
           quantity: 50,
           date: ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z")
         }
       ]
     }
   ]

Results
-------

After you implement the bucket pattern, you don't need to incorporate
pagination logic to return results in your application. The way the data
is stored matches the way it is used in the application.
