Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` feature
in the {+driver-short+}. The ``Aggregates``  builders class provides the
the ``vectorSearch()`` helper method that you can use to
create a :atlas:`$vectorSearch </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/>`
pipeline stage. This pipeline stage allows you to perform a **semantic
search** on your documents. A semantic search is a type of search which
locates information that is similar in meaning, but not necessarily
identical, to your provided search term or phrase.

.. important:: Feature Compatibility

   To learn what versions of MongoDB Atlas support this feature, see
   :atlas:`Limitations </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#limitations>`
   in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

Perform a Vector Search
-----------------------

To use this feature, you must create a vector search index and index your
vector embeddings. To learn about how to programmatically create a
vector search index, see the :ref:`kotlin-search-indexes` section in the
Indexes guide. To learn more about vector embeddings, see
:atlas:`How to Index Vector Embeddings for Vector Search
</atlas-search/field-types/knn-vector/>` in the Atlas documentation.

After you create a vector search index on your vector embeddings, you
can reference this index in your pipeline stage, as shown in the
following section.

Vector Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this section uses data modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AggregatesBuilderTest.snippet.vector-search-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

This example shows how to build an aggregation pipeline that uses the
``vectorSearch()`` method to perform an exact vector search with the following
specifications:

- Searches ``plotEmbedding`` field values by using vector embeddings of a
  string value
- Uses the ``mflix_movies_embedding_index`` vector search index
- Returns 1 document
- Filters for documents in which the ``year`` value is at least ``2016``

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AggregatesBuilderTest.snippet.vector-search.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. tip:: Query Vector Type

   The preceding example creates an instance of ``BinaryVector`` to
   serve as the query vector, but you can also create a ``List`` of
   ``Double`` instances. However, we recommend that you use the
   ``BinaryVector`` type to improve storage efficiency.
