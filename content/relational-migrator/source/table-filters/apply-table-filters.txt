You can use table filters to migrate specific subsets of your table data.
Table filters allow you to apply SQL where and row limit clauses
when pulling data from your table.

Before you Begin
----------------

Table filters are applied while you are creating mapping rules. See 
:ref:`<create-rule-relational>` for more details.

You can apply one filter per table. Each filter can have a SQL where 
clause, a row limit clause, or both.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Apply a table filter

      a. From the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, click the table 
         that you want to apply a filter to.
      #. On the :guilabel:`Filter on` section in the edit 
         :guilabel:`mapping rule` pane, click :guilabel:`+ Add`.
      #. Under the :guilabel:`SQL query` header, enter a SQL where 
         criteria. The 
         SQL you specify must be ANSI SQL compliant with your relational 
         database.The following are examples of SQL where clauses used 
         to apply :guilabel:`SQL query` table filters:

         - ``LASTNAME LIKE '%SMITH%'``
         - ``LASTNAME = 'SMITH'``
         - ``LASTNAME IN('SMITH')``
         - ``LASTNAME IN(SELECT LASTNAME FROM ASIA_CUSTOMERS 
           WHERE ID < 100000)``

   .. step:: (Optional) Add a row limit

      Under the :guilabel:`Row limit` header, click the 
      :guilabel:`Limit number of rows` radio button and enter a value. 
      This applies a limit clause at the end of your SQL query.

   .. step:: Save your table filter

      Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.

      .. note::
         
         After you save your filter, the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane 
         displays a :icon-fa5:`filter` icon for any tables containing a 
         filter under the :guilabel:`Relational` header.
