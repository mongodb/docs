Writing with accessibility in mind improves the documentation experience for all our users.

- Avoid unnecessary font formatting. (Screen readers explicitly
  describe text modifications.)
- Don’t force line breaks (hard returns) within sentences and
  paragraphs. Line breaks might not work well in resized windows or
  with enlarged text.
- Avoid camel case (``camelCase``) and all caps (``ALLCAPS``). Some
  screen readers read capitalized letters individually. Some
  languages are unicameral; they don't have lower and upper cases.
- Depending on the screen reader (or personal settings), not all
  punctuation marks are read. Make sure the same meaning is conveyed to
  the reader without punctuation marks. For that reason, avoid the use
  of exclamation marks, question marks, and semicolons.
- Don't use *&* instead of *and* in headings, text, navigation, or
  tables of contents; however, it's OK to use *&* when referencing UI
  elements that use *&*, or in table headings and diagram labels where
  space constraints require abbreviation. And of course it's fine to
  use ``&`` for technical purposes in code.

Provide Context for UI Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not identify UI elements using only one sensory characteristic (such
as color or location).

Directional phrases like “at the top of the page” or "right-hand side"
might not provide adequate information to someone using a screen
reader. Even relating one element to another with phrases like “next
to” or “above” might not provide the correct context.

- When referring to a UI element in a procedure, use previous steps to
  clearly navigate the user to the element to maintain clarity and
  avoid wordiness. If the same icon, button, or element appears on the
  page more than once, be more descriptive by using section, modal, or
  panel headings and field names.
- If a UI element is hard to find, provide a screenshot.
- Use the label of an element and not its shape or color to describe
  it.

Write for Ease of Reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Break up walls of text to aid in scannability. For example, separate
  paragraphs, create headings, and use lists.
- Use shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.
- Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage and if they're used
  infrequently.
- Use parallel writing structures for similar things. For example,
  start each list in the same format.
- Place distinguishing and important information of a paragraph in the
  first sentence to aid in scannability.

Use Descriptive, Hierarchical Headings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users of screen readers often scan a page by jumping from heading to
heading. Make the hierarchy clear and headings meaningful.

- Use descriptive headings and titles because they help a user navigate
  their browser and the page. It's easier to jump between pages and
  sections of a page if the headings and titles are unique.
- Use a heading hierarchy and don't skip levels. For example, put an
  ``h3`` only under an ``h2>``.
- Don't use a heading level that doesn't fit the hierarchy. Find
  another way to change the visual formatting of a heading.
- Don't have empty headings or headings with no associated content.
- Tag headings using heading elements, not bold.
- Use a level 1 heading for the page title or main content heading.

Use Meaningful Link Text and Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people who use screen readers jump from link to link to scan a
page and need to understand what a link contains.

- Use meaningful link text. Links should make sense when read out of
  context.
- Don't use *click here* or *read this document*. These phrases provide
  no information about what a link contains.
- Use an external link icon to indicate that the link opens in a new
  window or tab.
- Avoid adjacent links or put a character in between to separate them.
- If a link downloads a file, the link text must indicate this
  action as well as the file type.

Use Alternative Text for Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Screen readers read alternative text aloud so that users can better
understand an on-page image.

- Provide alternative (``alt``) text that adequately *summarizes the
  intent* of each image. Don't describe the image in detail.
- Don't present new information in images; always provide an equivalent
  text explanation with the image.
- Don't repeat images unless absolutely necessary.
- Don't use images of text, code samples, or terminal output. Use
  actual text.
- Use SVG instead of PNG if available. SVGs stay sharp when you zoom in
  on the image.

Caption Videos, Recordings, and GIFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Provide captions, transcripts, or descriptions of audio and video
  content. For example, you can use the autocaption feature in YouTube.
  Make sure that captions can be translated into major languages.
- Avoid flickering or flashing elements. They can cause anything from
  motion sickness to a seizure.

Use Simple Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't use tables unless it's the best method to present your
  information. Tables are challenging for screen readers. If you must
  use a table, use a simple table that doesn't have cells that span
  columns or rows.
- Avoid tables in the middle of a numbered procedure.

Format a Page for All Abilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that your document conveys all the information you intended
if you view it in the following contexts:

- Without sound
- Using only sound
- Without color
- Using a keyboard
- With screen magnification
- Without punctuation
- Don't use color, size, location, or other visual cues as the primary
  way of communicating information.

If you're using color, icon, or outline thickness to convey state, then
also provide a secondary cue, such as a change in the text label.
