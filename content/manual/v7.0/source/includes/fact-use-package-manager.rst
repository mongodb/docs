While you can install MongoDB manually using a downloaded ``.tgz``
tarball as described in this document, we recommend using the
|package-manager| package manager on your system if
possible. Using a package manager automatically installs all needed
dependencies, provides an example ``mongod.conf`` file,
and simplifies future upgrade and maintenance tasks.
