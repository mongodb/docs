On this page, you'll learn how to connect to your MongoDB deployment using
the {+intellij-full+}.

.. note:: MongoDB Atlas

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect the {+intellij-short+} to your 
   deployment.

Before You Begin
----------------

Ensure that an instance of MongoDB is running and the {+intellij-short+}
is :ref:`installed <intellij-install>`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Open the MongoDB side panel.

      To open the MongoDB side panel, click the leaf icon on the IntelliJ 
      far-right menu bar.

   .. step:: Add a MongoDB connection.

      To open the :guilabel:`Data Sources and Drivers` modal, 
      click :guilabel:`Add a MongoDB Data Source`.

      Paste your :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` 
      directly in the :guilabel:`URL` field near the bottom of the 
      :guilabel:`Data Sources and Drivers` tab.
      
      Ensure that your connection string specifies the port that your
      instance is running on. 
      
      Click :guilabel:`OK`.

   .. step:: View insights for your MongoDB deployment.

      After you connect to your deployment, you can see all the generated 
      insights for your workspace, which include index performance warnings and 
      validation errors. 

      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-insights.png
         :alt: View insights for your deployment in the side panel.

      The {+intellij-short+} includes four options to view your 
      :guilabel:`Insights`:
      
      - :guilabel:`All insights`: Includes insights for all packages in your 
        workspace.

      - :guilabel:`Recommended Insights`: Includes insights for the most common 
        parent package of files opened in the IDE. This ensures that insights 
        are relevant to all files and their shared context within the broader 
        structure of your application.

      - :guilabel:`Current File`: Includes insights only from the currently open 
        file.

      - :guilabel:`Current Query`: Includes insights for the query where the 
        keyboard cursor is located.

   .. step:: (*Optional*) Connect to another MongoDB deployment. 

      To add another data source, click the :guilabel:`+` icon, 
      click :guilabel:`Data Source`, and select :guilabel:`MongoDB` from the 
      drop-down menu.

      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-data-source.png
         :alt: Click the + icon and select MongoDB from the drop-down menu.
         :width: 600px
   
   .. step:: Select a data source in the side panel.

      You can select a data source associated with your application
      from within MongoDB side panel.
      
      The side panel has a :guilabel:`Connected to` drop-down menu that allows 
      you to select a data source associated with your application. 
      
      For the best experience, the data source you select should 
      contain the following:
      
      - All of the databases, collection, and fields your application code 
        uses.
      - All of the indexes used by your queries. 

   .. step:: (*Optional*) Launch Playgrounds.

      To launch the Playgrounds, click the highlighted button in 
      Database Explorer.
