.. expression:: queryString

   The ``queryString`` operator supports querying a combination of
   indexed fields and values.

.. _querystring-syntax:

Syntax
------

``queryString`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   {
     "$search": {
        "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
        "queryString": {
           "defaultPath": "<default-field-to-search>",
           "query": "<field-to-search>:(<search-values> AND|OR <search-values>|<field-to-search>: <search-values>)"
        }
     }
   }

.. _querystring-options:

Options
-------

``queryString`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 60 15

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``defaultPath``
     - string
     - The indexed field to search by default. |fts| only searches the
       field in ``defaultPath``:

       - If you omit the field to search in the ``query``.
       - If a value you specified in the ``query`` is not found in the
         field you specified in the ``query``.

     - yes

   * - ``query``
     - string
     - One or more indexed fields and values to search. Fields and
       values are colon-delimited. For example, to search the ``plot``
       field for the string ``baseball``, use ``plot:baseball``. The
       following operators are available to combine multiple search
       criteria:

       You can combine the fields and values using the following:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 10 90

          * - ``AND``
            - Indicates ``AND`` boolean operator. All search values
              must be present for a document to be included in the
              results.

          * - ``OR``
            - Indicates ``OR`` boolean operator. At least one of the
              search value must be present for a document to be
              included in the results.

          * - ``()``
            - Delimiters for subqueries. Use the parentheses to group
              fields and values to search.

       .. seealso::

          :ref:`querystring-ref-examples` for some sample queries that
          use the operators and delimiters to search the sample
          ``movies`` collection.
     - yes

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - The score assigned to matching search results. You can modify
       the score using the following options:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.

       For information on using ``score`` in your query, see
       :ref:`scoring-ref`.
     - no

.. _querystring-ref-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. If you have the :ref:`sample dataset
<available-sample-datasets>` on your cluster, you can create the |fts|
``default`` index and run the queries on your cluster. The
:ref:`fts-tutorial-ref` contains instructions for loading the
:ref:`sample dataset <available-sample-datasets>`, creating an
:ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`, and running |fts|
queries.

Example 1
~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query for
movies with the title ``Rocky`` and either ``IV``, ``4``, or ``Four``.

.. example::

   The following query searches for the combination of ``Rocky`` and
   either ``IV``, ``4``, or ``Four`` at path ``title`` in the
   ``movies`` collection. In the following query, a field is specified
   in the ``defaultPath``, but no fields are specified in the
   ``query``. The query includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage
   to exclude all fields except ``title``.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $search: {
               "queryString": {
                  "defaultPath": "title",
                  "query": "Rocky AND (IV OR 4 OR Four)"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1
            }
         }
      ])

   For the above query, |fts| performs a search at ``defaultPath``
   because there are no fields in the ``query``. It returns the
   following results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      { "title" : "Rocky IV" }

Example 2
~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query for
movies with the title ``The Italian`` in the ``Drama`` genre.

.. example::

   The following query searches a combination of fields for movies with
   the title ``The Italian`` in the ``Drama`` genre. The ``plot`` field
   in the ``defaultPath`` will be searched only if no matching results
   can be found in either of the fields specified in the ``query``
   field. The ``query`` field contains escaped double quotes as
   delimiters for the phrase to search.

   The query includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``_id``, ``title``, ``plot``, and
     ``genres``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $search: {
               "queryString": {
                  "defaultPath": "plot",
                  "query": "title:\"The Italian\" AND genres:Drama"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 1,
               "title": 1,
               "plot": 1,
               "genres": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:
      :copyable: false

      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("573a1390f29313caabcd56df"),
        "plot" : "An immigrant leaves his sweetheart in Italy to find a better life across the sea in the grimy slums of New York. They are eventually reunited and marry. But life in New York is hard and ...",

        "title" : "Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy",
        "score" : 3.4441356658935547
      }

Example 3
~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query for
movie plots that contain the terms ``captain`` or ``kirk`` and
``enterprise``.

.. example::

   The following query searches for a combination of terms, ``captain``
   or ``kirk`` and ``enterprise``, in the ``plot`` field. It includes a
   :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 3 results
   and a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``title``, ``plot``, and ``fullplot``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $search: {
               "queryString": {
                  "defaultPath": "fullplot",
                  "query": "plot:(captain OR kirk) AND enterprise"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $limit: 3
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "plot": 1,
               "fullplot": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:
      :copyable: false

      { "plot" : "Captain Picard, with the help of supposedly dead Captain Kirk, must stop a madman willing to murder on a planetary scale in order to enter an energy ribbon.",
      "fullplot" : "In the late 23rd century, the gala maiden voyage of the third Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701-B) boasts such luminaries as Pavel Chekov, Montgomery Scott and the legendary Captain James T. Kirk as guests. But the maiden voyage turns to disaster as the unprepared ship is forced to rescue two transport ships from a mysterious energy ribbon. The Enterprise manages to save a handful of the ships' passengers and barely makes it out intact... but at the cost of Captain Kirk's life. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Tolian Soran... who is destroying entire star systems.

This event also attracts the attention of a Klingon captain who wants to make a name for himself and sets out to pursue the Enterprise.

      "title" : "Star Trek: The Motion Picture",
      "score" : 8.322310447692871 }

   The documents in the above results match because:

   - In the first document, the ``plot`` field, which is the field to
     search per the  ``query``, contains both ``captain`` and ``kirk``,
     although only either one is required to meet the criteria for a
     match. For the term ``enterprise``, |fts| searches the
     ``fullplot`` field, which is the ``defaultPath``, because the
     ``plot`` field does not contain ``enterprise``, and finds
     ``enterprise`` in the ``fullplot`` field.
   - In the second document, the ``plot`` field contains all three
     search terms.
   - In  the third document, the ``plot`` field contains ``kirk`` and
     ``enterprise``.

Example 4
~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query for
movie plots that contain the terms ``captain``, ``kirk``, and
``chess``. This example shows how different grouping of the same search
terms using parentheses can result in different documents to be
included in the search results.

.. example::

   The following queries search for a combination of the terms,
   ``captain``, ``kirk``, and ``chess``, in the ``plot`` field. It
   includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``title``, ``plot``, and ``fullpath``
   - Add a field named ``score``
