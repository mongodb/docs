From the perspective of a client application, whether a MongoDB
instance is running as a single server (i.e. "standalone") or a
:term:`replica set` is transparent. However, replica sets offer some
configuration options for write. [#sharded-clusters]_

.. [#sharded-clusters] :term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` where the
   shards are also replica sets provide the same configuration options
   with regards to write and read operations.

Verify Write Operations to Replica Sets
---------------------------------------

For a replica set, the default :doc:`write concern
</reference/write-concern>` requests acknowledgement only from the primary.
You can, however, override this default write concern, such as to
confirm write operations on a specified number of the replica set
members.

.. include:: /images/crud-write-concern-w2.rst

To override the default write concern, specify a write concern with
each write operation. For example, the following method includes a
write concern that specifies that the method return only after the
write propagates to the primary and at least one secondary or the
method times out after 5 seconds.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.insert(
      { item: "envelopes", qty : 100, type: "Clasp" },
      { writeConcern: { w: 2, wtimeout: 5000 } }
   )

You can include a timeout threshold for a write concern. This prevents
write operations from blocking indefinitely if the write concern is
unachievable. For example, if the write concern requires
acknowledgement from 4 members of the replica set and the replica set
has only available 3 members, the operation blocks until those members
become available. See :ref:`wc-wtimeout`.

Modify Default Write Concern
----------------------------

.. TODO need to remove most of this section and rewrite what's left.
   Post 2.6 though.

You can modify the default write concern for a replica set by setting
the :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` setting
in the :doc:`replica set configuration
</reference/replica-configuration>`. The following sequence of commands
creates a configuration that waits for the write operation to complete
on a majority of the voting members before returning:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.settings.getLastErrorDefaults = { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

If you issue a write operation with a specific write concern, the write
operation uses its own write concern instead of the default.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/write-concern`

Custom Write Concerns
---------------------

You can :doc:`tag </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>` the
members of replica sets and use the resulting tag sets to create custom write
concerns. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets` for
information on configuring custom write concerns using tag sets.
