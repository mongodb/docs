MongoDB supports creating read-only views from existing collections
or other views. For example, you can:

- Create a view that :pipeline:`excludes <$project>` private or 
  confidential data from a collection of employee data.

- Create a view that :pipeline:`adds <$addFields>` computed fields
  from a collection of metrics.

- Create a view that :pipeline:`joins <$lookup>` data from two
  different related collections.

Each view has an associated 
:ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` against the source
data. MongoDB computes the view contents by executing the aggregation 
on-demand during read operations. MongoDB executes read operations
on views as part of the underlying aggregation pipeline.

Create View
-----------

To create or define a view, MongoDB 3.4 introduces:

- the ``viewOn`` and ``pipeline`` options to the existing
  :dbcommand:`create` command (and :method:`db.createCollection` helper):

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline> } )

  or if specifying a default :ref:`collation <3.4-relnotes-collation>` for the view:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )

- a new :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper :method:`db.createView()`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <collation> )

.. note::
   - You must create views in the same database as the source collection.

Public View Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations that lists collections, such as
:method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and
:method:`db.getCollectionNames()`, include views in their outputs.

Drop a View
-----------

To remove a view, use the :method:`db.collection.drop()` method on the
view.

Modify a View
-------------

You can modify a view either by dropping and recreating the view or
using the :dbcommand:`collMod` command.
