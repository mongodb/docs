MongoDB Extended BSON 
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB :doc:`import and export utilities
</administration/import-export>` and MongoDB :wiki:`REST
Interfaces<Http Interface>` support JSON-style access to MongoDB
:term:`BSON` documents.

The REST interface supports three different modes for document output:

- *Strict* mode that produces output that conforms to the `JSON RFC
  specifications <http://www.json.org>`_.

- *JavaScript* mode that produces output that can be processed by most
  JavaScript interpreters.
  
- *mongo Shell* mode produces output that the :program:`mongo` shell
  understands. This is basically an enhanced JavaScript format.

MongoDB can understand all of these representations in REST input.

Special representations are used for :term:`BSON types` that do not
have obvious JSON mappings, and multiple representations are allowed
for some of these types. These types are displayed in the following
table:
