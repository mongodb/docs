.. important:: Google and Apple Account Deletion Requirements

   `Google <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13316080?sjid=9059006274298096173-NA#account_deletion>`__ 
   and :apple:`Apple <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` require that 
   applications listed through their respective App Stores must give any 
   user who creates an account the option to delete the account. Whether you 
   use an authentication method where you must manually register a user, 
   such as email/password authentication, or one that that automatically 
   creates a user, such as Sign-In with Apple, you must implement 
   :ref:`user account deletion <delete-user>`.
