*Only available on M10+ {+clusters+}*

The Query Profiler diagnoses and monitors performance issues. This
monitoring can expose slow-running queries and their key performance
statistics in the {+atlas-ui+}.

|service| collects and displays statistics from any of your :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`
instances. The Query Profiler stores your ``mongod`` query :ref:`log data <mongodb-logs>`, which can be accessed 
directly through the Query Profiler or via the Atlas CLI, and use it to identify slow queries. 
|service| displays this data on the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab in the :guilabel:`Query Profiler` section of an instance. 

.. note::

   The Query Profiler differs from the :manual:`Database Profiler 
   </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`. The Query Profiler identifies 
   specific inefficient queries based on entries from your ``mongod`` logs.
   The Database Profiler returns detailed information about commands executed 
   on the ``mongod`` based on the specified :manual:`profiling level 
   </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler/#profiling-levels>`. Changing the 
   profiling level doesn't impact the slow queries displayed in the Query 
   Profiler.

The |service| Query Profiler shows operations across your entire {+cluster+} by default. 
You can filter the hosts for which operations the Query Profiler displays data with the  
:guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` dropdown, which allows you to view data related to 
one or more specific hosts or to view primary or secondary host groups. 
The :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab displays information to reveal slow database 
operations over a set time frame, such as the following:

- :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time`
- :guilabel:`Docs Examined : Returned Ratio`

The |service| Query Profiler supports binning operations of the same type 
running on the same collection around the same timestamp in order to 
support additional datapoints. 

In order to support additional datapoints, the |service| Query Profiler supports 
binning operations that meet the following critera:

- The operations are of the same operation type.
- The operations are running on the same namespace.
- The operations have matching ``hasSort`` and ``usedIndex`` boolean values.
- The operations are executed around the same timestamp.

|service| manages the threshold for slow operations for each
``mongod`` host based on average operation execution time on 
that host. This threshold can be changed using the 
:method:`db.setProfilingLevel <db.setProfilingLevel>` 
{+mongosh+} command.

.. note::

   Changing the threshold for slow operations using 
   :method:`db.setProfilingLevel <db.setProfilingLevel>` can impact 
   performance and system log settings. Carefully 
   consider any performance and security implications before you use 
   :method:`db.setProfilingLevel <db.setProfilingLevel>` to adjust 
   the Query Profiler settings on a production deployment. Query 
   Profiler settings reset to default values following a node restart. 

   Additionally, zooming in on the x axis of the scatterplot will refetch slow 
   operations and may provide more detailed fidelity of slow operations during 
   the selected timeframe.

.. note::

   To opt out of the |service|-managed slow operation threshold and
   use a fixed slow query threshold of 100 milliseconds instead,
   use the {+atlas-admin-api+}. See :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Disable Managed Slow 
   Operation Threshold <disablemanagedslowoperationthreshold>`. 
   For ``M0`` {+clusters+} and {+Flex-clusters+}, |service| disables the |service|-managed
   slow query operation threshold by default and you can't enable it.

Considerations
--------------

.. important:: Please read the following considerations before you enable the Query Profiler.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Profile data may include sensitive information including the content of
database queries. Ensure that exposing this data to |service| is
consistent with your information security practices.

Data Analysis Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Query Profiler displays approximately 100,000 sampled logs at a
time. It shows all the logs if 100,000 or less logs were
recorded in the selected hosts and time range.

Data Display Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| displays no more than 100,000 data points in the
:guilabel:`Query Profiler` charts.

Log data is processed in batches. Data can be delayed up to five
minutes from realtime.

Required Access
---------------

To enable or disable Performance Advisor and the Query Profiler 
for a project, you must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for 
the project or the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role on its parent 
organization.

To view query performance in the Query Profiler, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Read Only` or
:authrole:`Project Observability Viewer` access to the project.

Enable and Disable the Query Profiler
-------------------------------------

|service| enables the Query Profiler by default.

To disable the Query Profiler:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst

   .. step:: Disable the Query Profiler.

      In the :guilabel:`Database Monitoring Tools` section, toggle
      :guilabel:`Performance Advisor and Profiler` to :guilabel:`Off`.

Find Slow Queries with the Query Profiler
-----------------------------------------

The following section describes how to find slow queries using the Query Profiler.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
   
   .. step:: Access the Query Profiler.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for the cluster.
           
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.
        
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Profiler` tab.

         The Query Profiler displays all your data from the log on the 
         :term:`primary` and :term:`secondary` nodes by default.
   
   .. step:: Customize the Query Profiler.

      The Query Profiler uses a scatterplot chart and a table directly below the chart to 
      help you find slow operations.
      
      a. Select one or more hosts for which you want to view metrics in the 
         :guilabel:`Filter by Hosts` dropdown.      

      #. Select the time period from the :guilabel:`Time Range` or 
         :guilabel:`Filter by Date and Time` dropdowns.
         The Query Profiler displays data for the last 24 hours by default.

      #. Select the metric from the :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time` dropdown. Options  
         include:

         - :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time` (default):
           The total time, typically in milliseconds, that a MongoDB database 
           operation took to complete.
         
         - :guilabel:`Response Length`:
           The size of the documents or data returned by the database in response to an 
           operation, measured in bytes.
         
         - :guilabel:`Docs Examined`:
           The total number of documents scanned within the collection to find the results 
           for a query. 
         
         - :guilabel:`Docs Returned`:
           The number of documents that matched the query criteria that |service| 
           returned for the query.
         
         - :guilabel:`Keys Examined`:
           The total number of index entries scanned by the database during query execution. 
         
         - :guilabel:`Num Yields`:
           The number of times an operation paused to allow other 
           operations to proceed. 
         
         - :guilabel:`Docs Examined : Returned Ratio`:
           The ratio calculated by dividing :guilabel:`Docs Examined` by :guilabel:`Docs Returned`. 
         
         - :guilabel:`Keys Examined : Returned Ratio`:
           The ratio calculated by dividing :guilabel:`Keys Examined` by :guilabel:`Docs Returned`. 

      #. Click the :guilabel:`All operation types` dropdown to change which operations you 
         want to profile.
         The Query Profiler displays all operation types by default.

   .. step:: Identify slow queries.

      * Click a scatterplot point on the chart.
        This opens a right-side panel with summary information.  
      
      * Click :guilabel:`View more details` in the right-side panel to view the full query 
        shape, detailed execution statistics, query log, and suggestions for improvement.

      * Click and drag along the ``X`` and ``Y`` axes
        to zoom in on a specific subset of collected data.

      * Scroll down to the table below the chart to view a list of slow queries by collection.
        Click a row in the table for more details.

   .. step:: Interpret performance metrics.

      When inspecting a slow query, start by looking at these key metrics and patterns:

      * :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time` (``millis``): Query time in milliseconds. This 
        is the primary indicator of a slow query. If this metric is consistently high, 
        consider optimizing the query logic, batching results, or rethink how the data is 
        being accessed.

      * If you see ``"planSummary": "COLLSCAN":`` in the query log, the query performed a 
        collection scan and did not use an index. This is a strong signal to add an :ref:`index <indexes>` 
        or rewrite the query.

      * :guilabel:`Docs Examined` (``docsExamined``): Number of documents MongoDB inspected 
        for the query. If :guilabel:`Docs Examined` is significantly larger than 
        :guilabel:`Docs Returned`, this often means that:
        
        * The query scanned many documents to find the results, 
          which could impact network latency and application performance. 
        * Existing indexes are inefficient or not optimal for this specific query. 
          To learn more, see :ref:`indexes`.
        
      * :guilabel:`Keys Examined` (``keysExamined``): Number of index keys scanned for the query.
        If this metric is ``0`` for a query that includes filter conditions, it's highly likely
        there is no index and MongoDB scanned the entire collection. This is a primary cause of slowness.
        If :guilabel:`Docs Examined` is very high and :guilabel:`Keys Examined` is ``0`` or 
        very low compared to :guilabel:`Docs Examined`, you're likely scanning the collection 
        or a very unselective index. To learn more, see :ref:`indexes`.

      * A high :guilabel:`Docs Examined : Returned Ratio` means the 
        query is scanning many documents to return few results, 
        which can be a sign of an inefficient query or missing indexes.

      * :guilabel:`Num Yields` (``numYields``): Frequent yields suggest resource contention 
        or long-running operations that are pausing, potentially impacting overall throughput.

      * :guilabel:`Response Length`: Unusually large response lengths indicate that queries 
        are returning more data than necessary. Consider using :ref:`projections <projections>` to limit the fields 
        returned.

      * :guilabel:`Has Index Coverage` (``usedIndex``): This boolean confirms whether a MongoDB
        index was used. If set to ``false`` for a query that should be indexed, add an :ref:`index <indexes>`.

        .. note::

           This metric **does not** reflect the |fts| index usage. 

      * If ``hasSort`` is set to ``true``, this indicates that the query contains a
        :method:`~cursor.sort()` method. 
        Unindexed :method:`~cursor.sort()` methods can be very resource intensive. 
        Check your search index configuration and confirm whether it supports the 
        :method:`~cursor.sort()` method.
