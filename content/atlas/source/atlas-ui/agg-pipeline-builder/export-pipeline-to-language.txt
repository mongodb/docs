      application code for the selected programming language. If you include 
      driver syntax, the copyable code reflects :ref:`project 
      <atlas-ui-query-bar-project>`, :ref:`sort <atlas-ui-query-bar-sort>`, :ref:`maxtimems 
      <atlas-ui-query-bar-max-time-ms>`, :ref:`collation <atlas-ui-query-bar-collation>`, 
      :ref:`skip <atlas-ui-query-bar-skip>` and :ref:`limit <atlas-ui-query-bar-limit>` options.
