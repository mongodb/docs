  You can choose to export :guilabel:`All Fields` or :guilabel:`Select fields in table`.
  In the query bar, you can also use the :guilabel:`Project` field to specify 
  the fields to return or export.

  Only fields that are checked are included in the exported file.

  You can add document fields to include with the :guilabel:`Add Field` 
  button if the field you want to include is not automatically detected.

  .. note::
     
     |compass-short| samples your collection to pre-populate a list of 
     fields. Fields which only appear in a small percentage of 
     documents may not be automatically detected.

     For details on sampling, see :ref:`Sampling <sampling>`.

  Under :guilabel:`Export File Type`, select either :guilabel:`JSON` or :guilabel:`CSV`.
  If you select :guilabel:`JSON`, you can expand the :guilabel:`Advanced JSON Format` dropdown 
  and select from the following extended JSON formats:

  .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50, 50

         * - JSON Format
           - Description

         * - Default Extended JSON
           - A string format that avoids any loss of BSON type information. This 
             is the default |compass-short| setting.  

         * - Relaxed Extended JSON
           - A string format that emphasizes readability and interoperability at 
             the expense of type preservation. That is, conversion from relaxed 
             format to BSON can lose type information.

             .. warning::
                
                This format is not recommended for data integrity. 

         * - Canonical Extended JSON
           - A string format that emphasizes type preservation at the expense of 
             readability and interoperability. That is, conversion from canonical 
             to BSON will generally preserve type information except in certain 
             specific cases.
