title: Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels.

  a. Drag the ``directors`` field from the :guilabel:`Fields`
     section of the Chart Builder view to the :guilabel:`X Axis`
     encoding channel.

  #. In the ``directors`` :guilabel:`Array Reductions` dropdown,
     select :guilabel:`Unwind Array`.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``awards`` field to
     expand the ``awards`` object and view its properties.

  #. Drag the ``awards.wins`` field to the :guilabel:`Y Axis`
     encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel
     determines which field to use for the chart's
     :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`.

  #. Leave the :guilabel:`Aggregate` dropdown menu for the
     :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel on its default
     value of :guilabel:`sum`. This value directs the aggregation
     operation to return the total number of award wins for each
     director.

  .. example:: Aggregation
  
     :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>` processes data records
     using a wide variety of methods and returns computed results
     which may not be available in the original dataset. Because we
     are interested in the total number of awards won by each
     director, we use the ``awards.wins`` field here and will use
     an aggregation operator which will allow us to add up the
     total wins for each director.

title: Apply a limit to the X axis.
ref: add-limit

  At this point there are too many columns in our X axis to show any
  meaningful results. To bring the number down to a manageable level,
  we'll apply a :ref:`limit <charts-limit-data>` to get the ten
  directors with the most award wins.

  The ``directors`` array is already sorted by the aggregated value
  of ``wins`` in descending order. To apply a limit to the number
  of columns in the :guilabel:`X Axis`:
     
  a. Toggle :guilabel:`Limit Results` to :guilabel:`On`.
  
  #. Set the value of the adjacent numeric field to ``10``.

---
title: Group awards by genre.
ref: add-genres
level: 4
content: |
  a. Drag the ``genres`` field to the :guilabel:`Series` encoding
     channel.
     
  #. In the :guilabel:`Array Reductions` dropdown menu, select
     ``unwind array``. The X axis columns are now broken down by movie
     genre.

     .. note::

        Some movies contain more than one genre, so the numbers
        shown in the columns may not be the exact number of awards
        for each director.
