Verbs carry the action in a sentence. They make your content come
alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your writing, use
strong, simple, action verbs. See the following sections for specific
guidelines.

.. _use-action-oriented-verbs:

Use Action-Oriented Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs are supposed to carry the action in a sentence. When you use
verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their variants), or when
you use gerunds (*-ing* words), nouns carry the action and weaken the
meaning. Replace weak verbs and gerunds with strong, action-oriented
verbs to restore focus  to verbs from nouns. Relying on verbs rather
than nouns usually makes sentences shorter, clearer, and more direct.

.. _avoid-nouns-built-from-verbs:
.. _nominalizations:

Avoid Nouns Built from Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many nouns are built from verbs, for example, *description* and
*explanation*. Such nouns are called *nominalizations*. Some sentences
include a nominalization *and* a verb. Change the nominalization back
into a verb and omit the existing verb to simplify those sentences.

.. _use-simplest-tense:

Use the Simplest Tense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read
and understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or
perfect tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*,
*may*, *might*, *must*, and *should*).

.. _helping-verbs:

Use Modal Verbs Accurately
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modal verbs are helping verbs that further modify the action or meaning
of the main verb. If you need to use the following helping or modal
verbs, use them accurately and consistently:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 45 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Modal verb
     - Description
     - Example

   * - can
     - Indicates the ability to perform an action.
     - You **can** customize Atlas clusters to achieve a wide range of
       performance, durability, availability, and efficiency goals.

   * - may
     - Indicates permission.
     - If you need space, you **may** uninstall the program.

   * - might
     - Indicates probability or possibility.
     - A service **might** expose endpoints in different regions.

   * - must
     - Indicates the necessity of an action.

       In general, use the imperative mood. It implies the subject
       *you* and doesn't require *must* but still indicates necessity.
     - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.

   * - should
     - Indicates a recommendation or an expectation.

       Avoid using should, because it implies uncertainty or could
       imply a best practice (which we might or might not want to do).
     - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message,
       clients **should** periodically renew claims during long-running
       batches of work.

.. _use-single-word-verbs:

Use Single-Word Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs
followed by prepositions or adverbs).

.. example::

   Use *omit* rather than *leave out*, or shorten *start up* to
   *start*. One-word verbs are easier to understand and to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together
unless that changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable
phrasal verbs are *back up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work
around*.

.. note::

   Don't turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb.

   .. example::

      Don't use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These
      single-word terms should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

       Snapshots.

.. _dont-use-verbs-as-nouns-or-adjectives:

Don't Use Verbs as Nouns or Adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a word is defined in the dictionary as a verb, don't use it as a
noun or adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or
adjectives are *configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

   * - After **installation** is completed, you can **configure** the

       **configure**.

   * - After ``rubygems`` **is compiled**, the following message
       appears at the bottom of the output text.
     - When the **compile process** is finished, the following message
       appears at the bottom of the output text.

Don't Use Non-Verbs as Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use nouns or adjectives as verbs. Don't add verb suffixes to
abbreviations, nouns, or conjunctions.

       between adjacent words in a keyword search.
     - Some databases and search engines **AND** adjacent words in a
       keyword search.

   * - **Navigate** to the new directory.
     - **CD** to the new directory.

Use Transitive Verbs Transitively, not Intransitively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transitive verbs, such as *display* and *complete*, require a direct
object. Intransitive verbs don't require a direct object. Be sure to
use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it
passive if the performer of the action is understood or not important.

   * - After the installation **is completed**, ensure that the FTP
       services are running.
     - After the installation **completes**, ensure that the FTP
       services are running.

Use Correct Plurality Agreements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Verbs have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that agrees
with the subject of the sentence in number.

       Social media apps or Skype is available from the App Store.

Don't Humanize Inanimate Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to
inanimate objects. For example, a web application doesn't *know*,
*need*, *remember*, *see*, *think*, *understand*, or *want*.

Often, we humanize technology with anthropomorphic words.
Some writers believe this makes difficult topics more
understandable or relatable. These words can make the
concept harder to grasp for:
- Readers that are less familiar with metaphors.
- Readers with English as a second language.

There are standard anthropomorphic verbs in the computer industry. For
example, a software program can detect, record, require, store, check,
calculate, process, accept, calculate, deny, detect, interact,
interpret, listen, refuse, read, and write. You can use anthropomorphic
phrases standard to the industry to avoid awkward sentence
constructions, but take the time to question common usage and decide
if there’s a better word.

In general, avoid phrases that convey **intention** or **desire** (such
as *needs* or *wants*), intellect (*thinks*, *knows*, or *realizes*),
or emotion (*likes* or *cares*).
