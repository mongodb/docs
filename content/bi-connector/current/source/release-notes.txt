.. !!!!! NOTE TO FOLKS UPDATING THIS !!!!!
.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.
.. (DOCS-9670 for context)

.. note:: Release notes mention only releases with feature changes

   MongoDB releases the |bi| in a continuous deployment manner. This
   release cadence allows us to continuously maintain the {+bi-short+}'s
   performance and stability. These release notes capture only those
   releases that contain direct user feature changes. If a particular
   |bi| release contains only performance and stability improvements, it
   may not be included in these release notes.

  functions.

- ``str_to_date`` returns a ``date`` instead of a ``datetime`` for some
  non-constant format-string arguments.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pushdown
````````

This release includes a number of improvements to pushdown. Existing
translations were improved and expanded pushdown coverage to more
functions and query shapes.

- Adds support for pushing down correlated subqueries to MongoDB
  versions 3.6 and later.

- Adds pushdown support for ``ln``, ``ascii``, ``user``, ``database``,
  ``version``, ``connection_id``, and constant-valued time/date
  functions.

- Adds support for pushing down ``regexp`` to the aggregation language.

- Removes some unnecessary rounding from pushdown translations.

- Adds support for pushing down ``LIKE`` expressions with literal
  pattern strings to the aggregation language.

- Improves the efficiency of pipelines generated for ``EXISTS``
  subqueries.

- Improves truncate pushdown coverage and updated the translation to use
  ``$trunc`` with MongoDB versions 4.1.9 and later.

- Adds pushdown support for the ``char`` and ``str_to_date`` functions.

Go Driver
`````````

This release includes a number of improvements made possible by
upgrading to the new go driver:

- Adds support for SRV URI support to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` and
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.

- Adds MongoDB URI support to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` via a
  ``--uri`` flag.

- Adds support for zlib and snappy compression for connections to
  MongoDB.

- Updates :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>` file parsing to support
  the most recent version of the extjson spec.

Behavioral Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds new reserved words to the parser: ``INSERT``, ``INTO``, ``KEY``,
  ``FULLTEXT``, and ``PRIMARY``.

  Going forward, these words must be wrapped in backticks to be used as
  identifiers in queries.

- Removes support for altering sampled schema with ``ALTER TABLE``
  statements.

- Prior to 2.12, :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` supported renaming and
  removing tables and columns via a modified ``ALTER TABLE`` syntax when
  in :ref:`standalone schema mode <sampling-mode-chart>`. Any customer
  currently using this feature is advised to migrate their schema
  management needs to :ref:`views <schema-with-views>`,
  :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>`, or
  :ref:`custom schema mode <sampling-mode-chart>`. The variable/config
  parameter that enabled this feature, ``enable_table_alterations``, is
  still supported but doesn’t do anything in |bi-short| 2.12. It will be
  removed in a future release.

.. _bi-2-11-1:

|bi| 2.11.1
-----------

*Released July 8, 2019*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Fixes a bug that caused the MySQL schema to include incorrect foreign
key constraints.

``information_schema`` database.

.. _bi-2-11-0:

|bi| 2.11.0
-----------

*Released May 16, 2019*

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds a number of optimizations that are applied to generated
  aggregation pipelines before sending them to MongoDB.

- Adds new subcommands to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` for storing a
  ``DRDL`` file in MongoDB and for manipulating stored schemas.

- Enables :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` to use stored ``DRDL`` schemas instead
  of sampling. To learn more, see :ref:`2.11-schema-management-changes`.

- Introduces the beta version of :binary:`~bin.mongotranslate`, a
  command-line utility that can translate SQL queries to
  aggregation pipelines without a running |bi-short| or MongoDB
  instance.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a problem that caused the |bi-short| to generate unnecessarily
  long ``$group`` key names.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to generate incorrect table
  pipelines in
  :ref:`polymorphic schema mapping mode <system-environment-variables>`.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to panic when printing some
  query plans.

- Fixes a bug where the |bi-short|’s in-memory evaluation of
  string-to-date conversions did not match the pushdown behavior.

- Updates the supported Amazon Linux version to match the version
  supported by MongoDB 4.2.

- Fixes a bug with Active Directory constrained delegation in the
  |bi-short|’s GSSAPI implementation (linux and macOS).

  to ensure existing Kerberos configurations are not broken.

- Fixes a bug that caused Kerberos authentication to fail with a linux
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`, MongoDB 4.0, and an Active Directory KDC.

- Fixes a number of small bugs related to correlated subqueries.

Chages/Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes some schema-management configuration options.

- Deprecates schema-modification support via ``ALTER TABLE``, as well as
  the ``enable_table_alterations`` :ref:`system variable <system-environment-variables>` and
  :manual:`setParameter </reference/configuration-options/#setparameter-option/>`  

.. _bi-2-10-0:

|bi| 2.10.0
-----------

*Released Mar 15, 2019*

~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where aggregate functions returned ``NULL`` in dual
  queries with the ``DUAL`` keyword omitted.

- Fixes a bug where some invalid ``DUAL`` queries did not return an
  error.

- Fixes a bug that prevented pushdown of some joins to derived tables
  selecting from ``DUAL``.

- Fixes some correctness bugs in the in-memory evaluation for 
  :doc:`mysql-mode conversions </reference/type-conversion/>`.

- Fixes a bug where some trig functions (``ascii``, ``acos``, and
  ``asin``) could return incorrect results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where some subquery comparisons could return incorrect
  results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where we lost precision while converting a ``Uint64`` to a
  ``Decimal``.

  translation.

- Fixes a bug where unstable sorting caused non-deterministic renaming
  of colliding collection/field names during schema mapping.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery comparisons returned errors.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery and tuple comparisons returned
  errors.

- Fixes a bug where queries using ``xor`` returned errors on MongoDB 3.2
  because the generated pipelines required features added in MongoDB
  3.4.

- Fixes a bug that caused kerberos
  :ref:`authentication <client-authentication>` to fail with MongoDB
  4.0.

Date and Time Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release resolves a number of inconsistencies in the |bi-short|'s
date and timestamp semantics. Resolving these inconsistencies resulted
in some changes to user-facing behavior:

- Removes inconsistent support for partial dates.

  - MySQL can represent partial dates that are
    `missing month or day components <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html>`__.
    It is impossible to represent these incomplete dates with
    MongoDB dates. Attempting to correctly manipulate and render
    incomplete dates was causing a number of bugs and inconsistencies
    with complete dates.

  - Starting with version 2.10, the |bi-short| does not support
    operations on or expressions that return incomplete dates.
    Going forward, we cannot provide guarantees about the behavior of
    operations that attempt to construct incomplete dates.

- Updates the ``DATE(a)`` and ``TIMESTAMP(a)`` scalar functions to be
  equivalent to ``CAST(a AS DATE)``, and ``CAST(a AS DATETIME)``,
  respectively.

  - The behavior of the ``DATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP`` scalar functions will
    depend on the value of the ``type_conversion_mode`` variable. This
    will change the default behavior for those scalar functions.

  - Queries affected by this change can be rewritten to use a more
    explicit conversion function (such as ``str_to_date``) that does not
    depend on ``type_conversion_mode``. If an affected query cannot be
    rewritten, a user may set ``type_conversion_mode`` variable to
    ``mysql``, which instructs the BI Connector to perform all type
    conversions with MySQL semantics instead of MongoDB semantics.

    .. important::

       This is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it
       significantly curtails the ability to push down type conversions
       across the board.

  - For more information on type conversions and the
    ``type_conversion_mode`` system variable, see
    :ref:`Type Conversion Modes <type-conversion-modes>`.

EXPLAIN Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can use EXPLAIN to return details of aggregation pipeline used to generate query results.

Common Table Expression Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |bi-short| now supports queries that include Common Table Expressions.

.. _bi-2-5-0:

|bi| 2.5.0
----------

*Released May 23, 2018*

- Improved memory management for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.
- New SSPI support for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` on Windows.
- The :option:`--sampleNamespaces  <mongosqld --sampleNamespaces>`
  option now supports :ref:`exclusion <sampling-exclusion>`.
- ``NULL`` valued types are now cast to varchar during sampling.
- Optimized ``COUNT(*)`` query performance.
- ``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` are now pushed down.

New SSPI Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows Clients may now use kerberos to authenticate against the
|bi-short|.

``NULL`` Valued Types Are Now Cast to Varchar During Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resolves the issue where queries would fail due to ``NULL`` values
being ignored during sampling. Now, ``NULL`` values will be cast as SQL
type ``VARCHAR``.

``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` Are Now Pushed Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|bi-short| will now push down ``SIN``, ``COS``, and ``TAN`` SQL
functions. This will improve performance for queries using these
functions.
