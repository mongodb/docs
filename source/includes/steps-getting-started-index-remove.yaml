  Use :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` method to drop an existing
  index from a collection. Pass either the name of the index or the
  index specification document to identify the index to drop.

  The :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` method cannot drop the
  default index on the ``_id`` field.

  For example, the following operation drops the compound index
  associated with the specification document.
ref: ""
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     db.orders.dropIndex( { "cust_id" : 1, "ord_date" : -1, "items" : 1 })

   The method returns a document with the status of the results.

  language: javascript
  code: |
     { "nIndexesWas" : 7, "ok" : 1 }

   The method returns a document with the status of the results. To
   verify the result, use the :method:`~db.collection.getIndexes()` to
   view the indexes on the collection. The collection should only have
   6 indexes.
