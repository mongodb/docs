Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _osx-prereq:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your system meets each of the following prerequisites. You only
need to perform each prerequisite step once on your system. If you
have already performed the prerequisite steps as part of an earlier
MongoDB installation using Homebrew, you can skip to the
:ref:`installation procedure <install>`.

Install Xcode Command-Line Tools
````````````````````````````````

Homebrew requires the Xcode command-line tools from Apple's Xcode.

- Install the Xcode command-line tools by running the following
  command in your macOS Terminal:

  .. code-block:: bash

     xcode-select --install

Install Homebrew
````````````````

macOS does not include the Homebrew ``brew`` package by default.

- Install ``brew`` using the official
  `Homebrew installation instructions <https://brew.sh/#install>`_.

.. _install:

Installing MongoDB {+version+} |edition| Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install MongoDB |edition| Edition using Homebrew's
``brew`` package manager. Be sure that you have followed the
:ref:`installation prerequisites <osx-prereq>` above before proceeding.

#. Tap the `MongoDB Homebrew Tap
   <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_ to download the official
   Homebrew formula for MongoDB and the Database Tools, by running the
   following command in your macOS Terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      brew tap mongodb/brew

   If you have already done this for a previous installation of MongoDB,
   you can skip this step.

#. To update Homebrew and all existing formulae:

   .. code-block:: bash

      brew update

#. To install MongoDB, run the following command in your macOS Terminal
   application:

   .. code-block:: bash

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

.. tip::

   Alternatively, you can specify a previous version of MongoDB if
   desired. You can also maintain multiple versions of MongoDB side by
   side in this manner.

.. tip::

   If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
   you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError. To resolve, see
   :ref:`troubleshooting-checksumerror`.

The installation includes the following binaries:

- The :binary:`~bin.mongod` server
- The :binary:`~bin.mongos` sharded cluster query router
- The MongoDB Shell, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`

In addition, the installation creates the following files and
directories at the location specified below, depending on your Apple
hardware:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 30

   * -
     - Intel Processor
     - Apple Silicon Processor

   * - :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
     - ``/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf``
     - ``/opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf``

   * - :setting:`log directory <systemLog.path>`
     - ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``
     - ``/opt/homebrew/var/log/mongodb``

   * - :setting:`data directory <storage.dbPath>`
     - ``/usr/local/var/mongodb``
     - ``/opt/homebrew/var/mongodb``

See `Apple's documentation <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814>`__
for the current list of Apple hardware using the Apple Silicon processor. You 
can also run the following command to check where ``brew`` has installed
these files and directories:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew --prefix

Starting with MongoDB 4.4.1, the installation also includes the
:dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools </>`.
See :ref:`brew-installs-dbtools` for more information.

.. _run-with-homebrew:

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

Follow these steps to run MongoDB |edition| Edition. These instructions
assume that you are using the default settings.

You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using ``brew``, or you can run
MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run
MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system
``ulimit`` values automatically (see
:ref:`ulimit settings <ulimit-settings>` for more information).

- To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **as a
  macOS service**, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     brew services start mongodb-community@{+version+}

  To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a macOS service, use the
  following command as needed:

  .. code-block:: bash

     brew services stop mongodb-community@{+version+}

- To run :binary:`~bin.mongod` **manually as a background process**
  using a config file:

  - If your deployment does not use :ref:`TLS connections
    <configure-mongod-mongos-for-tls-ssl>`, use the ``--fork`` option:

    - For macOS running on Intel processors, run:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

    - For macOS running on `Apple Silicon processors
      <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814>`__, run:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf --fork

    - If your deployment uses :ref:`TLS connections
      <configure-mongod-mongos-for-tls-ssl>`, use `GNU Screen
      <https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`_.
   
      - For macOS running on Intel processors:

        .. procedure::
           :style: normal 

           .. step:: Start your screen.
 
              .. code-block:: bash

                 screen -S <name-of-screen>

           .. step:: Start ``mongod``.

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf 

           .. step:: Detach from screen.

              Detach from your screen by typing ``Ctrl+a``, then
              clicking ``d``.

           .. step:: View all active screens.

              .. code-block:: bash

                 screen -ls

      - For macOS running on `Apple Silicon processors
        <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814>`__:

        .. procedure::
           :style: normal 

           .. step:: Start your screen.

              .. code-block:: bash

                 screen -S <name-of-screen>

           .. step:: Start ``mongod``.

                 .. code-block:: bash

                    mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf

           .. step:: Detach from screen.

              Detach from your screen by typing ``Ctrl+a``, then
              clicking ``d``.

           .. step:: View all active screens.

              .. code-block:: bash

                 screen -ls


- To run ``mongod`` **manually as a background process** specifying 
  :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` and :option:`--logpath
  <mongod --logpath>` on the command line, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     mongod --dbpath /path/to/dbdir --logpath /path/to/mongodb.log --fork

  To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a background process,
  connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` using :mongosh:`mongosh </>`,
  and issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command as needed.

Both methods use the :file:`mongod.conf` file created
during the install. You can add your own MongoDB
:doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` to
this file as well.

.. note:: macOS Prevents ``mongod`` From Opening

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/macos-prevent-launch-mongod.rst

To verify that MongoDB is running, perform one of the following:

- If you started MongoDB **as a macOS service**:

  .. code-block:: bash

     brew services list

  You should see the service ``mongodb-community`` listed as
  ``started``.

- If you started MongoDB **manually as a background process**:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

  You should see your ``mongod`` process in the output.

You can also view the log file to see the current status of your
``mongod`` process: ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log``.

Connect and Use MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin using MongoDB, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the
running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh

For information on CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

.. _brew-installs-dbtools:

Using the MongoDB Database Tools
--------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.4.1, installing MongoDB through ``brew`` also installs
the MongoDB Database Tools.

The :dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools </>` are a collection of
command-line utilities for working with a MongoDB deployment,
including data backup and import/export tools like
:binary:`mongoimport` and :binary:`mongodump` as well as monitoring
tools like :binary:`mongotop`.

Once you have installed the MongoDB Server in the steps above, the
Database Tools are available directly from the command line in your
macOS Terminal application. For example you could run :binary:`mongotop`
against your running MongoDB instance by invoking it in your
macOS Terminal like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongotop

It should start up, connect to your running :binary:`mongod`, and start
reporting usage statistics.

See the :dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools Documentation</>` for usage information for
each of the Database Tools.
