=====================================
Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the
member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`.
A rollback is necessary only if the primary had accepted write
operations that the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not**
successfully replicated before the primary stepped down. When the
primary rejoins the set as a secondary, it reverts, or "rolls back," its
write operations to maintain database consistency with the other
members.

MongoDB attempts to avoid rollbacks, which should be rare. When a
rollback does occur, it is often the result of a network
partition. Secondaries that can not keep up with the throughput of
operations on the former primary, increase the size and impact of the
rollback.

A rollback does *not* occur if the write operations replicate to another
member of the replica set before the primary steps down *and* if that
member remains available and accessible to a majority of the replica
set.

Collect Rollback Data
---------------------

When a rollback does occur, administrators must decide whether to
apply or ignore the rollback data. MongoDB writes the rollback data to
:term:`BSON` files in the ``rollback/`` folder under the database's
:setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory.  The names of rollback files have the
following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <database>.<collection>.<timestamp>.bson

For example:

.. code-block:: none

   records.accounts.2011-05-09T18-10-04.0.bson

Administrators must apply rollback data manually after the member
completes the rollback and returns to secondary status. Use
:doc:`bsondump </reference/program/bsondump>` to read the contents of
the rollback files. Then use :program:`mongorestore` to apply the
changes to the new primary.

Avoid Replica Set Rollbacks
---------------------------

To prevent rollbacks, use :ref:`replica acknowledged write concern
<write-concern-replica-acknowledged>` to guarantee that the write
operations propagate to the members of a replica set.

Rollback Limitations
--------------------

A :program:`mongod` instance will not rollback more than 300
megabytes of data. If your system must rollback more than 300
megabytes, you must manually intervene to recover the data. If
this is the case, the following line will appear in your
:program:`mongod` log:

.. code-block:: none

   [replica set sync] replSet syncThread: 13410 replSet too much data to roll back

In this situation, save the data directly or force the member to perform
an initial sync. To force initial sync, sync from a "current" member of
the set by deleting the content of the :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory for
the member that requires a larger rollback.
