You can :ref:`view <view-dashboard-owners>`, :ref:`add
<add-dashboard-owners>`, or :ref:`remove <remove-dashboard-owners>`
dashboard owners to any dashboard in your project.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

.. _view-dashboard-owners:

View Dashboard Owners
---------------------

To view the owners of any dashboard in your project:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Charts` in the navigation bar to navigate to |charts|.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Owners` under :guilabel:`Dashboards` in the sidebar.

      |charts| displays a table with the following columns:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1
         :widths: 25 75

         * - Column Name
           - Description

         * - :guilabel:`Dashboard title`
           - Title of the dashboard.

         * - :guilabel:`Dashboard ID`
           - ``ID`` of the dashboard.

         * - :guilabel:`Dashboard owners`
           - Email associated with each dashboard owner.
             
             If an existing dashboard owner was the only owner, and
             no longer has access to the project anymore, the
             :guilabel:`Dashboard owners` column will say ``No owners``.

      You can sort this table by the :guilabel:`Dashboard title` column.
      If a dashboard owner omits the :guilabel:`Dashboard title`,
      |charts| sorts by the :guilabel:`Dashboard ID`.
