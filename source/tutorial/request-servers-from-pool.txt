Users can deploy MongoDB on servers from the server pool.

Request Servers from the Pool
-----------------------------

From the :guilabel:`Deployment` view, click on :guilabel:`Add` and
select :guilabel:`Request Servers`. 

Specify the desired configuration for the requested server(s).

If servers that meet the requested specifications are available (i.e.
unbound) in the pool, the servers are bound to the group.

Pending Server Requests
-----------------------

If no available servers in the pool meet the requested specifications,
the user can:

- Cancel the request or have the |onprem| Administrator :ref:`cancel
  the request <server-pool-cancel-request>`, or

- Wait up to the specified timeout period for the the servers to become
  available. After the timeout period has passed, |onprem| cancels the
  pending request. The |onprem| Administrator sets the request timeout
  period for the server pool through the
  :ref:`server-pool-configuration`.
