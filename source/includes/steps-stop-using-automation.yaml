  To create the init scripts, run the
  ``mongodb-mms-automation-make-init-scripts`` tool with superuser
  access. It is recommended that you use the ``-boot`` option so that
  you configure the scripts to start the MongoDB processes on system
  boot. Otherwise, you will be responsible to manually start each script.

    language: sh
    code: |

      and names each one using the following form:
    language: sh

      (mongod|mongos)-<process-name>
    post: |
      ``<process-name>`` is the name given to the :program:`mongod` or
