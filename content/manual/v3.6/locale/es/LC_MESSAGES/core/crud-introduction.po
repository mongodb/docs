"MongoDB stores data in the form of *documents*, which are JSON-like field"

":term:`BSON` documents. BSON is a binary representation of :term:`JSON` "
"with additional type information. In the documents, the value of a field "
"can be any of the BSON data types, including other documents, arrays, and"
