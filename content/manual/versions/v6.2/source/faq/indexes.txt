This document addresses some common questions regarding MongoDB
indexes. For more information on indexes, see
:ref:`indexes <indexes>`.

How do I create an index?
-------------------------

To create an index on a collection, use the
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method. Creating an index is an
administrative operation. In general, applications should not call
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` on a regular basis.

.. note:: 

   Index builds can impact performance; see
   :ref:`faq-index-performance`. Administrators should consider the
   performance implications before building indexes.

.. _faq-index-performance:

How does an index build affect database performance?
----------------------------------------------------

MongoDB index builds against a populated collection require an exclusive
read-write lock against the collection. Operations that require a read
or write lock on the collection must wait until the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the lock.

Index builds on replica sets have specific performance considerations
and risks. See :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` for more
information. To minimize the impact of building an index on replica
sets, including shard replica sets, use a rolling index build procedure
as described in :ref:`index-build-on-replica-sets`. 

To return information on currently running index creation operations,
see :ref:`currentOp-index-creation`. To kill a running index creation
operation on a :term:`primary` or standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`, use 
:method:`db.killOp()`. The partially built index will be
deleted.

You cannot terminate a *replicated* index build on secondary members of
a replica set. You must first :method:`drop <db.collection.dropIndex()>`
the index on the primary. The secondaries will replicate the drop
operation and drop the indexes *after* the index build completes.
All further replication blocks behind the index build and drop. 

How do I see what indexes exist on a collection?
------------------------------------------------

To list a collection's indexes, use the
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` method.

How can I see if a query uses an index?
---------------------------------------

To inspect how MongoDB processes a query, use the
:method:`~cursor.explain()` method.

How do I determine which fields to index?
-----------------------------------------

A number of factors determine which fields to index, including
:ref:`selectivity <index-selectivity>`, the support for multiple
:term:`query shapes <query shape>`, and :ref:`size of the index
<indexes-ensure-indexes-fit-ram>`. For more information, see
:ref:`Operational Considerations for Indexes <data-model-indexes>` and
:ref:`indexing-strategies`.

How can I see the size of an index?
-----------------------------------

The :method:`db.collection.stats()` includes an
:data:`~collStats.indexSizes` document which provides size
information for each index on the collection.

Depending on its size, an index may not fit into RAM. An index fits
into RAM when your server has enough RAM available for both the index
and the rest of the :term:`working set`. When an index is too large to
fit into RAM, MongoDB must read the index from disk, which is a much
slower operation than reading from RAM.

In certain cases, an index does not need to fit *entirely* into RAM.
For details, see :ref:`indexing-right-handed`.

How do write operations affect indexes?
---------------------------------------

Write operations may require updates to indexes:

- If a write operation modifies an indexed field, MongoDB updates all
  indexes that have the modified field as a key.

Therefore, if your application is write-heavy, indexes might affect
performance.
