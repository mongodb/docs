Sharded Cluster
---------------

Membership Awareness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.4, sharded cluster components (shards, config servers,
:program:`mongos` instances) recognize their membership in a sharded
cluster, including the name of the sharded cluster, the location of the
config servers.

.. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Make sure we single source these things since used in relnotes and compatibility

To support this awareness:

- ``shardsvr`` Requirement
     For a 3.4 sharded cluster, :program:`mongod` instances for the
     shards **must** explicitly specify its role as a ``shardsvr``,
     either via the configuration file setting
     :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` or via the command line option
     :option:`--shardsvr`.

     .. note::

        Default port for :program:`mongod` instances with the ``shardsvr``
        role is ``27018``. To use a different port, specify
        :setting:`net.port` setting or ``--port`` option.

     .. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Ensure that in all our sharding tutorials we specify shardsvr.

- 3.4 ``mongos`` Incompatibility with Earlier Versions of ``mongod``
   Version 3.4 :program:`mongos` instances cannot connect to
   earlier versions of :program:`mongod` instances.

Balancer on Config Server Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The balancer process has moved from the :program:`mongos` to the
primary member of the config server replica set. Associated with this
change, MongoDB 3.4 removes the following configuration options from
the :program:`mongos`:

- :setting:`sharding.chunkSize` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--chunkSize` command-line option

- :setting:`sharding.autoSplit` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--noAutoSplit` command line option

Faster Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.4:

- For :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, the default value
  ``secondaryThrottle`` is ``false`` for all chunk migrations. The
  balancer does not wait for replication to a secondary and instead
  continues with the next document.

- MongoDB can perform parallel chunk migrations. Similar to earlier
  versions, a shard can participate in at most one migration at a time.
  Observing this restriction, for a sharded cluster with *n* shards,
  MongoDB can perform at most *n/2* (rounded down) simultaneous chunk
  migrations.

Removal of Support for SCCC Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 sharded clusters no longer support the use of mirrored (SCCC)
:program:`mongod` instances as config servers. The use of SCCC config
servers, deprecated in the 3.2 release, is no longer valid. Instead,
deploy your config servers as a replica set (CSRS).

To upgrade your sharded cluster to version 3.4, the config servers must
be running as a replica set.

To convert your existing config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

Sharding Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 introduces :doc:`/core/zone-sharding`, which supersedes
tag-aware sharding available in earlier versions.

To support zones, MongoDB introduces the following commands and
:program:`mongo` shell helpers:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Commands
     - `mongo` Shell Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`addShardToZone`
     - :method:`sh.addShardToZone()`

   * - :dbcommand:`removeShardFromZone`
     -  :method:`sh.removeShardFromZone()`

   * - :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange`
     - | :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`
       | :method:`sh.removeRangeFromZone()`

.. _3.4-replica-set:

Replica Set
-----------

Default Journaling Behavior of ``majority`` Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new replica set configuration setting
:rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` determines whether an
acknowledgement for a write concern of :writeconcern:`majority
<"majority">` returns after the majority of the voting members apply
the write in memory or to the on-disk journal *if* the :ref:`j <wc-j>`
option is unspecified in the write concern.

Adjustable Catchup Period for Newly Elected Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new replica set configuration setting
:rsconf:`settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` defines the time limit for a
newly elected primary to catch up with the other replica set members
that may have more recent writes.

Linearizable Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 introduces a read concern level of
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` to read data that reflects all successful
writes issued with a :writeconcern:`"majority"` *and* acknowledged
prior to the start of the read operation. Linearizable read concern
guarantees only apply if read operations specify a query filter that
uniquely identifies a single document.

Linearizable read concern is available for all MongoDB supported
:doc:`storage engines </core/storage-engines>`.

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Reads with linearizable read concern may be significantly slower than
reads with :readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read
concerns. Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern, in
case a majority of data bearing members are unavailable. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )

For more information on read concern, including operations that support
read concerns, see :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

Improved Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MongoDB 3.4 improves the performance of :ref:`initial sync
  <replica-set-initial-sync>` by having initial sync build the indexes
  as the documents are copied.

- MongoDB 3.4 improves the :ref:`initial sync retry logic
  <init-sync-retry>` to be more resilient to intermittent failures on
  the network.

- Modified :ref:`rs.status() output <rs-status-output>` to report on
  initial sync status and progress.

.. _3.4-decimal:

Decimal Type
------------

3.4 adds support for the `decimal128 format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal128_floating-point_format>`_ with
the new ``decimal`` data type. The decimal128 format supports numbers with
up to 34 decimal digits (i.e. significant digits) and an exponent range
of −6143 to +6144.

To support the format, the :program:`mongo` shell adds the
:ref:`NumberDecimal <shell-type-decimal>` wrapper.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.insert( {_id: 1, item: "The Scream", price: NumberDecimal("9.99"), quantity: 4 } )

When performing :ref:`comparisons <bson-types-comparison-order>` among
different numerical types, MongoDB performs comparison on the exact
stored numerical values without first converting values to a common
type.

Unlike the ``double`` data type, which only stores an approximation of
the decimal values, the ``decimal`` data type stores the exact value.
For example, a ``decimal`` ``NumberDecimal("9.99")`` has a precise
value of ``9.99`` where as a double ``9.99`` would have an approximate
value of ``9.9900000000000002131628...``.

To test for ``decimal`` type, use the :query:`$type` operator with the
literal ``"decimal"`` or ``19``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { price: { $type: "decimal" } } )

To use the new ``decimal`` data type with a MongoDB driver, an upgrade
to a driver version that supports the feature is necessary.

.. _3.4-rel-notes-aggregation-cluster:

Aggregation
-----------

New Aggregation Stage for Recursive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 introduces a stage to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allows for recursive search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$graphLookup`

     - Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output
       document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal
       results of the recursive search for that document.

New Aggregation Stages for Faceted Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faceted search allows for the categorization of documents into
classifications. For example, given a collection of inventory
documents, you may want to classify items by a single category, such as
by the price range, or by multiple categories, such as by price range
as well as separately by the departments.

3.4 introduces stages to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allow for faceted search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$bucket`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into buckets that
       represent a range of values for a specified expression.

   * - :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into specified number
       of buckets that represent a range of values for a specified
       expression. MongoDB automatically determines the bucket
       boundaries.

   * - :pipeline:`$facet`

     - Processes multiple :ref:`pipelines <aggregation-pipeline>` on
       the input documents and outputs a document that contains the
       results of these pipelines. By specifying facet-related stages
       (:pipeline:`$bucket`, :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`, and
       :pipeline:`$sortByCount`) in these pipelines, :pipeline:`$facet`
       allows for multi-faceted search.

   * - :pipeline:`$sortByCount`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents by a specified
       expression to compute the count for each group. Output documents
       are sorted in descending order by the count.

New Aggregation Stages to Facilitate Reshaping Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 introduces stages to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that faciliate replacing documents as
well as adding new fields.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$addFields`

     - Adds new fields to documents. The stage outputs documents that
       contains all existing fields from the input documents as well as
       the newly added fields.

   * - :pipeline:`$replaceRoot`

     - Replaces a document with the specified document. You can specify
       a document embedded in the input document to promote the
       embedded document to the top level.

New Aggregation Stage to Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 introduces a new stage to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that faciliate counting document.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$count`

     - Returns a document that contains a count of the number of
       documents input to the stage.

New Aggregation Array Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :expression:`$in`

     - Returns a boolean that indicates if a specified value is in an
       array.

   * - :expression:`$indexOfArray`

     - Searches an array for an occurence of a specified value and
       returns the array index (zero-based) of the first occurence.

   * - :expression:`$range`

       numbers.

   * - :expression:`$reverseArray`

     - Returns an output array whose elements are those of the input
       array but in reverse order.

   * - :expression:`$reduce`

     - Takes an array as input and applies an expression to each
       element in the array to return the final result of the
       expression.

   * - :expression:`$zip`

     - Returns an output array where each element is itself an array,
       consisting of elements in the corresponding array index position
       from the input arrays.

New Aggregation String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :expression:`$indexOfBytes`

     - Searches a string for an occurence of a substring and returns
       the UTF-8 byte index (zero-based) of the first occurence.

- All other fields are returned in the output documents.

- You cannot specify new fields or the inclusion of other fields.

.. _3.4-relnotes-collation:

Collation and Case-Insensitive Indexes
--------------------------------------

To allow for language-specific rules for string comparison, MongoDB
3.4 introduces :doc:`collation </reference/collation>` to its query language and
indexes.

The following operations support collation:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-operations-table.rst

For details, see :doc:`Collation </reference/collation>`.

.. _3.4-relnotes-views:

Views
-----

MongoDB 3.4 adds support for creating read-only views from existing
collections or other views. To specify or define a view, MongoDB 3.4
introduces:

- the ``viewOn`` and ``pipeline`` options to the existing
  :dbcommand:`create` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline> } )

  or if specifying a default :ref:`collation <3.4-relnotes-collation>` for the view:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )

- and a corresponding :program:`mongo` shell helper
  :method:`db.createView()`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <collation>)

For more information on creating views, see :ref:`3.4-reference-views`.

Security Enhancement
--------------------

Transition to Auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 adds support for rolling transition to internal
authentication for replica sets and sharded clusters. For details, see
:setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting and :option:`--transitionToAuth`
command line option for :program:`mongod` and:program:`mongos`.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-keyfile-access-control-in-existing-replica-set-without-downtime`

MongoDB Tools
-------------

``mongoreplay``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB introduces :program:`mongoreplay`, a workload capture and
analysis tool that replaces :program:`mongosniff`. You can use
:program:`mongoreplay` to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB
instance, and then replay the commands back onto another host at a
later time.

General Enhancements
--------------------

MongoDB 3.4 includes the following enhancements:

- Added ``systemd`` support in distributions.

- Increased :parameter:`diagnosticDataCollectionDirectorySizeMB`
  default size to 200 megabytes from 100 megabytes.

- Decreased the lower bound and the default setting of the
  :option:`WiredTiger internal cache <--wiredTigerCacheSizeGB>`. Both
  the :option:`WiredTiger Storage Engine internal cache
  <--wiredTigerCacheSizeGB>` and the :option:`inMemory Storage Engine
  maximum memory size <--inMemorySizeGB>` can accept floating-point values.

- :method:`~db.collection.find()`,
  :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()`, :dbcommand:`listIndexes`, and
  :dbcommand:`listCollections` operations return a :ref:`maximum of 16
  megabytes per batch <cursor-batches>`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-diagnostic-info.rst

- :program:`mongo` shell adds support for marshalling fields of type
  :ref:`javascript<bson-types>` and
  :ref:`javascriptWithScope<bson-types>` to JavaScript functions.
  See :option:`--disableJavaScriptProtection`.
 

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

MongoDB Enterprise adds support for log redaction for use in
conjunction with MongoDB's :doc:`encrypted storage engine
</core/security-encryption-at-rest>`. Log redaction prevents
potentially sensitive information from being written to the diagnostic
log; however, diagnostics on redacted logs may be more difficult due to
the lack of data related to a log event.

To enable log redaction, see the
:setting:`security.redactClientLogData` setting and the
:option:`--redactClientLogData` option for :program:`mongod`.

Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.4-compatibility`.
