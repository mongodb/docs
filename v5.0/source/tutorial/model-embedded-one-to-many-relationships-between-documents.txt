Overview
--------

This page describes a data model that uses :ref:`embedded
<data-modeling-embedding>` documents to describe a one-to-many
relationship between connected data. Embedding connected data
in a single document can reduce the number of read operations required
to obtain data. In general, you should structure your schema so
your application receives all of its required information in a single
read operation.

.. _one-to-many-embedded-document-pattern:

Embedded Document Pattern
-------------------------

Consider the following example that maps patron and multiple address
relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of embedding over
referencing if you need to view many data entities in context of
another. In this one-to-many relationship between ``patron`` and
``address`` data, the ``patron`` has multiple ``address`` entities.

In the normalized data model, the ``address`` documents contain a
reference to the ``patron`` document.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // patron document
   {
      _id: "joe",
      name: "Joe Bookreader"
   }

   // address documents
   {
      patron_id: "joe", // reference to patron document
      street: "123 Fake Street",
      city: "Faketon",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
   }

   {
      patron_id: "joe",
      street: "1 Some Other Street",
      city: "Boston",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
   }

If your application frequently retrieves the ``address`` data with the
``name`` information, then your application needs to issue multiple
queries to resolve the references. A more optimal schema would be to
embed the ``address`` data entities in the ``patron`` data, as in the
following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": "joe",
      "name": "Joe Bookreader",
      "addresses": [
                   {
                     "street": "123 Fake Street",
                     "city": "Faketon",
                     "state": "MA",
                     "zip": "12345"
                   },
                   {
                     "street": "1 Some Other Street",
                     "city": "Boston",
                     "state": "MA",
                     "zip": "12345"
                   }
                 ]
    }

With the embedded data model, your application can retrieve the
complete patron information with one query.

.. _one-to-many-subset:

Subset Pattern
--------------

A potential problem with the :ref:`embedded document pattern
<one-to-many-embedded-document-pattern>` is that it can lead to large
documents, especially if the embedded field is unbounded. In this case,
you can use the subset pattern to only access data which is required by
the application, instead of the entire set of embedded data.

Consider an e-commerce site that has a list of reviews for a product:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "name": "Super Widget",
     "description": "This is the most useful item in your toolbox.",
     "price": { "value": NumberDecimal("119.99"), "currency": "USD" },
     "reviews": [
       {
         "review_id": 786,
         "review_author": "Kristina",
         "review_text": "This is indeed an amazing widget.",
         "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-18")
       },
       {
         "review_id": 785,
         "review_author": "Trina",
         "review_text": "Nice product. Slow shipping.",
         "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-17")
       },
       ...
       {
         "review_id": 1,
         "review_author": "Hans",
         "review_text": "Meh, it's okay.",
         "published_date": ISODate("2017-12-06")
       } 
     ]
   }

The reviews are sorted in reverse chronological order. When a user
visits a product page, the application loads the ten most recent reviews.

Instead of storing all of the reviews with the product, you can split
the collection into two collections:

- The ``product`` collection stores information on each product,
  including the product's ten most recent reviews:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id": 1,
       "name": "Super Widget",
       "description": "This is the most useful item in your toolbox.",
       "price": { "value": NumberDecimal("119.99"), "currency": "USD" },
       "reviews": [
         {
           "review_id": 786,
           "review_author": "Kristina",
           "review_text": "This is indeed an amazing widget.",
           "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-18")
         }
         ...
         {
           "review_id": 777,
           "review_author": "Pablo",
           "review_text": "Amazing!",
           "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-16")
         }
       ]
     }

- The ``review`` collection stores all reviews. Each review contains
  a reference to the product for which it was written.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "review_id": 786,
       "product_id": 1,
       "review_author": "Kristina",
       "review_text": "This is indeed an amazing widget.",
       "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-18")
     }
     {
       "review_id": 785,
       "product_id": 1,
       "review_author": "Trina",
       "review_text": "Nice product. Slow shipping.",
       "published_date": ISODate("2019-02-17")
     }
     ...
     {
       "review_id": 1,
       "product_id": 1,
       "review_author": "Hans",
       "review_text": "Meh, it's okay.",
       "published_date": ISODate("2017-12-06")
     }

By storing the ten most recent reviews in the ``product``
collection, only the required subset of the overall data is returned in
the call to the ``product`` collection. If a user wants to see
additional reviews, the application makes a call to the ``review``
collection.

.. tip::

   When considering where to split your data, the most
   frequently-accessed portion of the data should go in the collection
   that the application loads first. In this example, the schema is
   split at ten reviews because that is the number of reviews visible in
   the application by default.

   To learn how to use the subset pattern to model one-to-one
   relationships between collections, see
   :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-one`.

Trade-Offs of the Subset Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using smaller documents containing more frequently-accessed data reduces
the overall size of the working set. These smaller documents result in
improved read performance for the data that the application accesses
most frequently.

However, the subset pattern results in data duplication. In the example,
reviews are maintained in both the ``product`` collection and the
``reviews`` collection. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that the
reviews are consistent between each collection. For example, when a
customer edits their review, the application may need to make two write
operations: one to update the ``product`` collection and one to update
the ``reviews`` collection.

You must also implement logic in your application to ensure that
the reviews in the ``product`` collection are always the ten 
most recent reviews for that product.

Other Sample Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to product reviews, the subset pattern can also be a good 
fit to store:

- Comments on a blog post, when you only want to show the most recent
  or highest-rated comments by default.

- Cast members in a movie, when you only want to show cast members with
  the largest roles by default.
