Atlas Device Sync automatically synchronizes data between client applications and 
an :ref:`App Services backend <realm-cloud>`. When a client 
device is online, Sync asynchronously synchronizes data in a 
background thread between the device and your backend App.

Flexible Sync
-------------

.. versionadded:: 10.22.0

When you select :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` for your backend App 
configuration, your client implementation must include subscriptions to 
queries on :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`. Flexible Sync works 
by synchronizing data that matches query subscriptions you maintain in the 
client application. 

A subscription set contains a set of queries. Flexible Sync returns 
documents matching those queries, where the user has the appropriate 
:ref:`permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to read and/or 
read and write the documents. If documents match the query, but the client 
does not have the permission to read or write them, they do not sync to 
the client application.

You can form queries using :ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.

.. include:: /includes/note-unsupported-flex-sync-rql-operators.rst

Subscription sets are based on a specific type of :ref:`Realm object 
<ios-realm-objects>`. You might have multiple subscriptions if you 
have many types of Realm objects.

To use Flexible Sync in your client application, open a synced realm 
with a Flexible Sync configuration. Then, manage subscriptions
to determine which documents to sync.

.. tip::

   Device Sync supports two Sync Modes: Flexible Sync, and the older 
   Partition-Based Sync. If your App Services backend uses Partition-Based 
   Sync, refer to :ref:`swift-partition-based-sync`.

   We recommend new apps use Flexible Sync.

Sync Connection and Timeout Behaviors
-------------------------------------

In Realm Swift SDK version 10.41.0 and later, you can specify:

- Sync timeout behaviors 
- Whether opening more than one synced realm opens more than one 
  connection to the server

You can specify these settings on the :ref:`App client configuration 
<ios-init-appclient>`.
