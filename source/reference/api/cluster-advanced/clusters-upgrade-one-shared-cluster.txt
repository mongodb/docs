Considerations
--------------

Use this endpoint to upgrade one :ref:`shared-tier cluster <shared-tier-cluster>`
to another version of MongoDB. To specify which cluster to upgrade, use
the ``name`` string in the request body. This endpoint replaces the
tenant cluster with a new cluster and allows you to upgrade your cluster
and port the cluster to a different cloud provider.

Upgrading your shared-tier cluster has the following considerations:

- Your cluster must be in a healthy state before upgrading.

- You can only upgrade your |service| cluster one major version at a
  time. You cannot skip any major versions when upgrading your
  cluster.

- Each major version contains some features which may not be
  backward-compatible with previous versions. When upgrading to a new
  major version, check the :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes>` for
  changes which may affect your applications.
  If you have any questions regarding migration support, see :ref:`major-version-upgrade-support`.

- After upgrading the MongoDB major version, you will not be able to 
  downgrade to previous versions.

- Create a staging cluster to test your applications against the new 
  MongoDB version and to ensure your production application's transition
  to the upgraded MongoDB version is smooth. For more information, see
  :ref:`Modify a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`.
