===============================
Remove Members from Replica Set
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use this procedure to remove or decommission a member of a
:term:`replica set`. To change the hostname of a member of the replica
set, you can reconfigure the set: see
:doc:`/tutorial/change-hostnames-in-a-replica-set` for more
information..

Requirements
------------

For best results always *shut down* the :program:`mongod` instance
before removing it from a :term:`replica set`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   In versions prior to 2.2, you *must* to shut down the
   :program:`mongod` instance before removing it.

Procedure
---------

1. Connect to the :term:`primary` with the :program:`mongo` shell.

   Use :method:`db.isMaster()` when connected to *any* member of the
   set to find the current primary.

#. Use :method:`rs.remove()` in either of the following forms to
   remove the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27017")
      rs.remove("mongo3.example.net")

   MongoDB disconnects the shell briefly as the replica set elects a
   new primary: the shell will automatically reconnect. However, the
   shell displays an error even if this command succeeds.

To add a removed member to a replica set, see the :doc:`procedure for
adding replica set members </tutorial/expand-replica-set>`.
