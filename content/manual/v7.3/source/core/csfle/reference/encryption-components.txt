Diagram
-------

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between a MongoDB
driver or :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and each component of {+csfle+}
({+csfle-abbrev+}):

Components
----------

The following sections discuss the individual components of the preceding
diagram.

libmongocrypt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libmongocrypt`` is the `Apache-licensed open-source
<https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`__ core cryptography
library used by the official MongoDB drivers and :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to 
power {+csfle+}. Some drivers may require specific integration steps to install 
or link the library.

To view steps for installing ``libmongocrypt``,
see the :ref:`libmongocrypt reference page <csfle-reference-libmongocrypt>`.

mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongocryptd`` supports automatic encryption and is only available
with MongoDB Enterprise. ``mongocryptd`` does not perform
cryptographic functions.

To learn more about ``mongocryptd``, see
:ref:`csfle-reference-mongocryptd`.

{+key-vault-long+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+key-vault-long+} is a standard MongoDB collection
that stores all {+dek-long+}s used to encrypt application data.
{+dek-long+}s are themselves encrypted using a {+cmk-long+}
({+cmk-abbr+}) prior to storage in the {+key-vault-long+}. You can host
your {+key-vault-long+} on a different MongoDB cluster than
the cluster storing your encrypted application data.

To learn more about the {+key-vault-long+}, see
:ref:`qe-reference-keys-key-vaults`.

{+kms-long+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+kms-long+} ({+kms-abbr+}) stores the
{+cmk-long+} ({+cmk-abbr+}) used to encrypt {+dek-long+}s.

To view a list of all {+kms-abbr+} providers MongoDB supports,
see :ref:`qe-fundamentals-kms-providers`.

MongoDB Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB cluster which stores the encrypted data may also enforce
{+csfle+}. For more information on server-side schema enforcement,
see :ref:`csfle-reference-server-side-schema`.
