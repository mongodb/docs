"The balancer is a process that runs on *one* of the :program:`mongos` "
"instances in a cluster and ensures that :term:`chunks <chunk>` are evenly "
"distributed throughout a sharded cluster. In most deployments, the default "
"balancer configuration is sufficient for normal operation. However, "
"administrators might need to modify balancer behavior depending on "
"application or operational requirements. If you encounter a situation where "
