      An area chart is a good choice to easily visualize the ages where
      customers are the most concentrated. Since you are not concerned
      with exact values in this scenario but rather general trends, an
      area chart makes more sense than a line chart because the filled-in
      visualization allows us to more easily identify the most common age
      ranges.

      We use a discrete area chart, rather than continuous,
      because we are concerned with the particular age values of our
      customers and there is a distinct set of possible values for
      customer age.

title: Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels.

   a. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``customer`` field to
      expand the ``customer`` object and view its properties.

   #. Drag the ``customer.age`` field to the :guilabel:`X Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`X Axis` encoding channel
      dictates which field to display on the horizontal axis.

   #. Drag the ``customer.age`` field to the :guilabel:`Y Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel
      determines which field to use for the chart's
      :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`.

      .. cssclass:: admonition-example
      .. admonition:: Y Axis Encoding Channel

         Because we are interested in the age range of the
         total customer base, we use the ``customer.age`` field here
         and will use an aggregation operator which allows us
         to count the occurrences of the ages of each customer.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Y Axis Aggregate` dropdown, select
      :guilabel:`count`. This option counts the occurrence of each
      customer age from each sale and adds it to the visualization.

   Your chart should now look something like this:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/tutorial-area-in-progress-2.png
      :figwidth: 750px
      :alt: Area Chart Builder

   In general, customers appear to most commonly between the
   ages ``34-48``. This is where the largest area region in the
   chart occurs. Additionally, the rest of the ages appear to be
   `normally distributed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution>`_,
   meaning the average customer age is at the center of the area chart
   and there are the same number of younger and older customers. You can
   use this information to direct advertising where the largest
   customer age group is most likely to see company advertisements.
