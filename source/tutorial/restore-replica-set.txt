Overview
--------

When you restore a replica set from backup, |mms| provides you with a
restore file for the selected restore point. For an overview of the
restore process, please see :doc:`/core/restore-overview`.

Considerations
--------------

``BinData``
+++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/considerations-restore-bindata-change.rst

``restoreInfo.txt``
+++++++++++++++++++

The backup restore file includes a metadata file, ``restoreInfo.txt``.
This file captures the options the database used when the snapshot was
taken. The database must be run with the listed options after it has
been restored.

Prerequisites

.. include:: /includes/extracts/encrypted-backup-display-kmip-info.rst

Oplog Size
++++++++++

To seed each replica set member, you will use the
:file:`seedSecondary.sh` or :file:`seedSecondary.bat` script included
in the backup restore file. When you run the script, you will provide
the replica set's oplog size, in gigabytes.

.. seealso::
   See the **Check the Size of the Oplog** section of the 
   :manual:`Troubleshoot Replica Sets </tutorial/troubleshoot-replica-sets>` 
   if you do not have the size.

Client Requests During Restoration

Procedures
----------

To have |mms| automatically restore the backup, perform the
:ref:`select the snapshot <select-snapshot-replica-set>` procedure.

To restore the backup manually, perform all the following procedures
sequentially. If you restore to existing hardware, use a different data
directory than used previously.

Unmanage the Replica Set
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before attempting to restore the data manually, 
:doc:`remove the replica set from Automation </tutorial/unmanage-deployment>`.

.. _restore-cluster-manually:

Restore the Replica Set Manually
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Follow the tutorial from the MongoDB Manual to  
:manual:`restore the replica set </tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup>` 

.. _reimport-cluster:

Reimport the Replica Set
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To manage the replica set with automation again, 
:doc:`import the replica set </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>` 
back into |mms|.
