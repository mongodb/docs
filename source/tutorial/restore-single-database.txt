Backup snapshots contain a complete copy of your :program:`mongod` data
directory. You may want to restore some of the data in a snapshot.

To restore a single database or a collection
from a snapshot, you can use the :ref:`Queryable Backup
<restore-from-queryable-backup>` to export a single database or
collection to restore to the target deployment.

You can also manually :ref:`manual-restore-from-backup`.

Considerations
--------------

Before you attempt a restore, ensure the host for your target
deployment has sufficient storage space for the restore files and the
restored database, plus additional space for dataset growth. Use
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>` to find the current
database size.

Restore a Database or Collection from Queryable Backup
------------------------------------------------------

You can use a :doc:`queryable backup snapshot </tutorial/query-backup>`
to export data for a database or a collection and restore to the target
deployment. The following procedure connects to the queryable backup
instance via |mms|-provided tunnel [#manual-connect]_.

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-db-from-queryable-backup.rst

.. [#manual-connect]
   Alternatively, instead of connecting via the tunnel, you can
   :ref:`connect directly <query-via-manual-connection>` to the
   queryable backup, using the X.509 PEM files provided. If connecting
   directly to the queryable backup, you must specify the hostname and
   port, the TLS/SSL option, and the X.509 certificates.
