Authorization
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to govern access to a
MongoDB system. A user is granted one or more :ref:`roles <roles>` that
determine the user's access to database resources and operations. Outside
of role assignments, the user has no access to the system.

MongoDB provides :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>`, each
with a dedicated purpose for a common use case. Examples include the
:authrole:`read`, :authrole:`readWrite`, :authrole:`dbAdmin`, and
:authrole:`root` roles.

Administrators also can create new roles and privileges to cater to
operational needs. Administrator can assign privileges scoped as
granularly as the collection level.

When granted a role, a user receives all the privileges of that role. A
user can have several roles concurrently, in which case the user receives
the union of all the privileges of the respective roles.

.. _roles:

Roles
-----

A role consists of privileges that pair resources with allowed operations.
Each privilege is defined directly in the role or inherited from another
role.

A role's privileges apply to the database where the role is created. A role
created on the ``admin`` database can include privileges that apply to all
databases or to the :ref:`cluster <resource-cluster>`.

A user assigned a role receives all the privileges of that role. The user can
have multiple roles and can have different roles on different databases.

Roles always grant privileges and never limit access. For example, if a user
has both :authrole:`read` *and* :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` roles on a
database, the greater access prevails.

.. _privileges:

Privileges
~~~~~~~~~~

A privilege consists of a specified resource and the actions permitted on the
resource.

A privilege :doc:`resource </reference/resource-document>` is either a
database, collection, set of collections, or the cluster. If the cluster, the
affiliated actions affect the state of the system rather than a specific
database or collection.

An :doc:`action </reference/privilege-actions>` is a command or method the
user is allowed to perform on the resource. A resource can have multiple
allowed actions. For available actions see
:doc:`/reference/privilege-actions`.

For example, a privilege that includes the :authaction:`update` action
allows a user to modify existing documents on the resource. To
additionally grant the user permission to create documents on the
resource, the administrator would add the :authaction:`insert` action to
the privilege.

For privilege syntax, see :data:`admin.system.roles.privileges`.

.. _inheritance:

Inherited Privileges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A role can include one or more existing roles in its definition, in which case
the role inherits all the privileges of the included roles.

A role can inherit privileges from other roles in its database. A role created
on the ``admin`` database can inherit privileges from roles in any database.

.. _user-defined-roles:

User-Defined Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.4

User administrators can create custom roles to ensure collection-level and
command-level granularity and to adhere to the policy of :term:`least
privilege`. Administrators create and edit roles using the :ref:`role
management commands <role-management-commands>`.

MongoDB scopes a user-defined role to the database in which it is created and
uniquely identifies the role by the pairing of its name and its database.
MongoDB stores the roles in the ``admin`` database's :doc:`system.roles
</reference/system-roles-collection>` collection. Do not access this
collection directly but instead use the :ref:`role management commands
<role-management-commands>` to view and edit custom roles.

Role Assignment to Users
------------------------

User administrators create the users that access the system's databases.
MongoDB's :ref:`user management commands <user-management-commands>` let
administrators create users and assign them roles.

MongoDB scopes a user to the database in which the user is created. MongoDB
stores all user definitions in the ``admin`` database, no matter which
database the user is scoped to. MongoDB stores users in the ``admin``
database's :doc:`system.users collection
</reference/system-users-collection>`. Do not access this collection directly
but instead use the :ref:`user management commands
<user-management-commands>`.

The first role assigned in a database should be either :authrole:`userAdmin`
or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`. This user can then create all other users
in the system. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator`.
