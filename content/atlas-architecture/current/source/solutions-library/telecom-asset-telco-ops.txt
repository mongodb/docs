Solution Overview
-----------------

Communication service providers (CSPs) manage massive volumes of data
generated by billions of connected devices to ensure seamless and
uninterrupted operations. To accomplish this, they rely on
data-intensive network management systems that monitor critical
performance metrics like latency, maintain reliability during network
congestion, and uphold stringent security measures to protect against
cyberattacks. 

Recognizing the complexity and scale of these operations, our solution
highlights the transformative power of integrating artificial
intelligence and MongoDB to automate network management, significantly
streamlining workflows for operators. By merging MongoDB with `large
language models
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/large-language-models>`__
(LLM) and adopting a `retrieval-augmented generation
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/retrieval-augmented-generation>`__
(RAG) strategy, we have developed an AI-assisted chatbot that transforms
network operations into a conversational, automated, and informed
system. This chatbot taps into network logs, maintenance records,
customer data, and sensor data stored in MongoDB to provide actionable
insights for anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, mitigation
recommendations, and more. 

This approach empowers network operators to manage complex workflows
with minimal human involvement, accelerating the rollout of new services
and potentially `increasing CSPs’ annual revenue by up to 5%

through autonomous networks.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

With MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three main components of this solution:

1. **Source data ingestion:** Before querying data, network managers need to
   ingest log entries and telemetry events in real time, capturing details
   like IP addresses, geographic data, request paths, timestamps, router
   logs, and sensor data. This architecture leverages MongoDB's stream
   processing capabilities to automatically capture and process incoming
   data into MongoDB Atlas, creating a comprehensive view of network
   activity. This enriched dataset is then leveraged within our RAG
   architecture for decision-making.

#. **Question-based data selection:** The second component of this
   solution addresses the questions from network managers, such as “What
   might be causing the client’s video streaming issue in Toronto?” This
   query undergoes an initial processing where the LLM generates a
   customized aggregation pipeline to select the appropriate data for
   analysis. Concurrently, `vector-embedded data
   <https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/vector-embeddings>`__ can
   be efficiently retrieved through `semantic search
   <https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/semantic-search>`__,
   allowing for the extraction of closely related information.

#. **Inference and natural language output:** Once MongoDB identifies
   the relevant data, a subsequent LLM translates this information into
   natural language explanations for the user. During this process, the LLM
   analyzes the retrieved data to detect patterns and anomalies, enabling
   precise identification of root cause candidates and supporting informed
   decision-making. For example, it might uncover that an overloaded local
   CDN node, along with high requests from older routers, are causing the
   problem.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

This solution leverages server network logs, organized as time series
data, using the following MongoDB schema:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   {
      "_id": ObjectId("..."),
      "source_id": 12345,  
      "source_type": "webserver",  
      "timestamp": ISODate("2025-02-19T15:12:57.000Z"),  
      "category": "accesslog",  
      "event": "GET",  
      "value": { "type": "url", "data": "https://mytv.telco.com/login" }
   }

Building the Solution
---------------------

This AI-powered network management solution employs a RAG framework with
MongoDB Atlas to enhance data-driven diagnostics in complex
telecommunication environments.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **MongoDB and gen AI transform network management:** Integrating LLMs
  with MongoDB's capabilities like aggregation pipelines and vector
  search effectively streamlines network management by reducing human
  intervention, optimizing processes, and ultimately automating critical
  operations.

- **Data management is critical:** Network management systems produce vast
  amounts of data from network logs and user requests, creating
  substantial challenges in data interoperability, privacy, and
  efficient processing. Effective solutions require flexible, scalable
  databases that can store and handle high-frequency, complex data
  streams.

- **MongoDB offers the tools to drive AI-powered solutions:** A robust
  database infrastructure, combined with a flexible document model and
  advanced vector search capabilities, allow CSPs to efficiently develop
  AI applications. Specifically, vector search streamlines the retrieval
  of semantically relevant content, boosting the performance of LLMs that
  fuel chatbot technologies.
