You can install {+rel-mig+} on a single Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS 
machine. This installation method uses default settings and binds {+rel-mig+} 
to a single IP and port.

About This Task
---------------

{+rel-mig+} uses the following file locations on RHEL/CentOS:

.. include:: /includes/fact-file-location-linux.rst

Steps
-----

1. Download the latest ``.tar.gz`` binary from the 
   `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Install {+rel-mig+}.

   .. code-block:: bash

      tar -xvzf relational-migrator-<version_number>-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /opt

   .. include:: /includes/fact-install-linux-directory.rst

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers 
   into your {+rel-mig+} directory.

   a. To download and install MySQL, Oracle or DB2 drivers, see the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fact-driver-download-locations.rst

   b. Copy the driver files to ``~/.mongodb/relational-migrator/Drivers``.

      To copy the driver, use the following example: 

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/jdbc/216/ojdbc11.jar -O -L -b -o
