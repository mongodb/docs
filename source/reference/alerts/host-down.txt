Fix Down Host

At time ``T``, the {+magent+} on host ``X`` had not detected a 
:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process running on host ``Y`` port ``Z`` for ``A`` 
minutes.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

To learn more about the alert condition, see 
:ref:`Host is down <host-alert-conditions>`.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process could not be reached because of a 
  network issue.

- The :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process is not running.

- The host is powered off.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

- Verify network communication between the host running the {+magent+} 
  and the host that is listed as down. One way to do this is through 
  {+mongosh+}:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongosh <hostname>:<port>

  If connecting from {+mongosh+} fails, try a basic 
  ping test:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ping <hostname>

- Verify the :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process is running:

  If the process was installed from ``deb`` or ``rpm`` package, query 
  the service manager for the status:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo service mongod status

  Alternatively, you can use ``ps``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ps aux | grep mongo

.. note::

   The ``Host is down`` alert should not be used to detect all 
   occurrences of a host reboot. The alert is triggered only if the 
   host is seen as down at the instant that the {+magent+} runs the 
   check. The interval between checks can vary from 1 to 3 minutes.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Keep your host powered on and the :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process running. 
Work to prevent any network issues.
