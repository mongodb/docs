Provision a Server on AWS
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that you can provision EC2
servers directly from the |mms| interface. When you provision an EC2 server
from |mms|, |mms| automatically installs the Automation Agent to the
server and is ready to deploy managed MongoDB instances on this
system.

Prerequisites
-------------

To provision EC2 servers through |mms|, you must have an Amazon Web Services
account that meets the prerequisites described in :ref:`aws-checklist`.

You must also configure the |mms| :ref:`AWS Settings <aws-settings-page>` in
|mms|, as described in :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`.

AWS Machine Size
----------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines have sufficient capacity in terms of memory (RAM) and
storage. The root volume should have at least 25 gigabytes.

|mms| does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the ``m3.medium``
instance. |mms| currently supports the AWS Linux and Ubuntu
operating systems.
