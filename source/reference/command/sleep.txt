.. dbcommand:: sleep

   Forces the database to block all operations. This is an internal
   command for testing purposes.

   The :dbcommand:`sleep` command takes the following prototype form:

      { sleep: 1, w: <true|false>, secs: <seconds> }

   The :dbcommand:`sleep` command has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/sleep-field.rst

Behavior
--------

The command places the :program:`mongod` instance in a :term:`write lock`
state for a specified number of seconds. Without arguments,
:dbcommand:`sleep` causes a "read lock" for 100 seconds.

.. warning::

   :dbcommand:`sleep` claims the lock specified in the ``w``
   argument and blocks *all* operations on the :program:`mongod`
   instance for the specified amount of time.
