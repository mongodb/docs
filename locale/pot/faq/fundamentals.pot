# 07d62fb9ba5443e996a6630bb862d148
msgid "MongoDB is a :term:`document`\\-oriented DBMS. Think of MySQL but with :term:`JSON`-like objects comprising the data model, rather than RDBMS tables. Significantly, MongoDB supports neither joins nor transactions. However, it features secondary indexes, an expressive query language, atomic writes on a per-document level, and fully-consistent reads."

# c7a62b8ee552481bac1b349362805a1f
msgid "Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in :term:`collections <collection>`, which are the rough equivalent of RDBMS tables. A collection holds one or more :term:`documents <document>`, which corresponds to a record or a row in a relational database table, and each document has one or more fields, which corresponds to a column in a relational database table."

msgid "MongoDB uses dynamic schemas. You can create collections without defining the structure, i.e. the fields or the types of their values, of the documents in the collection. You can change the structure of documents simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones. Documents in a collection need not have an identical set of fields."

msgid "In practice, it is common for the documents in a collection to have a largely homogeneous structure; however, this is not a requirement. MongoDB's flexible schemas mean that schema migration and augmentation are very easy in practice, and you will rarely, if ever, need to write scripts that perform \"alter table\" type operations, which simplifies and facilitates iterative software development with MongoDB."

# 567d8dccb5d14ed4b633fc8f747bdf8d
msgid "No. In MongoDB, a document's representation in the database is similar to its representation in application memory.

Relational databases must transform data into object representations that applications can read and must store the transformed data in a separate cache: if these transformation from data to application objects require joins, this process increases the overhead related to using the database which increases the importance of the caching layer."
