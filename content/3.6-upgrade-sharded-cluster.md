# Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 3.6

Note: MongoDB 3.6 is not tested on APFS, the new filesystem in macOS 10.13 and may encounter errors. 

Important: Before you attempt any upgrade, please familiarize yourself with the content of this document. 

If you need guidance on upgrading to 3.6, [MongoDB offers major version
upgrade services](https://www.mongodb.com/products/consulting?jmp=docs) to help ensure
a smooth transition without interruption to your MongoDB application.


## Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists

When upgrading, consider the following:


### Upgrade Version Path

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 3.6, you must be
running a 3.4-series release.

To upgrade from a version earlier than the 3.4-series, you must
successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to
3.4-series. For example, if you are running a 3.2-series, you must
upgrade first to [upgrade first to 3.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4/#upgrade) *before* you can upgrade to 3.6.


### Preparedness

Before beginning your upgrade, see the [Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 3.6](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility) document to
ensure that your applications and deployments are compatible with
MongoDB 3.6. Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment before
starting the upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.


### Downgrade Consideration

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend [downgrading](../3.6-downgrade-sharded-cluster/) to the latest patch release of 3.4.


### Default Bind to Localhost

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) and [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos)
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients, including other
members of the replica set, cannot connect to an instance bound only to
localhost. To override and bind to other ip addresses, use the
[``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) configuration file setting or the ``--bind_ip``
command-line option to specify a list of ip addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
[``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting (or ``--bind_ip``) if your sharded
cluster members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote
clients to connect to your sharded cluster.

Warning: Before you bind to other ip addresses, consider [enabling access control](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/#checklist-auth) and other security measures listed in [Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist) to prevent unauthorized access. 

For more information, see [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility)


## Prerequisites

* Version 3.4 or Greater

     To upgrade a sharded cluster to 3.6, **all** members of the
     cluster must be at least version 3.4. The upgrade process checks
     all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
     component is running version earlier than 3.4.

* Feature Compatibility Version

     The 3.4 sharded cluster must have
     ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``. The 3.4
     instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``.
     To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, see [View FeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#view-fcv). To
     set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, see
     [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion).

* Shard Aware

     The shards in the 3.4 sharded clusters must be shard aware
     (i.e. the shards must have received their ``shardIdentity``
     document):

     * For sharded clusters that started as 3.4, the shards are shard aware. 

     * For 3.4 sharded clusters that were upgraded from 3.2-series, when you update ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` from ``3.2`` to ``3.4``, the config server attempts to send the shards their respective ``shardIdentity`` document every 30 seconds until success. You must wait until all shards receive the documents. 

* Avoid Metadata Changes during the Upgrade

     *Optional but Recommended.* During the upgrade, if possible, avoid
     making changes to the collection metadata; for example, avoid
     performing any of the following operations:

     * [``sh.enableSharding()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.enableSharding/#sh.enableSharding) 

     * [``sh.shardCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#sh.shardCollection) 

     * [``sh.addShard()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.addShard/#sh.addShard) 

     * [``db.createCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/#db.createCollection) 

     * [``db.collection.drop()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.drop/#db.collection.drop) 

     * [``db.dropDatabase()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.dropDatabase/#db.dropDatabase) 

     * any operation that creates a database 

     * any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way. 

     See the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) for a complete list of sharding
     commands. Not all commands on the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) page
     modify the cluster metadata.

* [Disable the balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily) 

* Back up the ``config`` Database

     *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
     ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.


## Download 3.6 Binaries


### Use Package Manager

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to 3.6 using your package
manager.

Follow the appropriate [installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux) for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade process.


### Download 3.6 Binaries Manually

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the [MongoDB Download
Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs).

See [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) for more information.


## Upgrade Process


### Step 1: Disable the Balancer.

Disable the balancer as described in
[Disable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily).


### Step 2: Upgrade the config servers.

If the config servers are replica sets:

1. Upgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time: 

   1. Shut down the secondary [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.4 binary with the 3.6 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.6 binary with both the ``--configsvr``, ``--port`` options, 

      If the sharded cluster members are run on different hosts or
      if you wish remote clients to connect to the sharded cluster,
      you must also specify ``--bind_ip`` (or the
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting). For more information, see
      [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) (and
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting if needed) and start the
      3.6 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member’s state, issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell. 

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary. 

   1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an election of a new primary: 

      ```javascript

      rs.stepDown()

      ```

   2. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.6 binary. 

   3. Start the 3.6 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and ``--port`` options: 

      If the sharded cluster members are run on different hosts or
      if you wish remote clients to connect to the sharded cluster,
      you must also specify ``--bind_ip`` (or the
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting). For more information, see
      [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) (and
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting if needed), and start the
      3.6 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.


### Step 3: Upgrade the shards.

Upgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

1. Upgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time: 

   1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.4 binary with the 3.6 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.6 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options. 

      If the sharded cluster members are run on different hosts or
      if you wish remote clients to connect to the sharded cluster,
      you must also specify ``--bind_ip`` (or the
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting). For more information, see
      [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      Of if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      include [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) (and
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting if needed) and start:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member’s state, you can issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell. 

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary. 

   Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use
   [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an
   election of a new primary:

   ```javascript

   rs.stepDown()

   ```

3. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary: 

   1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.6 binary. 

   2. Start the 3.6 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options. 

      If the sharded cluster members are run on different hosts or
      if you wish remote clients to connect to the sharded cluster,
      you must also specify ``--bind_ip`` (or the
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting). For more information, see
      [Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

      ```

      Of if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) (and
      [``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting if needed) and start the
      3.6 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
         bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.


### Step 4: Upgrade the ``mongos`` instances.

Replace each [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance with the 3.6 binary
and restart. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your
deployment.

If the sharded cluster members are run on different hosts or
if you wish remote clients to connect to the sharded cluster,
you must also specify ``--bind_ip`` (or the
[``net.bindIp``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.bindIp) setting). For more information, see
[Localhost Binding Compatibility Changes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#bind-ip-compatibility).

```sh

mongos --configdb csReplSet/<rsconfigsver1:port1>,<rsconfigsver2:port2>,<rsconfigsver3:port3> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

```


### Step 5: Re-enable the balancer.

Using a 3.6 [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell, re-enable the balancer as
described in [Enable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-enable).

The 3.4 and earlier [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell is not compatible with 3.6
clusters.


### Step 6: Enable backwards-incompatible 3.6 features.

At this point, you can run the 3.6 binaries without the
3.6 [features that are incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4.

To enable these 3.6 features, set the feature compatibility
version to 3.6.

Tip: Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can complicate the
downgrade process since you must remove any persisted
backwards-incompatible features before you downgrade. It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to
run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that
the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.

On a [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance, run the
[``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command in the ``admin``
database:

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

```

This command must perform writes to an internal system
collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
successfully, you can safely retry the command on the
[``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) as the operation is idempotent.


### Step 7: Restart ``mongos`` instances.

After changing the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, all
[``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instances need to be restarted to pick up the
changes in the causal consistency behavior.
