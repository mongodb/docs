|service| provides a mechanism for downloading dedicated {+cluster+},
shared {+cluster+}, and {+old-backup+} snapshots as compressed files.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning.rst

Download Considerations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your manual download of a backup snapshot fails, |service| keeps
the request alive and allows you to restart the backup as long as the 
most recent download failure occurred no more than one hour ago. 

For |service| {+clusters+} deployed on |aws| or |azure|, if you 
:ref:`configured any private endpoints <cluster-private-endpoint>`, 
|service| allows you to download the snapshot over the private 
endpoints in the same region as the snapshot. You might incur charges
for downloading the snapshot over the private endpoint. To learn more,
see :ref:`privatelink-billing`.

Restore Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`prerequisites <restore-prereq>`, consider the
following requirements and limitations when restoring from a
locally-downloaded snapshot.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-reqs.rst

- This feature is unavailable for ``M0`` {+clusters+} and 
  for {+Serverless-instances+}.

- The downloaded files consist of the raw files copied from the 
  ``data`` directory. ``mongorestore`` is incompatible with these 
  files. To access the data files, use :ref:`the following procedure
  <restore-local-snapshot-procedure>` to start a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance and point it to the extract directory.

access or higher to the project.
