program: _shared
name: host

args: <hostname><:port>
default: |
  localhost:27017
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     --host <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  When specifying the replica set list format, {{program}} always connects to
  the :term:`primary <Primary>`. 
  
  You can also connect to any single member of the replica set by specifying
  the host and port of only that member:

  .. code-block:: none

     --host <hostname1><:port>

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     If you use IPv6 and use the ``<address>:<port>`` format, you must
     enclose the portion of an address and port combination in
     brackets (e.g. ``[<address>]``).

  .. note::

     You cannot specify both {{role}} and :option:`--uri`.

  {{verb}} IPv6 support and allows {{program}} to connect to the

  is always enabled.

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
  from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/ssl-facts-ca-file.rst

  .. warning::

     **Version 3.2 and earlier:** For TLS/SSL connections (``--ssl``) to
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`, if the {{program}} runs without the
     {{role}}, {{program}} will not attempt
     to validate the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability
     to expired :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
     well as to foreign processes posing as valid :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. Ensure that you *always* specify the
     CA file to validate the server certificates in cases where
     intrusion is a possibility.

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the TLS/SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect

# These are for the tools -- do not use these for the mongod/mongos/mongo shell

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Use the {{role}} option only if the
  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a passphrase. See
  :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the

     --uri "mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]"

  For information on the components of the connection string, see
  the :doc:`Connection String URI Format
  </reference/connection-string/>` documentation. 

  .. note::

     For TLS/SSL options, use the command-line options instead of the
     :ref:`URI options for TLS/SSL (Available starting in
     4.2)<uri-options-tls>`.

   .. important::

      The following command-line options cannot be used in conjunction

      - :option:`--port`
      - :option:`--db`

        :doc:`URI </reference/connection-string/>` connection string also includes the password)
      - :option:`--authenticationDatabase`
      - :option:`--authenticationMechanism`

  of the following values:

     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - ``synchronous``

       - The {{program}} uses synchronous networking and manages its
         networking thread pool on a per connection basis. Previous
         versions of MongoDB managed threads in this way.

     * - ``adaptive``

       - The {{program}} uses the new experimental asynchronous
         networking mode with an adaptive thread pool which manages
         threads on a per request basis. This mode should have more
         consistent performance and use less resources when there are
         more inactive connections than database requests.
