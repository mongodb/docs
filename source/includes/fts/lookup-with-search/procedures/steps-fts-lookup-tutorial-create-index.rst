   .. step:: Specify an index definition.

      The following index definition dynamically indexes the fields of 
      :ref:`supported types <bson-data-chart>` in the collection. You 
      can use the |fts| :guilabel:`Visual Editor` or the |fts| :guilabel:`JSON 
      Editor` in the |service| user interface to create the index.

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Visual Editor 
            :tabid: vib 

            Review the default index definition for the 
            collection.

         .. tab:: JSON Editor
            :tabid: json-editor

            a. Review the index definition.
     
               Your index definition should look similar to the 
               following: 

               .. code-block:: json 
                    
                  {
                    "mappings": {
                      "dynamic": true
                    }
                  }

            #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Search Index`.

   .. step:: Close the :guilabel:`You're All Set!` Modal Window.

      A modal window displays to let you know your index is building. 
      Click the :guilabel:`Close` button.

   .. step:: Wait for the index to finish building.

      The index should take about one minute to build. While it is
      building, the :guilabel:`Status` column reads ``Build in
      Progress``. When it is finished building, the
      :guilabel:`Status` column reads ``Active``.
