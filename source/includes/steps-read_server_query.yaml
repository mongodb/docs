  Before you can write queries to extract data in a meaningful way, you'll need
  to add more data to your database. You can do that by running the ``insertMany()``
  command:

  Now that you have more documents in your collection, you can retrieve specific
  documents.

  To specify criteria to narrow the search results, you need to pass a JSON document
  to the find() method that contains the criteria you are searching for.

  The following example illustrate using a status of "D" as criteria
  for narrowing a find on a collection.
