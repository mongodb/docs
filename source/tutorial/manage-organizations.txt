   You must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for an
   organization to configure the organization settings described
   in this section.

Require Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an |service| :authrole:`Organization Owner`, you can require that
all |service| :doc:`users </tutorial/manage-users/>` within your
organization have :ref:`Two-Factor Authentication
<security-two-factor-auth>` enabled on their |service|
accounts.

.. note::

   You must enable |2fa| on your own |service| account before you
   can enable this setting for your organization. For instructions
   on enabling |2fa| on your |service| account, see
   :ref:`Two-Factor Authentication <security-two-factor-auth>`.

Procedure

.. include:: /includes/steps/org-req-2fa.rst

Require IP Whitelist for Public API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports requiring API whitelisting at the organization level, such that any API activity for all projects within that organization must originate from an entry on each respective |service| userâ€™s API whitelist. For more information on |service| API Access,
see :doc:`Configure Atlas API Access </configure-api-access>`.

Procedure

   This does not stop |service| from sending alerts. To stop |service|
   from sending alerts to Slack, you must :ref:`delete the Slack alert
   setting <delete-alert-setting>`.

.. _delete-organization:

Delete an Organization
----------------------

.. important::

   To delete an organization, you must have :authrole:`Organization

   organization.
