Cursors

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In the :program:`mongo` shell, the primary method for the read
operation is the :method:`db.collection.find()` method. This method
queries a collection and returns a :term:`cursor` to the returning
documents.

To access the documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in
the :program:`mongo` shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a
variable using the ``var`` keyword, then the cursor is automatically
iterated up to 20 times [#set-shell-batch-size]_ to print up to the
first 20 documents in the results.

For example, in the :program:`mongo` shell, the following read
operation queries the ``inventory`` collection for documents that have
``type`` equal to ``'food'`` and automatically print up to the first 20
matching documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } );

To manually iterate the cursor to access the documents, see
:doc:`/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor`.

.. _cursor-behaviors:

Cursor Behaviors
----------------

Closure of Inactive Cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the server will automatically close the cursor after 10
minutes of inactivity or if client has exhausted the cursor. To
override this behavior, you can specify the ``noTimeout``
:meta-driver:`wire protocol flag </legacy/mongodb-wire-protocol>` in
your query; however, you should either close the cursor manually or
exhaust the cursor. In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can set the
``noTimeout`` flag:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myCursor = db.inventory.find().addOption(DBQuery.Option.noTimeout);

See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation for
information on setting the ``noTimeout`` flag. For the :program:`mongo`
shell, see :method:`cursor.addOption()` for a complete list of
available cursor flags.

Cursor Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the cursor is not isolated during its lifetime, intervening
write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a
document more than once if that document has changed. To handle this
situation, see the information on :ref:`snapshot mode
<faq-developers-isolate-cursors>`.

Cursor Batches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB server returns the query results in batches. Batch size
will not exceed the :ref:`maximum BSON document size
<limit-bson-document-size>`. For most queries, the *first* batch
returns 101 documents or just enough documents to exceed 1 megabyte.
Subsequent batch size is 4 megabytes. To override the default size of
the batch, see :method:`~cursor.batchSize()` and
:method:`~cursor.limit()`.

For queries that include a sort operation *without* an index, the
server must load all the documents in memory to perform the sort and
will return all documents in the first batch.

As you iterate through the cursor and reach the end of the returned
batch, if there are more results, :method:`cursor.next()` will perform
a :data:`getmore operation <currentOp.op>` to retrieve the next batch.
To see how many documents remain in the batch as you iterate the
cursor, you can use the :method:`~cursor.objsLeftInBatch()` method, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myCursor = db.inventory.find();

   var myFirstDocument = myCursor.hasNext() ? myCursor.next() : null;

   myCursor.objsLeftInBatch();

Cursor Information
------------------

The :method:`db.serverStatus()` method returns a document that includes
a :data:`~serverStatus.metrics` field. The
:data:`~serverStatus.metrics` field contains a
:data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor` field with the following
information:

- number of timed out cursors since the last server restart

- number of open cursors with the option
  :data:`DBQuery.Option.noTimeout` set to prevent timeout after a
  period of inactivity

- number of "pinned" open cursors

- total number of open cursors

Consider the following example which calls the
:method:`db.serverStatus()` method and accesses the ``metrics`` field
from the results and then the ``cursor`` field from the ``metrics``
field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.serverStatus().metrics.cursor

The result is the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "timedOut" : <number>
      "open" : {
         "noTimeout" : <number>,
         "pinned" : <number>,
         "total" : <number>
      }
   }
