++++++++++++++++

Install and configure the {+magent+}, as described in the
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/monitoring-agent` documentation.

Firewall

If your MongoDB instances operate within a firewall, configure your
network infrastructure to allow outbound connections on port ``443``
(SSL) to ``api-backup.mongodb.com``.

Access Control
++++++++++++++

If you use the Backup feature with a MongoDB deployment that uses authentication,
before installing the Backup Agent, you must create a user in MongoDB
with the appropriate access. See
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/configure-backup-agent`.
