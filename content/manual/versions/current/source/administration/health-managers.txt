This document describes how to use |HMS| to monitor and manage sharded 
cluster health issues.

Overview
--------

A |HM| runs health checks on a :term:`health manager facet`
at a specified :ref:`intensity level 
<health-managers-intensity-levels>`. |HM| checks
run at specified time intervals. A |HM| can be configured to 
move a failing :ref:`mongos <mongos>` out of a cluster automatically. 
:ref:`Progress Monitor <health-managers-progress-monitor>` ensures 
that |HM| checks do not become stuck or unresponsive.

.. _health-managers-active-fault:

Active Fault Duration
---------------------

When a failure is detected and the |HM| intensity level
is set to ``critical``, the |HM| waits the amount of time specified by 
:parameter:`activeFaultDurationSecs` before stopping and moving the 
:ref:`mongos <mongos>` out of the cluster automatically.
