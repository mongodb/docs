Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command (as ``root`` or with ``sudo``) to install
MongoDB Enterprise and associated tools:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongodb-enterprise

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB Enterprise!

.. _install-rhel-version-pinning-enterprise:

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use these packages to install specific releases of MongoDB
Enterprise.  To install a specific release, you must specify the
component packages individually and append the version number to
the package names, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongodb-enterprise-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-server-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-shell-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-mongos-2.6.1 mongodb-enterprise-tools-2.6.1

This will install the ``2.6.1`` release of MongoDB Enterprise. You can specify
any available version and package of MongoDB Enterprise; however ``yum`` 
**will** upgrade the packages when newer versions become available. Use the following *pinning* 
procedure to prevent unintended upgrades.

To pin the packages, add the following line to your ``/etc/yum.conf``
file:

.. code-block:: ini

   exclude=mongodb-enterprise,mongodb-enterprise-server,mongodb-enterprise-shell,mongodb-enterprise-mongos,mongodb-enterprise-tools

.. note::

   Previous versions of :term:`MongoDB` packages use different naming 
   conventions. See the :v2.4:`2.4 version of documentation for more
   information </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise>`.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-unix-data-and-log-dir.rst

Start the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongod start

You can verify that the :program:`mongod` process has started
successfully by checking the contents of the log file at
``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``.

You may optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system
reboot by issuing the following command (with root privileges:)

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo chkconfig mongod on

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongod stop

Restart MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restart the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following
command (as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongod restart

Follow the state of this process by watching the output in the
``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log`` file to watch for errors or important
messages from the server.
