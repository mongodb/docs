"Be careful when splitting data in a sharded collection to create new chunks."
" When you shard a collection that has existing data, MongoDB automatically "
"creates chunks to evenly distribute the collection. To split data "
"effectively in a sharded cluster you must consider the number of documents "
"in a chunk and the average document size to create a uniform chunk size. "
"When chunks have irregular sizes, shards may have an equal number of chunks "
"but have very different data sizes. Avoid creating splits that lead to a "
"collection with differently sized chunks."
