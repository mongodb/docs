In a migration project, you can apply table filters to control the 
volume of data migrated from each table. You can apply table filters 
when you configure the mapping rules from the relational schema model.

Table filters allow you to:

- Migrate your data in logical batches.
- Limit the read operations on your source database.
- Create test environments before migrating your entire database.

Migration jobs apply project-level table filters during the initial snapshot stage. During a continuous migration job, 
the CDC stage ignores table filters and updates all new or modified database objects. 
To learn more about types of migration jobs, see :ref:`rm-sync-jobs`. 

Table Filter Types
------------------

You can apply one filter per table. Each filter can have a SQL where 
clause, a row limit clause, or both.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Filter Component

     - Only the customers who have a last name of Smith.
     - ``WHERE LASTNAME = 'SMITH'``
   * - Row limit
     - Apply a SQL limit clause to the tables database query.
     - Only migrate the top 100 rows.
     - ``... LIMIT 100``
   * - Both
     - Apply a SQL where clause and a limit clause to the tables database query.
     - Only 100 rows for customers who have a last name of Smith.
