Remove Documents from a Collection
----------------------------------

By default, the :method:`db.collection.remove()` method removes all
documents that match the remove condition. You can specify a
``justOne`` option to remove only one matching documents even when
multiple documents match the remove condition.

To specify the remove condition, use the same structure and
:manual:`query operators </reference/operator/query>` as for query
conditions. See :doc:`/query` for an introduction to query conditions.

Drop Collection
---------------

The remove all operation only removes the documents from the
collection. The collection itself, as well as any indexes for the
collection, remain. To remove all documents from a collection, it may
be more efficient to drop the entire collection, including the indexes,
and then recreate the collection and rebuild the indexes.
