  .. alert:: Backup Agent has too many conf call failures

     Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

     Sends an alert when the cluster topology as known by monitoring does
     not match the backup configuration from conf calls made by the
     Backup Agent. |onprem| sends the alert after the number of attempts
     specified in the :setting:`maximumFailedConfCalls
     <mms.alerts.BackupAgentConfCallFailure.maximumFailedConfCalls>`
     setting.

   .. alert:: Backup could not be assigned to a backup daemon

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert if a backup job fails to bind to a Backup Daemon. A
      job might fail to bind if, for example:

      - No :term:`primary` is found for the backed-up replica set. At
        the time the binding occurred, the Monitoring Agent did not
        detect a primary. Ensure that the replica set is healthy.

      - Not enough space is available on any Backup Daemon.

      In both cases, resolve the issue and then :doc:`restart the initial
      sync of the backup </tutorial/enable-backup>`.

      As an alternative, you can manually bind jobs to daemons through the
      :guilabel:`Admin` interface. See :ref:`jobs-page` for more
      information.

   .. alert:: Backup has reached a high number of retries

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert if the same task fails repeatedly. This could happen,
      for example, during maintenance. :ref:`Check the corresponding job
      log <jobs-page>` for an error message explaining the problem.
      Contact MongoDB Support if you need help interpreting the error
      message.

   .. alert:: Backup is in an unexpected state

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert when something unexpected happened and the
      Backup state for the replica set is ``broken``. You must
      resync the backed-up replica set, as described in the 
      :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup` procedure.

      In case of a :alert:`Backup is in an unexpected state` alert,
      :ref:`check the corresponding job log <jobs-page>` for an
      error message explaining the problem. Contact MongoDB Support if you
      need help interpreting the error message.

   .. alert:: Replica set has a late snapshot

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert if a snapshot has failed to complete before the next
      snapshot is scheduled to begin. :ref:`Check the job log <jobs-page>`
      in the |mms| Admin interface for any obvious errors.

   .. alert:: Backup sync slice transfer has not progressed

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert when an :term:`initial sync` has
      started but then subsequently stalled. A number of issues can cause
      this, including:

      - processes that are down (agents, ingest, backing databases)
      - network issues
      - incorrect authentication credentials

   .. alert:: Backup job is too busy

      Available only as a :doc:`global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>`.

      Sends an alert when a backup job has taken longer than the time
      specified. This could occur if you have an overloaded Backup Daemon
      or blockstore. :ref:`Check the corresponding job log <jobs-page>`
      for error messages. Contact MongoDB Support if you need help
      interpreting the error message.
