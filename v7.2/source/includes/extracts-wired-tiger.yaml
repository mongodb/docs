   If the ``dbpath`` is on a single volume, filesystem snapshots are
   sufficient for the purpose of volume-level backup of WiredTiger. If
   you do use journaling, the journal **must** reside on the same volume
   as the data.

   - WiredTiger sets checkpoints for journal data at intervals of 60
     seconds or 2 GB of data, depending on which occurs first.

   - Because MongoDB uses a log file size limit of 100 MB, WiredTiger
     creates a new journal file approximately every 100 MB of data. When
     WiredTiger creates a new journal file, WiredTiger syncs the previous
     journal file.

   - If the write operation includes a :doc:`write concern
     </reference/write-concern>` of ``j:true``, WiredTiger forces a
     sync on commit of that operation as well as anything that has
     happened before.

   With WiredTiger, MongoDB utilizes both the WiredTiger internal cache
   and the filesystem cache.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-cache-default-setting.rst

   By default, WiredTiger uses Snappy block compression for all collections
   and prefix compression for all indexes. Compression defaults are configurable
   at a global level and can also be set on a per-collection and per-index
   basis during collection and index creation.

   Different representations are used for data in the WiredTiger internal cache
   versus the on-disk format:

   - Data in the filesystem cache is the same as the on-disk format, including
     benefits of any compression for data files. The filesystem cache is used
     by the operating system to reduce disk I/O.
   - Indexes loaded in the WiredTiger internal cache have a different data
     representation to the on-disk format, but can still take advantage of
     index prefix compression to reduce RAM usage. Index prefix compression
     deduplicates common prefixes from indexed fields.
   - Collection data in the WiredTiger internal cache is uncompressed
     and uses a different representation from the on-disk format. Block
     compression can provide significant on-disk storage savings, but
     data must be uncompressed to be manipulated by the server.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-filesystem-cache.rst

ref: wt-cache-default-setting
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 3.4, the default WiredTiger internal cache size is
   the larger of either:

   - 50% of (RAM - 1 GB), or

   - 256 MB.

   For example, on a system with a total of 4GB of RAM the
   WiredTiger cache uses 1.5GB of RAM (``0.5 * (4 GB - 1 GB) =
   1.5 GB``). Conversely, on a system with a total of 1.25 GB of
   RAM WiredTiger allocates 256 MB to the WiredTiger cache
   because that is more than half of the total RAM minus one
   gigabyte (``0.5 * (1.25 GB - 1 GB) = 128 MB < 256 MB``).
   
   .. note::

      In some instances, such as when running in a container, the database
      can have memory constraints that are lower than the total system
      memory. In such instances, this memory limit, rather than the total
      system memory, is used as the maximum RAM available.
   
      To see the memory limit, see :data:`hostInfo.system.memLimitMB`.

ref: wt-filesystem-cache
content: |
  With the filesystem cache, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory
  that is not used by the WiredTiger cache or by other processes.
---
ref: wt-snapshot-frequency
content: |

      Starting in version 3.6, MongoDB configures WiredTiger to create
      checkpoints (i.e. write the snapshot data to disk) at intervals
      of 60 seconds. In earlier versions, MongoDB sets checkpoints to
      occur in WiredTiger on user data at an interval of 60 seconds or
      when 2 GB of journal data has been written, whichever occurs
      first.

---
ref: wt-journal-frequency
content: |

   WiredTiger syncs the buffered journal records to disk upon any of
   the following conditions:

   - For replica set members (primary and secondary members),
   
     - If there are operations waiting for oplog entries. Operations
       that can wait for oplog entries include:
        
       - forward scanning queries against the oplog

       - read operations performed as part of :ref:`causally consistent
         sessions <causal-consistency>`

     - Additionally for secondary members, after every batch
       application of the oplog entries.

   - If a write operation includes or implies a write concern of
     :writeconcern:`j: true <j>`.
     
     .. note::

        Write concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` implies ``j: true`` if
        the :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` is true.

   - At every 100 milliseconds (See :setting:`storage.journal.commitIntervalMs`).

   - When WiredTiger creates a new journal file. Because MongoDB uses a
     journal file size limit of 100 MB, WiredTiger creates a new
     journal file approximately every 100 MB of data.
