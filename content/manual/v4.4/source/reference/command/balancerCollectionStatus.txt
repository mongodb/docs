Definition

.. dbcommand:: balancerCollectionStatus

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

   Returns a document that contains information about whether the
   chunks of a sharded collection are balanced (i.e. do not need to be
   moved) as of the time the command is run or need to be moved because
   of draining shards, zone violation or imbalance of chunks across
   shards.

   You can only issue the :dbcommand:`balancerCollectionStatus` against the
   ``admin`` database.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus`
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { balancerCollectionStatus: "<db>.<collection>" } )
   
   Specify the full namespace ("<db>.<collection>") of the sharded collection.
   
   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides a wrapper method
   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()`.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`enableSharding` privilege actions on :ref:`database
and/or collection <resource-specific-db-and-or-collection>` to run the
command. That is, a user must have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants
the following :ref:`privilege <privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { resource: { db: <database>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "enableSharding" ] }

The built-in :authrole:`clusterManager` role provides the appropriate
privileges.

Output Document
---------------

The following is an example of a document returned by the command:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "balancerCompliant" : false,
      "firstComplianceViolation" : "chunksImbalance",
      "ok" : 1,
      "operationTime" : Timestamp(1583192967, 16),
      "$clusterTime" : {
         "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1583192967, 16),
         "signature" : {
            "hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
            "keyId" : NumberLong(0)
         }
      }
   }
   

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``"balancerCompliant"``

     - A boolean that indicates whether the chunks do not need to be
       moved (``true``) or need to be moved (``false``).


   * - ``"firstComplianceViolation"``

     - A string that indicates the reason  chunks for this namespace need to be
       moved. The field is only available if ``"balancerCompliant"`` is
       ``false``.

       Possible values are:

       .. list-table::
          :header-rows: 1
          :widths: 25 75

          * - Value
            - Description

          * - ``"draining"``

            - A :ref:`remove shard operation
              <remove-shard-remove-chunks>` is in progress and MongoDB
              must drain chunks off the removed shard to other shard(s).

              .. note::

                 If the ``"firstComplianceViolation"`` returns
                 ``"draining"``, there may also be pending chunk
                 migration due to ``"zoneViolation"``.

          * - ``"zoneViolation"``

            - Chunks violate the :ref:`defined zone ranges
              <zone-sharding-balancer>` for a shard.

              .. note::

                 If the ``"firstComplianceViolation"`` responds with
                 ``"zoneViolation"``, there may also be pending chunk
                 migrations due to ``"chunksImbalance"``.

          * - ``"chunksImbalance"``
      
            - The difference in the number of chunks between the shard
              with the most chunks for the collection and the shard
              with the fewest chunks for the collection exceed the
              :ref:`migration threshold<sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

In addition to the command-specific return fields, the command also
returns the ``ok`` status field, the ``operationTime`` field, and the
``$clusterTime`` field for the operation. For details on these fields,
see :ref:`command-response`.

Example
-------

To check whether the chunks of a sharded collection ``test.contacts``
is currently in balance, connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance
and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { balancerCollectionStatus: "test.contacts" } )

If the chunks for the collection do not need to be moved, the command
returns an output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "balancerCompliant" : true,
      "ok" : 1,
      "operationTime" : Timestamp(1583193238, 1),
      "$clusterTime" : {
         "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1583193238, 1),
         "signature" : {
            "hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
            "keyId" : NumberLong(0)
         }
      }
   }
