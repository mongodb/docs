Install MongoDB Community Edition using ``.deb`` Packages
---------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on AWS, Azure, or GCP using Atlas, our
   fully-managed database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything
   from a free sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster.
   `Set up a free cluster now

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

.. container::

   Production Notes
      Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
      :doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

   ulimit Considerations
      .. include:: /includes/fact-installation-ulimit.rst

   .. |mongod-user| replace:: ``mongodb``
   .. |mongod-datadir| replace:: ``/var/lib/mongodb``

   Directories
      If you installed via the package manager, the data directory
      |mongod-datadir| and the log directory ``/var/log/mongodb`` are
      created during the installation.

      By default, MongoDB runs using the |mongod-user| user account. If
      you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you **must** also
      modify the permission to the data and log directories to give this
      user access to these directories.

   Configuration File
      The official MongoDB package includes a :ref:`configuration file
      <conf-file>` (:file:`/etc/mongod.conf`). These settings (such as the
      data directory and log directory specifications) take effect
      upon startup. That is, if you change the configuration file while
      the MongoDB instance is running, you must restart the instance for the
      changes to take effect.

.. important::

   The following instructions assume that you have downloaded the  
   official MongoDB ``mongodb-org`` packages, and not the unofficial  
   ``mongodb`` package provided by Ubuntu. 

.. include:: /includes/steps/run-mongodb-on-debian.rst


Uninstall MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-uninstall.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/uninstall-mongodb-on-debian.rst

.. seealso::

   The recommended procedure to install is through the package manager,
   as detailed on this page. However, if you choose to install by
   directly downloading the ``.tgz`` file, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-tarball`.
