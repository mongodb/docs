==================
Edit a Replica Set
==================

Overview
--------

MMS allows you to add members to a :term:`replica set` and modify a
member's properties.

Procedures
----------

Add a Replica Set Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have an existing server to which to deploy the new member. The
server can exist on your own system or on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You
can use MMS to provision new server on AWS, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/add-server`.

To add a member to an existing replica set, you increase the size of the
set, as described here:

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-replica-set-member.rst

Edit a Replica Set Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can edit the individual members of the replica set, designating the
:manual:`type of member </core/replica-set-members>` and priority level in
:manual:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-replica-set-member.rst
