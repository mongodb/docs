For easier scripting, you can specify configuration settings by using environment variables.

Precedence
----------

- When you run a command, any settings that you specified with    
  environment variables take precedence over the profile stored in the
  configuration file.

- When you run a command using the ``--projectId`` option, the command
  line option takes precedence over both the environment variable and
  the profile stored in the configuration file.

Supported Environment Variables
--------------------------------

The {+mcli+} supports the following environment variables:
