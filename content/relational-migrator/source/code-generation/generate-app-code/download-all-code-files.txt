Code Generation is a feature built into {+rel-mig+} that helps
automatically generate code files for your applications connected 
to MongoDB. This page details how to generate and download all code files into a zip file.

About this Task
---------------

Some templates also generate additional files which are not specific to 
a MongoDB collection. These files are called :guilabel:`Support files`.
Click the :guilabel:`Support files` check box to indicate if you would like 
these files included in your downloads.

Steps
-----

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Code Generation` screen, in the left :guilabel:`Generate code` pane.
#. Select a :guilabel:`Language`.
#. Select a :guilabel:`Template`.
#. (Optional) Enter a keyword in the :guilabel:`Filter` text box to 
   filter the MongoDB collections.
#. Select the MongoDB collections by clicking check box next to the collection name.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Download selected files` button. The selected files download into a zip file 
   to your :guilabel:`Downloads folder`. The zip file has a naming convention of ``PROJECTNAME-LANGUAGE-TEMPLATE``.
