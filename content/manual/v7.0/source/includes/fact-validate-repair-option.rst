*Optional*. A flag that determines whether the command performs a
repair.

- If ``true``, a repair is performed.

- If ``false``, no repair is performed.

The default is ``false``.

A repair can only be run on a standalone node.

The repair fixes these issues:

- If missing index entries are found, the missing keys are inserted into
  the index.

- If extra index entries are found, the extra keys are removed from the
  index.

- If :ref:`multikey <index-type-multikey>` documents are found for an
  index that is not a multikey index, the index is changed to a multikey
  index.

- If :ref:`multikey <index-type-multikey>` documents are found that are
  not specified by an index's multikey paths, the index's multikey paths
  are updated.

- If corrupt documents with invalid BSON data are found, the documents
  are removed.

for :binary:`~bin.mongod`
