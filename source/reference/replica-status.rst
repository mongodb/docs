Replica Status Reference
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` provides an overview of the
current status of a :term:`replica set`. Issue the following command against
the "``admin``" database, in the :program:`mongo` shell: ::

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { replSetGetStatus: 1 } )

The value specified (e.g "``1``" above,) does not impact the output of
the command. Data provided by this command derives from data included
in heartbeats sent to the current instance by other members of the
replica set: because of the frequency of heartbeats, these data can be
at most 2 seconds out of date.

TODO: not sure I'd commit to 2 seconds, as the timeout before heartbeat fails is ~20 seconds. So maybe "this data can be a few seconds out-of-date"?

.. note::

   The :program:`mongod` that you issue the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`
   command to needs to have replication enabled, and be a member of a
   replica set for this command to return successfully.

.. seealso:: The ":func:`rs.status()`" function in the
   :program:`mongo` shell provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command. Also consider the
   ":doc:`/replication`" documentation index for more information on
   replication.

Statuses
--------

.. status:: rs.status.set

   The ``set`` value is the name of the replica set, configured in the
   :setting:`replSet` setting.

TODO: might want to mention it's the same as the _id in rs.conf(), but no one's ever expressed confusion about that, so minor point.

.. status:: rs.status.date

   The value of the ``date`` field is an :term:`ISODate` of the
   current time, according to the current server. Compare this to the
   value of the :status:`members.lastHeartbeat` to find the
   operational lag between the current host and the other hosts in the
   set.

.. status:: rs.status.myState

   The value of the ``myState`` value reflect state of the current
   replica set member. An integer between ``0`` and ``9`` represents
   the state of the member. These integers map to states, as described
   in the following table:

TODO: an integer between 0 and 10, now.

   ==========  ==========================================================
   **Number**  **State**
   ----------  ----------------------------------------------------------
   0           Starting up, phase 1 (parsing configuration)
   1           Primary
   2           Secondary
   3           Recovering (initial syncing, post-rollback, stale members)
   4           Fatal error
   5           Starting up, phase 2 (forking threads)
   6           Unknown state (the set has never connected to the member.)
   7           Arbiter
   8           Down
   9           Rollback
   10          Removed
   ==========  ==========================================================

.. status:: rs.status.members

   The ``members`` field holds an array that contains a document for
   every member in the replica set. See the ":ref:`Member Statuses
   <repl-set-member-statuses>`" for an overview of the values included
   in these documents.

TODO: this is missing the syncedTo field, only present on secondaries (and recovering nodes) that shows who they're syncing from.

.. _repl-set-member-statuses:

Member Statuses
---------------

.. status:: members.name

   The ``name`` field holds the name of the server.

.. status:: members.self

   The ``self`` field is only included in the document for the
   current ``mongod`` instance in the members array. It's value is
   "``true``".

.. status:: members.errmsg

   This field contains the most recent error or status message received from
   the member. This field may be empty (e.g. ``""``) in some cases.

.. status:: members.health

   The ``health`` value is only present for the other members of the
   replica set (i.e. not the member that returns
   :func:`rs.status`.) This field conveys if the member is up
   (i.e. ``1``) or down (i.e. ``0``.)

.. status:: members.uptime

   The ``uptime`` field holds a value that reflects the number of
   seconds that this member has been online.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :func:`rs.status()` data.

.. status:: members.optime

   A document that contains information regarding the last operation
   from the operation log that this member has applied.

   .. status:: members.optime.t

      A 64-bit timestamp of the last operation applied to this member
      of the replica set from the :term:`oplog`.

TODO: 32-bit (t+i=64-bit)

   .. status:: members.optime.i

      An incremented field, which reflects the number of operations in
      since the last time stamp. This value only increases if there
      are more than one operation per second.

TODO: ...if there is more

.. status:: members[n].optimeDate

   An :term:`ISODate` formatted date string that reflects the last
   entry from the :term:`oplog` that this member applied. If this
   differs significantly from :status:`members.lastHeartbeat` this
   member is either experiencing "replication lag" *or* there have not
   been any new operations since the last update. Compare
   ``members.optimeDate`` between all of the members of the set.

.. status:: members.lastHeartbeat

   The ``lastHeartbeat`` value provides an :term:`ISODate` formatted
   date of the last heartbeat received from this member. Compare this
   value to the value of the :status:`date <rs.status.date>` field to track
   latency between these members.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :func:`rs.status()` data.

.. status:: members.pingMS

   The ``pingMS`` represents the number of milliseconds (ms) that a
   round-trip packet takes to travel between the remote member and the
   local instance.

   This value does not appear for the member that returns the
   :func:`rs.status()` data.
