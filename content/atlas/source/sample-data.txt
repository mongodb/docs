   |service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
   {+database-deployments+}. You can use this data to quickly get started
   experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
   :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

   For descriptions of each of the available datasets, see
   :ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
   information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

   You can also generate synthetic data that aligns to your real data's
   schema. To learn more, see :ref:`synthetic-data`.

   To import your own data, see :ref:`import-strategies`.

   Load Sample Data
   ----------------

   Required Access
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To load sample data, you must have 
   :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

   .. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/org-owners-add-project.rst

   Prerequisites
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
   an |service| {+database-deployment+} to load data into. To learn more, 
   see :ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

   Load Sample Data into Your Cluster
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can load sample data into your |service| {+database-deployment+} from the {+atlas-cli+} or the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>`. To load sample data into your local deployment, see :ref:`sample-dataset-local`.

   .. tip::

      You can use the local deployment steps to load data 
      into a MongoDB Community or Enterprise cluster.

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: atlas-ui

      .. tabs::
        
         .. tab:: Clusters View
            :tabid: clusters-view

            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from
            the :guilabel:`Clusters` view:
         
            .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-clusters.rst

         .. tab:: Collections View
            :tabid: collections-view

            .. important::
         
               You can load sample data through the
               :guilabel:`Collection View` only if you have 
               :guilabel:`Data Explorer` :ref:`enabled 
               <disable-data-explorer>` and you don't have 
               any data already in your collection.
         
            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from the :guilabel:`Collections View`:
      
            .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-de.rst  

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: atlas-cli
      
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-load.rst

      After you run the command to load sample data, you can use
      the following {+atlas-cli+} commands to monitor the status of the
      sample data load job:

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-describe-and-watch.rst

   .. _sample-dataset-local:

   Load Sample Data into Your Local Deployment
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To load sample data into your local deployment: 

   .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-local.rst

   .. _available-sample-datasets:

   Available Sample Datasets
   -------------------------

   The following table shows the sample datasets available for |service| 
   {+database-deployments+}. Click a sample dataset to learn more about it.

   For instructions on loading this sample data into your |service|
   {+database-deployment+}, see :ref:`load-sample-data`.

   Sample Data Namespaces
   ----------------------

   When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
   namespaces on your {+database-deployment+}:

   .. warning::

      If any of these namespaces already exist on your 
      {+database-deployment+} when you attempt to load the sample data, 
      the operation will fail and no sample data will be loaded into your 
      {+database-deployment+}.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

   data.

   MongoDB Charts Tutorials
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` tutorials guide you through
   visualizing sample data provided by |service|:

   :charts:`Visualizing Order Data </tutorial/order-data/order-data-tutorial-overview/>`
