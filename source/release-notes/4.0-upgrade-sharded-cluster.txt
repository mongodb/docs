Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure includes the command-line option
:option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>` or the configuration option
:setting:`net.bindIp` when restarting the replica set.

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, the options must be specified when the replica
set members are run on different hosts or if remote clients connect to
the deployment. Omit if all members are run on the same host and all
clients are local to the host.

Read Concern Majority (3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB enables support for
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern by default.

For MongoDB 4.0.3+ (and 3.6.1+), you can disable read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"` to prevent the storage cache pressure from
immobilizing a deployment with a three-member replica set with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded cluster with
a three-member PSA shards.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-disable-rc-majority.rst

   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` does not affect
   :ref:`multi-document transactions <transactions>`; i.e. you
   can specify read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` for transactions
   even if read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is disabled.

For more information, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Change Streams Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.0 introduces new hex-encoded string change stream
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.0.rst

.. important:: When upgrading from MongoDB 3.6 to MongoDB 4.0.7


   When upgrading from MongoDB 3.6 to MongoDB 4.0.7 or later, the
   upgraded sharded cluster members continue to produce ``v0`` token
   until the first :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is upgraded. If a
   client tries to resume change streams using the new ``v1`` resume
   token when connected to another :binary:`~bin.mongos` that has not
   been updated (i.e. only accepts BinData resume tokens), the resume
   operation will fail. In such cases, the client must wait for the
   upgrade to complete before resuming change streams.

   After upgrading, if you later decide to downgrade to MongoDB 3.6, to
   resume a change stream, clients can use a pre-upgrade resume token
   (if available) on the 3.6 deployment. Otherwise, clients will need
   to start a new change stream.
   
Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process
checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shards and config servers, ensure that no replica set member is in
:replstate:`ROLLBACK` or :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

Remove ``pv0`` for Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-pv0.rst

Remove Master-Slave Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-master-slave.rst

Remove Support for ``$isolated``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-isolated.rst

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| sharded cluster must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.6``. 

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.6``, connect to each
shard replica set member and each config server replica set member
and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Back up the ``config`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.
