   For new features in MongoDB 4.4, see :doc:`/release-notes/4.4`.

   <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

Welcome to the MongoDB |version| Manual! MongoDB is a 
document database designed for ease of development
and scaling. The Manual introduces key concepts in MongoDB, presents the
query language, and provides operational and administrative
considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference
section. The manual is also available as :hardlink:`HTML tar.gz
<manual.tar.gz>` and :hardlink:`EPUB <MongoDB-manual.epub>`.

MongoDB offers both a *Community* and an *Enterprise* version of the
database:

- MongoDB Community is the {+source-available+} edition of MongoDB.

- MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise
  Advanced subscription and includes comprehensive support for your
  MongoDB deployment. MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused
  features such as LDAP and Kerberos support, on-disk encryption, 
  and auditing.

MongoDB also offers
`Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__,
a hosted MongoDB Enterprise service option in the cloud which requires
no installation overhead and offers a free tier to get started.

The Manual documents both MongoDB Community and Enterprise features and
functionality.
