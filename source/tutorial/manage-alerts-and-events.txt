Overview
--------

The :guilabel:`Activity` page's :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab displays
your alert configurations. An alert configuration defines the conditions
that trigger an alert and the notifications to be sent. From this page you
can edit, clone, disable, or delete alert configurations.

.. I've edited the above to distinguish between alerts and alert
   configurations, per Mike Benoit's comments on pull 249 for ticket 2498.

Procedures
----------

Modify an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each alert configuration has a distribution list, a frequency for sending
the alert, and a waiting period after an alert state triggers before
sending the first alert.

By default, an alert configuration sends alerts at 60-minute intervals.
You can modify the interval. The minimum interval is 5 minutes.

.. START-COMMENT

   Per Mike Benoit 12/17/2013, mms-docs Pull 80: The reason for the 5 minute
   minimum is that our alert processing job only executes every five minutes.
   Thus, setting this lower than 5 minutes wouldn't have any impact. This also
   means that only multiples of 5 make sense for this value.

Delete an Alert

Disable or Re-enable an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you disable an alert, the alert configuration remains visible in a
*grayed out* state. MMS automatically cancels active
alerts related to a disabled alert configuration.
You can reactivate disabled alerts.

For example, if you have an alert configured for *Host Down* and you currently
have an active alert telling you a host is down, MMS automatically
cancels active *Host Down*  alerts if you disable the default
*Host Down* configuration. MMS will send no further alerts
of this type unless the disabled alert is re-enabled.

To disable or enable an alert:

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-disable-enable.rst

View Open Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view open alerts, select the :guilabel:`Activity` tab, and then select
the :guilabel:`All Activity` tab. Open alerts appear above the *Feed* section in an
*Open Alerts* section that only appears if there are open alerts. From this
window you can acknowledge an alert and select the duration of the
acknowledgment.

Once a user acknowledges an alert in the interface, MMS sends no
further notifications to the alert's distribution list until the
acknowledgement period has passed.

The distribution list receives *no* notification of alert
acknowledgment.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident management
service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty dashboard.
