Database References

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB does not support joins. In MongoDB some data is
"denormalized," or stored with related data in :term:`documents
<document>` to remove the need for joins. However, in some cases it
makes sense to store related information in separate documents,
typically in different collections or databases.

MongoDB applications use one of two methods for relating documents:

#. :ref:`Manual references <document-references>` where you save the
   ``_id`` field of one document in another document as a reference.
   Then your application can run a second query to return the embedded
   data. These references are simple and sufficient for most use
   cases.

#. :ref:`DBRefs <dbref>` are a reference from one document to another using an 	
   ObjectId and a collection and database specification for the target  
   document.  Using DBRefs requires two queries, both of which aren't done on
   the server side, but are something that some of the drivers can interpret.
   DBRefs are useful when you may be emending documents from multiple 
   collections, and many :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` automatically
   resolve documents embedded with DBRefs.

Unless you have a compelling reason for using DBrefs, use manual
references.

.. _document-references:

Manual References
-----------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Manual references refers to the practice of including one
:term:`document's <document>` ``_id`` field in another document. The
application can then issue a second query to resolve the referenced
fields as needed.

Process
~~~~~~~

Consider the following operation to insert two documents, using the
``_id`` field of the first document as a reference in the second
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   original_id = ObjectId()

   db.places.insert({
       "_id": original_id
       "name": "Broadway Center"
       "url": "bc.example.net"
   })

   db.people.insert({
       "name": "Erin"
       "places_id": original_id
       "url":  "bc.exmaple.net/Erin"
   })

Then, when a query returns the document from the ``people`` collection
you can, if needed, make a second query for the document referenced by
the ``places_id`` field in the ``places`` collection.

Use
~~~

For nearly every case in which you want to store a relationship between two
documents, use :ref:`manual references <document-references>`. The
references are simple to create and your application can resolve references
as needed.

The only limitation of manual linking is that these references do not
convey the database and collection name. If you have documents in a
single collection that relate to documents in more than one
collection, you may need to consider using :ref:`DBRefs <dbref>`.

.. _dbref:

DBRefs
------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

DBRefs are a convention for representing a :term:`document`, rather
than a specific reference "type." They include the name of the
collection, and in some cases the database, in addition to the
``ObjectId``. Some :term:`drivers <driver>` also have support for
automatic resolution of DBRef references.

Format
~~~~~~

DBRefs have the following fields:

.. describe:: $ref

   The ``$ref`` field holds the name of the collection where the
   referenced document resides.

.. describe:: $id

   The ``$id`` field contains the value of the ``_id`` field in the
   referenced document.

.. describe:: $db

   *Optional.*

   Contains the name of the database where the referenced document
   resides.

   Only some drivers support ``$db`` references.

Thus a DBRef document would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $ref : <value>, $id : <value>, $db : <value> }

.. note::

   The order of fields in the DBRef matter, and you must use the above
   sequence when creating a DBRef.

Support
~~~~~~~

**C++**
   The C++ driver contains no support for DBRefs. You can transverse
   references manually.

**C#**
   The C# driver provides access to DBRef objects with the
   :api:`MongoDBRef Class <csharp/current/html/46c356d3-ed06-a6f8-42fa-e0909ab64ce2.htm>`
   and supplies the :api:`FetchDBRef Method <csharp/current/html/1b0b8f48-ba98-1367-0a7d-6e01c8df436f.htm>`
   for accessing these objects.

**Java**
   The :api:`DBRef <java/current/com/mongodb/DBRef.html>` class
   provides supports for DBRefs from Java.

**JavaScrpt**
   The :program:`mongo` shell's :doc:`JavaScript </reference/javascript>`
   interface provides automatic resolution of DBRef objects.

**Perl**
   The Perl driver contains no support for DBRefs.  You can transverse
   references manually or use the `MongoDBx::AutoDeref
   <http://search.cpan.org/dist/MongoDBx-AutoDeref/>`_ CPAN module.

**Python**
   The Python driver supports automatic resolution of DBRef
   relationships, and provides the :api:`DBref class <python/current/api/bson/dbref.html>`,
   and the :api:`dereference method </python/current/api/pymongo/database.html#pymongo.database.Database.dereference>`
   for interacting with DBRefs.

**Ruby**
   The Ruby Driver supports DBRefs using the :api:`DBRef class </ruby/current/classes/XGen/Mongo/Driver/DBRef.html>`
   and the :api:`deference method <ruby/current/classes/XGen/Mongo/Driver/DB.html#M000236>`.

Use
~~~

In most cases you should use the :ref:`manual reference
<document-references>` method for connecting two or more related
documents. However, if you need to reference documents from multiple
collections, consider a DBRef.
