=================
Delete a Document
=================

You can delete a single document from a collection using the ``deleteOne()`` 
method on a ``MongoCollection`` object. The method accepts a query filter
that matches the document you want to delete. If you do not specify
a filter, MongoDB matches the first document in the collection. The 
``deleteOne()`` method only deletes the first document matched.

This method returns an instance of ``DeleteResult`` which contains information 
including how many documents were deleted as a result of the operation.

If your delete operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``deleteOne()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes a single document from the ``movies``
collection of the ``sample_mflix`` database. The example uses the ``eq()`` 
filter to match movies with the ``title`` exactly matching the text
``'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie'``.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/delete.snippet.delete-usage-example.kt
   :language: kotlin

When you run the example, if the query filter you passed in your call to
``deleteOne()`` matches a document and removes it, you should see output
that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Deleted document count: 1

If your query filter does not match a document in your collection,
your call to ``deleteOne()`` removes no documents and returns the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Deleted document count: 0
