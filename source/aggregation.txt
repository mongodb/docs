Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to perform
**aggregation operations**.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections and
return computed results. The MongoDB Aggregation framework, which is
part of the Query API, is modeled on the concept of data processing
pipelines. Documents enter a pipeline that contains one or more stages,
and this pipeline transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

An aggregation operation is similar to a car factory. A car factory has
an assembly line, which contains assembly stations with specialized
tools to do specific jobs, like drills and welders. Raw parts enter the
factory, and then the assembly line transforms and assembles them into a
finished product.

The **aggregation pipeline** is the assembly line, **aggregation stages** are the
assembly stations, and **operator expressions** are the
specialized tools.

Aggregation Versus Find Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use find operations to perform the following actions:

- Select which documents to return
- Select which fields to return
- Sort the results

You can use aggregation operations to perform the following actions:

- Perform find operations
- Rename fields
- Calculate fields
- Summarize data
- Group values

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Keep the following limitations in mind when using aggregation operations:

- Returned documents must not violate the
  :manual:`BSON document size limit </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`
  of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. You can exceed this
  limit by using the ``allowDiskUse`` keyword argument of the
  ``aggregate()`` method.

.. important:: $graphLookup exception

   The :manual:`$graphLookup
   </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` stage has a strict
   memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the ``allowDiskUse`` parameter.

Aggregation Example
-------------------

.. note::
  
  This example uses the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
  from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
  free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see :ref:`<pymongo-get-started>`.

To perform an aggregation, pass a list of aggregation stages to the
``collection.aggregate()`` method.

The following code example produces a count of the number of bakeries in each borough
of New York. To do so, it uses an aggregation pipeline with the following stages:

- A :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to filter for documents
  whose ``cuisine`` field contains the value ``"Bakery"``.

- A :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to group the matching
  documents by the ``borough`` field, accumulating a count of documents for each distinct
  value.

Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the
corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         # Define an aggregation pipeline with a match stage and a group stage
         pipeline = [
            { "$match": { "cuisine": "Bakery" } },
            { "$group": { "_id": "$borough", "count": { "$sum": 1 } } }
         ]

         # Execute the aggregation
         aggCursor = collection.aggregate(pipeline)

         # Print the aggregated results
         for document in aggCursor:
            print(document)

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         # Define an aggregation pipeline with a match stage and a group stage
         pipeline = [
            { "$match": { "cuisine": "Bakery" } },
            { "$group": { "_id": "$borough", "count": { "$sum": 1 } } }
         ]

         # Execute the aggregation
         aggCursor = await collection.aggregate(pipeline)

         # Print the aggregated results
         async for document in aggCursor:
            print(document)

The preceding code example produces output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   {'_id': 'Bronx', 'count': 71}
   {'_id': 'Brooklyn', 'count': 173}
   {'_id': 'Missing', 'count': 2}
   {'_id': 'Manhattan', 'count': 221}
   {'_id': 'Queens', 'count': 204}
   {'_id': 'Staten Island', 'count': 20}

Explain an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view information about how MongoDB executes your operation, you can
instruct MongoDB to **explain** it. When MongoDB explains an operation, it returns
**execution plans** and performance statistics. An execution
plan is a potential way MongoDB can complete an operation.
When you instruct MongoDB to explain an operation, it returns both the
plan MongoDB executed and any rejected execution plans.

To explain an aggregation operation, you can use either the
`PyMongoExplain <https://pypi.org/project/pymongoexplain/>`__ library or a database
command. Select the corresponding tab below to see an example of each method.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: PyMongoExplain
      :tabid: pymongoexplain

      Use pip to install the ``pymongoexplain`` library, as shown in the
      following example:

      .. code-block:: sh

         python3 -m pip install pymongoexplain

      The following code example runs the preceding aggregation example and prints the explanation
      returned by MongoDB: 
     
      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true
     
        .. input::
           :language: python
        
           # Define an aggregation pipeline with a match stage and a group stage
           pipeline = [
              { "$match": { "cuisine": "Bakery" } },
              { "$group": { "_id": "$borough", "count": { "$sum": 1 } } }
           ]

           # Execute the operation and print the explanation
           result = ExplainableCollection(collection).aggregate(pipeline)
           print(result)
     
        .. output::
           :language: javascript
           :visible: false

           ... 
           'winningPlan': {'queryPlan': {'stage': 'GROUP',
                                                 'planNodeId': 3,
                                                 'inputStage': {'stage': 'COLLSCAN',
                                                                'planNodeId': 1,
                                                                'filter': {'cuisine': {'$eq': 'Bakery'}},
                                                                'direction': 'forward'}},
                                                               ... 

   .. tab:: Database Command
      :tabid: db-command

      The following code example runs the preceding aggregation example and prints the explanation
      returned by MongoDB: 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: python

            # Define an aggregation pipeline with a match stage and a group stage
            pipeline = [
               { $match: { cuisine: "Bakery" } },
               { $group: { _id: "$borough", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
            ]

            # Execute the operation and print the explanation
            result = database.command("aggregate", "collection", pipeline=pipeline, explain=True)
            print(result)

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            ...
            'command': {'aggregate': 'collection',
              'pipeline': [{'$match': {'cuisine': 'Bakery'}},
                           {'$group': {'_id': '$borough',
                                       'count': {'$sum': 1}}}],
              'explain': True,
            ...

.. tip::

   You can use Python's ``pprint`` module to make explanation results easier to read:

   .. code-block:: python

      import pprint
      ...
      pprint.pp(result)

  aggregation type. This section also describes the example and desired
  outcome that the tutorial demonstrates.

- **Before You Get Started**, which describes the necessary databases,
  collections, and sample data that you must have before building the
  aggregation pipeline and performing the aggregation.

- **Tutorial**, which describes how to build and run the aggregation
  pipeline. This section describes each stage of the completed
  aggregation tutorial, and then explains how to run and interpret the
  output of the aggregation.

At the end of each aggregation tutorial, you can find a link to a fully
runnable Python code file that you can run in your environment.
