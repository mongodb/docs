         .. important:: Record your Credentials
   
            Ensure you record the following credentials:

            - **tenant id**
            - **client id**
            - **client secret**
   
            Unless you are running your client within an Azure Virtual
            Machine, you will need these credentials to construct your
            ``kmsProviders`` object later in this tutorial.
