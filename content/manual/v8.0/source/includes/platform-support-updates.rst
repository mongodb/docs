Starting in MongoDB 8.0, new MongoDB Server versions (major and minor)
support the minimum operating system (OS) minor version defined by the
OS vendor. After an OS minor version is no longer supported by the OS
vendor, MongoDB updates the MongoDB Server to support the next OS minor
version. For details, see `MongoDB Platform Support Improvements
<https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/announcing-mongodb-server-8-0-platform-support-improvements>`_.

MongoDB 8.0 supports the following minimum OS minor versions:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5
- Amazon Linux 2023 version 2023.3
