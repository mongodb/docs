.. dbcommand:: replSetResizeOplog

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   Use the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` administrative command to 
   change the size of a replica set member's oplog. [#oplog]_
   :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` enables you to resize the oplog 
   dynamically without restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. 

   You must run this command against the ``admin`` database.

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetResizeOplog: <boolean>, size: <num MB> }

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes the size parameter in
      megabytes while the oplog size is stored in bytes:

      - The minimum size you can specify is 990 megabytes.

      - The maximum size you can specify is 1 petabytes.

Behavior
--------

You can only use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` on 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running with the 
:ref:`Wired Tiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

In MongoDB versions 3.4 and earlier, the oplog was resized by dropping
and recreating the ``local.oplog.rs`` collection. In MongoDB versions
3.6 and later, use the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command to resize
the oplog as shown in the :ref:`tutorial-change-oplog-size` tutorial.
Starting in MongoDB 4.0, MongoDB forbids dropping the ``local.oplog.rs``
collection. For more information on this restriction, see
:ref:`oplog-coll-behavior`.

Changing the oplog size of a given replica set member with
:dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` does not change the oplog size of any
other member in the replica set. You must run
:dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` on each replica set member in your
cluster to change the oplog size for all members.

Reducing the oplog size does *not* reclaim that disk space
automatically. You must run :dbcommand:`compact` against the
``oplog.rs`` collection in the ``local`` database. ``compact``
blocks all operations on the database it runs against.
Running ``compact`` against ``oplog.rs`` therefore prevents oplog 
synchronization. For a procedure on resizing the oplog and compacting
``oplog.rs``, see :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.2.2

- For MongoDB 4.2.2 and later, :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes
  an exclusive (W) lock on the :data:`oplog <local.oplog.rs>`
  and blocks other operations on the collection until it finishes.

- For MongoDB 4.2.1 and earlier, :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` 
  takes a global exclusive (W) lock and blocks all other operations
  until it finishes.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

Example
--------

Use the :dbcommand:`stats` command to display the current oplog size,
``maxSize``. For example:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code
         
.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command will return the oplog size of this member:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "maxSize": NumberLong("9790804377")

``maxSize`` is currently 9790804377 bytes, or 9337 megabytes.

The following command changes the oplog size of this member to
17179869184 bytes, or 16384 megabytes.

To change the size, run the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`, passing
the desired size in megabytes as a parameter.

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({replSetResizeOplog:1, size: 16384})

To verify the new oplog size, rerun the :dbcommand:`stats` command:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "maxSize": NumberLong("17179869184")

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog in a node removes data from it. This
   may cause replica members syncing with that node to become stale.
   To resync those members, see :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.
