   |service| supports real-time performance metrics for
   ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` processes and replica
   set clusters. For sharded clusters, you can view 
   real-time peformance metrics for each shard replica set. You must 
   have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` |service| user 
   role to access the :guilabel:`Real Time` tab.
 
To view real-time peformance metrics for a specific |service| cluster 
in a :ref:`project <projects>`, click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button 
for that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster
to open the cluster overview, then
click :guilabel:`Real Time` to open the 
:doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel </real-time-performance-panel>`. 
Monitoring metrics in real-time allows you to respond to time-critical 
issues right away.

metrics, see :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel
