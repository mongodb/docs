You can deploy |text-search| and |vector-search| in your |k8s| cluster
to build powerful search experiences directly within your applications.
Using |text-search| and |vector-search|, you can build both traditional
text search and AI-powered vector search capabilities that automatically
sync with an on-premises MongoDB database. This eliminates the need to
maintain separate systems in sync while providing advanced search
features. To learn more, see: 

- :ref:`atlas-search`
- :ref:`avs-overview`

To enable the search capabilities such as full-text and semantic search
in on-prem deployments, you must deploy the |text-search| and
|vector-search| process (``mongot``) and connect it with your MongoDB
database deployment (``mongod``). Deployment of ``mongot`` is optional
and is needed only if you plan to leverage the search features it offers.

The MongoDB Database processes (``mongod``) acts as the proxy for all
search queries for ``mongot``. The ``mongod`` forwards the query to
``mongot``, which processes the query. The ``mongot`` returns the query
results to the ``mongod``, which then forwards the results to you. You
never interact directly with the ``mongot``. 

Each ``mongot`` process has its own persistent volume that is not shared
with the database or other search nodes. Storage is used to maintain
indexes that are built from the data continuously sourced from the
database. The index definitions (metadata) are stored in the database
itself.

The ``mongot`` performs the following actions: 

- Manages the index. 
  
  The ``mongot`` is responsible for updating the index definitions in
  the database. 
  
- Sources the data from the database. 
  
  The ``mongot`` nodes establish permanent connections to the database
  in order to update indexes from the database in real time. 

- Processes search queries. 
  
  When ``mongod`` receives a :pipeline:`$search`,
  :pipeline:`$searchMeta`, or :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` query, it
  directs the query to one of the ``mongot`` nodes. The ``mongot`` that
  receives the query processes the query, aggregates the data, and
  returns the results to ``mongod``, which it forwards to the user. 

The ``mongot`` components are tightly coupled with a single MongoDB
replica set and cannot be shared across multiple databases or replica
sets. That means a replica set deployment has its own dedicated search
nodes. 

Network connectivity between ``mongot`` and ``mongod`` goes in both
directions: 

- ``mongot`` establishes connection to the replica set to source the data
  used to build indexes and run queries.
- ``mongod`` connects to ``mongot`` to forward search related operations
  such as index management and querying the data.

|text-search| and |vector-search| Deployment 
--------------------------------------------

There are not many differences between the search deployment
architecture with or without the |k8s-op-short|. The |k8s-op-short|
simplifies the steps required to deploy fully functioning search nodes,
especially when the database is also managed by the |k8s-op-short|.

To deploy, you apply the ``MongoDBSearch`` Custom Resource (CR), which
the |k8s-op-short| picks up and starts deploying ``mongot`` pods and
requests persistent storage specified in the ``spec``. The |text-search|
and |vector-search| deployed using the |k8s-op-short| can target MongoDB
replica set deployed by the |k8s-op-short| inside the same |k8s| cluster
or a completely independent external MongoDB database. To learn how to
deploy and configure ``mongot`` to use: 

- A MongoDB replica set in |k8s|, see :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-install-enterprise`
- An external MongoDB replica set, see
  :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-install-external-enterprise`. 

Pre-Requisites 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to leverage |text-search| and |vector-search| in your MongoDB
Enterprise deployment, you must have the following:

- Fully functional MongoDB 8.0.10+ replica set deployed in one of the
  following ways:  

  - Inside a |k8s| cluster using the |k8s-op-short|
  - Outside a |k8s| cluster

- |com| Instance

Configuration Tasks  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the configuration tasks that the
|k8s-op-short| automatically performs and the actions that you must
take to successfully deploy |text-search| and |vector-search| in |k8s|
and connect to a MongoDB replica set in |k8s| or an external MongoDB
replica set.

   When both the ``mongot`` and ``mongod`` processes are deployed inside
   the |k8s| cluster, the |k8s-op-short| performs configuration for both 
   processes automatically. Specifically, the |k8s-op-short| performs the 
   following operations: 

   1. Finds the MongoDB :abbr:`CR (Custom Resource)` referenced by
      ``MongoDBSearch`` using ``spec.source.mongodbResourceRef``, or by
      a naming convention by looking for MongoDB :abbr:`CR (Custom
      Resource)` with the same name as ``MongoDBSearch``.

   #. Generates ``mongot`` configuration in a |yaml| file and saves it
      to a config map named ``<MongoDBSearch.metadata.name>-search-config``.
     
      The Config map is mounted by the search pods and the |yaml| configuration
      is used by ``mongot``\'s process on startup. The generated |yaml|
      contains all the information about how to connect to the replica set, TLS
      settings, and so on.
     
   #. Deploys |text-search| and |vector-search| stateful set named
      ``<MongoDBSearch.metadata.name>-search`` with storage and resource
      requirements configured according to the ``spec.persistence``
      and ``spec.resourceRequirements`` settings in the :abbr:`CR
      (Custom Resource)`.

   #. Updates configuration of every ``mongod`` process by adding the
      necessary ``setParameter`` options, including the hostnames and port
      numbers of the mongot hosts.
      necessary ``setParameter`` options, including the hostnames and port
      numbers of the MongoDB replica set members.

   #. For MongoDB version prior to v8.2, creates the ``searchCoordinator``
      custom role with all the necessary permissions that the ``mongot``
      process requires. Starting in MongoDB 8.2, the
      ``searchCoordinator`` is a built-in role.

   You must perform the following actions: 

   1. Create a user in the replica set using a ``MongoDBUser`` custom
      resource. The ``mongot`` uses the credentials of this user to
      connect to the replica set to source the data:

      - The user name is arbitrary (in the examples, we use
        ``search-sync-source-user``), but it must have the
        ``searchCoordinator`` role set.  
      - The username and password of this user is passed in
        ``MongoDBSearch.spec.source.username`` and
        ``MongoDBSearch.spec.source.passwordSecretRef`` respectively. 
        
        The password secret can refer to the same secret containing
        user password that was used to create ``MongoDBUser`` spec (in
        ``MongoDBUser.spec.source.passwordSecretKeyRef``). 

   #. Configure and apply the ``MongoDBSearch`` custom resource.

   ``mongot`` process, see :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-settings`.

   In order to leverage |text-search| and |vector-search| when you have
   your MongoDB deployment outside of |k8s|, you deploy ``mongot`` using
   the |k8s-op-short| and you must perform some steps manually. The
   |k8s-op-short| handles configuration of the search pods. However,
   when the MongoDB replica set is outside of |k8s|, you must
   reconfigure your MongoDB nodes and the networking. 
   
   You are responsible for the following manual configurations:
   
   External MongoDB Configuration
   ``````````````````````````````

   1. Configure the following parameter using ``setParameter`` on every
      ``mongod`` process in your external replica set. When configuring,
      replace ``<search-service-hostname>:27027`` with the actual
      resolvable hostname and port of your ``MongoDBSearch`` service. 

      .. code-block:: javascript

         setParameter:
           mongotHost: "<search-service-hostname>:27027"
           searchIndexManagementHostAndPort: "<search-service-hostname>:27027"
           skipAuthenticationToSearchIndexManagementServer: false
           searchTLSMode: "disabled"  # or "requireTLS" for TLS deployments

   #. (Only for MongoDB version lesser than (``<``) 8.2) :ref:`Create
      <k8s-search-create-role-user>` the ``searchCoordinator`` custom role
      with all the necessary permissions. 
      
      From MongoDB 8.2+, ``searchCoordinator`` is a built-in role and so, you
      can skip this step. 

   #. Create a user in the external replica set for the search
      synchronization process. This user must have the ``searchCoordinator``
      role. 

      .. code-block:: yaml 

         - userName: "search-sync-source" 
           password: "<your-search-sync-password>" 
           database: "admin" 
           roles: 
             - role: "searchCoordinator" 
               db: "admin"

   |k8s| Configuration 
   ```````````````````

   2. Configure and apply the ``MongoDBSearch`` :abbr:`CR (Custom
      Resource)` with ``spec.source.external`` pointing to your external
      MongoDB hosts.  
   #. Create a |k8s| secret for the search synchronization user's password.

      .. code-block:: yaml 

         apiVersion: v1
         kind: Secret
         metadata:
           name: search-sync-source-password
         stringData:
           password: "your-search-sync-password"

   #. Create a keyfile secret containing the same keys specified in the
      keyfile used by your external MongoDB replica set.  

   #. Configure networking and DNS to ensure bi-directional connectivity
      between your external MongoDB and the search pods. Your external
      MongoDB environment must be able to resolve your search service
      hostname (``<search-service-hostname>``). 

   To learn more about the :abbr:`CR (Custom Resource)` settings for the
   ``mongot`` process to connect to an external ``mongod`` process, see
   :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-settings`. 

Security 
--------

The following image illustrates the security configuration for the
``mongot`` process. If the MongoDB server is inside of the |k8s|
cluster, the |k8s-op-short| automatically sets up keyfile authentication
for |text-search| and |vector-search|. If the MongoDB server is
external, you must create a |k8s| Secret containing the replica set's
keyfile credential and reference it in the ``MongoDBSearch`` :abbr:`CR
(Custom Resource)`. 

.. figure:: /images/search-security.png
   :alt: Diagram showing the keyfile authentication and TLS configuration for search.
   :figwidth: 600px
   :lightbox:

Authentication 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to ``mongod``, ``mongot`` authenticates itself as a
database user. When deploying |text-search| and |vector-search|, you
must create the database user. You must pass the user credentials stored
in a |k8s| Secret to ``mongot`` by populating the
``spec.source.username`` and ``spec.source.passwordSecretRef`` fields
in the ``MongoDBSearch`` :abbr:`CR (Custom Resource)`.  

When accepting a connection from ``mongod``, the ``mongot``
authenticates the remote request using internal authentication with
keyfiles, similar to the MongoDB replica set member internal
authentication. When configured to index a MongoDB resource on the same
|k8s| cluster, the |k8s-op-short| automatically sets up keyfile
authentication for ``MongoDBSearch``. If the MongoDB replica set is
deployed outside |k8s|, you must create a |k8s| Secret containing the
replica set's keyfile credential and reference it in the
``MongoDBSearch.spec.source.external.keyfileSecretRef`` field. 

Transport Layer Security  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MongoDBSearch`` can protect data and credentials in transit using TLS. 
For index management commands and search queries, specify (even an empty
object, ``{}``) ``spec.security.tls`` field and provide a |tls|
certificate in a |k8s| Secret in the
``spec.security.tls.certificateKeySecretRef`` field. This |tls| 
certificate must be issued and signed by the same CA that issued the CA 
certificate that the MongoDB replica set uses.

When both ``MongoDBSearch`` and ``MongoDB`` are deployed by the
|k8s-op-short|, the underlying ``mongot`` and ``mongod`` configuration
is largely handled by the |k8s-op-short| itself. When the MongoDB
replica set is deployed outside of |k8s|, the
``.spec.source.external.tls`` field must be populated with a |k8s|
Secret containing the same CA certificate ``mongod`` is configured with,
and ``mongod`` configuration itself must have the ``searchTLSMode``
parameter set to ``requireTLS``.
