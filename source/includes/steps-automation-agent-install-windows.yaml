       host to a server pool)

       .. include:: /includes/fact-server-pools-deprecated.rst

  a. After the MSI downloads, double-click
     :file:`mongodb-mms-automation-agent-<version>.windows_x86_64.msi`

  #. If a security warning appears, click :guilabel:`Run`.

  #. At the :guilabel:`Configuration/Log Folder` step, provide the
     directory into which these files are saved.

  .. cond:: onprem

     #. At the :guilabel:`Key Type` step, select either:

        - :guilabel:`Agent API Key` to bind to a specific
          :term:`project` or
        - :guilabel:`Server Pool Key` to add the host to a :term:`server
          pool`.

  .. cond:: cloud

     #. At the :guilabel:`Key Type` step, select
        :guilabel:`Agent API Key` to bind to a specific
        :term:`project`.

  #. Enter the appropriate agent keys.

     .. note::
        These keys are provided in the :guilabel:`Automation Agent
        Installation Instructions` modal box described in the previous
        step.

     .. only:: onprem

        If you selected :guilabel:`Agent API Key`:
          Type the :guilabel:`Base URL`, :guilabel:`Project ID`, and
          :guilabel:`Agent API Key`.

        If you selected :guilabel:`Server Pool Key`:
          Type the :guilabel:`Base URL`, :guilabel:`Project ID`, and
          the :guilabel:`Server Pool Key`.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/server-pool-key-location.rst

     .. only:: cloud

        If you selected :guilabel:`Agent API Key`:

        If you selected :guilabel:`Server Pool Key`:
          Type the :guilabel:`Project ID` and the :guilabel:`Server Pool
          Key`.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/server-pool-key-location.rst

  #. Specify the Log and Backup directories at the :guilabel:`Automation
     Paths` step.

  #. At the :guilabel:`Windows Firewall Configuration` step, click your
     preferred firewall configuration.

     If you click :guilabel:`Configure firewall rules allowing access
     from only the specified IP addresses.`, type the necessary IP
     addresses into the provided box.

  #. (Conditional) Windows enables `Stealth Mode <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd448557(v=ws.10).aspx>`__
     for the Windows Firewall by default. If you have not disabled it on
     the MongoDB host on which you are installing the Automation Agent,
     you are asked to disable it. Stealth Mode significantly degrades
     the performance and capability of the :term:`Automation Agent`.
     Click :guilabel:`Disable Stealth Mode`.

  #. (Conditional) Windows does not enable `Disk Performance Counters <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2012/03/16/windows-performance-monitor-disk-counters-explained/>`__
     by default. If you had not enabled Disk Performance Counters for
     the MongoDB host, click :guilabel:`Enable Disk Performance
     Counters`. The :term:`Automation Agent` uses these counters for
     some of its hardware monitoring activities.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Install`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Finish` once setup is complete.

  The :term:`Automation Agent` starts automatically after installation.

title: "(Optional) Change the location of the Automation Agent binaries and configuration backup files."
stepnum: 6
ref: change-binary-directory
pre: |

   By default, the MongoDB binaries and |mms|
   configuration backup file are located in
   ``%SystemDrive%\MMSAutomation\versions``.

   .. note::
      Windows sets the ``%SystemDrive%`` environment variable to the
      drive on which you installed Windows. By default, you would be
      directed to install Windows on the ``C:`` drive. To find your
      ``%SystemDrive%``, issue with following command from `PowerShell
      <https://msdn.microsoft.com /en-us/powershell/>`__:

      .. code-block:: ps1

         get-childitem env:SystemDrive

   If you want to store these files in a different directory, follow
   these procedures:

action:
  - heading: "To change the location of the Automation Agent Binaries:"
    pre: |

      a. Click :guilabel:`Deployment`; :guilabel:`Agents`; and then
         :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings`.

      #. Below the :guilabel:`Download Directory` heading, click the
         pencil icon to the right of the path shown in
         :guilabel:`Download Directory (Windows)`.

      #. Change the path to the new path you want.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      #. Create the new directory you specified on each host that runs
         an Automation Agent. Use Windows Explorer to move the file or
         issue the following command from a Command Prompt or
         `PowerShell <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/>`__:

         .. code-block:: ps1

              md \<newPath>

         .. important::
            Make sure the system user that runs the Automation Agent can
            write to this new directory. This is usually the ``SYSTEM``
            user, which requires no additional configuration unless you
            changed the user.

  - heading: "To change the location of the Automation Agent configuration backup:"
    pre: |

      a. Open the :ref:`Automation Agent configuration file
         <automation-agent-config-file-location>` in your preferred text
         editor.

      #. Change the :asetting:`mmsConfigBackup` setting to the new path
         for the configuration backup file. Replace ``X`` with the drive
         letter on which your backup is stored.

         .. code-block:: ini
            :class: copyable-code

            mmsConfigBackup=X:\<newPath>\mms-cluster-config-backup.json

      #. Save the :term:`Automation Agent` configuration file.

      #. Move the configuration backup file to the new directory. Use
         Windows Explorer to move the file or issue the following
         command from a Command Prompt or `PowerShell <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/>`__:

         .. code-block:: ps1
            :class: copyable-code
