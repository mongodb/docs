Deploy an |onprem| Resource
===========================

You can deploy |onprem| in a container with the |k8s-op-short|.

Considerations
--------------

When you configure your |onprem| deployment, you must choose whether to run connections over |http| or |https|.

The following |http| procedure: 

- Doesn't encrypt connections to/from the |onprem| application.
- Doesn't encrypt connections between the
  application database's replica set members.
- Has fewer setup requirements.

The following |https| procedure:
 
- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections to/from the |onprem|
  application.
- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between the application
  database's replica set members.
- Requires valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

When running over |https|, |onprem| runs on port ``8443`` by
default.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want to encrypt
your |onprem| and application database connections with |tls|.
