     * - Notification Method

       - Description

     * - User

       - Sends the alert by email or SMS to a specified |mms| user. If you
         select :guilabel:`SMS`, |mms| sends the text message to the number
         configured on the user's :ref:`Account page <profile-page>`.

     * - Email

       - Sends the alert to a specified email address.

     * - SMS

       - Sends the alert to a specified mobile number. |mms| removes all
         punctuation and letters and uses only the digits.

         If you are outside of the United States or Canada, include '011'
         and the country code. For example, for New Zealand enter '01164'
         before your phone number. As an alternative, use a Google Voice
         number. |mms| uses the U.S.-based `Twilio
         <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send SMS messages.

     * - HipChat

       - Sends the alert to a HipChat room message stream. Enter the HipChat
         room name and API token.

     * - PagerDuty

       - Enter only the service key. Define escalation rules and alert
         assignments in `PagerDuty
         <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_.

     * - Administrators

       - Sends the alert to the email address specified in the
         :setting:`mms.adminEmailAddr` setting in the
         :ref:`conf-mms.properties` configuration file.
