|service| provides multiple connection strings. These strings allow
you to connect to your clusters from both public and private contexts.

.. _atlas-faq-multi-conn-strings:

Why does my cluster have multiple connection strings?
-----------------------------------------------------

To connect to |service|, point your applications to a |uri| to
communicate with a cluster. |service| creates clusters with more than
one node or host. Each node has its own hostname that resolves to an IP
address. The |uri|, known as a *connection string*, to which |service|
connects might have more than one hostname. Configure |service| to
accept connections to the cluster hosts from allowed IP addresses.

|service| secures connections from public IP address through
authentication and |tls|. If you want to connect to private IP
addresses, you can use:

- :doc:`AWS and GCP VPC Peering </security-vpc-peering>`
- :doc:`Azure VNet Peering </security-vpc-peering>`
- :ref:`AWS PrivateLink and Azure Private Link <private-endpoint-connection-strings>`

These features all manage communication over internal IP addresses
within secure networks.

|service| provides more than one connection string when using secure
networks. Each network offers a string that resolves to different IP
addresses.

All clusters have a
:ref:`standard connection string <connstring-standard>`. This resolves
to the cluster's:

- Public IP addresses for Internet connections and
- |vpc| private IP addresses for |aws| clusters when resolved from a
  peered |vpc|.

Use this string for applications connecting over the Internet or
connecting to peered clusters in |aws|.

Clusters with peered networks have a
:ref:`Private IP for Peering connection string <connstring-private>`.
This string resolves to IP addresses available to:

- Peered networks in |azure| or |gcp|
- |aws| peered clusters with a custom |dns| service.

Use this connection string with applications connecting:

- Within an |azure| or |gcp| peered network
- To |aws| clusters when using |aws| with custom |dns| service.

|aws| or |azure| clusters in regions with :ref:`private endpoints
<private-endpoint-connection-strings>` configured have one or more
connection strings. Each string resolves to the private IP address of a
network interface in your |vpc| or VNet that connects directly to a load
balancer in the |service| |vpc| or VNet. Use these connection strings
with applications connecting with private endpoints.

.. _atlas-faq-azure-gcp-peering-only:

What does this mean for |gcp| or |azure| clusters in peering-only mode?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before 31 March 2020, you were required to enable peering-only mode to
connect to databases on peer networked |azure| or |gcp| clusters. This
mode:

- Affected global |dns| resolution and
- Limited any database connections outside the peered network.

Multiple horizons lifts these restrictions and unlocks additional
features. In projects running MongoDB 3.6 or later clusters, you can
use:

- :realm:`{+MongoDB-Realm+} </>`
- :charts:`Charts </>`
- :doc:`Live Migration </import>`

To leverage multiple horizons:

- Make sure your clusters use MongoDB 3.6 or later,
- Update your application's existing connection strings to use
  :ref:`Private IP for Peering connection strings <connstring-private>`,
- :ref:`Disable Peering-Only mode <disable-peering-mode>`,
  and
- Connect using the strings outlined in :ref:`atlas-faq-multi-conn-strings`.

.. note::

   You *can* keep connecting to your clusters using existing
   peering-enabled connection strings at this time. Peering-Only mode
   prevents access to the improved functionality and reduced
   limitations of multiple horizons. To use the new features and remove
   the legacy limitations, MongoDB requires that you use the new
   connection strings.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Upgrade to MongoDB 4.0 or later </tutorial/major-version-change>`

.. _atlas-faq-azure-span-regions:

Can my VNet-peered |azure| cluster span multiple regions?
---------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

Change your applications to connect using the
:ref:`Private IP for Peering connection string <connstring-private>`.
This change allows your applications to connect from peered networks
using the UI or API.

To expand into more regions, disable Peering-Only mode on existing
|azure| clusters first.

:ref:`Private IP for Peering connection strings <connstring-private>`
work with MongoDB 3.6 or later clusters.

.. _disable-peering-mode:
.. _atlas-faq-disable-peering-mode:

How do I disable peering-only mode?
-----------------------------------

To disable Peering-Only mode using the:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas Console
      :tabid: console

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disable-private-ip-mode-console.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas API
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disable-private-ip-mode-api.rst

.. _faq-custom-dns:
.. _atlas-faq-custom-dns:

How does this affect |aws| |vpc| peering when I use custom |dns|?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Before 31 March 2020, applications deployed within |aws| using custom
|dns| services and |vpc|\-peered with |service| couldn't connect over
private IP addresses:

- Custom |dns| resolved to public IP addresses.
- |aws| internal |dns| resolved to private IP addresses.

Applications deployed with custom |dns| services in |aws| should use
:ref:`Private IP for Peering connection strings <connstring-private>`.
To show these strings:

1. Toggle the :guilabel:`Using Custom DNS on AWS with VPC Peering` on
   ``On`` from the :guilabel:`Project Settings` menu.
2. View the :guilabel:`connect` modal for your |aws| Cluster.
3. Select the :guilabel:`Private IP for Peering` connection string.

.. _atlas-faq-id-connstrings:

How do I identify which connection string my application uses?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The structure of the connection string's |uri| indicates the string's
type. If you have created a peering connection or private endpoint,
|service| displays more than one of these options for your use.

.. _connstring-standard:
.. _atlas-faq-connstring-standard:

Standard Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standard connection strings follow this format:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://xyz456-shard-00-00.ab123.mongodb.net:27017
   mongodb+srv://xyz456.ab123.mongodb.net

The dot before ``ab123`` *matters*. |uri|\s using this format resolve
to public IP addresses *except* when connecting from inside |aws| with
|vpc|\-peering configured.

.. important::

   This format changes one character from the
   :ref:`Legacy Connection Strings <connstring-legacy>`: a hyphen
   (``-``) after the cluster name becomes a period (``.``).

   .. example::

      This *legacy connection string*:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongodb+srv://xyx456-ab123.mongodb.net

      is written as this *standard connection string*:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongodb+srv://xyx456.ab123.mongodb.net

   For new clusters, replica sets and shards don't derive their name
   from the name of the cluster. The new names use a six alphanumeric
   character ID.

.. _connstring-private:
.. _atlas-faq-connstring-private:

Private Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Private connection strings follow this format:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://xyx456-shard-00-00-pri.ab123.mongodb.net:27017
   mongodb+srv://xyx456-pri.ab123.mongodb.net

The ``-pri`` before ``ab123`` *matters*. |uri|\s using this format
resolve to private IP addresses reachable within the peered network.

.. important::

  In new clusters, replica sets and shards don't derive their name
  from the name of the cluster. The new names use a six
  alphanumeric character ID.

.. _connstring-privatelink:
.. _atlas-faq-connstring-privatelink:

|aws| Privatelink Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`AWS PrivateLink <private-endpoint-connection-strings>`
connection strings follow this format:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://pl-0-us-east-1a.ab123.mongodb.net:1024
   mongodb+srv://pl-0-us-east-1a.ab123.mongodb.net

|uri|\s using this format can be reachable via the |aws| |vpc| where
someone configured PrivateLink, though access can be transitive from
other |vpc|\s peered in turn.

|azure| Private Link Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Azure Private Link <private-endpoint-connection-strings>`
connection strings follow this format:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   mongodb://pl-0-eastus2.ab123.azure.mongodb.net:1024
   mongodb+srv://pl-0-eastus2.ab123.azure.mongodb.net

|uri|\s using this format can be reachable via the |azure| VNet where
someone configured PrivateL ink, though access can be transitive from
other VNets peered in turn.

.. _connstring-legacy:
.. _atlas-faq-connstring-legacy:

Legacy Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before 31 March 2020, you wrote |service| connection strings as
follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - |aws|
     -
       .. code-block:: sh
          :copyable: false

          foo-shard-00-00-ab123.mongodb.net
          foo-ab123.mongodb.net

   * - |azure|
     -
       .. code-block:: sh
          :copyable: false

          foo-shard-00-00-ab123.azure.mongodb.net
          foo-ab123.azure.mongodb.net

   * - |gcp|
     -
       .. code-block:: sh
          :copyable: false

          foo-shard-00-00-ab123.gcp.mongodb.net
          foo-ab123.gcp.mongodb.net

If you enabled **Private Only** mode, these hostnames resolve to peered
network IP addresses. If you disabled that mode, hostnames resolve to
public IP addresses.

If your application uses a legacy connection string in **Peering Only**
mode, switch to
:ref:`Private IP for Peering connection strings <connstring-private>`.

.. _atlas-faq-migrate-providers:

Do I have to update my connection string when migrating to a different cloud provider?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It depends on:

- which cloud provider your current cluster uses and
- when you created the cluster.

GCP or Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your cluster runs on |gcp| or |azure| and was created before
multi-cloud clusters were available:

1. Open the cluster builder.

#. Edit the cluster.

#. Add read-only nodes from your target cloud provider.

#. Review and submit the changes.

#. Copy the resulting comma-delimited |uri| connection string.

#. Replace the connection string in your application with this new
   :ref:`standard connection string <atlas-faq-connstring-standard>`.

   This allows your application to connect to nodes from multiple cloud
   providers.

   .. note::
      |service| doesn't support SRV connection strings for multi-cloud clusters at this time.

#. Restart your application.

#. Make sure that your application can connect to |service|.

#. After the first change completes, reconfigure your cluster:

   - Remove all electable nodes using the original cloud provider.
   - Remove the read-only nodes for the target cloud provider.
   - Add the same number of electable nodes using the target cloud
     provider.

#. Review and submit the changes.

#. Copy the resulting comma-delimited |uri| connection string.

#. Replace the |uri| connection string in your application with this
   new |uri| connection string.

#. Restart your application.

#. Make sure that your application can connect to |service|.

AWS
~~~


If your cluster runs on |aws| or was created after October 2020:

1. Open the cluster builder.

#. Edit the cluster.

#. Change the cloud provider.

#. Review and submit the changes.
