.. method:: Bulk()

   Bulk operations builder used to construct a list of write operations
   to perform in bulk for a single collection. To instantiate the
   builder, use either the
   :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()` or the
   :method:`db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()` method.

Ordered and Unordered Bulk Operations
-------------------------------------

The builder can construct the list of operations as *ordered* or
*unordered*.

Ordered Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With an *ordered* operations list, MongoDB executes the write
operations in the list serially. If an error occurs during the
processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will return without
processing any remaining write operations in the list.

Use :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()` to create a
builder for an ordered list of write commands.

Unordered Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With an *unordered* operations list, MongoDB can execute in parallel,
as well as in a nondeterministic order, the write operations in the
list. If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write
operations, MongoDB will continue to process remaining write operations
in the list.

Use :method:`db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()` to create a
builder for an unordered list of write commands.
