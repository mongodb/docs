Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to use the
{+driver-short+} to connect your application to MongoDB by specifying
various settings. 

.. tip:: Connection Options

   To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <c-connect-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as
``<hostname>``, with the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Connection
----------

The following sections describe how to connect to different targets,
such as a local instance of MongoDB or a cloud-hosted instance on Atlas.

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows the connection string to connect to a local
instance of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: c

   client = mongoc_client_new ("mongodb://localhost:27017");

To learn more about connecting to local deployments, see :ref:`c-connect-local`
in the Choose a Connection Target guide.

Atlas
~~~~~

The following code shows the connection string to connect to a
deployment hosted on Atlas:

.. code-block:: c

   client = mongoc_client_new ("mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>/?<options>");

To learn more about connecting to Atlas, see :ref:`c-connect-atlas` in the
Choose a Connection Target guide.

Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows the connection string to connect to a
replica set:

.. code-block:: c
   
   client = mongoc_client_new ("mongodb+srv://<replica-set-member>/?replicaSet=<replica_set_name>");

To learn more about connecting to replica sets, see
:ref:`c-connect-replica-sets` in the Choose a Connection Target guide.

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
------------------------------

The following sections describe how to connect to MongoDB
while enabling the TLS protocol. 

To learn more about using TLS with the {+driver-short+},
see :ref:`c-tls`.

Enable TLS
~~~~~~~~~~

The following tabs demonstrate how to enable TLS on a connection:

.. include:: /includes/connect/tls-tabs.rst

To learn more about enabling TLS, see :ref:`c-enable-tls` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Disable Hostname Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tabs demonstrate how to disable hostname verification when
connecting by using TLS:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-host-verification-tabs.rst


To learn more about disabling hostname verification, see :ref:`c-certificate-revocation` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Network Compression
-------------------

The following sections describe how to connect to MongoDB
while specifying network compression algorithms.

Compression Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tabs demonstrate how to specify all available compressors
while connecting to MongoDB:

.. include:: /includes/connect/compression-tabs.rst

.. TODO, uncomment once TLS page is merged
.. To learn more about specifying compression algorithms, see
.. :ref:`c-enable-compression` in the Network Compression guide.

zlib Compression Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tabs demonstrate how to specify a compression level for
the ``zlib`` compressor:

.. include:: /includes/connect/zlib-level-tabs.rst

.. To learn more about setting the zlib compression level, see
.. :ref:`c-enable-compression` in the Network Compression guide.

Server Selection
----------------

The following code shows a connection string that specifies a server
selection function:

.. code-block:: c

   client = mongoc_client_new("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>/?server_selector=<selector_function>");

.. TODO, uncomment once server selection page is merged
.. To learn more about customizing server selection, see
.. :ref:`c-server-selection`.

{+stable-api+}
--------------

The following code shows how to specify Stable API settings within a
``mongoc_client_t`` instance:

.. code-block:: c 

   client = mongoc_client_new ("mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>/?<options>");

   // Set the version of the Stable API on the client
   mongoc_server_api_t *api = mongoc_server_api_new(MONGOC_SERVER_API_V1);
   mongoc_client_set_server_api(client, api, &error);

   // Do database work here

   mongoc_server_api_destroy (api);

To learn more about the {+stable-api+}, see :ref:`c-stable-api`.
