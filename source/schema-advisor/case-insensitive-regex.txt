If you frequently run case-insensitive regex queries (utilizing the
``i`` option), you should create a
:manual:`case-insensitive index </core/index-case-insensitive/>` to
support your queries. You can specify a
:manual:`collation </reference/collation/>` on an index to define
language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for
lettercase and accent marks. A case-insensitive index greatly improves
performance for case-insensitive queries.

Example
-------

Consider an ``employees`` collection with the following documents. This
collection has no indexes besides the default ``_id`` index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // employees collection

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "first_name": "Hannah",
     "last_name": "Simmons",
     "dept": "Engineering"
   },
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "first_name": "Michael",
     "last_name": "Hughes",
     "dept": "Security"
   },
   {
     "_id": 3,
     "first_name": "Wendy",
     "last_name": "Crawford",
     "dept": "Human Resources"
   },
   {
     "_id": 4,
     "first_name": "MICHAEL",
     "last_name": "FLORES",
     "dept": "Sales"
   }

If your application frequently queries the ``first_name`` field, you may
want to run case-insensitive regex queries to more easily find matching
names. Case-insensitive regex also helps match against differing data
formats, as in the example above where you have ``first_names`` of both
"Michael" and "MICHAEL".

If a user searches for the string "michael", the application may run
the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.find( { first_name: { $regex: /michael/i } } )

Since this query specifies the
:manual:`$regex </reference/operator/query/regex/>` option ``i``, it is
case-insensitive. The query returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 2, "first_name" : "Michael", "last_name" : "Hughes", "dept" : "Security" }
   { "_id" : 4, "first_name" : "MICHAEL", "last_name" : "FLORES", "dept" : "Sales" }

Although this query does return the expected documents, case-insensitive
regex queries with no index support are not very performant. To improve
performance, you can create a
:manual:`case-insensitive index </core/index-case-insensitive/>` on the
``first_name`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.createIndex(
     { first_name: 1 }, 
     { collation: { locale: 'en', strength: 2 } }
   )

When the ``strength`` field of an index's ``collation`` document is
``1`` or ``2``, the index is case-insensitive. For a detailed
description of the collation document and the different ``strength``
values, see :manual:`Collation Document
</reference/collation/#collation-document>`.

For the application to use this index, you must also specify the *same*
collation document from the index in the query. You can remove the
``$regex`` operator from the previous :method:`~db.collection.find()`
method and instead utilize the newly created index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.find( { first_name: "michael" } ).collation( { locale: 'en', strength: 2 } )

.. note::

   Do not use the :manual:`$regex </reference/operator/query/regex/>`
   operator when using a case-insensitive index for your query. The
   ``$regex`` implementation is not collation-aware and cannot utilize
   case-insensitive indexes.
