{+language+} Driver Compatibility
-------------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the versions of the
:ruby:`{+ruby-driver+} </>` that are compatible with each
{+odm+} version.

.. note:: Patch Version Compatibility

  Older patch versions of {+odm+} within the same minor release might
  support older {+ruby-driver+} versions. For example, {+odm+} v7.0.5
  supports {+ruby-driver+} v2.5 and later, but {+odm+} v7.0.6 requires
  driver v2.7 or later.

MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of {+odm+} that you can use with a specific version of MongoDB. To use
features of a particular {+mdb-server+} version, both the
{+ruby-driver+} and {+odm+} must be compatible with that MongoDB
version. To learn about the driver's MongoDB compatibility details,
see :ruby:`Compatibility </reference/driver-compatibility/>`
in the {+ruby-driver+} documentation.

The first column lists the version of {+odm+}.

To learn more about how to read the compatibility tables, see the guide
on :ref:`MongoDB Compatibility Tables <about-driver-compatibility>`.

Language Compatibility
----------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or
versions of {+odm+} that you can use with specific {+language+}
interpreter versions.

The first column lists the version of {+odm+}.

.. include:: /includes/language-compatibility-table-mongoid.rst

To learn more about how to read the compatibility tables, see the guide
on :ref:`MongoDB Compatibility Tables <about-driver-compatibility>`.

{+ror+} Compatibility
---------------------------

The following compatibility table specifies which versions of {+ror+}
are supported by {+odm+}.

.. include:: /includes/rails-compatibility-table-mongoid.rst

Rails Frameworks Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} is compatible with many of the frameworks that comprise {+ror+}.
In this section, you can learn about which frameworks you can use with {+odm+}.

{+odm+} attempts to offer API compatibility with `Active Record
<{+active-record-docs+}/active_record_basics.html>`__, but libraries
that depend directly on Active Record might not work as expected if you
use {+odm+} as a direct replacement.

.. note::

  You can use {+odm+} alongside Active Record within the same
  application.
