Index builds can impact replica set performance. By default, 
MongoDB builds indexes simultaneously on all data-bearing 
replica set members. For workloads which cannot tolerate performance 
decrease due to index builds, consider using the following 
procedure to build indexes in a rolling fashion. 

Rolling index builds take at most one replica set member out at a time,
starting with the secondary members, and builds the index on that member
as a standalone. Rolling index builds require at least one replica set
election.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` using the following
procedure, you must stop all writes to the collection during this
procedure.

If you cannot stop all writes to the collection during this procedure,
do not use the procedure on this page. Instead, build your unique index
on the collection by issuing :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` on
the primary for a replica set.

Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that your :term:`oplog` is large enough to permit the indexing
or re-indexing operation to complete without falling too far behind to
catch up. See the :ref:`oplog sizing <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`
documentation for additional information.

Prerequisites
-------------

For building unique indexes
   To create :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` using the
   following procedure, you must stop all writes to the collection
   during the index build. Otherwise, you may end up with inconsistent
   data across the replica set members. 

   .. warning::

      If you cannot stop all writes to the collection, do not use the
      following procedure to create unique indexes.

Procedure
---------

.. important::

   The following procedure to build indexes in a rolling fashion
   applies to replica set deployments, and not sharded clusters. For
   the procedure for sharded clusters, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters` instead.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member:

1. Hide and Restart One Secondary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following commands on your primary node to hide the secondary
that will build the new index.

In this example, the secondary that will build the new index is the
third node in ``cfg.members``.

.. code-block:: bash

   var cfg = rs.conf();
   // Record originalPriority so that you can reset it later.
   var originalPriority = cfg.members[2].priority;
   cfg.members[2].priority = 0;
   cfg.members[2].hidden = 1;
   rs.reconfig(cfg);

2. Stop One Secondary and Restart as a Standalone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process associated with a secondary.
Restart after making the following configuration updates:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
      - id: config-file
        name: Configuration File
        content: |

          If you are using a configuration file, make the following
          configuration updates:

          - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.

          - Change the :setting:`net.port` to a different port. [#different-port]_
            Make a note of the original port setting as a comment.

          - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
            ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

          For example, the updated configuration file for a replica
          set member will include content like the following example:

          .. code-block:: yaml

             net:
                bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>
                port: 27217
             #   port: 27017
             #replication:
             #   replSetName: myRepl
             setParameter:
                disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh: true

          Other settings (e.g. :setting:`storage.dbPath`, etc.) remain the same.

          And restart:

          .. code-block:: bash

             mongod --config <path/To/ConfigFile>

      - id: command-line
        name: Command-line Options
        content: |

          If using command-line options, make the following
          configuration updates:

          - Remove :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`.

          - Modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` to a different port. [#different-port]_

          - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
            to ``true`` in the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
            --setParameter>` option.

          For example, if your replica set member *normally* runs
          with on the default port of ``27017`` and the
          :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option, you would
          specify a different port, omit the ``--replSet`` option,
          and set ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` parameter
          to true:

          .. code-block:: bash

             mongod --port 27217 --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true

          Other settings (e.g. :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, etc.) remain the same.

.. [#different-port] By running the :binary:`~bin.mongod` on a different
   port, you ensure that the other members of the replica set and all
   clients will not contact the member while you are building the
   index.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index:

3. Build the Index.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect directly to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running as a
standalone on the new port and create the new index for this
instance.

For example, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the instance, and
use the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` to create an ascending
index on the ``username`` field of the ``records`` collection:

.. code-block:: bash

   db.records.createIndex( { username: 1 } )

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod:

4. Restart the Program ``mongod`` as a Replica Set Member.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the index build completes, shutdown the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance. To return the node to its original configuration, undo the
configuration changes that you made when you started the node as a
standalone. Then, restart the node as a member of the replica set.

.. important::

   Be sure to remove the ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
   parameter.
   
For example, to restart your replica set member:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
      - id: config-file
        name: Configuration File
        content: |

          If you are using a configuration file:

          - Revert to the original port number.

          - Uncomment the :setting:`replication.replSetName`.

          - Remove parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
            in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

          For example:

          .. code-block:: yaml

             net:
                bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>
                port: 27017
             replication:
                replSetName: myRepl

          Other settings (e.g. :setting:`storage.dbPath`, etc.) remain the same.

          And restart:

          .. code-block:: bash

             mongod --config <path/To/ConfigFile>

      - id: command-line
        name: Command-line Options
        content: |

          If you are using command-line options, 

          - Revert to the original port number

          - Include the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
            option.

          - Remove parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``.

          For example:

          .. code-block:: bash

             mongod --port 27017 --replSet myRepl

          Other settings (e.g. :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, etc.) remain the same.

.. important::
   
   Allow replication to catch up on this member before you begin the
   next step. 

5. Unhide the Secondary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command on your primary to unhide the secondary node
that built the index. In this example, the secondary node that built the
index is the third node in ``cfg.members``. 

.. code-block:: bash

   var cfg = rs.conf();
   cfg.members[2].priority = originalPriority;
   cfg.members[2].hidden = false;
   rs.reconfig(cfg);



6. Repeat the Procedure for the Remaining Secondaries.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the member catches up with the other members of the set, repeat
the procedure one member at a time for the remaining secondary members:

A. :ref:`Hide and restart one secondary. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member>`

B. :ref:`Build the index. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index>`

C. :ref:`Restart the Program mongod as a replica set member. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod>`

7. Build the Index on the Primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When all the secondaries have the new index, step down the primary,
restart it as a standalone using the procedure described above, 
and build the index on the former primary:

A. Use the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
   to step down the primary. Upon successful stepdown, the current primary
   becomes a secondary and the replica set members elect a new primary.

B. :ref:`Hide and restart one secondary. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member>`

C. :ref:`Build the index. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index>`

D. :ref:`Restart the Program mongod as a replica set member. <tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod>`
