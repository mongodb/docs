|charts| provides various options to customize the format and display
of your visualizations. You can use these options to display your data
in the proper format, show data labels to relay precise measurements,
and many other formatting techniques.

The documentation for specific chart types covers additional
customization options pretaining to those charts. See the :ref:`Chart
Types <chart-type-reference>` page to learn more about customizing a
particular chart type.

|charts| provides the following types of customization options:

General
  :ref:`General Customization Options <general-customization>` modify
  high-level aspects of the chart such as its colors and data labels.
  These options affect the overall look and format of your data.

Axes
  :ref:`Value Axis Options <value-axis-options>` modify the
  chart's axes, such as their scale and their minimum and maximum
  values. These options only affect the chart's axes, and not how
  |charts-short| formats data points in the visualization.

Fields
  :ref:`Field-Level Options <field-level-options>` modify how
  |charts-short| renders data fields, such as specific formatting
  for numbers and dates. These options apply to individual data fields
  :ref:`encoded <encoding-channels>` into your chart, rather than the
  chart as a whole. The field-level customization options available
  depend on the data type and
  :ref:`channel type <charts-channel-type-table>` of the field you are
  customizing.

Conditional Formatting
  :ref:`Conditional Formatting Options <conditional-formatting>` modify 
  the styling of chart values that meet conditions you define. These 
  options affect the look of your chart dynamically: 
  if a value changes to meet or stop meeting your conditions, 
  its styling updates to reflect that.

To customize a chart, click the :guilabel:`Customize` tab above the
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` in the
:doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`:

Your chart automatically updates as you modify customization options.
