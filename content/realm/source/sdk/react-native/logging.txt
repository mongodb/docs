You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different
amounts of data depending on the app's environment. You can specify 
different log levels or custom loggers.

   This page shows how to set a Realm logger, which was added
   in Realm React Native SDK v12.0.0. This supersedes setting the Sync client 
   log level in earlier versions of the Realm React Native SDK. For information 
   on how to set the Sync client log level in an earlier version, refer to
   :ref:`react-native-client-log-level`.

.. _react-native-set-the-client-log-level:

Set or Change the Realm Log Level
---------------------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by the Realm React Native SDK. To
configure the log level, pass a valid level string value to
:js-sdk:`setLogLevel() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogLevel>`:

- "all"
- "trace"
- "debug"
- "detail"
- "info"
- "warn"
- "error"
- "fatal"
- "off"

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.set-log-level.tsx.rst

Use ``setLogLevel()`` anywhere in your app to increase or decrease log verbosity
at different points in your code. This behavior differs from the deprecated
:ref:`sync client log level <react-native-client-log-level>`, which had to be
set before opening a synced realm and could not be changed.

To turn off logging, pass "off" to ``setLogLevel()``:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.disable-logger.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-customize-logger:

Customize the Logger
--------------------

To set a custom logger, call :js-sdk:`setLogger() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogger>`.
This method receives ``level`` and ``message`` arguments from the Realm logger, 
not individual realms. Use these arguments to define your own logging behavior.

You must use ``setLogger()`` before you open a realm with ``RealmProvider``.
You can't use ``setLogger()`` in a hook in the same component as
``RealmProvider`` because ``RealmProvider`` opens a realm when it is mounted.
Hooks generally run after a component is mounted, which means ``RealmProvider``
already opened a realm.

Most of the time, you should set your custom logger outside of the React tree.
For example, in your app's root ``index.js`` file.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.set-custom-logger.tsx.rst

This sets the logging behavior for all Realm logging in your application,
regardless of where you set it. If you do not provide a log level, the default
is "info".
