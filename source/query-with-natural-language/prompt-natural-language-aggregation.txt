You can use |compass| to generate aggregation queries using natural 
language. |compass-short| uses AI to generate aggregations based on prompts 
you provide. Querying with natural language can be a helpful starting 
point and assist you in learning to write MongoDB queries.

About this Task
---------------

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-natural-language-query.rst

- You can also provide natural language prompts on the 
  :ref:`documents tab <compass-prompt-natural-language-query>`.

- This page uses the :ref:`sample_mflix.movies <sample-mflix>` 
  collection from the Atlas sample dataset.

-  .. include:: /includes/fact-natural-language-querying-maxTimems.rst
   
Before you Begin
----------------

You must :ref:`enable natural language querying 
<compass-enable-natural-language-querying>` in |compass-short|.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar`
      
      a. Select the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Generate aggregation` button.

      The :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar` displays.

   .. step:: Type a question about your collection

      Type a natural language prompt for your collection into the query 
      bar. Aggregation pipeline prompts usually have an aggregation verb 
      such as count, average, or sum with logical conditions. For 
      example: ``How many movies have more than 3 writers 
      in the writers array?``

      a. Press enter or click the :guilabel:`Generate aggregation` button.
      #. An aggregation pipeline populates in the :guilabel:`Pipeline` 
         bar. You can scroll down to see the syntax of each stage.

   .. step:: Run the aggregation

      a. Before running the query, make sure to thoroughly review the 
         syntax of each stage. Ensure the returned pipeline has the 
         fields and stages that match your desired use case.

      b. Press enter or click the :guilabel:`Run` button to execute 
         the pipeline.

      The results populate in the aggregations view.

Examples

Below are examples of prompts to help you understand expected results 
when using natural language prompts for aggregation.
