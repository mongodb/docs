Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your
cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the
event of data loss. If you have strict data protection requirements, 
you can :ref:`enable a {+bcp+} <backup-compliance-policy>` to protect 
your backup data.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/backup-restore.rst

Considerations
--------------

Be aware that:

- |service| backups are not available for ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}.
  You may use :ref:`mongodump <command-line-tools-mongodump>` to back
  up your ``M0`` cluster data and
  :ref:`mongorestore <command-line-tools-mongorestore>` to restore that
  data. To learn how to manually back up your data, see
  :doc:`Command Line Tools </command-line-tools>`.

- You can't write to your cluster while 
  a backup restore is in progress for that cluster.

- You can restore a backup only to a cluster running either the same
  major release version, or the next higher one. |service| doesn't
  support restoring to older versions.

  If the backup has a pinned FCV, the major version of the target
  {+cluster+} must match the major version of that pinned FCV.

.. _cloud-backup-overview:

{+Cloud-Backup+}s
-----------------

*Available in M10+ {+Clusters+}.*

|service| uses the native snapshot capabilities of your cloud provider
to support full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot storage.

|service| supports
:ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s <backup-cloud-provider>` on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google GCP <google-gcp>`

To learn more, see :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`.

To learn how to restore cluster from a {+Cloud-Backup+}, see
:ref:`restore-from-snapshot`.

Snapshots for {+Flex-Clusters} and Deprecated M2 / M5 {+clusters+}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/shared-to-atlas-flex-migration.rst

Backups are automatically enabled for {+Flex-clusters+} and ``M2`` and ``M5``
{+Shared-clusters+} and can't be disabled.
|service| takes :ref:`daily snapshots <m2-m5-snapshots>` of your {+Flex-clusters+} and 
{+Shared-clusters+}, which you can restore to {+Flex-clusters+} tiers or
``M10`` and greater.

To learn more about backing up your cluster, refer to :ref:`<m2-m5-snapshots>`
and :ref:`flex-snapshots`. 

To learn more about restoring your cluster, refer to :ref:`<restore-from-snapshot>`. 

Snapshots for {+Serverless-Instances+} (Deprecated)
---------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/shared-to-atlas-flex-migration.rst

|service| uses the native snapshot capabilities of your cloud provider
to support full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot storage.

Backups are automatically enabled for {+Serverless-instances+}. 
You can't disable {+Serverless-instance+} backups.

|service| offers the following backup options for
{+Serverless-instances+}:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-serverless-backup-options.rst
   
You can restore {+Serverless-instance+} snapshots to other 
{+Serverless-instances+} and {+dedicated-clusters+}.

To learn more, see:

- :ref:`config-serverless-backup`
- :ref:`serverless-snapshots`
- :ref:`restore-from-snapshot`

{+Old-Backup+}s
---------------

*Available in M10+ {+Clusters+}.*

|service| ensures {+pit-restore+} of replica sets and consistent,
cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters.

For each |service| project with {+old-backup+}s enabled, |service|
stores the {+old-backup+} snapshots in the backup data center
location where {+old-backup+}s were *first* enabled for a cluster in
the project.

Continuous snapshots support restoring from the full snapshot
or from a {+PIT-Restore+} between snapshots.

With |service| {+old-backup+}, the total number of collections
across all databases in a |service| cluster can't be equal to or
exceed ``100,000``.
