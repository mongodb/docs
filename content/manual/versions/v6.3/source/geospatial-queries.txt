MongoDB supports query operations on geospatial data. This section
introduces MongoDB's geospatial features.

.. _geo-overview-location-data:

Geospatial Data
---------------

In MongoDB, you can store geospatial data as :ref:`GeoJSON
<geospatial-geojson>` objects or as :ref:`legacy coordinate pairs
<geospatial-legacy>`.

.. _geospatial-geojson:

GeoJSON Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate geometry over an Earth-like sphere, store your location
data as :ref:`GeoJSON objects <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/geojson-specification-geospatial.rst

.. _geospatial-legacy:

Legacy Coordinate Pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate distances on a Euclidean plane, store your location data
as legacy coordinate pairs and use a :ref:`geo-2d` index. MongoDB
supports spherical surface calculations on legacy coordinate pairs by using
a :ref:`geo-2dsphere` index if you manually convert the data to 
the :ref:`GeoJSON Point type <geojson-point>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-legacy-coordinates-specification.rst

.. _index-feature-geospatial:

Geospatial Indexes
------------------

MongoDB provides the following geospatial index types to support the
geospatial queries.

.. _geo-2dsphere:

``2dsphere``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`2dsphere <2dsphere-index>` indexes support queries that calculate
:ref:`geometries on an earth-like sphere <geospatial-geometry>`.

.. include:: /includes/create-2dsphere-index.rst

For more information on the ``2dsphere`` index, see
:ref:`<2dsphere-index>`.

.. _geo-2d:

``2d``
~~~~~~

:ref:`2d <2d-index>` indexes support queries that calculate
:ref:`geometries on a two-dimensional plane <geospatial-geometry>`.
Although the index can support :query:`$nearSphere` queries that
calculate on a sphere, if possible, use the :ref:`geo-2dsphere` index
for spherical queries.

.. include:: /includes/create-2d-index.rst

For more information on the ``2d`` index, see :doc:`/core/2d`.

Geospatial Indexes and Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/geospatial-index-shard-key-restriction-general.rst

The following geospatial operations are supported on sharded
collections:

- :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage

- |geo-operation| query operators (starting in MongoDB 4.0)

.. include:: /includes/fact-near-sharded-cluster.rst

.. |geo-operation| replace:: :query:`$near` and :query:`$nearSphere`

You can also query for geospatial data for a sharded cluster using
:query:`$geoWithin` and :query:`$geoIntersects`.

Covered Queries

Geospatial Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following geospatial query operators:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30,70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name

     - Description

   * - :query:`$geoIntersects`

     - Selects geometries that intersect with a :term:`GeoJSON` geometry.
       The ``2dsphere`` index supports :query:`$geoIntersects`.
   

   * - :query:`$geoWithin`

     - Selects geometries within a bounding :ref:`GeoJSON geometry
       <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>`. The ``2dsphere`` and 
       ``2d`` indexes support :query:`$geoWithin`.
   

   * - :query:`$near`

     - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point.
       Requires a geospatial index.  The ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes 
       support :query:`$near`.
   

   * - :query:`$nearSphere`

     - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere.
       Requires a geospatial index.  The ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes 
       support :query:`$nearSphere`.
   


For more details, including examples, see the individual reference page.

Geospatial Aggregation Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following geospatial :ref:`aggregation pipeline
stage <aggregation-pipeline>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 72

   * - Stage

     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear`

     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/geoNear-stage-toc-description.rst

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/geoNear-stage-index-requirement.rst

For more details, including examples, see :pipeline:`$geoNear`
reference page.

.. _geospatial-geometry:

Geospatial Models
-----------------

MongoDB geospatial queries can interpret geometry on a flat surface or
a sphere.

``2dsphere`` indexes support only spherical queries (i.e. queries that
interpret geometries on a spherical surface).

``2d`` indexes support flat queries (i.e. queries that interpret
geometries on a flat surface) and some spherical queries. While ``2d``
indexes support some spherical queries, the use of ``2d`` indexes for
these spherical queries can result in error. If possible, use
``2dsphere`` indexes for spherical queries.

The following table lists the geospatial query operators, supported
query, used by each geospatial operations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 48, 12, 40

   * - Operation

     - Spherical/Flat Query

     - Notes

   * - :query:`$near` (:ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` centroid
       point in this line and the following line, :ref:`2dsphere
       <geo-2dsphere>` index)

     - Spherical

     - See also the :query:`$nearSphere` operator, which provides the
       same functionality when used with :ref:`GeoJSON
       <geospatial-geojson>` and a :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index.

   * - :query:`$near` (:ref:`legacy coordinates <geospatial-legacy>`, :ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$nearSphere` (:ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` point, :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index)

     - Spherical

     - Provides the same functionality as :query:`$near` operation that
       uses :ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` point and a
       :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index.

       For spherical queries, it may be preferable to use
       :query:`$nearSphere` which explicitly specifies the spherical
       queries in the name rather than :query:`$near` operator.

   * - :query:`$nearSphere` (:ref:`legacy coordinates <geospatial-legacy>`, :ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)

     - Spherical

     - Use :term:`GeoJSON` points instead.

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$geometry`: ... }

     - Spherical

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$box`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$polygon`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$center`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$centerSphere`: ... }

     - Spherical

     -

   * - :query:`$geoIntersects`

     - Spherical

     -


   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage (:ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index)
     - Spherical
     -

   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage (:ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)
     - Flat
     -

Examples
--------

.. include:: /includes/geospatial-places-data-setup.rst

The ``places`` collection above has a ``2dsphere`` index.
The following query uses the :query:`$near` operator to return
documents that are at least 1000 meters from and at most 5000 meters
from the specified GeoJSON point, sorted in order from nearest to
farthest:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        location:
          { $near:
             {
               $geometry: { type: "Point",  coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
               $minDistance: 1000,
               $maxDistance: 5000
             }
          }
      }
   )

The following operation uses the :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation
operation to return documents that match the query filter ``{ category:
"Parks" }``, sorted in order of nearest to farthest to the specified
GeoJSON point:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate( [
      {
         $geoNear: {
            near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
            spherical: true,
            query: { category: "Parks" },
            distanceField: "calcDistance"
         }
      }
   ] )
