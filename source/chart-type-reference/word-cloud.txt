Word clouds visually represent text data, highlighting prevalent
keywords and phrases. The frequency at which each word appears is
reflected by the word's size.

Encoding Channels
-----------------

Word clouds provide the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 40

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Channel Type
     - Description

   * - Text
     - Category
     - The text values to add to the word cloud. |charts-short| adds
       each unique value from the field applied to this channel to the
       word cloud.

       .. tip::

          Word clouds can display a maximum of 100 values. If the field
          applied to this channel contains more than 100 unique values,
          the chart shows a random sample of 100 values. To ensure that the
          chart only shows the most common words, you should apply a
          :ref:`limit <charts-limit-data>` and sort by
          :guilabel:`Value`.

   * - Size
     - Aggregation
     - Dictates the field to aggregate on and the type of
       aggregation to perform. The results of the aggregation define
       the size of each :guilabel:`Text` value, with larger aggregated
       values resulting in larger text sizes.

   * - Color
     - Category
     - (*Optional*) Colors each text value to indicate a corresponding
       data value from the applied field.

Use Cases
---------

Use word clouds to show the frequency of specific words or phrases
in text fields. Word clouds provide a high-level view of common
words and themes across a series of text data. They can also
highlight the most common phrases from a known set of
strings, such as product categories or tags.

Consider using a word cloud to:

- Show common words and phrases used in reviews of a product.

- Identify common terms in existing content to improve
  :abbr:`SEO (Search Engine Optimization)`.

- Highlight specific customer pain points from aggregated user surveys.


Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for a word cloud is 5000 documents. 


Example
-------

Word clouds are commonly used to show the frequency of words appearing
within long text fields. By default, word clouds do not split text
fields into words, and instead attempt to visualize the entire text
field as a single value. You can use an
:ref:`aggregation pipeline <charts-agg-pipeline>` to split a text
field into individual words.

.. note::

   The dataset used in this tutorial is included in the
   ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews``
   :atlas:`dataset provided by Atlas</sample-data/load-sample-data/>`.

The following example creates a word cloud from a dataset containing
information on AirBnB rental properties. Each property listing contains
a ``description`` field; a text field describing the property.

First, we run an aggregation pipeline to pre-process the ``description``
field. The following aggregation pipeline:

1. :expression:`Splits <$split>` the ``description`` field into an array
   where each individual word is an array element.
   
#. :pipeline:`Unwinds <$unwind>` this array, creating a new document for
   each individual word from each ``description`` field.

#. :pipeline:`Adds a new field <$addFields>` called ``words`` to the
   collection, where each unwound word from the ``description`` becomes
   a value of ``words``.

#. Performs a :pipeline:`$match` query such that only non-trivial words
   are added to the word cloud.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1. Paste the following aggregation pipeline into the :guilabel:`Query`
   bar at the top of the Chart Builder:

   .. code-block:: json

      [
        {
          $addFields: {
            words: {
              $map: {
                input: { $split: ['$description', ' '] },
                as: 'str',
                in: {
                  $trim: {
                    input: { $toLower: ['$$str'] },
                    chars: " ,|(){}-<>.;"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        { $unwind: '$words' },
        { 
          $match: { 
            words: { 
              $nin: ["", "also", "i", "me", "my", "myself", "we", "us",

                     "would", "should", "can", "could", "ought", "i'm",
                     "you're", "he's", "she's", "it's", "we're", "they're",
                     "i've", "you've", "we've", "they've", "i'd", "you'd",
                     "he'd", "she'd", "we'd", "they'd", "i'll", "you'll",
                     "he'll", "she'll", "we'll", "they'll", "isn't",
                     "aren't", "wasn't", "weren't", "hasn't", "haven't",

                     "wouldn't", "shan't", "shouldn't", "can't", "cannot",
                     "couldn't", "mustn't", "let's", "that's", "who's",
                     "what's", "here's", "there's", "when's", "where's",
                     "why's", "how's", "a", "an", "the", "and", "but",
                     "if", "or", "because", "as", "until", "while", "of",
                     "at", "by", "for", "with", "about", "against",
                     "between", "into", "through", "during", "before",
                     "after", "above", "below", "to", "from", "up", "upon",
                     "down", "in", "out", "on", "off", "over", "under",
                     "again", "further", "then", "once", "here", "there", "when",
                     "where", "why", "how", "all", "any", "both", "each",
                     "few", "more", "most", "other", "some", "such", "no",
                     "nor", "not", "only", "own", "same", "so", "than",
                     "too", "very", "say", "says", "said", "shall"] 
            }
          }
        }
      ]

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to execute the pipeline.

   Now that we have a new field containing the individual words from
   each review, we can visualize those words in a word cloud.

#. Apply the newly created ``words`` field to the :guilabel:`Text`
   encoding channel to add each individual word to the word cloud.

#. Apply a :ref:`limit <charts-limit-data>` of 80 to only show
   the 80 most common words from the reviews.

#. Apply the ``words`` field to the :guilabel:`Size` encoding
   channel and aggregate based on the count of each individual word.

.. _word-cloud-example:

Your word cloud should look something like this:

.. figure:: /images/charts/word-cloud-example2.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Word cloud example

The size of the words in the cloud represent their relative frequency.
