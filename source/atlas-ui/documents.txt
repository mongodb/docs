You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to manage documents inside
your collections. Documents are individual records in a MongoDB
collection and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.

Viewing documents and collections in the {+atlas-ui+} can provide a
high-level overview of your database schema. You can use the |service|
UI to ensure you are following MongoDB's core data modeling concepts,
such as utilizing embedded documents and arrays.
