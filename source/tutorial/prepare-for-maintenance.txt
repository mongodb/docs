|mms| performs a :term:`rolling restart` when you perform maintenance
on nodes in a cluster. {+aagent+} updates nodes in a cluster one-by-one 
until all nodes are updated to maintain cluster availability during a 
maintenance period.

Before you perform maintenance on your clusters, review the following 
considerations and take action, if necessary, to maintain cluster
availability.

.. note::

   To learn about how {+aagent+} performs maintenance on your clusters,
   see :ref:`rolling-restart-faq`.

``oplog`` Size
--------------

Each node in a cluster is restarted in standalone mode before 
maintenance starts. The node replays writes in the :term:`oplog` to 
catch up to the other nodes when it is added back to the cluster after 
maintenance completes.
  
Make sure that the cluster's oplog is large enough to store all writes
that you application might make during the maintenance period. Use 
the :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB` advanced deployment option
to adjust the oplog size.

Priority
--------

All client connections to a primary node are dropped when maintenance 
starts on that node. Connections are re-established to the newly elected 
primary node.

You may prefer a node in a specific data center to become the new primary 
node. :doc:`Edit the cluster's configuration </tutorial/edit-deployment>` 
and adjust the priority of each node to indicate your preferred primary
node.

Fault Tolerance
---------------

Nodes undergoing maintenance don't provide failover support to the 
cluster. For three-member replica sets, if an additional node becomes 
unavailable while one node is undergoing maintenance, the cluster has 
lost the majority of nodes. The primary node loses this status and 
steps down to become a secondary node. A new primary can't be elected
until a majority of the cluster's nodes are available.

For mission-critical applications with high uptime needs, consider 
converting a three-member replica set to a five-member replica 
set before performing maintenance to maintain cluster majority in case 
an additional cluster node becomes unavailable during a maintenance 
period.

.. note::

   Five-member replica sets or larger are more resilient and less likely
   to experience loss of majority during maintenance periods.

A simpler but less resilient option to increase multiple failure 
tolerance is to :ref:`add a temporary arbiter <add-member-to-rs>` to a 
three-member replica set before you perform maintenance.

Unique Index Builds
-------------------

{+aagent+} builds indexes on cluster nodes one at a time using identical 
but independent commands. To ensure that writes respect the ``unique`` 
quality of indexed fields in a :manual:`unique indexe </core/index-unique/>`, 
all writes to the collection on the cluster must stop before you build 
the index.

You can't use :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>` or the 
:doc:`Automation Config Resource </reference/api/automation-config>` in 
|mms| to create unique indexes in a rolling fashion because these 
methods don't stop writes to the cluster.

If your use case requires you to build new unique indexes: 

1. Stop all writes to the affected collection. For more information.
   see :manual:`db.fsyncLock() </reference/method/db.fsyncLock/>` in the
   MongoDB Manual.
2. See :manual:`Build Indexes on Replica Sets 
   </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>` in the MongoDB Manual 
   to build the unique index in a rolling fashion.
