Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.addShardToZone(shard, zone)

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

      Associates a shard with a :term:`zone`. MongoDB associates this shard
      with the given zone. Chunks that are covered by the zone are assigned to
      shards associated with the zone.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-sh.addShardToZone-param.rst

   Only issue :method:`sh.addShardToZone()` when connected to a
   :program:`mongos` instance.

Behavior
--------

You can associate a zone with multiple shards, and a shard can associate with
multiple zones.

See the :ref:`zone <zone-sharding>` manual page for more information on zones
in sharded clusters.

Ranges
~~~~~~

MongoDB effectively ignores zones that do not have at least one range of
shard key values associated with it. 

To associate a range of shard key values with a zone, use the 
:method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` method.

Security
--------

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authentication <authentication>`, you
must authenticate as a user whose privileges include :authaction:`update` on
the ``config.shards`` collection or the ``config`` database.

The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` or :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in roles have
the appropriate permissions for issuing :method:`sh.addShardToZone()`. See the
:ref:`Role-Based Access Control <authorization>` manual page for more
information.

Example
-------

The following example adds three zones, ``NYC``, ``LAX``, and ``NRT``,
associating each to a shard:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShardToZone("shard0000", "JFK")
   sh.addShardToZone("shard0001", "LAX")
   sh.addShardToZone("shard0002", "NRT")

A shard can associate with multiple zones. The following example associates
``LGA`` to ``shard0000``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShardToZone("shard0000", "LGA")

``shard0000`` associates with both the ``LGA`` zone and the ``JFK`` zone. In a
balanced cluster, MongoDB routes reads and writes covered by either zone to
``shard0000``.

.. seealso:: :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` and :method:`sh.removeShardFromZone()`.
