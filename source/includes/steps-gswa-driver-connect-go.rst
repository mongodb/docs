   .. step:: Connect with the sample application.

      The following sample application connects to your |service|
      cluster with your connection string and sends a ping to 
      confirm a successful connection. To test the sample application:
      
      a. Create a new directory called ``connect`` and 
         initialize your project by using the ``go mod`` command.
      
         .. code-block:: shell
      
            mkdir connect
            cd connect
            go mod init connect
      
      #. Run the following commands to download the Go driver 
         and driver dependencies:
      
         .. code-block:: shell
      
            go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo
            go get github.com/joho/godotenv
      
      #. In your project, create a new file called ``connect.go`` and paste 
         the following code. Make sure to replace the placeholder with 
         your updated connection string:
      
         .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect.go
            :language: go
            :linenos:
            :emphasize-lines: 15
      
      #. To run your application, use the following command:
         
         .. io-code-block::
      
            .. input::
               :language: bash
      
               go run connect.go
