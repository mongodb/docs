Restore One Database from a Snapshot

Backup snapshots contain a complete copy of your :program:`mongod` data
directory. You may want to restore some of the data in a snapshot.

To restore a single database instead of all databases in the snapshot,
load the snapshot first to a temporary :program:`mongod` instance and
then export the single database from this instance. Use the export of
the single database to restore data to the target deployment.

.. admonition:: Changed in MongoDB 3.0
   :class: note

   :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore`
   no longer support the :option:`--dbpath` option. These tools now
   must connect to a running :program:`mongod` instance.

Considerations
--------------

Before you attempt a restore, ensure the host for your target
deployment has sufficient storage space for the restore files and the
restored database, plus additional space for dataset growth. Use
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>` to find the current
database size.

Restore the Database
--------------------

The following examples use:

- ``27017`` as the port for a running MongoDB instance that receives
  the restored backup.

- ``27018`` as the port for the temporary MongoDB instance that
  uses the snapshot to export the single database.
