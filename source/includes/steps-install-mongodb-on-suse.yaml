  Add the repository so that you can install MongoDB.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0

     .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-3.0-linux-package-repo-tutorial.rst
  
  Use the command appropriate for your version of SUSE:

  .. note::

     SUSE 15 support was added with MongoDB v3.4.24.

content: |
  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: SUSE 15
        :tabid: suse-15

        .. code-block:: sh

           sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/15/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/" mongodb

     .. tab:: SUSE 12
        :tabid: suse-12

        .. code-block:: sh

           sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/" mongodb

        To install MongoDB packages from a previous :ref:`release
        series <release-version-numbers>` such as 3.2, you can
        specify the release series in the repository configuration.

        For example, to restrict your SUSE 12 system to the 3.2 release
        series, use the following command:

        .. code-block:: sh

           sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/3.2/x86_64/" mongodb

#   When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
#   release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.

      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper -n install mongodb-org
  # - pre: |
  #     To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
  #     component package individually and append the version number to the
  #     package name, as in the following example:

  #     .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse.rst
  # - pre: |
  #     You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
  #     will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
  #     prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
  #     command:

  #     .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock.rst

  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
