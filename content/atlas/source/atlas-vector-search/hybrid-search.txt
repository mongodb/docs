A hybrid search is an aggregation of different search methods or search
queries for the same or similar query criteria. This technique utilizes
algorithms to rank results and return unified results from the different
methods of search. You can use the ``$rankFusion`` to perform a
hybrid search.

What is Reciprocal Rank Fusion?
-------------------------------

Reciprocal rank fusion is a technique to combine results from different
search methods into a single result set by performing the following
actions: 

1. Calculate the reciprocal rank of the documents in the results.

   .. _calculate-reciprocal-rank: 

   For each ranked document in each search result, first add the rank
   (``r``) of the document with a constant number, ``60``, to smooth
   the score (``rank_constant``), and then divide ``1`` by the sum of
   ``r`` and ``rank_constant`` for the reciprocal rank of the document 
   in the results. You can't set the value of ``rank_constant`` and it
   defaults to ``60``. 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      reciprocal_rank = 1 / ( r + rank_constant )

   For each method of search, apply different weights (``w``) to give more
   importance to that method of search. For each document, the weighted
   reciprocal rank is calculated by multiplying the weight by the
   reciprocal rank of the document. 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      weighted_reciprocal_rank = w x reciprocal_rank   
  
#. Combine the rank-derived and weighted scores of the documents in the
   results. 
  
   .. _combine-reciprocal-ranks:
     
   For each document across all search results, add the calculated
   reciprocal ranks for a single score for the document. 

#. Sort the results by the combined score of the documents in the
   results. 

   Sort the documents in the results based on the combined score across
   the results for a single, combined ranked list of documents in the
   results. 

About the Different Hybrid Search Use Cases  
-------------------------------------------

You can leverage {+avs+} to perform several types of hybrid search.
Specifically, {+avs+} supports the following use cases: 

- Full-text and vector search in a single query: You can combine results
  from different search methods, such as a semantic and a full-text
  search. You can use the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` for the semantic
  search and the :pipeline:`$search` for the full-text search results
  and combine the results by using the reciprocal rank fusion technique.
  To learn more, see the :ref:`avs-reciprocal-rank-fusion` tutorial,
  which demonstrates how to perform a semantic search and full-text
  search against the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` namespace and
  retrieve combined ranked results by using reciprocal rank fusion. 

  Alternatively, for a more granular hybrid search where the score
  matters in addition to the relative ordering of results, you can use
  the ``$scoreFusion`` pipeline stage. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`avs-reciprocal-rank-fusion` tutorial, which demonstrates how to
  perform a semantic search and full-text search against the
  ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` namespace and retrieve input pipeline
  results into a final scored results set. 

  While ``$rankFusion`` ranks documents based on their positions
  (relative ranks) in input pipelines using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion
  algorithm, ``$scoreFusion`` ranks documents based on scores assigned
  by the input pipelines, using mathematical expressions for combining the
  results. 

  In ``$rankFusion``, rankings are influenced by pipeline weights. In
  ``$scoreFusion``, weights control the contribution of each pipeline's
  scores to the final result. 

- Multiple vector search queries in a single query: The MongoDB
  ``$rankFusion`` pipeline supports multiple sub-pipelines that contain
  vector search queries executed against the same collection and
  combining their results using the reciprocal rank fusion technique.
  The :ref:`avs-with-unionwith` tutorial demonstrates the following
  types of vector search:  

  - Perform a comprehensive search of your dataset for semantically
    similar terms in the same query. 

  - Search multiple fields in your dataset to determine which fields
    return the best results for the query. 

  - Search using embeddings from different embedding models to determine
    the semantic interpretation differences between the different
    models.

Considerations 
--------------

When using the ``$rankFusion`` or ``$scoreFusion``
pipeline stage for hybrid search, consider the following.

Disjoint Result Sets 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to capture false negatives that one search methodology
couldn't catch, having disjoint results from individual sub-pipelines
might be acceptable. When you have disjoint results, most or all of the
results might appear to be returned from one of the pipelines and not
the other. However, if you want all the sub-pipelines to return similar 
results, try increasing the number of results per sub-pipeline.

Weights
~~~~~~~

We recommend weighing lexical and vector queries on a per-query basis
rather than having static weights for all queries to improve the
relevance of the results for each query. This also improves computation
resource utilization by allocating resources on the query that needs it
most. 

Multiple Pipelines 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can combine an arbitrary number of sub-pipelines together in the
``$rankFusion`` or ``$scoreFusion`` stage, but they must all execute
against the same collection. You can't use the ``$rankFusion`` or
``$scoreFusion`` stage to search across collections. Use the
:pipeline:`$unionWith` stage with :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` for
cross-collection search.

Non-Search Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$sort`, and so on in
your pipeline to boost on specific fields within your collection
without requiring a search pipeline.

Geospatial Relevance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :pipeline:`$geoNear` and the :ref:`near <near-ref>` operator
inside :pipeline:`$search` for a geographic location search within the
``$rankFusion`` or ``$scoreFusion`` stage. However, the
:pipeline:`$geoNear` and the :ref:`near <near-ref>` operator use
different coordinate reference frames. Therefore, the result ordinals
and scores might not be identical.  

Limit the Results 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend setting limits for the number of results to return for each
sub-pipeline. If the pipeline stage inside the
:pipeline:`$rankFusion` or :pipeline:`$scoreFusion` input pipeline doesn't support limiting the number of results (such
as :pipeline:`$search`), we recommend that you use :pipeline:`$limit`
subsequently inside the input pipeline to limit the number of documents
that :pipeline:`$rankFusion` or :pipeline:`$scoreFusion` evaluates. 

Advanced Pre-Filters 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using :ref:`fts-vectorSearch-ref` if you want to pre-filter
data for vector search using :pipeline:`$search` operators that include
analyzed text capabilities such as fuzzy search, phrase matching,
location filtering, wildcard pattern matching, and so on. 

Limitations 
-----------

The following limitations apply to hybrid search using
``$rankFusion`` and ``$scoreFusion``: 

- ``$rankFusion`` is only supported on MongoDB 8.0 and later (including latest
  version with auto upgrades). ``$scoreFusion`` is available on v8.2+.

  .. note::

     When you upgrade from 8.0, you might have to pause executing ``$rankFusion`` 
     queries.

- ``$rankFusion`` and ``$scoreFusion`` sub-pipelines can contain only the
  following stages:  

  - :pipeline:`$search`
  - :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
  - :pipeline:`$match`
  - :pipeline:`$sort`
  - :pipeline:`$geoNear`

- ``$rankFusion`` and ``$scoreFusion`` preserve a traceable link back to
  the original input document for each sub-pipeline. Therefore, it
  doesn't support the following: 
  
  - :pipeline:`$project` stage 
  - :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` fields

- ``$rankFusion`` and ``$scoreFusion`` sub-pipelines run serially, not
  in parallel. 

- ``$rankFusion`` and ``$scoreFusion`` don't support pagination.

- ``rankFusion`` can be run on :manual:`Views </core/views/>` only on
  clusters running MongoDB 8.0 or higher. You can't run ``rankFusion``
  within a view definition or on a time series collection.
