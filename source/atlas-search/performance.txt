|fts| runs a new process, called ``mongot``, alongside
the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process on each host in your
|service| cluster. ``mongot`` maintains all
|fts| indexes on collections in your |service| databases.
The amount of CPU, memory, and disk resources ``mongot`` consumes
depends on several factors, including our index configuration and 
the complexity of your queries. 
:ref:`Atlas Search alerts <atlas-search-alerts>` measure the amount of
CPU and memory used by |fts| processes.

The following pages contain recommendations that you can apply when
configuring your |fts| index and defining your |fts| queries to improve
performance: 

- :ref:`index-perf`
- :ref:`query-perf`
