Synopsis
--------

Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly, by
creating an small and efficient representation of the documents in the
collection. Read the ":doc:`/core/indexes`" documentation for more
information on the fundamentals of indexing in MongoDB, and the
":doc:`/administration/indexes`" documentation for operational
guidelines and examples for building and managing indexes.

This document provides an overview of approaches to indexing with
MongoDB and a selection of strategies that you can use as you develop
applications with MongoDB.

Strategies
----------

Use Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, MongoDB will be able to fulfill a query using *only*
the index, without needing to scan actual documents from the
database. To use a covered index you must:

- ensure that the index includes all of the fields in the result.

- if any of the indexed fields in any of the documents in the
  collection includes an array, then the index becomes a
  :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multi-key>` index, and cannot
  support a covered query.

- in the :term:`projection`, explicitly exclude the ``_id`` field from
  the result set, unless the index includes ``_id``.

Use the :func:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` to test the query. If
MongoDB was able to use a covered index, then the value of the
``indexOnly`` field will be ``true``.

Covered queries are much faster than other queries, for two reasons:
indexes are typically stored in RAM *or* located sequentially on
disk, and indexes are smaller than the documents they catalog.

Sort Using Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the :dbcommand:`sort` database command and the :func:`sort()
<cursor.sort()>` helper support in-memory sort operations without the
use of an index, these operations are:

#. Significantly slower than sort operations that use an index.

#. Abort when the sort operation consume 32 megabytes of memory.

For the best result, index the field you want sorted query
results. For example:

- if you have an ``{ username: 1 }`` index, you can use this index to
  return documents sorted by the ``username`` field.

  *MongoDB can return sorted results in either ascending or descending
  order using an index in ascending or descending order,* because
  MongoDB can transverse items in the index in both
  directions. For more information about index order see the section
  on ":ref:`Ascending and Descending Index Order
  <index-ascending-and-descending>`."

- MongoDB can use a compound index ``{ status: 1, username: 1 }`` to
  return a query on the ``status`` field sorted by the ``username``
  field.

When using compound indexes to support sort operations, the sorted
field must be the *last* field in the index.

Store Indexes in Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For best results, always ensure that your indexes fit entirely in RAM,
so the system doesn't need to read the index from disk to
fulfill a query. If your indexes approach or exceed the total size of
available RAM, they may not fit in memory.

You can check the size of your indexes in the :program:`mongo` shell,
using the :func:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` helper. You may also
use :dbcommand:`collStats` or :func:`db.collection.stats()` to return
this and :doc:`related information </reference/collection-statistics>`.

:func:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` returns data in bytes. Consider
the following invocation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.collection.totalIndexSize()
   4294976499

This reports a total index size of roughly 4 gigabytes. Consider this
value in contrast to the total amount of available system RAM and the
rest of the :term:`working set`. Also remember:

- if you have and use multiple collections to consider the size of
  all indexes on all collections.

- there are some :ref:`limited cases where indexes do not need to fit
  in RAM <indexing-right-handed>`.

Considerations
--------------

Above all, when developing your indexing strategy you should have a
deep understanding of:

- the application's queries.

- the relative frequency of each query in the application.

- the current indexes created for your collections.

- which indexes the most common queries use.

MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given operation.

Selectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~

Selectivity describes the ability of a query to narrow the result set
using the index. Effective indexes are more selective and allow
MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work associated
with fulfilling the query.

.. example::

   First, consider an index on a field that has three values evenly
   distributed across the collection. If MongoDB uses this index for a
   query, MongoDB will still need to scan a third of the
   :term:`documents <document>` in the collection to fulfill the rest
   of the query.

   Then, consider an index on a field that has many values evenly
   distributed across the collection. If your query selects one of
   these values using the index, MongoDB will only need to scan a very
   small number of documents to fulfill the rest of the query.

To ensure optimal performance, use indexes that are maximally
selective relative to your queries.

Insert Throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO insert link to /source/core/write-operations when that page is complete.

.. TODO fact check

MongoDB must update all indexes associated with a collection following
every insert or update operation. Every index on a collection adds
some amount of overhead to these operations. In almost every case, the
performance gains that indexes realize for read operations are worth
the insertion penalty; however:

- in some cases, an index to support an infrequent query may incur
  more insert-related costs, than saved read-time.

- in some situations, if you have many indexes on a collection with a
  high insert throughput and a number of very similar indexes, you may
  find better overall results by using a slightly less effective index
  on some queries if it means consolidating the total number of
  indexes.

Index Size
~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes require space, both on disk and in RAM. Indexes require less
space in RAM than the full documents in the collection. In theory, if
your queries only match a subset of the documents and can use the
index to locate those documents, MongoDB can maintain a much smaller
:term:`working set`. Ensure that:

- all of your indexes use less space than the documents in the
  collection.

- the indexes and a reasonable working set can fit RAM at the same
  time.

.. _indexing-right-handed:

Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the
value of the indexed field grows with every insert, and most queries
select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the
parts of the index that hold the most recent or "right-most" values in
RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write
operations and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the
index.
