Dashboard permissions dictate which |charts| users have access to the
dashboard and the actions they can perform on the dashboard. The
following dashboard permissions are available:

.. _dashboard-roles:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - Viewer
     - Can perform the following actions:
       
       - Open a dashboard and view charts that are backed by a data 
         source the user has permission to view. If the user doesn't 
         have the :ref:`Viewer <data-source-roles>` role on a chart's 
         backing data source, the dashboard doesn't render the chart.

         ``Viewers`` cannot make any modifications to the dashboard.

       - Filter dashboards based on available fields.

       - Configure auto-refresh settings and manually refresh dashboard
         data.

         .. note::

            .. include:: /includes/fact-auto-refresh-persistence.rst

   * - Author
     - Has all privileges of ``Viewer`` and can also:
     
       - Add, modify, and delete charts,
       - :ref:`Add <add-dashboard-filters>`, 
         :ref:`edit <edit-dashboard-filters>`, 
         and :ref:`delete <delete-dashboard-filters>` dashboard filters,
       - Specify which fields can be used for
         :ref:`Unauthenticated embedded chart filters
         <specify-filter-fields>`,
       - Change dashboard layout,
       - Rename the dashboard.

   * - Owner
     - Has all privileges of ``Author`` and can also:

       - :ref:`Manage permissions <dashboard-permissions>` on the
         dashboard
       - :ref:`Delete the dashboard <dashboard-delete>`.

       The creator of the dashboard automatically has the
       ``Owner`` permission. The creator cannot be removed from the
       list of dashboard users and their ``Owner`` permission cannot be
       modified.

To view a chart on a dashboard, the user must have both:

- The ``Viewer`` role (or higher) on the chart's data source
- Any role on the dashboard

.. admonition:: Default Dashboard Permissions
   :class: note

   You can have no permissions on a dashboard. That dashboard won't
   appear on your :ref:`dashboards page <dashboards-tab>`. Newly-created
   dashboards aren't shared by default. Only the dashboard ``Owner``
   can view the dashboard until they grant access to more users.

View Dashboard Permissions
--------------------------

To view permissions for a specific dashboard, hover over the icon
next to the dashboard's :guilabel:`Access` button. A tooltip appears
describing what permission you have on the dashboard, who the owner
of the dashboard is, and who else has access to the dashboard.

The following table lists the possible icons and their associated
permissions:

.. _dashboard-permission-icons:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Icon
     - Description

   * - :icon-fa5:`eye` Eye Icon
     - You have ``Viewer`` permission.

   * - :icon-fa5:`users` Group Icon
     - You have either ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`additional users <dashboard-specific-access>` or :ref:`Everyone <dashboard-access-everyone>` have
       some level of access to the dashboard.

   * - :icon-fa5:`lock` Lock Icon
     - You have ``Owner`` permission and no other user has
       access.

If you have ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and
:ref:`Anyone with this link <dashboard-access-link>` sharing is
enabled, the icon doesn't change.

Modify Dashboard Permissions
----------------------------

.. important::

   To modify a dashboard's :ref:`permissions <dashboard-roles>`, you
   must have the ``Owner`` role on that dashboard.

To modify dashboard permissions, either click the click the
:ref:`permission icon <dashboard-permission-icons>` at the top-right of
the dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-permission-icon.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard permission icon

Or click the :guilabel:`Access` button at the top-right of the
dashboard within the specific dashboard view:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-access-button.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard access button

With the :guilabel:`Dashboard Permissions` dialog open, read the
following sections to learn how to grant permissions to a dashboard to:

- :ref:`A specific user <dashboard-specific-access>`
- :ref:`All users on your MongoDB Charts deployment <dashboard-access-everyone>`
- :ref:`Any user with the download link <dashboard-access-link>`

.. _dashboard-specific-access:

Specific User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To give specific users permissions on the dashboard:

1. Search for the desired user using the search bar directly above
   where the dashboard users are listed. You can search for users
   by their username or email address.

#. Click the desired user to add them to the permissions list.

#. Use the dropdown to the right of the user's name to assign the
   appropriate :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>`.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when the desired user can't
      access one or more Data Sources used on the dashboard. The user
      can't see any charts that use that Data Source.

      - If you own a Data Source used in the dashboard, click
        :guilabel:`Grant <Level> Access` to assign the required
        permissions.

      - If you don't own a Data Source used in the dashboard, ask an
        Owner to grant permission to the desired user so they can view
        the data.

#. Repeat steps 1-3 for each user you would like to provide dashboard
   permissions for.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.

To remove permissions for a user, click the trash can icon to the right
of the user's name.

.. _dashboard-access-everyone:

Access for All Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow access to the dashboard for all users in your |service|
project:

1. Toggle the switch on the right-side of the :guilabel:`Everyone` user
   to ``On``.

#. Select the :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>` to apply to all
   |charts| users.

   A user's own permissions override others that could come from the
   :guilabel:`Everyone` setting.

   .. example::

      If :guilabel:`Everyone` has the :guilabel:`Author` permission and
      **Alice** has the :guilabel:`Viewer` permission, **Alice**'s
      effective permission is :guilabel:`Viewer`.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when
      :guilabel:`Everyone in <Project Name>` can't access one or more
      Data Sources used on the dashboard. A user might not see a chart
      that uses a Data Source that to which the user wasn't granted
      access.

      - If you own a Data Source used in the dashboard, click
        :guilabel:`Grant <Level> Access` to assign the required
        permissions to all users in the project.

      - If you don't own a Data Source used in the dashboard, ask an
        Owner to grant permission to Everyone to view the data.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.

.. _dashboard-access-link:

Access for Users with a Link to the Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to view a dashboard using a public link, enable
:ref:`Unauthenticated External Sharing <data-source-embedding>`
on each data source in the charts in the dashboard.

To allow access to the dashboard for users on your |charts|
deployment who have a direct link:

1. Toggle the switch on the right-side of the
   :guilabel:`Anyone with this link` user to ``On``.

   A user's permissions don't affect their ability to view a chart
   using a link. |charts| generates two links: a public and a private
   one. The public link has no permission requirements.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when the Data Source Owner
      hasn't enabled
      :ref:`Unauthenticated External Sharing <data-source-embedding>`.
      Users with the link won't be able to see the charts with the
      specified data source.

      - If you own a Data Source used in the dashboard, click
        :guilabel:`Enable External Sharing` to fix this issue.

      - If you don't own a Data Source used in the dashboard, ask an
        Owner to enable external sharing to view the data.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.

.. admonition:: Link Sharing with Sensitive Data
   :class: warning

   Don't share links to dashboards that display sensitive data. You
   can't verify who has access to the link.
