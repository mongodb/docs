==============================================================
Development Release Notes for MongoDB 2.8.0 Release Candidates
==============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.8 is currently in development. While 2.8 release candidates
are currently available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing
only and not for production use**.

Major Changes
-------------

Storage Engines: Pluggable API, Improved Concurrency, Document-Level Locking with Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. RF: added the storage engine API first; makes it easier to introduce new
.. storage engines

MongoDB 2.8 includes a pluggable storage engine API that allows third
parties to develop storage engines with MongoDB.

MongoDB 2.8 includes support for two storage engines: MMAPv1, the
storage engine available in previous versions of MongoDB, and
`WiredTiger <http://wiredtiger.com>`_. By
default, in 2.8 MongoDB uses the MMAPv1 engine.

The 2.8 MMAPv1 storage engine adds support for collection-level
locking by default.

The 2.8 WiredTiger storage engine provides document-level locking
and compression. WiredTiger supports all MongoDB features and can
interoperate with MMAPv1 in the same replica set or sharded cluster, but
requires a change to the on-disk storage format. To convert an existing
data set to WiredTiger, you can either:

- upgrade replica sets in a rolling manner. See
  :ref:`2.8-upgrade-replica-set` or :ref:`2.8-upgrade-cluster`, or

- use :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` to import
  data.

To enable WiredTiger, start MongoDB with the following option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger

If you attempt to start a :program:`mongod` with a
:setting:`storage.dbPath` that contains data files produced by a
storage engine other than the one specified by ``--storageEngine``,
:program:`mongod` will refuse to start.

The behavior and properties of the ``wiredTiger`` storage engine are
configurable using the following :setting:`storage.wiredTiger` configuration
options. You can set :ref:`WiredTiger options on the command line
<cli-wiredtiger-options>`.

All existing server, database, and collection reporting exposes
statistics from WiredTiger.

WiredTiger compresses collection data by default using :term:`snappy`.

WiredTiger uses :term:`prefix compression` on all indexes by default.

Increased Number of Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB replica sets now support larger maximum replica set sizes up
to 50 members. As in earlier releases, replica sets may only have a
maximum of 7 voting members.

Use the following drivers with larger replica sets:

- C# (.NET) Driver 1.10
- Java Driver 2.13
- Python Driver (PyMongo) 3.0+
- Ruby Driver 2.0+
- Node.JS Driver 2.0+

Because the C, C++, Perl, PHP, and earlier versions of the Ruby,
Python, and Node.JS drivers discover and monitor replica set members
serially, these drivers are not suitable for use with large replica
sets.

Pymongo 3.0, the Ruby Driver 2.0, and the Node.JS Driver 2.0 are currently
in development.

New Query Introspection System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.8 includes a new query introspection system that provides an
improved output format and a finer-grained introspection into both
query plan and query execution.

For details, see the new :method:`db.collection.explain()` method and
the new :dbcommand:`explain` command as well as the updated
:method:`cursor.explain()` method.

For information on the format of the new output, see
:doc:`/reference/explain-results`.

Security Improvements
---------------------

New ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` Password Authentication Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.8 adds a new ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` password authentication
mechanism.

Changes to the Localhost Exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.8 increases restrictions when using the
:ref:`localhost-exception` to access MongoDB. For details, see
:ref:`2.8-compatibility-localhost`.
