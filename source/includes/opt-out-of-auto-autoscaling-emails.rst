Starting on July 31, 2024, |service| replaces legacy auto-scaling notification
emails with configurable :ref:`auto-scaling events <alert-conditions-autoscaling>`.
By default, |service| continues to send all alert notifications to the project owners.
You can :ref:`customize your auto-scaling alert distribution <configure-autoscaling-alert>` to change alert recipients or a distribution method.
