MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the {+driver-short+} for use with a specific version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/lifecycle-schedule-callout.rst

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/mongodb-compatibility-table-kotlin.rst

The driver does not support older versions of MongoDB.

For more information on how to read the compatibility table, see our guide on
`MongoDB Compatibility Tables <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/about-compatibility/>`__.

Language Compatibility
----------------------

The {+driver-long+} requires Kotlin 1.8 or later.
