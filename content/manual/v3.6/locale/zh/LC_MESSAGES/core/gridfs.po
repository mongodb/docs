":term:`GridFS` is a specification for storing and retrieving files that "

"Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides the file "
"into parts, or chunks [#chunk-disambiguation]_, and stores each chunk as "
"a separate document. By default, GridFS uses a default chunk size of 255 "
"kB; that is, GridFS divides a file into chunks of 255 kB with the "
"exception of the last chunk. The last chunk is only as large as "
"necessary. Similarly, files that are no larger than the chunk size only "
"have a final chunk, using only as much space as needed plus some "
"additional metadata."

"Do not use GridFS if you need to update the content of the entire file "
