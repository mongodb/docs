View and Export Chart Data

While editing a chart in the Chart Builder, you can view underlying
data from the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` dropdown menu. Access to
underlying data is intended to help you build meaningful charts as well
as export that data for use with third-party tools.

.. _view-source-documents:

View Source Documents
---------------------

Once you have selected a :doc:`data source <data-sources>` for your
chart, you can view 20 sample documents from that data source by
clicking the :guilabel:`View Source Documents` menu option.

.. note::
   If you want to explore your data source beyond 20 sample documents,
   you can use :compass:`Compass </>` or the 
   :atlas:`Atlas Data Explorer </data-explorer/>`.

The sample documents are intended for reference to help you build a
chart. The documents do not reflect any groupings or projections
applied to an existing chart (i.e. any :guilabel:`Encode` panel options
in the Chart Builder). The documents are produced with a query on your
data source that considers:

- :ref:`Pipelines applied to the data source <data-sources-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Sample mode <charts-sample-mode>` (if toggled on)

- :ref:`Queries <query-bar>` or
  :ref:`pipelines specified in the Chart Builder <charts-agg-pipeline>`
  
- Filters applied in the :ref:`Filter Tab <filter-tab>`

.. _get-chart-data:

Get Chart Data
--------------

After you have configured a valid chart, you can view the data
displayed on the chart as a table. Each row in the table represents a
data point. To view the chart data, click the :guilabel:`Get Chart Data`
menu option.

From the :guilabel:`Chart Data` dialog, you can download your
chart data as a CSV or JSON file. This is useful for analyzing data
with third-party tools.

.. admonition:: Considerations
   :class: important

   Some Chart Builder configuration options (e.g. the :guilabel:`Limit
   Results` option and the :guilabel:`Multiplier` field-level option)
   apply only to the chart visualization and do not affect the
   underlying data. The :guilabel:`Chart Data` table displays
   underlying data, meaning some configuration options you see
   reflected on a chart may not be applied to the table. Review your
   data to verify its contents.

   :figwidth: 60%
   :alt: Viewing chart data will display a table of the values used to create a chart. It also allows for downloading a CSV or JSON representation of that table.
