This section describes the options that you can use with the
:pipeline:`$search` stage to improve the performance of your queries
under certain conditions:

   * - Use Case 
     - Option

   * - Run queries that can benefit from parallel execution such as
       queries accessing different parts of a large dataset
       simultaneously and improve each individual query latency. 
     - :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>`

   * - Return the documents stored directly on ``mongot`` and minimize
       the overhead of fetching entire documents from the database after
       retrieving the search results.
