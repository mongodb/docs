title: Create the data and log directories.
ref: create-dirs
content: |

   Create a directory where the MongoDB instance stores its data. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mkdir -p /data/db

   Create a directory where the MongoDB instance stores its log. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb

   The user that starts the MongoDB process must have read and write
   permission to the directories.

title: Run MongoDB.
ref: start-mdb
content: |
   
   To run MongoDB, run the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process at the system 
   prompt.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log --fork

   For details on the command-line options :option:`--dbpath <mongod
   --dbpath>` and :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`, see
   :ref:`mongod-options`.

   If the ``mongod`` binary was not installed to a ``$PATH`` folder
   available to ``sudo`` (i.e. ``/usr/bin/``), specify the full
   path to the ``mongod`` instead:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /path/to/<mongodb-install-directory>-{+release+}/bin/mongod \
        --dbpath /data/db --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod-log --fork

   Replace ``/path/to/<mongodb-install-directory>`` with the full path
   to the extracted tarball contents.

title: "Verify that MongoDB has started successfully."
ref: verify
pre: |
  Verify that MongoDB has started successfully by
  checking the process output for the following line in the 
  log file ``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``:
action:
  language: none
  copyable: false
  code: |
    [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
post: |

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see the log line shown above, you can safely
  ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of MongoDB.

title: Begin using MongoDB.
ref: begin-using-mongodb
pre: |

  Start a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell on the same host machine as the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`. You can run the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
  without any command-line options to connect to a
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` that is running on your localhost with default
  port 27017:

action:
  language: shell
  code: |

     mongo
post: |

  For more information on connecting using the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell, such as to connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running
  on a different host and/or port, see :doc:`/mongo`.

  To help you start using MongoDB, MongoDB provides :ref:`Getting
  Started Guides <getting-started>` in various driver editions. See
  :ref:`getting-started` for the available editions.

  mongod: ":binary:`~bin.mongod`"
