Overview
--------

Associations in {+odm+} allow you to create relationships between models. In
this guide, you can learn about the different types of associations that
{+odm+} supports and how to use them in your application.

Referenced Associations
-----------------------

Referenced associations allow you to create a relationship between two models
where one model references the other. {+odm+} supports the following referenced
association types:

- ``has_one``
- ``has_many``
- ``belongs_to``
- ``has_and_belongs_to_many``

The following sections describe how to use each of these association types.

Has One
~~~~~~~

You can use the ``has_one`` macro to declare that documents represented by one class also contain a
document represented by a separate child class. The
following example creates a ``Band`` class with a ``has_one`` relationship to a
``Studio`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-one
   :end-before: # end-has-one

When you declare a ``has_one`` association, the child class must also use the
``belongs_to`` association that references the parent class. The following
example shows the ``Studio`` class referenced in the preceding ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-one-child
   :end-before: # end-has-one-child

To learn more about the ``belongs_to`` macro, see the :ref:`Belongs To
<mongoid-belongs-to>` section.

You can use validations to ensure that the child
class is present in your parent class, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-one-validation
   :end-before: # end-has-one-validation
   :emphasize-lines: 6

To learn more about validations in {+odm+}, see the :ref:`Validations
<mongoid-modeling-validation>` guide.

Has Many
~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``has_many`` macro to declare that documents represented by a class contain
multiple child documents represented by another class. The following
example creates a ``Band`` class with a ``has_many`` relationship to a
``Members`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many
   :end-before: # end-has-many

When you declare a ``has_many`` association, the child class must also use the
``belongs_to`` association that references the parent class. The following
example shows the ``Member`` class referenced in the preceding ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-child
   :end-before: # end-has-many-child

To learn more about the ``belongs_to`` macro, see the :ref:`Belongs To
<mongoid-belongs-to>` section.

You can use validations to ensure that the child
class is present in your parent class, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-validation
   :end-before: # end-has-many-validation
   :emphasize-lines: 6

To learn more about validations in {+odm+}, see the :ref:`Validations
<mongoid-modeling-validation>` guide.

Retrieve Association Information
````````````````````````````````

You can use the ``any?`` method on a ``has_many`` association to determine if the
association contains any documents without retrieving the entire set of
documents from the database.

The following example uses the ``any?`` method to determine if documents in the
``Band`` class contain any ``Members`` documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-any
   :end-before: # end-has-many-any

You can also use the ``any?`` method with a filter to find documents that match
a specified criteria, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-any-filter
   :end-before: # end-has-many-any-filter

You can supply a class name to the ``any?`` method to filter the results by the
name of the class. This is useful for polymorphic associations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-any-class
   :end-before: # end-has-many-any-class

.. note::

   After the data of the associated class is loaded to {+odm+}, subsequent calls
   to the ``any?`` method do not query the database. Instead, {+odm+} uses the
   data that is already loaded in memory.

You can also call the ``exists?`` method to determine if there are any persisted
documents in the association. The ``exists?`` method always queries the
database and checks only for documents that have been saved to the database.
The ``exists?`` method does not allow for filtering and does not accept any
arguments.

The following example uses the ``exists?`` method to determine if there are any persisted
``Members`` documents in the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-many-exists
   :end-before: # end-has-many-exists

.. _mongoid-belongs-to:

Belongs To
~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``belongs_to`` macro to declare that a document represented by one class
is a child of a document represented by another
class. By default, the ``_id`` field of the parent class is stored in the child
class. The following example creates a ``Members`` class with a ``belongs_to``
association to a ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-belongs-to
   :end-before: # end-belongs-to

You can allow {+odm+} to persist documents to the database without storing the
``_id`` of the associated parent class by setting the ``optional`` option to
``true``, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-belongs-to-optional
   :end-before: # end-belongs-to-optional

.. tip::

   You can globally change the default behavior of the ``belongs_to``
   association to not require their parent class by setting the
   ``belongs_to_required_by_default`` configuration option to ``false`` in your
   application's configuration settings.

You can specify a ``belongs_to`` association in a child class without specifying a matching
``has_one`` or ``has_many`` association in the parent class. When doing so, you
can't access the fields of the child document from the parent class, but you can
access the parent fields that are stored in the child class, such as the
parent's ``_id`` field. In the following example, the ``Band``
class cannot access the ``Members`` class, but the ``Members`` class can access the
``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-belongs-to-one-way
   :end-before: # end-belongs-to-one-way

For clarity, you can optionally set the ``inverse_of`` option to ``nil`` to
indicate that the parent class does not contain a ``has_one`` or ``has_many``
association to the child class, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-belongs-to-inverse
   :end-before: # end-belongs-to-inverse

Has and Belongs To Many
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` macro to declare that a class model contains
a many-to-many relationship with another class. In a many-to-many relationship,
each document in one class can be associated with multiple documents in another
class. The following example creates a ``Band`` class with a
``has_and_belongs_to_many`` relationship to a ``Members`` class. A ``Band`` document can
reference multiple ``Members`` documents, and a ``Members`` document can
reference multiple ``Band`` documents.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-and-belongs-to-many
   :end-before: # end-has-and-belongs-to-many

When you declare a ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` association, both model instances
store a list of the associated document's ``_id`` values. You can set the
``inverse_of`` option to ``nil`` to store the associated document's ``_id`` values in
only one of the model instances. The following example prompts {+odm+} to store
the associated document's ``_id`` values in only the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-has-and-belongs-to-many-inverse
   :end-before: # end-has-and-belongs-to-many-inverse

.. tip::

   When you update a document that has a ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` association,
   {+odm+} sets the ``updated_at`` field of updated document but does not set the
   ``updated_at`` field of the associated documents.

Query Referenced Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use an aggregation pipeline to query for documents across referenced
associations. The aggregation pipeline allows you to create queries across
multiple collections and manipulate data into a specified format. To learn more
about using the aggregation pipeline, see the :ref:`Aggregation
<mongoid-aggregation>` guide.

For simple queries, you can query the association directly. When you directly
query on a collection, you can query only on fields and values that are in the
collection itself. You cannot directly query on collections
associated to the one you are querying.

For example, consider the following ``Band`` and ``Tour`` classes:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-query-models
   :end-before: # end-query-models

The following example queries the ``Tour`` class for documents that have a
``year`` value of ``2000`` or greater and saves the ``band_id`` of those
documents. It then queries the ``Band`` class for documents that have those
``band_id`` values.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-association-query
   :end-before: # end-association-query

Embedded Associations
---------------------

You can use embedded associations to store different types of documents in the
same collection. {+odm+} supports embedded associations with the following 
macros:

- ``embeds_one``
- ``embeds_many``
- ``embedded_in``
- ``recursively_embeds_one``
- ``recursively_embeds_many``

The following sections describe how to use these association types.

Embeds One
~~~~~~~~~~

To specify that a class model contains an embedded document of a different
class type, use the ``embeds_one`` macro in the parent class and the ``embedded_in``
macro in the embedded class. The following example creates a ``Band`` class with
an embedded ``Label`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-one
   :end-before: # end-embed-one

{+odm+} stores documents embedded with the ``embeds_one`` macro in the
parent document as a field with the same name as the embedded class. The
preceding ``Label`` documents are stored in the ``Band`` document, as shown in
the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-one-stored
   :end-before: # end-embed-one-stored

You can store the embedded document with a different name by using the
``store_as`` option, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-store-as
   :end-before: # end-embed-store-as

Embeds Many
~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify that a class model contains multiple embedded documents of a
different class type, use the ``embeds_many`` macro in the parent class and the
``embedded_in`` macro in the embedded class. The following example creates a
``Band`` class with multiple embedded ``Album`` type documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-many
   :end-before: # end-embed-many

{+odm+} stores documents embedded with the ``embeds_many`` macro in the
parent document as an array field with the same name as the embedded class. The
preceding ``Album`` documents are stored in the ``Band`` document, as shown in
the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-many-stored
   :end-before: # end-embed-many-stored

You can store the embedded document with a different name by using the
``store_as`` option, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embed-many-store-as
   :end-before: # end-embed-many-store-as

Recursive Embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can embed one or more documents of the same type into a parent
class by using the ``recursively_embeds_one`` and ``recursively_embeds_many``
macros. Both macros provide accessors for the parent and child documents through
a ``parent_*`` method and a ``child_*`` method, where ``*`` represents the name
of the class. The following example creates a ``Band`` class that recursively
embeds multiple other ``Band`` documents to represent multiple band names:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-recursive-embed
   :end-before: # end-recursive-embed

You can access the parent and child documents through the ``parent_band`` and
``child_band`` methods, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-recursive-embed-access
   :end-before: # end-recursive-embed-access

Query Embedded Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access embedded documents when querying the collection of the parent
class by using dot notation.

The following example uses dot notation to query ``Tour`` type documents that
are embedded in a ``Band`` class. The query returns documents that have a
``tours.year`` value of ``2000`` or greater:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-query
   :end-before: # end-embedded-query

You can use the ``pluck`` projection method to retrieve embedded documents
without retrieving their associated parent documents, as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-query-pluck
   :end-before: # end-embedded-query-pluck

You can use {+odm+} query methods to perform **embedded matching**, which allows
you to query on embedded associations of documents that are already loaded in
the application. {+odm+} implements embedded matching without sending queries to
the server.

The following query operators are supported with embedded matching:

- :manual:`Comparison operators </reference/operator/query-comparison/>`
- :manual:`Logical operators </reference/operator/query-logical/>`
- :manual:`Array query operators </reference/operator/query-array/>`
- :manual:`$exists </reference/operator/query/exists/>`
- :manual:`$mod </reference/operator/query/mod/>`
- :manual:`$type </reference/operator/query/type/>`
- :manual:`$regex </reference/operator/query/regex/>`
- :manual:`Bitwise operators </reference/operator/query-bitwise/>`
- :manual:`$comment </reference/operator/query/comment/>`

The following example queries the embedded ``tours`` field of a loaded ``Band``
document by using the ``$gte`` comparison operator:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-matching
   :end-before: # end-embedded-matching

Embedded matching on loaded documents has the following known limitations:

- Embedded matching is not implemented for the following features:
  
  - :ref:`Text search <mongoid-data-text-search>`
  - :manual:`Geospatial queries </reference/operator/query-geospatial/>`
  - Operators that execute JavaScript code, such as :manual:`$where
    </reference/operator/query/where/>`
  - Operators that are implemented through other server functionality, such as
    :manual:`$expr </reference/operator/query/expr/>`
    and :manual:`$jsonSchema
    </reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/>`

- {+odm+} expands ``Range`` arguments to hashes with ``$gte`` and ``$lte``
  conditions. This can lead to invalid queries in some cases and raises a an
  ``InvalidQuery`` exception.

- With the ``$regex`` operator, you cannot specify a regular expression object
  as a pattern while also providing options to the ``$options`` field. You can
  only provide options if the regular expression pattern is a string.

- {+mdb-server+} versions 4.0 and earlier do not strictly validate ``$type``
  arguments.

Omit _id Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+odm+} adds an ``_id`` field to embedded documents. You can omit
this field from embedded documents by explicitly specifying the ``_id`` field in
your model and omitting the default value. The following example instructs {+odm+}
not to add an ``_id`` field to the ``Albums`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-omit-id
   :end-before: # end-embedded-omit-id
   :emphasize-lines: 4

In the preceding ``Albums`` class, the ``_id`` field is not automatically added.
Without a default value, {+odm+} does not store the value in the database
unless you provide one in your model.

Delete Embedded Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete child documents from ``embeds_many`` associations by using one of
the following methods:

- ``clear``
- ``delete_all``
- ``destroy_all``

The ``clear`` method uses the :manual:`$unset operator
</reference/operator/update/unset>` operator to remove an entire embedded
association from the parent document. The ``clear`` method does not run any
``destroy`` callbacks. The following example uses the ``clear``
method to remove all embedded associations from the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-clear
   :end-before: # end-embedded-clear

The ``delete_all`` method uses the :manual:`$pullAll operator
</reference/operator/update/pullAll>` operator to remove documents in an
embedded association. ``delete_all`` loads the association if it has not
yet been loaded, then only removes the documents that exist in the application.
The ``delete_all`` method does not run any ``destroy`` callbacks. 
The following example uses the ``delete_all`` method to remove all embedded
``Album`` documents from the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-delete-all
   :end-before: # end-embedded-delete-all

The ``destroy_all`` method also uses the :manual:`$pullAll operator
</reference/operator/update/pullAll>` operator to remove documents in an
embedded association. It also runs any ``destroy`` callbacks that are defined on
the associated documents. The following example uses the ``destroy_all``
method to remove all embedded ``Album`` documents from the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/associations.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-embedded-destroy-all
   :end-before: # end-embedded-destroy-all

Customize Association Behavior
------------------------------

You can use {+odm+} to customize how associations behave in your application.
The following sections describe ways to customize association behaviors.

Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~

Extensions allow you to add custom functionality to an association. You can
define an extension on an association by specifying a block in the association
definition, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-extensions
   :end-before: # end-extensions
   :emphasize-lines: 4-6

Custom Association Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``class_name`` macro to specify a custom class name for an
association. This is useful when you want to name the association something other
than the name of the class. The following example uses the
``class_name`` macro to specify that an embedded association called ``records``
represents the ``Album`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-custom-name
   :end-before: # end-custom-name

Custom Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+odm+} uses the ``_id`` field of the parent class when looking up
associations. You can specify different fields to use by using the
``primary_key`` and ``foreign_key`` macros. The following example specifies a new
primary and foreign key for the ``albums`` association on a ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-custom-keys
   :end-before: # end-custom-keys

If you are specifying a ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` association, you can also
use the ``inverse_primary_key`` and ``inverse_foreign_key`` macros. The
``inverse_primary_key`` macro specifies the field on the local model that the
remote model uses to look up the documents.
The ``inverse_foreign_key`` macro specifies the field on the remote model
that stores the values found in ``inverse_primary_key``.

The following example specifies a new primary and foreign key for the
``Band`` and ``Members`` classes in a ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` association:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-custom-inverse-keys
   :end-before: # end-custom-inverse-keys
   :emphasize-lines: 9, 20

Custom Scopes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the scope of an association by using the ``scope`` parameter.
The ``scope`` parameter determines the documents that {+odm+} considers part
of an association. A scoped association returns only documents that match the
scope conditions when queried. You can set the ``scope`` to either a ``Proc`` with an arity
of zero or a ``Symbol`` that references a named scope on the associated model.
The following example sets custom scopes on associations in a ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-custom-scope
   :end-before: # end-custom-scope

.. note::

   You can add documents that do not match the scope conditions to an
   association. {+odm+} saves the documents to the database and they will appear
   in associated memory. However, you won't see the documents when querying the
   association.

Validations
~~~~~~~~~~~

When {+odm+} loads an association into memory, by default, it uses the
``validates_associated`` macro to validate that any children are also present.
{+odm+} validates children for the following association types:

- ``embeds_many``
- ``embeds_one``
- ``has_many``
- ``has_one``
- ``has_and_belongs_to_many``

You can turn off this validation behavior by setting the ``validate`` macro to
``false`` when defining the association, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-validation-false
   :end-before: # end-validation-false

Polymorphism
~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} supports polymorphism on the child classes of one-to-one and one-to-many associations.
Polymorphic associations allows a single association to contain objects of different class
types. You can define a polymorphic association by setting the ``polymorphic``
option to ``true`` in a child association and adding the ``as`` option to the
parent association. The following example creates a polymorphic association in a
``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-polymorphic
   :end-before: # end-polymorphic

In the preceding example, the ``:featured`` association in the ``Band`` class can contain either a
``Label`` or ``Album`` document.

.. important::

   {+odm+} supports polymorphism only from child to parent. You cannot specify
   a parent ``has_one`` or ``has_many`` association as polymorphic.

``has_and_belongs_to_many`` associations do not support polymorphism.

Custom Polymorphic Types
````````````````````````

Starting in version 9.0.2, {+odm+} supports custom polymorphic types through
a global registry. You can specify alternative keys to represent different
classes, decoupling your code from the data. The following example specifies
the string ``"artist"`` as an alternate key for the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-custom-polymorphic
   :end-before: # end-custom-polymorphic

In the preceding example, the ``identify_as`` directive instructs {+odm+}
to store the ``Band`` class in the database as the string ``"artist"``. 

You can also specify multiple aliases, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-multiple-alias
   :end-before: # end-multiple-alias

In the preceding example, ``artist`` is the default name and the others are used
only for looking up records. This allows you to refactor your
code without breaking the associations in your data. 

Polymorphic type aliases are global. The keys you specify must be unique across your
entire code base. However, you can register alternative resolvers that
can be used for different subsets of your models. In this case, the keys must
be unique only for each resolver. The following example shows how to register
alternate resolvers:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-polymorphic-resolvers
   :end-before: # end-polymorphic-resolvers

Both ``Music::Band`` and ``Tools::Band`` are aliased as 
``"bnd"``, but each model uses its own resolver to avoid conflicts.

Dependent Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide ``dependent`` options to referenced associations to specify how
{+odm+} handles associated documents when a document is deleted. You can specify
the following options:

- ``delete_all``: Deletes all child documents without running any model
  callbacks.
- ``destroy``: Deletes the child documents and runs all model callbacks.
- ``nullify``: Sets the foreign key of the child documents to ``nil``. The child
  document might become orphaned if it is referenced by only the parent.
- ``restrict_with_exception``: Raises an exception if the child document is not
  empty.
- ``restrict_with_error``: Cancels the operation and returns ``false`` if the
  child document is not empty.

If you don't specify any ``dependent`` options, {+odm+} leaves the child
document unchanged when the parent document is deleted. The child document
continues to reference the deleted parent document, and if it is
referenced through only the parent, the child document becomes orphaned.

The following example specifies ``dependent`` options on the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-dependent
   :end-before: # end-dependent

Autosave Referenced Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+odm+} does not automatically save associated documents from
non-embedded associations when saving the parent document. This can
result in dangling references to documents that don't exist.

You can use the ``autosave`` option on a referenced association to
automatically save associated documents when saving the parent document. The
following example creates a ``Band`` class with an associated ``Album`` class
and specifies the ``autosave`` option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-autosave
   :end-before: # end-autosave
   :emphasize-lines: 10

.. note::

   {+odm+} automatically adds autosave functionality to an association that uses
   the ``accepts_nested_attributes_for`` option.

You do not need to specify the ``autosave`` option for embedded associations
because {+odm+} saves embedded documents in the parent document.

Autobuild
~~~~~~~~~

You can add the ``autobuild`` option to one-to-one associations, such as
``has_one`` and ``embeds_one``, to automatically instantiate a new document when
accessing a ``nil`` association. The following example adds the ``autobuild``
option to an association on the ``Band`` class:

Touch
~~~~~

When {+odm+} *touches* a document, it updates the document's
``updated_at`` field to the current date and time. You can add the ``touch``
option to any ``belongs_to`` association to ensure that {+odm+} touches the
parent document whenever the child document is updated. The following example
adds the ``touch`` option to an association on the ``Band`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-touch
   :end-before: # end-touch

You can also use the ``touch`` option to specify another field on the parent
association, as a string or a symbol. When {+odm+} touches the parent
association, it sets both the ``updated_at`` field and the specified field
to the current date and time.

The following example instructs {+odm+} to touch the ``bands_updated_at`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-touch-specific
   :end-before: # end-touch-specific

.. note::

   In embedded associations, when an embedded document is touched, {+odm+}
   touches its parents recursively. Because of this, adding a ``touch``
   attribute to an ``embedded_in`` association is unnecessary. 
   
   {+odm+} does not support specifying additional fields to touch in
   ``embedded_in`` associations.

Counter Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``counter_cache`` option to store the number of objects
that belong to an associated field. When you specify this option, {+odm+} stores
an extra attribute on the associated models to store the count. Because of this,
you must specify the ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` module in the associated
classes. 

The following example adds the ``counter_cache`` option to a ``Band``
class and specifies the ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` in a ``Label`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-counter-cache
   :end-before: # end-counter-cache
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 9

Association Metadata
--------------------

When you define an association, {+odm+} stores metadata about that association.
You can access the metadata by calling the ``reflect_on_association`` method on
a model class or document, or by directly accessing the metadata on a specific
document. The following example shows how to access metadata by using the
``reflect_on_association`` method and by direct access:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-access-metadata
   :end-before: # end-access-metadata

.. note::

   Replace ``<association_name>`` in the preceding example with the name of your
   association.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

All associations contain attributes that store information about the associated
document. Associations contain the following attributes:

- ``_target``: The proxied document or documents
- ``_base``: The document on which the association is defined
- ``_association``: Information about the association

The following example accesses each of the preceding attributes:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/data-modeling/association-behaviors.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-attributes
   :end-before: # end-attributes

The following table shows the information stored in the ``_association``
attribute:
