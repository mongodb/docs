You can manage the collections in your {+database-deployments+} using
the {+atlas-ui+} and {+mongosh+}. 

Required Roles

The following table describes the roles required to manage the
collections in an {+service+} project:

.. _atlas-ui-create-a-collection:

Create a Collection
-------------------

.. tip::

   To create the first collection in a new database, see
   :ref:`atlas-ui-create-a-db`.

.. important::

   You cannot create new collections on the ``config`` and
   ``system`` databases. |service| will deprecate writing to existing
   collections on these databases in the near future.

To create a collection in an existing database through the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. sharedinclude:: cet/atlas/data-explorer/steps-atlas-ui-create-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-view-collections:

View Collections
----------------

To view the databases and collections in the cluster through the
{+atlas-ui+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

      |service| shows the databases in the left pane of the {+atlas-ui+}.

   .. step:: View the collections in a database.

      Click on the name of the database.

      .. note::

         |service| bases the document count that appears on this tab 
         on cached metadata using :manual:`collStats 
         </reference/command/collStats/>`. This count might differ from 
         the actual document count in the collection. For example, an 
         :manual:`unexpected shutdown 
         </reference/command/collStats/#behavior>` can throw off the 
         count. Use the :manual:`db.collection.countDocuments() 
         </reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/>` method for 
         the most accurate document count.

.. _atlas-ui-visualize-a-collection:

Visualize Collection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To launch |charts| to visualize data in your databases and collections.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

   .. step:: Launch |charts|.

      .. include:: includes/fact-charts-activation.rst

.. _atlas-ui-drop-a-collection:

Drop a Collection
-----------------

To drop a collection, including its documents and indexes, through the
{+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-ui-drop-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection
------------------

If you have large data sets and perform high throughput operations, you 
can :manual:`shard </sharding>` a collection to distribute data across 
the shards. 

You cannot shard a collection through the {+atlas-ui+}. To shard a
collection, first confirm that your cluster is a :ref:`sharded cluster
<create-cluster-sharding>`, then take the following steps to shard the
collection in {+mongosh+}: 

.. include:: /includes/steps/shard-collection.rst

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Collections with Collation </atlas-ui/collections/collation-collection>
   Clustered Collections </atlas-ui/collections/clustered-collection>
   Time Series Collections </atlas-ui/collections/time-series-collection>
