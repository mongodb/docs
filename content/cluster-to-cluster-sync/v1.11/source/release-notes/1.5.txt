1.5.0 Release
-------------

**July 25, 2023**

Oplog Rollover Resilience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.5.0, ``mongosync`` begins to apply changes while the
initial sync is still in progress. By starting to apply changes earlier,
``mongosync`` maintains a more recent position in the :term:`oplog`.
This adds resilience to long-running operations, mitigates the risk
of ``oplog`` rollover, and significantly lowers the risk of restarting
the sync.

Logging Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.5.0, the default logging level is ``DEBUG``.  To change
the logging level, see the :setting:`verbosity` setting.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes an issue where very large collections could timeout during 
  ``mongosync`` initialization. 

- Fixes an issue where ``mongosync`` could incorrectly report indexes 
  as mismatched.

- Fixes an issue where the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` endpoint would not return
  an error when passed a ``sharding`` object without the ``shardingEntries``
  key.

- Changes telemetry to send less metadata to Segment.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.5, the minimum supported version of MongoDB is 6.0.8.
