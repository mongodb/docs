Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to search **geospatial data** by using the
{+driver-short+}. Geospatial data represents a geographic location on the surface
of the Earth or on a Euclidean plane.

Examples of geospatial data include:

- Locations of movie theaters
- Borders of countries
- Routes of bicycle rides
- Dog exercise areas in New York City
- Points on a graph

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Store Geospatial Data <rust-store-geo>` describes the data formats you can use to
  represent geospatial data

- :ref:`Geospatial Indexes <rust-indexes-geo>` describes how to create an index on fields
  storing geospatial data 

- :ref:`Geospatial Queries <rust-query-geo>` describes how to query geospatial
  data stored in indexed fields

- :ref:`Additional Resources <rust-addtl-info-geo>` provides links to resources and
  API documentation for types and methods mentioned in this guide

.. _rust-store-geo:

Store Geospatial Data
---------------------

All geospatial data in MongoDB is stored in one of the following formats:

- GeoJSON, a format that represents geospatial data on an Earth-like
  sphere

- Legacy Coordinate Pair, a format that represents geospatial data
  on a Euclidean plane

GeoJSON
~~~~~~~

Use GeoJSON to store data that represents geospatial information on
an Earth-like sphere. GeoJSON is composed of one or more **positions**
and a **type**.

Positions
`````````

A position represents a single place on Earth and exists in code as an array
containing the following values:

- Longitude in the first position
- Latitude in the second position 

The following code represents the **position** of the MongoDB Headquarters in
New York City, NY:

.. code-block:: rust
   :copyable: false

   let coords = vec! [-73.986805, 40.7620853];

.. important:: Longitude then Latitude

  GeoJSON orders coordinates as **longitude** first and **latitude** second.
  This conflicts with geographic coordinate system conventions, which generally list
  latitude first and longitude second. Ensure that you reformat your coordinates to
  align with GeoJSON standards.

Types
`````

Your GeoJSON object's type determines the geometric shape it represents. Geometric shapes are
made up of positions.

The following list describes common GeoJSON types and how to specify them with positions:

- ``Point``: a single position. For example, the following ``Point`` represents the location of
  the MongoDB Headquarters:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
     :start-after: start-point
     :end-before: end-point
     :language: rust
     :dedent:

- ``LineString``: an array of two or more positions that forms a series of line
  segments. A ``LineString`` can represent a path, route, border, or any other linear
  geospatial data. For example, the following ``LineString`` represents a segment of
  `the Great Wall of China <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GreatWallChina4.png>`__:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
     :start-after: start-linestring
     :end-before: end-linestring
     :language: rust
     :dedent:

- ``Polygon``: an array of positions in which the first and last
  position are the same and enclose some space. For example, the following
  ``Polygon`` represents `the land within Vatican City
  <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vatican_City_map_EN.png>`__:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
     :start-after: start-polygon
     :end-before: end-polygon
     :language: rust
     :dedent:

To learn more about the GeoJSON types that you can use in MongoDB, see the
:manual:`GeoJSON </reference/geojson/>` page in the Server manual.

Legacy Coordinate Pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use legacy coordinate pairs to represent geospatial data on a two-dimensional
Euclidean plane.

The following code specifies a legacy coordinate pair that represents the
location of Washington, D.C.:

.. code-block:: rust
   :copyable: false

   let capital = vec! [-77.0369, 38.9072];


To learn more about legacy coordinate pairs, see
:manual:`Legacy Coordinate Pairs </geospatial-queries/#legacy-coordinate-pairs>`
in the Server manual.

.. _rust-indexes-geo:

Geospatial Indexes
------------------

Before querying geospatial data, you must create an index that corresponds
to the data format. The following index types enable geospatial queries:

- ``2dsphere`` for GeoJSON data
- ``2d`` for legacy coordinate pairs

The following sections on ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes include code examples
that use the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database from the
Atlas sample data.

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about creating an index, see the :ref:`rust-indexes` guide.

   For instructions on importing the Atlas sample data, see the :atlas:`Load Sample Data
   </sample-data>` page.

2dsphere
~~~~~~~~

To query data stored in the GeoJSON format, add the field containing
both the ``type`` and ``coordinates`` fields to a ``2dsphere`` index. The
following example creates a ``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
      :start-after: start-2dsphere
      :end-before: end-2dsphere
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      location.geo_"2dsphere"

2d
~~

To query data stored as legacy coordinate pairs, add the field containing
legacy coordinate pairs to a ``2d`` index. The following example creates a
``2d`` index on the ``location.geo.coordinates`` field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
      :start-after: start-2d
      :end-before: end-2d
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      location.geo.coordinates_"2d"

.. _rust-query-geo:

Geospatial Queries
------------------

After creating a ``2dsphere`` or ``2d`` index on fields containing geospatial data, you
can perform geospatial queries that access those fields.

To query geospatial data, create a query filter with a field name and a geospatial query
operator. You can specify options for certain geospatial query operators to limit
the documents returned.

The following sections on geospatial queries include code examples that use the ``theaters``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database from the Atlas sample data. Assume that
the ``theaters`` collection has a ``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field.

.. tip:: 
   
   To learn more about querying data, see the :ref:`rust-query-guide` guide.

   For instructions on importing the Atlas sample data, see the :atlas:`Load Sample Data
   </sample-data>` page.

Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query your geospatial data, use one of the following query operators:

- ``$near``
- ``$geoWithin``
- ``$nearSphere``
- ``$geoIntersects`` *(requires a 2dsphere index)*

When using the ``$near`` operator, you can specify the following distance operators:

- ``$minDistance``
- ``$maxDistance``

When using the ``$geoWithin`` operator, you can specify the following shape operators:

- ``$box``
- ``$polygon``
- ``$center``
- ``$centerSphere``

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about geospatial query operators, see :manual:`Geospatial Query Operators
   </geospatial-queries/#geospatial-query-operators>` in the Server manual.

.. _rust-query-proximity-geo:

Query by Proximity Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example queries for documents in which the ``location.geo`` field
stores a location within 1000 meters of the MongoDB Headquarters in New York City, NY.
The code returns documents in ascending order of their distance from the MongoDB Headquarters.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
      :start-after: start-proximity
      :end-before: end-proximity
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":1908,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.983487,40.76078] } } }
      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":1448,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.982094,40.769882] } } }

.. _rust-query-range-geo:

Query Within a Range Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example queries for documents in which the ``location.geo`` field
stores a location within the Chicago area. The example creates a vector called ``chicago``
that stores four coordinates representing the bounds of the geographic search area.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/geo.rs
      :start-after: start-range
      :end-before: end-range
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":322,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.849403, 41.90707] } } }
      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":2960,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.811262, 41.847938] } } }
      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":323,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.653557, 41.912025] } } }
      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":320,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.805817, 41.847572] } } }
      { "_id":{...},"theaterId":814,"location":{"address":{...},"geo":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.670631, 41.919514] } } }
