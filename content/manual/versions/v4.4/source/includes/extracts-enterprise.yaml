          If you have installed MongoDB Community using a package
          manager, follow the package manager instructions for your
          operating system:

          - :doc:`Red Hat Enterprise or CentOS </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-red-hat>`

          - :doc:`Ubuntu </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-ubuntu>`

          - :doc:`Debian </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-debian>`

          - :doc:`SUSE </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-suse>`

          - :doc:`Amazon Linux </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-amazon>`

          During the installation, the package manager will remove the
          community packages; this will not affect the running
          deployment until you restart.

          If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager,
          you can manually download the MongoDB binaries from the
          `MongoDB Download Center
          <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`__. Follow
          the manual instructions, including specific prerequisites
          for MongoDB Enterprise, for your operating system:

          .. important::

              Install to a location different from that of your current
              Community edition.
          
              In the upgrade procedure, you will use the existing data
              directory and, if applicable, the existing configuration
              file.

              You cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the Enterprise
              edition if you have the Community edition of the same
              release series installed on the same machine. That is, if
              you have version 4.4.0 Community edition installed, you
              cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the 4.4.0 or 4.4.1
              Enterprise edition.

          1. Manually download the archive file from the `MongoDB
             Download Center
             <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`__.

          #. To install, extract/unzip the file to a location
             different from that of your current Community
             edition.
          
             In the upgrade procedure, you will use the existing
             data directory and, if applicable, the existing
             configuration file.
