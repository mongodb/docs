Callouts and Admonitions
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Callouts or admonitions emphasize important or helpful information. Use
callouts sparingly to avoid clutter on the page and to preserve visual impact. 

Callout Types
-------------

You can use the following callouts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 60 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Callout Type
     - Description
     - Directive
   * - Tip
     - Provides useful information that might improve product
       performance or make procedures easier to follow. Tips provide
       the following benefits:

       - Help users learn techniques or procedures
       - Show alternative ways of doing something
       - Provide shortcuts
       - Provide helpful (but not essential) information

     - ``.. tip:: <title>``

   * - Note
     - Provides information that emphasizes or supplements information
       in the text. A note can provide information that applies only in
       certain cases.
     - ``.. note:: <title>``
   * - Important
     - Presents an important or essential point. As a rule, users must
       pay attention to important callouts to complete a task or
       understand a topic.
     - ``.. important:: <title>``
   * - Warning
     - Alerts users to potential hazards or highlights critical
       information. Use a warning for situations in which users could
       lose data, compromise data integrity, or disrupt operations if
       they don't follow instructions carefully.
     - ``.. warning:: <title>``
   * - Example
     - Presents a scenario that illustrates or demonstrates a concept in
       the text.
     - ``.. example:: <title>``
   * - See
     - Provides a link to a topic or section directly related to the
       preceding text. You might use ``see`` to link to content with
       necessary procedures, definitions, or deployment considerations
       and impacts.
     - ``.. see::``
   * - See also
     - Provides a link to topics or sections that are generally related 
       to or provide useful context for the preceding text. You might
       use ``seealso`` to link to content that provides background
       information, deeper context, or common related tasks.
     - ``.. seealso::``

Callout Guidelines
------------------

When creating callouts, use the following guidelines:

-  Use the callout type to convey the kind of information you want 
   to communicate. Don't rely on color to convey intensity.

-  Use the correct {+rst+} directive to create the callout. Don't 
   attempt to create callouts using boldface, headings, or custom
   :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`.

- Don't stack multiple callouts directly after one another, as these can
  distract users. To avoid stacking callouts, group supplemental information
  from callouts into a dedicated section.

- If possible, don't use callouts in tables and option lists
  Callouts reduce the scannability of tables and options lists.

-  Avoid nesting callouts inside tables and other elements.

-  Avoid nesting code blocks inside callouts.

-  Place a callout as close as possible to the information that it
   emphasizes or clarifies.

-  Avoid stacking callouts of the same type. For example, avoid adding
   one labeled note directly after another labeled note. Instead, use
   a single callout that contains separate paragraphs or an unordered list.

The following callouts might appear in existing documentation but are
deprecated. Don't use these callouts in new content:

- ``.. admonition::``
- ``.. caution::``
- ``.. danger::``
- ``.. topic::``
