To defragment a sharded collection, use the
:dbcommand:`configureCollectionBalancing` command's
``defragmentCollection`` option. The option is available starting in
MongoDB 6.0.

Before you Begin
----------------

Consider these issues before you defragment collections:

- Defragmentation might cause many metadata updates on the shards. If
  your CRUD operations are already taking longer than usual during
  migrations, you should only run defragmentation during a :ref:`shard
  balancing window <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` to reduce the
  system workload.
- If defragmentation is impacting workload and CRUD latency on the
  cluster, you can reduce the impact using the
  :parameter:`chunkDefragmentationThrottlingMS` parameter.
- Merged chunks lose their placement history.

  - This means that while defragmentation is running, snapshot reads and
    indirectly, transactions, could fail with stale chunk history
    errors.
  - Placement history records the shards that a chunk was stored on.
    Defragmentation erases the placement history and some operations
    could fail, but will typically resolve after around five minutes.

- Defragmentation affects the locality of the documents in a collection
  by moving data between shards. If a collection has ranges of data that
  are frequently accessed, after defragmenting the collection it is
  possible that the frequently accessed data will be on one shard. This
  might decrease the performance of CRUD operations by placing the
  workload on one shard instead of multiple shards.

Tasks
-----

- :ref:`Manually start defragmenting a sharded collection
  <start-defragmenting-sharded-collection>`
- :ref:`Monitor defragmentation of a sharded collection
  <monitor-defragmentation-sharded-collection>`
- :ref:`Manually stop defragmenting a sharded collection
  <stop-defragmenting-sharded-collection>`

.. note::

   Typically, you should use a :ref:`shard balancing window
   <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` to specify when the balancer
   runs instead of manually starting and stopping defragmentation.

Details
-------

This section describes additional details related to defragmenting
sharded collections.

Configure Collection Balancing Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``defragmentCollection`` field returned by the
:dbcommand:`configureCollectionBalancing` command is only ``true`` when
defragmentation is running.

After defragmentation automatically ends or you manually stop
defragmentation, the ``defragmentCollection`` field is removed from the
returned document.

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

Secondary node reads are permitted during defragmentation, but might
take longer to complete until metadata updates on the primary node are
replicated to the secondary nodes.

Chunk Size, Balancing, and Defragmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
