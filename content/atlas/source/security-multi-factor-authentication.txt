Authentication verifies the identity of a user. The process uses either
something you *have* or something you *know*. You *know* your password.
You *have* an app that gives you a one-time token. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA) uses both.

Considerations
--------------

When enabling |mfa|, |service| requests two forms of identification:
your password and one of the following recommended factors:

- **Security Key / Biometrics**
- **Okta Verify Mobile App**
  
  - OTP
  - Push Notifications
  
- **Authenticator App** (|totp|)
  
  You can choose any |totp| for authentication. We recommend enabling 
  cloud backups when possible to avoid being locked out of your account.

  - `Google Authenticator <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447>`__
  - `Microsoft Authenticator <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app>`__

- **Email** (use with caution)
- **SMS** (deprecated)

  .. important::

     SMS authentication is deprecated. Only existing SMS users can 
     continue to use this method with their current phone numbers.
     |service| does not accept new SMS registrations.
     
Set Up Backup Multi-Factor Authentication Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Enable a minimum of two methods so that you can still access your 
   account if you lose access to one method. 

While you can set up one, some, or all of the available methods, we 
strongly recommend that you set up at least two methods. When |service|
requires |mfa|, it offers you the choice of which method to use. If you 
have less than two methods set up, |service| prompts you to set up 
|mfa| and a backup method at login.

Required Access
---------------

To use |mfa|, an :authrole:`Organization Owner` must enable it for
their organization. All members of that organization must enable
|mfa| for their accounts. 

After |mfa| is enabled for an organization, |service| prompts those
organization members who haven't enabled |mfa| to set it up on their next
login. If an organization member doesn't enable |mfa|, they won't be able
to access the organization.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install and configure multiple authentication factors.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Okta Verify Mobile App
      :tabid: okta

      Download the Okta Verify app to your
      `iOS <{+ios-store+}/okta-verify/id490179405>`__ or
      `Android <{+play-store+}details?id=com.okta.android.auth>`__ device.

   .. tab:: Security Key / Biometric
      :tabid: webauthn

      Install and configure a |fido2| compatible device (like a 
      YubiKey) or operating system feature (like Windows Hello).

      .. note::

         |fido2| compatibility varies. It depends on your platform
         and browser. Consult `Okta's documentation <https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa-webauthn.htm#WebAuthn2>`__
         before choosing this method.

   .. tab:: Authenticator App
      :tabid: authapp

      Download an Authenticator App (for example, Google Authenticator 
      or Microsoft Authenticator) to your iOS or Android device.

   .. tab:: Email
      :tabid: email

      1. Verify the email address you used to sign up for your MongoDB
         account.

      2. Verify that this email address can receive email from the
         ``mongodb.com`` domain.

Remove an Authentication Method
-------------------------------

To remove a method from your account:

1. Choose a method to remove.
#. Click :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` :guilabel:`Delete` to the right of that method.

To remove a method, |service| asks you to authenticate again using
|mfa|.
