:ref:`Aggregation expressions <aggregation-expressions>` can use both
user-defined and system variables.

Variables can hold any :doc:`BSON type data </reference/bson-types>`.
To access the value of the variable, prefix the variable name with
double dollar signs (``$$``); i.e. ``"$$<variable>"``.

If the variable references an object, to access a specific field in the
object, use the dot notation; i.e. ``"$$<variable>.<field>"``.

User Variables
--------------

User variable names can contain the ascii characters ``[_a-zA-Z0-9]``
and any non-ascii character.

User variable names must begin with a lowercase ascii letter ``[a-z]``
or a non-ascii character.

System Variables
----------------

MongoDB offers the following system variables:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 50

   * - Variable

     - Description

   * - .. variable:: NOW

     - A variable that returns the current datetime value.
       :variable:`NOW` returns the same value for all members of the
       deployment and remains the same throughout all stages of the
       aggregation pipeline.

   * - .. variable:: CLUSTER_TIME

     - A variable that returns the current timestamp value.
     
       :variable:`CLUSTER_TIME` is only available on replica sets and
       sharded clusters.

       :variable:`CLUSTER_TIME` returns the same value for all members
       of the deployment and remains the same throughout all stages of
       the pipeline.

   * - .. variable:: ROOT

     - References the root document, i.e. the top-level document, currently
       being processed in the aggregation pipeline stage.

   * - .. variable:: CURRENT

     - References the start of the field path being processed in the
       aggregation pipeline stage. Unless documented otherwise, all
       stages start with :variable:`CURRENT` the same as
       :variable:`ROOT`.

       :variable:`CURRENT` is modifiable. However, since ``$<field>``
       is equivalent to ``$$CURRENT.<field>``, rebinding
       :variable:`CURRENT` changes the meaning of ``$`` accesses.

   * - .. variable:: REMOVE

     - A variable which evaluates to the missing value. Allows for the
       exclusion of fields in :pipeline:`$addFields` and
       :pipeline:`$project` stages.

       For examples that use ``$$REMOVE``, see:
       
       - :ref:`addFields-remove-example`
       - :ref:`remove-example`

       .. versionadded:: 3.6

   * - .. variable:: DESCEND

     - One of the allowed results of a :pipeline:`$redact` expression.

   * - .. variable:: PRUNE

     - One of the allowed results of a :pipeline:`$redact` expression.

   * - .. variable:: KEEP

     - One of the allowed results of a :pipeline:`$redact` expression.

.. seealso::

   - :expression:`$let`
   - :pipeline:`$redact`
   - :expression:`$map`
