Authentication Plugins
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The |bi| offers authentication plugins allowing you to authenticate
using either the ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, or ``PLAIN``
authentication mechanisms. If you are using the
:doc:`MongoDB ODBC Driver </reference/odbc-driver>`, the driver will
handle authentication and you do not need to install an authentication
plugin. If you are not using the MongoDB ODBC Driver and need to
authenticate using your BI Tool, install either the C or JDBC
authentication plugin depending on which is compatible with your BI
Tool:

For more
information on connecting BI Tools to the |bi-short|, see
:doc:`client-applications`.

.. important::

   The use of TLS/SSL is recommended in addition to using an
   authentication plugin as:

   - The ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` mechanisms hash the
     passwords in the client plugin. However, all other data is in
     cleartext.

   - The ``PLAIN`` mechanism sends the password in cleartext.

The |bi| requires authentication when running with
:option:`--auth <mongosqld --auth>`.
When the |bi| receives a connection with authentication credentials
from a client, it passes those credentials through to the underlying
MongoDB instance.

   To authenticate as user ``grace`` with the LDAP authentication
   mechanism, use the following username:
