=============================================================
Connect to a MongoDB Database Resource from Inside Kubernetes
=============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed by |k8s| from inside of the |k8s| cluster.

Considerations
--------------

You must be able to connect to the host and port where you deployed your
|k8s| resource. To learn more about connecting to your deployment, see
:opsmgr:`Connect to a MongoDB Process </tutorial/connect-to-mongodb/>`.

Procedure
---------

Retrieve and run the connection command for your deployment. You can retrieve
the connection command from the |mms| or
:cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager </>`
application, depending on where your clusters are hosted. You can also retrieve the connection command from
the |k8s| |k8s-secret| that the |k8s-op-short| creates automatically when you
:ref:`add a MongoDB user with SCRAM authentication <create-db-user-scram>` or X509.

The install procedure varies based on how you want to retrieve your connection string:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Using the Application
      :tabid: UsingTheApplication

      Perform the following steps in the |mms| or :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager </>`
      application, depending on where your clusters are hosted:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/connect-from-inside-k8s.rst

      When connecting to a resource from inside of |k8s|, the
      hostname to which you connect has the following form:

      .. code-block:: sh

         <k8s-pod-name>.<k8s-internal-service-name>.<k8s-namespace>.<cluster-name>
         
   .. tab:: Using the Kubernetes Secret
      :tabid: UsingK8sSecret

      .. include:: /includes/facts/fact-if-create-user-creates-secret.rst

      Perform the following steps to view the credentials and
      use the connection string to connect to MongoDB:
