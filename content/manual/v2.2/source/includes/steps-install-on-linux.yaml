  To ensure that the downloaded binaries are in your ``PATH``, you can
  modify your ``PATH`` and/or create symbolic links to the MongoDB
  binaries in your :file:`/usr/local/bin` directory
  (:file:`/usr/local/bin` is already in your ``PATH``). You can find
  the MongoDB binaries in the ``bin/`` directory within the archive.
