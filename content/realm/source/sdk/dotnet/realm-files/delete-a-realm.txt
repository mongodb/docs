In some circumstances, such as a :ref:`client reset <dotnet-client-resets>` 
scenario, you might need to delete a realm file and its auxiliary files. If 
you are developing or debugging the app, you might manually delete the realm 
file, but doing so when the app is running and any realm instances are still 
open can cause data corruption. 

To delete a realm file while the app is running, you can use the 
:dotnet-sdk:`DeleteRealm(configuration) <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_DeleteRealm_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>` 
method to safely do so. The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Program.snippet.delete-realm-file.cs
   :language: csharp

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, however, **be sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm**.
