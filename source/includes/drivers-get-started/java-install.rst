- `Java Development Kit (JDK) 
  <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/>`__ version 8 or later.
- The driver dependencies installed by using `Maven 
  <https://maven.apache.org>`__ or `Gradle <https://gradle.org>`__. 
  We recommend using an integrated development environment (IDE) 
  such as `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`__ or 
  `Eclipse IDE <https://www.eclipse.org/ide/>`__ to configure the dependencies. 

To configure Maven or Gradle to build and run your project, see
