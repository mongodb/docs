Overview
--------

You can configure a log forwarder to automatically store your
Trigger and Function server-side logs in a MongoDB collection or send them to
an external service. You can also forward logs individually as they're created,
or batch logs together to reduce overhead.

A log forwarder consists of the following components:

- An **action** that controls how and where logs are forwarded.

- A **filter** that controls which logs are forwarded.

- A **policy** that controls whether logs are forwarded individually or in batches.

Why Should I Configure Log Forwarding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider setting up a log forwarder if you need to do any of the
following actions:

- Store logs for longer than the retention period of {+triggers-log-retention-time+}.

- Integrate logs into an external logging service.

- Access logs in |fts|, Online Archive, and Charts.

      .. step:: Create a Log Forwarder

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               To create a log forwarder:

               .. include:: /includes/nav/list-triggers.rst
               
               4. Click the :guilabel:`View All Apps` button. 
               #. Click into the app that contains the Trigger or Function whose logs you'd like to forward.
               #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Logs` page.
               #. Select the :guilabel:`Forwarding` tab. 
               #. Click the :guilabel:`Create a Log Forwarder` button.
               #. Specify a unique name for your log forwarder.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli

               To create a new log forwarder, add a new configuration file to the
               ``log_forwarders`` directory of your app. The file name should
               match the value in the configuration's ``name`` field.
               
               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /log_forwarders/<name>.json
                  
                  {
                  "name": "<name>"
                  }

      .. step:: Choose Which Logs to Forward

         You can forward all of your Trigger or Function logs or send only a subset to the
         target collection or service. You control this subset for each log
         forwarder by defining filters for the log type (e.g. functions, triggers,
         etc.) and status (i.e. success or error) that invoke the forwarder's
         action.

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               Choose one or more types of log to forward in the :guilabel:`Log
               Type` dropdown. Then, choose one or more statuses to forward in the
               :guilabel:`Log Status` dropdown.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli

               Specify one or more types and one or more statuses for the
               forwarder to match and forward:

               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /log_forwarders/<name>.json
                  :emphasize-lines: 3, 4
                  
                  {
                  "name": "<name>",
                  "log_types": [ "<type>", ... ],
                  "log_statuses": [ "<status>", ... ]
                  }
               
               You can forward the following log types:
               
               .. include:: /includes/triggers/log-forwarder-types.rst
               
               You can forward the following log statuses:
               
               .. include:: /includes/triggers/log-forwarder-statuses.rst

         .. important::
            
            A log forwarder only forwards a given log if both its type *and* status are
            specified in the filter.

            For example, consider a forwarder that filters for ``triggers`` logs with
            an ``error`` status.
            
            The filter *would* forward the following log:

            .. code-block:: json
               
               { "type": "triggers", "status": "error", ... }
            
            The filter *would not* forward the following logs:

            .. code-block:: json
               
               { "type": "triggers", "status": "success", ... }
               { "type": "functions", "status": "error", ... }

      .. step:: Configure Log Batching

         You can combine multiple logs into a single batched request to reduce
         overhead. The batching policy you select determines how a log forwarder groups
         logs.

         You can choose between the following batching policies:

         - **No Batching:** The log forwarder forwards logs individually as their
           corresponding requests occur.

         - **Batching:** The log forwarder groups documents into a batch as they
           happen. Each batch may include up to 100 log entries. When a batch is
           full, the log forwarder forwards the entire batch in a single request.
           The log forwarder forwards logs at least once a minute regardless of the
           number of logs in the current batch.

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               To configure batching, select either the :guilabel:`No batch` or
               :guilabel:`Batching` policy.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli
               
               To configure batching, specify the policy type, either ``single``
               or ``batch``, in the ``policy`` field:

               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /log_forwarders/<name>.json
                  :emphasize-lines: 5
                  
                  {
                  "name": "<name>",
                  "log_types": [ "<type>", ... ],
                  "log_statuses": [ "<status>", ... ],
                  "policy": { "type": "<single|batch>" }
                  }

      .. step:: Define an Action

         A log forwarder can automatically store logs in a linked MongoDB
         collection or call a custom function that sends the logs to an external
         service.

         Store Logs in a MongoDB Collection
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               To store logs in a collection, select the :guilabel:`To
               Collection` action and enter the names of the linked cluster,
               database, and collection that should hold the forwarded logs.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli
               
               To store logs in a collection, specify an ``action`` of type
               ``collection`` that includes the names of the linked cluster,
               database, and collection that should hold the forwarded logs.
               
               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /log_forwarders/<name>.json
                  :emphasize-lines: 6-11
                  
                  {
                     "name": "<name>",
                     "log_types": [ "<type>", ... ],
                     "log_statuses": [ "<status>", ... ],
                     "policy": { "type": "<single|batch>" },
                     "action": {
                        "type": "collection",
                        "data_source": "<data source name>",
                        "database": "<database name>",
                        "collection": "<collection name>"
                     }
                  }
         
         Forward Logs with a Custom Function
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         To forward logs to an external service, :ref:`write a function
         <atlas-define-a-function>` that accepts an array of log objects and calls the
         service through an API, SDK, or library.

         .. note::
            
            Depending on your batching policy and log frequency, the log forwarder may 
            call a log forwarding function with an array of up to 100 log objects.

         The function should have the same signature as the following example:

         .. code-block:: javascript
            :caption: /functions/<function name>.js

            exports = async function(logs) {
            // `logs` is an array of 1-100 log objects
            // Use an API or library to send the logs to another service.
               await context.http.post({
                  url: "https://api.example.com/logs",
                  body: logs,
                  encodeBodyAsJSON: true
               });
            }

         After you write the log forwarding function, you can assign it to a
         log forwarder by name.

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               To assign a function to a log forwarder, select the :guilabel:`To
               Function` action and then select the function from the dropdown
               input.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli
               
               To assign a function to a log forwarder, specify an ``action`` of
               type ``function`` that includes the name of the log forwarding
               function.

               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /log_forwarders/<name>.json
                  :emphasize-lines: 6-9
                  
                  {
                     "name": "<name>",
                     "log_types": [ "<type>", ... ],
                     "log_statuses": [ "<status>", ... ],
                     "policy": { "type": "<single|batch>" },
                     "action": {
                        "type": "function",
                        "name": "<function name>"
                     }
                  }

      .. step:: Save and Deploy your Changes

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
               :tabid: ui
               
               After you configure the log forwarder, click :guilabel:`Save`.
               If you have deployment drafts enabled, make sure to deploy your
               changes.
            
            .. tab:: {+app-services+} CLI
               :tabid: cli
               
               After you configure the log forwarder, save the configuration
               file and then push your updated app configuration:
               
               .. code-block:: sh
                  
                  {+cli-bin+} push

Restart a Suspended Log Forwarder
---------------------------------

A log forwarder might suspend in response to an event that prevents it
from continuing, such as a network disruption or a change to the
underlying cluster that stores the logs. Once suspended, a forwarder
cannot be invoked and does not forward any logs.

You can restart a suspended log forwarder from the :guilabel:`Logs >
Forwarding` screen of the {+atlas-ui+}.

.. note::

   If a log forwarder is suspended, an email is sent to the Project Owner
   to notify them about the issue.
