.. expression:: $split

   Divides a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.
   ``$split`` removes the delimiter and returns the resulting substrings
   as elements of an array. If the delimiter is not found in the string,
   ``$split`` returns the original string as the only element of an array.
   
   ``$split`` has the following :ref:`operator expression syntax
   <agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions>`:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
     { $split: [ <string expression>, <delimiter> ] }


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``string expression``
   
        - string
   
        - The string to be split. ``string expression``
          can be any valid :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` as
          long as it resolves to a string. For more information on
          expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.
          
          
   
      * - ``delimiter``
   
        - string
   
        - The delimiter to use when splitting the string expression.
          ``delimiter`` can be any valid
          :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` as long as
          it resolves to a string.
          
          
   


Behavior
--------

The :expression:`$split` operator returns an array.
The ``<string expression>`` and ``<delimiter>`` inputs must both be
strings. Otherwise, the operation fails with an error.

          [ "pea green boat" ]

   * - ``{ $split: [ "headphone jack", 7 ] }``
     - Errors with message:

       ``"$split requires an expression that evaluates to a string as
       a second argument, found: double"``

   * - ``{ $split: [ "headphone jack", /jack/ ] }``
     - Errors with message:

       ``"$split requires an expression that evaluates to a string as
       a second argument, found: regex"``

Example
-------

A collection named ``deliveries`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "city" : "Berkeley, CA", "qty" : 648 }
   { "_id" : 2, "city" : "Bend, OR", "qty" : 491 }
   { "_id" : 3, "city" : "Kensington, CA", "qty" : 233 }
   { "_id" : 4, "city" : "Eugene, OR", "qty" : 842 }
   { "_id" : 5, "city" : "Reno, NV", "qty" : 655 }
   { "_id" : 6, "city" : "Portland, OR", "qty" : 408 }
   { "_id" : 7, "city" : "Sacramento, CA", "qty" : 574 }

The goal of following aggregation operation is to find the total
quantity of deliveries for each state and sort the list in
descending order. It has five pipeline stages:

- The :pipeline:`$project` stage produces documents with two fields,
  ``qty`` (integer) and ``city_state`` (array). The ``$split``
  operator creates an array of strings by splitting the ``city``
  field, using a comma followed by a space (``", "``) as a delimiter.

- The :pipeline:`$unwind` stage creates a separate record for each
  element in the ``city_state`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$match` stage uses a regular expression to filter out
  the city documents, leaving only those containing a state.

- The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups all the states together and sums the
  ``qty`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` stage sorts the results by ``total_qty`` in
  descending order.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.deliveries.aggregate([
     { $project : { city_state : { $split: ["$city", ", "] }, qty : 1 } },
     { $unwind : "$city_state" },
     { $match : { city_state : /[A-Z]{2}/ } },
     { $group : { _id: { "state" : "$city_state" }, total_qty : { "$sum" : "$qty" } } },
     { $sort : { total_qty : -1 } }
   ]);

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : { "state" : "OR" }, "total_qty" : 1741 }
   { "_id" : { "state" : "CA" }, "total_qty" : 1455 }
   { "_id" : { "state" : "NV" }, "total_qty" : 655 }
