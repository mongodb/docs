|service| {+Cloud-Backup+}s provide localized backup storage using the
native snapshot functionality of the cluster's cloud service provider.

|service| supports {+cloud-backup+} for clusters served on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`

You can enable {+cloud-backup+} during the
:doc:`cluster creation </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` or during the
:doc:`modification of an existing cluster </scale-cluster>`.
From the cluster configuration modal, toggle
:guilabel:`Turn on Cloud Backup` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

If you have strict data protection requirements, 
you can :ref:`enable a {+bcp+} <backup-compliance-policy>` to protect 
your backup data.

{+Cloud-Backup+}s inherit the snapshot redundancy native to your cluster's 
cloud provider. As such, {+Cloud-Backup+}s have at least the following 
redundancies depending on the cloud provider:

- {+aws+} stores objects on multiple devices across a minimum of three 
  Availability Zones in an {+aws+} Region.
- {+azure+} uses locally redundant storage (LRS) which replicates your 
  data three times within a single data center in the selected region.
- {+gcp+} spreads your data across multiple zones in the backup region.

To ensure greater redundancy for your {+Cloud-Backup+}s, you can 
also enable :ref:`Multi-Region Snapshot Distribution <snapshot-distribution>` 
in |service|. This automatically creates copies of your snapshots and oplogs 
and stores them in other |service| regions. With snapshots distributed 
across multiple regions, you can still restore your cluster if the primary 
region goes down.

To learn about recommendations for backups, including the frequency and
retention of snapshots to meet your desired {+rto+} and {+rpo+}, see
:ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging-recs` in the {+atlas-arch-center+}.

.. important::

   If you previously ran any |service| {+clusters+} on version 4.4 or
   earlier and used {+Old-Backup+}, |service| retains your
   {+Old-Backup+} snapshots in accordance with your legacy backup
   retention policy.

   Restoring to an |service| {+cluster+} from {+Old-Backup+} snapshots
   is deprecated. To access data in your {+Old-Backup+} snapshots, we
   recommend :ref:`restoring <atlas-mongorestore>` to a local
   MongoDB cluster running MongoDB 4.4 or earlier. For more
   information, contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

Limitations of {+Cloud-Backup+}
-------------------------------

{+Cloud-Backup+}s support sharded {+clusters+}. You cannot restore an
existing snapshot to a {+cluster+} after you add or remove a shard
from it. You may restore an existing snapshot to another {+cluster+}
with a matching topology.
