=========================
Add or Remove EC2 Servers
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that you can provision EC2
servers directly from the |mms| interface. You can also terminate
instances you no longer need.

When you provision an EC2 server from |mms|, |mms| automatically installs
the Automation Agent to the server and is ready to deploy managed MongoDB
instances on this system.

Prerequisites
-------------

To provision EC2 servers through |mms|, you must first :doc:`Configure AWS
Integration </tutorial/configure-aws-settings>`.

.. _aws-machine-size:

AWS Machine Size
----------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines have sufficient capacity in terms of memory (RAM) and
storage. The root volume should have at least 25 gigabytes.

|mms| does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the ``m3.medium``
instance. |mms| currently supports the AWS Linux and Ubuntu
operating systems.
