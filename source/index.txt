.. admonition:: MongoDB Stitch (Available in Beta)
   :class: note

   |stitch-docs|_ is a backend as a service that provides an HTTP API
   to MongoDB, integration with other services, and a declarative rules
   infrastructure which spans database and service actions.

.. admonition:: Video Series Available

   `Tutorial Series [Video]: Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas

|service-fullname|_ is a cloud
service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments,
including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB
instances. In addition, |service| provides the ability to
:doc:`introspect collections <data-explorer>`, :doc:`query backups
<query-backup>`, and :doc:`migrate data from existing MongoDB replica
set </import/live-import>` into an |service| cluster.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`.

MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

|service| deploys each :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process to its own 
instance. For sharded clusters, the :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` 
routers (the  processes) run on each of the shard servers; 
i.e. each of the :binary:`mongos` processes shares an 
instance with one :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process.

Depending on the cloud provider and region selected for the |service| project,
|service| distributes each cluster across the region for high availability.
For more information on how |service| manages cluster distribution, see
:ref:`amazon-aws-availability-zones` for :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`,
:ref:`google-gcp-availability-zones` for :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)`,
and :ref:`microsoft-azure-availability-zones` for :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft
Azure)`.

|service| deploys each cluster with mandatory :ref:`security
<overview-security>`. 

|service| Organization and Project
----------------------------------

Atlas provides an organizations and projects hierarchy to facilitate
the management of your Atlas clusters. In the organizations and
projects hierarchy, an organization can contain multiple projects
(previously referred to as groups).

Your |service| project manages your MongoDB deployments. An |service|
project can have multiple MongoDB clusters.

For more information, see :doc:`organizations-projects`.

.. _overview-security:

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of :ref:`TLS/SSL
<security-tls>`, :ref:`virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
<security-vpc>` with :ref:`IP whitelists <add-to-whitelist>`, and
:ref:`user authentication and authorization <mongodb-users>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.
