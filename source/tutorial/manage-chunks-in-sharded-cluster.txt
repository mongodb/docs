This page describes various operations on :term:`chunks <chunk>` in
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. MongoDB automates most
chunk management operations. However, these chunk management
operations are accessible to administrators for use in some
situations, typically surrounding initial setup, deployment, and data
ingestion.

.. _sharding-procedure-create-split:

Split Chunks
------------

Normally, MongoDB splits a :term:`chunk` following inserts when a
chunk exceeds the :ref:`chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>`. The
:term:`balancer` may migrate recently split chunks to a new shard
immediately if :binary:`~bin.mongos` predicts future insertions will
benefit from the move.

MongoDB treats all chunks the same, whether split manually or
automatically by the system.

.. warning::

   You cannot merge or combine chunks once you have split them.

You may want to split chunks manually if:

- you have a large amount of data in your cluster and very few
  :term:`chunks <chunk>`,
  as is the case after deploying a cluster using existing data.

- you expect to add a large amount of data that would
  initially reside in a single chunk or shard.

.. example::

   You plan to insert a large amount of data with :term:`shard key`
   values between ``300`` and ``400``, *but* all values of your shard
   keys are between ``250`` and ``500`` are in a single chunk.

.. include:: /includes/warning-splitting-chunks.rst

Use :method:`sh.status()` to determine the current chunks ranges across
the cluster.

To split chunks manually, use the :dbcommand:`split` command with
operators: ``middle`` and ``find``. The equivalent shell helpers are
:method:`sh.splitAt()` or :method:`sh.splitFind()`.

.. example::

   The following command will split the chunk that contains
   the value of ``63109`` for the ``zipcode`` field in the ``people``
   collection of the ``records`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.splitFind( "records.people", { "zipcode": 63109 } )

:method:`sh.splitFind()` will split the chunk that contains the
*first* document returned that matches this query into two equally
sized chunks. You must specify the full namespace
(i.e. "``<database>.<collection>``") of the sharded collection to
:method:`sh.splitFind()`. The query in :method:`sh.splitFind()` need
not contain the shard key, though it almost always makes sense to
query for the shard key in this case, and including the shard key will
expedite the operation.

Use :method:`sh.splitAt()` to split a chunk in two using the queried
document as the partition point:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.splitAt( "records.people", { "zipcode": 63109 } )

However, the location of the document that this query finds with
respect to the other documents in the chunk does not affect how the
chunk splits.

Create Chunks (Pre-Splitting)
-----------------------------

Pre-splitting the chunk ranges in an empty sharded collection, allows
clients to insert data into an already-partitioned collection. In most
situations a :term:`sharded cluster` will create and distribute chunks
automatically without user intervention. However, in a limited number
of use profiles, MongoDB cannot create enough chunks or distribute
data fast enough to support required throughput.  For example, if:

- you must partition an existing data collection that resides on a
  single shard.

- you must ingest a large volume of data into a cluster that
  isn't balanced, or where the ingestion of data will lead to an
  imbalance of data.

  This can arise in an initial data loading, or in a case where you
  must insert a large volume of data into a single chunk, as is the
  case when you must insert at the beginning or end of the chunk
  range, as is the case for monotonically increasing or decreasing
  shard keys.

Preemptively splitting chunks increases cluster throughput for these
operations, by reducing the overhead of migrating chunks that hold
data during the write operation. MongoDB only creates splits after an
insert operation and can migrate only a single chunk at a time. Chunk
migrations are resource intensive and further complicated by large
write volume to the migrating chunk.

.. warning::

   You can only pre-split an empty collection.  When you enable
   sharding for a collection that contains data MongoDB automatically
   creates splits. Subsequent attempts to create splits manually, can
   lead to unpredictable chunk ranges and sizes as well as inefficient
   or ineffective balancing behavior.

To create and migrate chunks manually, use the following procedure:

#. Split empty chunks in your collection by manually performing
   :dbcommand:`split` command on chunks.

   .. example::

      To create chunks for documents in the ``myapp.users``
      collection, using the ``email`` field as the :term:`shard key`,
      use the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           for ( var x=97; x<97+26; x++ ){
             for( var y=97; y<97+26; y+=6 ) {
               var prefix = String.fromCharCode(x) + String.fromCharCode(y);
               db.runCommand( { split : "myapp.users" , middle : { email : prefix } } );
             }
           }

      This assumes a collection size of 100 million documents.

#. Migrate chunks manually using the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command:

   .. example::

      To migrate all of the manually created user profiles evenly,
      putting each prefix chunk on the next shard from the other, run
      the following commands in the mongo shell:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           var shServer = [ "sh0.example.net", "sh1.example.net", "sh2.example.net", "sh3.example.net", "sh4.example.net" ];
           for ( var x=97; x<97+26; x++ ){
             for( var y=97; y<97+26; y+=6 ) {
               var prefix = String.fromCharCode(x) + String.fromCharCode(y);
               db.adminCommand({moveChunk : "myapp.users", find : {email : prefix}, to : shServer[(y-97)/6]})
             }
           }

   You can also let the balancer automatically distribute the new
   chunks. For an introduction to balancing, see
   :ref:`sharding-balancing`. For lower level information on balancing,
   see :ref:`sharding-balancing-internals`.

.. _sharding-balancing-modify-chunk-size:

Modify Chunk Size
-----------------

When you initialize a sharded cluster, [#mongos-initialization]_ the
default chunk size is 64 megabytes. This default chunk size works well
for most deployments; however, if you notice that automatic migrations
are incurring a level of I/O that your hardware cannot handle, you may
want to reduce the chunk size. For the automatic splits and
migrations, a small chunk size leads to more rapid and frequent
migrations.

to modify the chunk size, use the following procedure:

#. connect to any :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the cluster using the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

#. issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Issue the following :method:`save() <db.collection.save()>`
   operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.save( { _id:"chunksize", value: <size> } )

   Where the value of ``<size>`` reflects the new chunk size in
   megabytes. Here, you're essentially writing a document whose values
   store the global chunk size configuration value.

.. note::

   The :setting:`chunkSize` and
   :option:`--chunkSize <mongos --chunkSize>`
   options, passed at runtime to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   **do not** affect the chunk size after you have initialized the
   cluster. [#mongos-initialization]_

   To eliminate confusion you should *always* set chunk size using the
   above procedure and never use the runtime options.

Modifying the chunk size has several limitations:

- Automatic splitting only occurs when inserting :term:`documents
  <document>` or updating existing documents.

- If you lower the chunk size it may take time for all chunks to split to
  the new size.

- Splits cannot be "undone."

If you increase the chunk size, existing chunks must grow through
insertion or updates until they reach the new size.

.. [#mongos-initialization] The first :binary:`~bin.mongos` that connects
   to a set of :term:`config servers <config database>` initializes
   the sharded cluster.

.. _sharding-balancing-manual-migration:

Migrate Chunks
--------------

In most circumstances, you should let the automatic balancer
migrate :term:`chunks <chunk>` between :term:`shards <shard>`.
However, you may want to migrate chunks manually in a few cases:

- If you create chunks by :term:`pre-splitting` the data in your
  collection, you will have to migrate chunks manually to distribute
  chunks evenly across the shards. Use pre-splitting in limited
  situations, to support bulk data ingestion.

- If the balancer in an active cluster cannot distribute chunks within
  the balancing window, then you will have to migrate chunks manually.

For more information on how chunks move between shards, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing-internals`, in particular the section
:ref:`sharding-chunk-migration`.

To migrate chunks, use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command.

.. note::

   To return a list of shards, use the :dbcommand:`listShards`
   command.

   Specify shard names using the :dbcommand:`addShard` command
   using the ``name`` argument. If you do not specify a name in the
   :dbcommand:`addShard` command, MongoDB will assign a name
   automatically.

The following example assumes that the field ``username`` is the
:term:`shard key` for a collection named ``users`` in the ``myapp``
database, and that the value ``smith`` exists within the :term:`chunk`
you want to migrate.

To move this chunk, you would issue the following command from a :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell connected to any :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { moveChunk : "myapp.users",
                      find : {username : "smith"},
                      to : "mongodb-shard3.example.net" } )

This command moves the chunk that includes the shard key value "smith" to the
:term:`shard` named ``mongodb-shard3.example.net``. The command will
block until the migration is complete.

See :ref:`sharding-administration-create-chunks` for an introduction
to pre-splitting.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command has the: ``_secondaryThrottle``
   parameter. When set to ``true``, MongoDB ensures that changes to
   shards as part of chunk migrations replicate to :term:`secondaries
   <secondary>` throughout the migration operation. For more
   information, see :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.

.. warning::

   The :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command may produce the following error
   message:

   .. code-block:: none

      The collection's metadata lock is already taken.

   These errors occur when clients have too many open :term:`cursors
   <cursor>` that access the chunk you are migrating. You can either
   wait until the cursors complete their operation or close the
   cursors manually.

   .. todo:: insert link to killing a cursor.

.. index:: bulk insert
.. _sharding-bulk-inserts:

Strategies for Bulk Inserts in Sharded Clusters
-----------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Consider moving to the administrative guide as it's of an
   applied nature, or create an applications document for sharding

.. todo:: link the words "bulk insert" to the bulk insert topic when
   it's published

Large bulk insert operations, including initial data ingestion or
routine data import, can have a significant impact on a :term:`sharded
cluster`. For bulk insert operations, consider the following strategies:

- If the collection does not have data, then there is only one
  :term:`chunk`, which must reside on a single shard. MongoDB must
  receive data, create splits, and distribute chunks to the available
  shards. To avoid this performance cost, you can pre-split the
  collection, as described in :ref:`sharding-administration-pre-splitting`.

- You can parallelize import processes by sending insert operations to
  more than one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. If the collection is
  empty, pre-split first, as described in
  :ref:`sharding-administration-pre-splitting`.

- If your shard key increases monotonically during an insert then all
  the inserts will go to the last chunk in the collection, which will
  always end up on a single shard. Therefore, the insert capacity of the
  cluster will never exceed the insert capacity of a single shard.

  If your insert volume is never larger than what a single shard can
  process, then there is no problem; however, if the insert volume
  exceeds that range, and you cannot avoid a monotonically
  increasing shard key, then consider the following modifications to
  your application:

  - Reverse all the bits of the shard key to preserve the information
    while avoiding the correlation of insertion order and increasing
    sequence of values.

  - Swap the first and last 16-bit words to "shuffle" the inserts.

  .. example:: The following example, in C++, swaps the leading and
     trailing 16-bit word of :term:`BSON` :term:`ObjectIds <ObjectId>`
     generated so that they are no longer monotonically increasing.

     .. code-block:: cpp

        using namespace mongo;
        OID make_an_id() {
          OID x = OID::gen();
          const unsigned char *p = x.getData();
          swap( (unsigned short&) p[0], (unsigned short&) p[10] );
          return x;
        }

        void foo() {
          // create an object
          BSONObj o = BSON( "_id" << make_an_id() << "x" << 3 << "name" << "jane" );
          // now we might insert o into a sharded collection...
        }
