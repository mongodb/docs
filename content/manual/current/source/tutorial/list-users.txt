To list all users, use :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to query the
:ref:`system.users <system-users>` collection:

Before You Begin
----------------

.. include:: /includes/dSO-role-intro.rst

.. include:: /includes/dSO-warning.rst

Steps
-----

.. code-block:: sh

   use admin
   db.system.users.find()

.. important::

   Do not modify the :doc:`system.users
   </reference/system-users-collection>` collection directly. To manage
   users, use the designated :ref:`user management commands
   <user-management-commands>`.

To list all users of a :ref:`sharded cluster <sharding-sharded-cluster>` that were
created through a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, connect to a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and run the preceding command. MongoDB stores
users that are created through a :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the ``admin``
database of the :term:`config servers <config server>`.

To list all :ref:`shard local users
<shard-local-users>`, connect to the respective shard directly and run
the preceding command. MongoDB stores *shard local* users in the
``admin`` database of the shard itself. These *shard local* users are
independent from the users added to the sharded cluster through a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`. *Shard local* users are local to the shard and
are inaccessible to :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
