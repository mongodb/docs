Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access data from a **cursor** by using the
{+php-library+}.

A cursor is a mechanism that returns the results of a read operation in iterable
batches. Cursors reduce both memory consumption and the number of server requests
by holding only a subset of documents at any given time, rather than returning all
documents at once.

Whenever the {+php-library+} performs a read operation by using the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()``
method, it returns the matching documents in a ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor`` instance.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your PHP application, instantiate a ``MongoDB\Client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following value to your ``$collection`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/cursor.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-db-coll
   :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _php-cursors-iterate:

Access Cursor Contents Iteratively
----------------------------------

The ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor`` class implements the ``Iterator`` interface, so you
can use a ``foreach`` loop to iterate through its contents.

The following example uses the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method to retrieve all documents
in which the ``name`` field value is ``'Dunkin' Donuts'``. It then prints each document from the
cursor returned by the ``find()`` method:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/cursor.php
      :start-after: start-cursor-iterate
      :end-before: end-cursor-iterate
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},..."name":"Dunkin' Donuts","restaurant_id":"40379573"}
      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},..."name":"Dunkin' Donuts","restaurant_id":"40363098"}
      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},..."name":"Dunkin' Donuts","restaurant_id":"40395071"}
      ...

Retrieve Documents Individually
-------------------------------

To retrieve an individual document from a cursor, call the ``current()`` method on
a ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor`` instance. This method returns the document that the cursor
initially points to. You can continue to advance the cursor by calling the ``next()``
method, which instructs the cursor to point to the next retrieved document.

The following example finds all documents in which the ``name`` field value is
``'Dunkin' Donuts'``. Then, it prints the first retrieved document by calling the
``current()`` method on a cursor:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/cursor.php
      :start-after: start-cursor-first
      :end-before: end-cursor-first
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false
      
      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},..."name":"Dunkin' Donuts","restaurant_id":"40379573"}
      
Retrieve All Documents
----------------------

.. warning::

   If the number and size of documents returned by your query exceeds available
   application memory, your program will crash. If you expect a large result
   set, :ref:`access your cursor iteratively <php-cursors-iterate>`.

To retrieve all documents from a cursor, convert the cursor into an array by using
either of the following methods:

- :php:`MongoDB\Driver\Cursor::toArray() <mongodb-driver-cursor.toarray>`: Call
  on a ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor`` object
- :php:`iterator_to_array() <function.iterator-to-array>`: Pass a
  ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor`` object as a parameter

The following example calls the ``toArray()`` method on a cursor to store its results
in an array:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/cursor.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-cursor-array
   :end-before: end-cursor-array

.. _php-tailable-cursor:

Tailable Cursors
----------------

When querying on a :manual:`capped collection </core/capped-collections/>`, you
can use a **tailable cursor** that remains open after the client exhausts the
results in a cursor. To create a tailable cursor, set the ``cursorType`` option to
``MongoDB\Operation\Find::TAILABLE`` in an array. Then, pass the array as an options
parameter to the ``MongoDB\Collection::find()`` method.

For example, you can create a capped collection called ``vegetables`` that stores
documents representing vegetables, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/cursor.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-capped-coll
    :end-before: end-capped-coll

The following code uses a tailable cursor to retrieve all documents in the ``vegetables``
collection. After the cursor is exhausted, it remains open until retrieving three documents:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/cursor.php
      :start-after: start-tailable
      :end-before: end-tailable
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},"name":"cauliflower"}
      {"_id":{"$oid":"..."},"name":"zucchini"}

If you insert another document into the ``vegetables`` collection, the preceding code prints
the new document and closes the ``while`` loop.

</core/tailable-cursors/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
