MongoDB |k8s| Resource Specification

The :gh:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>`
creates |k8s| |k8s-statefulsets| from specification files that you
wrote.

MongoDB resources are created in Kubernetes as
:k8sdocs:`custom resources </concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>`.
After you create or update a |k8s-mdbrsc| specification, you direct
|k8s-op-full| to apply this specification to your |k8s| environment.
|k8s-op-short| creates the defined |k8s-statefulsets|, services and
other Kubernetes resources. After the Operator finishes creating those
objects, it updates the |onprem-link| deployment configuration to
reflect changes.

   * - Deployment Type
     - StatefulSets
     - Size of StatefulSet

   * - Standalone

     - 1 |k8s-pod|

   * - Replica Set
     - 1
     - 1 |k8s-pod| per member

   * - Sharded Cluster
     - <numberOfShards> + 2
     - 1 |k8s-pod| per |mongos|, shard, or config server member

Each |k8s-mdbrsc| uses an object specification in |yaml| to define the
characteristics and settings of the MongoDB object: standalone,
:term:`replica set`, and :term:`sharded cluster`.

Common Resource Settings

Deployment-Specific Resource Settings
