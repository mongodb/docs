  Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
  members of the replica set one at a time:

  #. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace the |oldversion|
     binary with the |newversion| binary.

  #. Restart the member.

   When :method:`rs.status()`
   shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
   has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary: 

   #. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |newversion| binary.

   #. Restart the member.

      .. tip::

         Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
         :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an initial
         sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

      On the primary, run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command in the ``admin`` database:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "5.0" } )
   post: |

      Setting :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (FCV) : "5.0" <set-fcv>`
      implicitly performs a :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` to add the
      :rsconf:`term` field to the configuration document and blocks
      until the new configuration propagates to a majority of replica
      set members.

      This command must perform writes to an internal system
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
      successfully, you can safely retry the command on the primary as
      the operation is idempotent.
