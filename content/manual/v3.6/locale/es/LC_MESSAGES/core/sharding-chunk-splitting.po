"As chunks grow beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size <sharding-chunk-"
"size>` a :program:`mongos` instance will attempt to split the chunk in "
"half. Splits may lead to an uneven distribution of the chunks for a "
"collection across the shards. In such cases, the :program:`mongos` "
"instances will initiate a round of migrations to redistribute chunks "
"across shards. See :doc:`/core/sharding-balancing` for more details on "
"balancing chunks across shards."
