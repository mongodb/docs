title: Download the Backup Daemon package.
stepnum: 1
ref: backup-package-download
content: |
  a. In a browser, go to `http://www.mongodb.com/download <http://www.mongodb.com/download>`_.

  b. On the :guilabel:`MongoDB Ops Manager Downloads` page, copy the link
     address of the "Backup" :guilabel:`MSI` link.

---
title: Install the Backup Daemon.
stepnum: 2
ref: install-backup-windows
content: |
  Right-click on the ``mongodb-mms-backup-daemon-<version>.msi`` file
  and select :guilabel:`Install`. Follow the instructions in the Setup
  Wizard.

  During setup, the :guilabel:`Daemon Paths` screen prompts you to
  specify the following folders. The installer will restrict access to
  these folders to administrators only:

  - :guilabel:`Configuration/Log Path`. The location of the Backup Daemon's configuration and log files.

  - :guilabel:`Backup Data Root Path`. The path where the Backup Daemon stores the local copies of the backed-up databases. This location must have enough storage to hold a full copy of each database being backed up.

  - :guilabel:`MongoDB Releases Path`. The location of the MongoDB software releases required to replicate the backed up databases. These releases will be downloaded from ``mongodb.org`` by default.
---
title: Configure the Backup Daemon.
stepnum: 3
ref: configure-backup-daemon-windows
content: |
  In the folder you selected for storing configuration and log files,
  navigate to ``\BackupDaemon\Config``. For example, if you chose
  ``C:\MMSData``, navigate to ``C:\MMSData\BackupDaemon\Config``.

  Open the ``conf-daemon.properties`` file and configure the
  :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` property to point the Backup Daemon to the
  servers and ports hosting the |application| Database. For example:
action:
  language: cfg
  code: |
    mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017,mongodb3.example.net:27017
---
title: "Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the |application| server to the Backup Daemon server."
stepnum: 4
ref: copy-genkey-windows
content: |
  .. include:: /includes/fact-copy-gen-key.rst

  **Important:** You must copy the file as a whole. Do not open the file and
  copy its content.

  Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the ``C:\MMSData\Secrets`` folder on the
  |application| server to the empty ``C:\MMSData\Secrets`` folder on the
  Backup Daemon server.
---
title: Start the Backup Daemon.
stepnum: 5
ref: start-daemon-windows
content: |
  On the **Backup Daemon server**, open ``Control Panel``, then ``System and
  Security``, then ``Administrative Tools``, and then ``Services``.
  Right-click on the ``MMS Backup Daemon Service`` and select ``Start``.
---
title: "Open |onprem| and access the Backup configuration page."
stepnum: 6
ref: access-backup-config
content: |
  Open the |onprem| home page and log in as the user you registered when
  installing the |application|. Then click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the
  top right of the page. Then click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.
---
title: "Enter configuration information for the Backup Database."
stepnum: 7
ref: configure-backup-database-uri
content: |
  Enter the configuration information described here, and then click
  :guilabel:`Save`. |onprem| uses this information to create the
  :manual:`connection string URI </reference/connection-string>` used to
  connect to the database.

  :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`: Enter a comma-separated list of the fully
  qualified domain names and port numbers for all :term:`replica set` members
  for the Backup Database. For test deployments, you can use a
  :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance for the database.

  :guilabel:`MongoDD Auth Username` and :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`:
  Enter the user credentials if the database uses authentication.

  :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`: Check this if the user credentials use
  the |onprem| ``credentialstool``. For more information, see
  :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

  :guilabel:`Use SSL`: Check this if the MongoDB database uses SSL. If you
  select this, you must configure SSL settings for both the |application| and
  Backup Daemon. See :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

  :guilabel:`Connection Options`: To add additional connection options, enter
  them using the MongoDB :manual:`Connection String URI Format
  </reference/connection-string>`.
