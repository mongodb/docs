Combine real-time analytics with semantic search using MongoDB Atlas
Vector Search to detect and prevent fraud.

Solution Overview
------------------

Fraud and anti-money laundering (AML) are major concerns for businesses and
consumers and impact financial services institutions across commercial banking
and capital markets. Traditional methods of tackling these issues, such as
rule-based systems and machine learning methods, are limited by the engineering overhead
that is necessary to keep models updated, resulting in outdated technologies.

`MongoDB Atlas Vector Search <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search>`__ 
can improve `fraud detection <https://www.mongodb.com/solutions/industries/financial-services/fraud-prevention>`__
and AML efforts by addressing these limitations. This solution uses real-time
analytics and continuous monitoring with Atlas Vector Search to detect and prevent 
emerging threats.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This solution aggregates fraud and AML data, creates vector embeddings, and
performs semantic search to detect similar transactions. The following diagram 
details this solution's architecture:

- **Voyage AI for embeddings:** First, the solution generates embeddings by 
  using an embedding model on transaction data. The fraud embedding is 
  composed from text, transactions, and data from counterparties involved 
  in a transaction. The AML embedding is created based on transactions, 
  relationships between counterparties, and their risk profiles.
  You can use Voyage AI to create your embeddings. You can also configure the choice
  of data sources used to create your embeddings. 
  
  The solution demo pre-populates the database with synthetically-generated test
  data for fraud and AML embeddings. You can also generate embeddings by using
  historical transaction data and customer profiles.

- **MongoDB Atlas as an operational data store:** MongoDB Atlas allows 
  users to simultaneously store their operation data, metadata, and vector 
  embeddings. This eliminates the need for niche technologies, such as a
  dedicated vector database. With a scalable architecture and
  the option to deploy `dedicated search node(s)
  <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/search-nodes-now-public-preview-performance-scale-dedicated-infrastructure>`__
  for workload isolation, MongoDB helps organizations scale with growing
  datasets and adapy dynamically to new fraud or money laundering patterns.
   
- **Atlas Vector Search powers the application:** Atlas Vector Search searches 
  the database for transactions based on the percentage of previous transactions 
  with similar characteristics that were flagged for suspicious activity. 
  This simulates how human analysts would evaluate transactions or suspicious cases.

  If a transaction is flagged as fraudulent or suspicious, the solution declines
  the transaction request. Otherwise, it completes the transaction successfully
  and shows a confirmation message. For rejected transactions, users can contact
  case management services with the transaction reference number for details. 

Benefits of Atlas Vector Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Atlas Vector Search for fraud detection and prevention has the following
benefits:

1. **Improved fraud detection accuracy:** {+avs+} captures complex,
   high-dimensional patterns that rule-based and machine learning models 
   often overlook. By analyzing the full context of transactions, {+avs+}
   also uncovers subtle fraud signals, which improves the detection of
   sophisticated schemes that simpler models can miss.

#. **Detect new fraud schemes faster:** With real-time anomaly detection, Atlas Vector
   Search can help identify novel fraud or money laundering tactics more quickly, reducing
   the risk of emerging threats without the need for constant model retraining.

#. **Store structured and unstructured data:** MongoDB stores vector embeddings
   next to source data and metadata. When you insert or update a vector in
   the database, it is automatically indexed.

Build the Solution
------------------

This `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/AML-Fraud-prevention-Demo>`__ presents a
demo where a customer accesses a bank's website to perform transactions. It
focuses on the clearing stage of the transaction, where the bank goes through
a series of verifications to combat fraud and uphold sanctions and AML laws.
The demo includes an API that flags sanctioned customers, AML, and fraudulent
transactions.

This solution requires an embedding model to generate vector embeddings. 
The demo linked above does not include provider credentials. You can use `Voyage AI
<https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/redefining-database-ai-why-mongodb-acquired-voyage-ai>`__
as your embedding service.

Key Learnings
-------------

- Build intelligent applications powered by semantic search and generative AI
  systems that use diverse datatypes.

- Store vector embeddings with source data and metadata. If you insert or
  update vectors, they are automatically synchronized to the vector index.

- Optimize resource consumption, improve performance, and enhance availability
  with `Search Nodes
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/>`__. 

- Remove operational overhead with MongoDB Atlas.
