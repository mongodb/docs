You can pause, resume, or terminate your {+clusters+}. See also 
:ref:`Terminate a Flex Cluster <terminate-flex-cluster>`.

.. _paused-cluster-considerations:

Considerations for Paused Clusters
----------------------------------

- You can't:

  - Change the configuration of a paused {+cluster+}.
  - Read data from or write data to a paused {+cluster+}.
  - Add or remove Search Nodes to a paused {+cluster+}. 

- For paused {+clusters+}, |service|:

  - Stops triggering configured alerts.
  - Stops all backups. Your existing snapshots remain until they expire.
  - Stops all :pipeline:`$search` queries.

    .. note:: 

       When you pause a {+cluster+}, |service| deletes all data from
       the Search Nodes. |service| automatically rebuilds the |fts|
       indexes when you resume the |service| {+cluster+}.
       While |service| rebuilds the |fts| indexes, the 
       :pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` pipeline stages
       are unavailable.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-bcp-resume-cluster.rst

- If a paused {+cluster+} doesn't have :ref:`Encryption at Rest 
  <security-kms-encryption>` enabled, you can't toggle the 
  :guilabel:`Require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters` option to :guilabel:`On` in a {+bcp+}.

- In certain scenarios, pausing a {+cluster+} pauses its required maintenance tasks. 
  When you unpause the cluster, these maintenance tasks may start immediately, which 
  could delay {+cluster+} availability.

Required Access
---------------

To pause or resume a cluster, you must have
:authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` access or higher to the project.

To terminate a cluster, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` 
or :authrole:`Organization Owner` access.

.. _pause-cluster:

Pause One Cluster
-----------------

.. include:: /includes/flex-dont-use.rst

Depending on your {+cluster+} tier, |service| either pauses {+clusters+}
automatically or when you manually initiate it.

M0 {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| automatically pauses all inactive ``M0`` {+clusters+} after 
60 days.

{+Flex-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't pause {+Flex-clusters+}. |service| doesn't 
automatically pause inactive {+Flex-clusters+}.

M10+ {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pause ``M10`` or larger {+clusters+}:

- If they do not use :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`. 
- For up to 30 days. If you don't resume the {+cluster+} within 30 
  days, |service| resumes the {+cluster+}.

  .. note::

     You must allow a recently :ref:`resumed <resume-cluster>`
     {+cluster+} to run for at least 60 minutes before pausing the
     {+cluster+} again. This allows the {+cluster+} to process all
     the maintenance jobs that were queued while it was paused.

|service| only charges paused {+clusters+} for storage. |service| does
not charge for any other services or data transfer on paused
{+clusters+}.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-pause.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To pause a cluster with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see 
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Modify One Cluster <updatecluster>`. 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To pause |a-service| {+cluster+} using the {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-pause-cluster.rst

M0 {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
|service| automatically stops collecting monitoring information
for an ``M0`` {+cluster+} after a few days of inactivity.

If there is no activity for 60 days, then |service| automatically
pauses the cluster completely, disallowing any connections to it
until you resume the cluster. |service| sends an email seven days
before pausing the cluster. |service| sends another email after
pausing the cluster.

.. include:: /includes/fact-resume-free-cluster.rst
      
You can't initiate a pause for ``M0`` clusters.  

Local Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-deployments-pause.rst
      
.. _resume-cluster:

Resume One Cluster
------------------

.. include:: /includes/flex-dont-use.rst

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-bcp-resume-cluster.rst

To resume collection of monitoring information for |a-service| ``M0``
{+cluster+} paused for monitoring, connect to that {+cluster+} using a
:doc:`MongoDB Driver </driver-connection>`, {+mongosh+}, or
:doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>`.

Resume a Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To resume |a-service| ``M10+`` {+cluster+} that you paused previously:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-start.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-resume-cluster.rst

.. note::

   If you don't resume an ``M10+`` {+cluster+} within 30 days, |service|
   resumes the cluster.

Resume a Local Deployment with the {+atlas-cli+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-deployments-start.rst

.. _terminate-cluster:

Terminate One Deployment
------------------------

Use the following resources to terminate a deployment.

.. _terminate-atlas-cluster:

Terminate a Cloud Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To terminate |a-service| cloud cluster:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. note::

         If you enabled :guilabel:`Termination Protection` on your
         cluster, you must first disable it.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-delete.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the {+cluster+} after completing any in-progress
deployment changes. |service| also terminates all Search Nodes
configured for the {+cluster+}.

|service| bills for the hours that the {+cluster+} was active. To learn
more about |service| billing, see :doc:`/billing`.

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`cloud-provider-retention-policy`. If you
   terminate a {+cluster+} with associated :ref:`tags
   <configure-resource-tags>` that don't apply to any other
   {+database-deployment+}, |service| deletes the tags. You can't
   restore these deleted tags.

.. tabs:: 
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: M10+
      :tabid: m10+

      .. note:: Public IP Address Retention

         When you terminate a {+cluster+} with a lifetime of 12 hours or 
         more, |service| reserves the cluster's public |ipaddr| 
         address, bound to its original {+cluster+} name.

         The following time frames apply from the moment you
         terminate the cluster:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 10 30
   
            * - Cluster Lifetime
              - IP Address Retention
  
            * - Less than 12 hours
              - Not retained

            * - 12 to 35 hours
              - 12 to 35 hours (equal to the {+cluster+} lifetime)
   
            * - 36 hours or more
              - 36 hours
    
         If, in the applicable time frame, you create a new {+cluster+} 
         with the same name, |service| reassigns the reserved public 
         |ipaddr| address to that cluster.

         {+cluster+} |ipaddr| addresses don't change when you or |service|
         pause or resume {+clusters+}.
