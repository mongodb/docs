Overview
--------

MongoDB users can use usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves against a MongoDB database.

   * - MongoDB Version
     - Default authentication mechanism

   * - MongoDB 4.0
     - Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) using the SHA-1
       and SHA-256 hashing algorithms (``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256``).

   * - MongoDB 3.0 to 3.6
     - Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) using
       the SHA-1 hashing algorithm (``SCRAM-SHA-1``).

   * - MongoDB 2.8 and earlier
     - MongoDB Challenge and Response (``MONGODB-CR``).

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` (`RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_) and
``SCRAM-SHA-256`` (`RFC 7677 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677>`_)
are IETF standards that define best practice methods for implementation of
challenge-response mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` verify supplied user credentials
using the userâ€™s name, password and authentication database. The
authentication database is the database where the user was created.

Considerations
--------------

This tutorial describes how to enable Username and Password
authentication for your |mms| MongoDB deployment.

.. note::
   The MongoDB Community version supports Username and Password
   authentication and x.509 authentication.

.. include:: /includes/note-reset-auth.rst

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable username and
password authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or
Backup agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure
them to use Usernames and Passwords. See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-cr` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr` for instructions.

.. note::

   If you configure the |mms| application to authenticate using
   SCRAM-SHA-256, you cannot deploy pre-4.0 MongoDB clusters.
