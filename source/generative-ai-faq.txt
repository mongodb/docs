What GenAI Features Does MongoDB Currently Offer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB offers various generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in its 
products and services, including within Atlas and in its software 
products. 
For example, in MongoDB Compass and Charts, Atlas users can
leverage natural language to generate queries or visualizations. And 
with MongoDB Relational Migrator, GenAI can be leveraged for query 
conversions.

We also offer a GenAI chatbot within our MongoDB Documentation. 

What Services Do These GenAI Features Rely On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's current GenAI features are powered by `Azure OpenAI 
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__. 
When you use these features, your data is processed in Microsoft Azure using 
the Azure OpenAI service. 

Data processed in Azure OpenAI is not used for any model training. 
MongoDB has opted out of asynchronous `Abuse 
Monitoring <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring>`__ 
so that no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. 
For more detail, refer to `Azure OpenAI's data management practices 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy>`__.

What Data Is Sent To The Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB tool backed by GenAI sends the minimal required 
information to produce the best possible answer. To learn more 
about what each tool sends, please consult our documentation:

- `Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__

Are Outputs from my Use of MongoDB GenAI Features Used to Train Models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

Does MongoDB Store my Inputs or their Corresponding Outputs to GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB will store inputs and outputs from the GenAI service for a 
limited time period (up to one year) for troubleshooting, analytics, and
feature improvement.
For any GenAI capabilities offered in our on-premise software 
(Relational Migrator and Compass) you may opt out, in which case
MongoDB will not store your inputs or outputs.

What Agreements Govern My Use of MongoDB's GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of these features is subject to your applicable MongoDB legal 
agreement, our
`Acceptable Use Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy>`_ and 
our `Privacy Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy>`__.
