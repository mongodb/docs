This tutorial describes how to use the :doc:`API </api>` to migrate a
MongoDB deployment to a new version of MongoDB. These steps assume you
have an existing deployment that uses a ``4.0.6`` version of MongoDB,
as would be the case if you used the tutorial to
:doc:`/tutorial/create-cluster-with-api`.

Consideration
-------------

The |api| supports most MongoDB settings and parameters for MongoDB 
versions 2.6 and later. To learn more, see 
:ref:`cm-unsupported-mdb-settings`.

variables with your desired values before calling these API resources.

You must have credentials to access |mms| as a user with the
:authrole:`Project Owner` role for the |mms| project in which the
deployment exists.
