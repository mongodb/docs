   #. Select the snapshot to query and click :guilabel:`Next`.

   #. :guilabel:`Start` the process to query a snapshot. If prompted
      for your password, enter your password to verify.

   #. Select :guilabel:`Backup Tunnel` as the connection method to the
      queryable snapshot.

   #. Select your Platform and download.

   #. Uncompress the downloaded file.

   #. Open a terminal or command prompt and go to the uncompressed
      <tunnel> directory. Run the executable to start the tunnel. 
      
      The default port for the tunnel is ``27017``. To change the port,
      use the ``--local`` flag, as in the following example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         ./<tunnel executable> --local localhost:27020

      .. note::

         If you change the port, you must include the port information
         when connecting.

   #. Use the :binary:`mongo` shell or a MongoDB driver to connect to
      the backup via the tunnel.

      - If connecting locally from the same machine as where the tunnel
        is running, you do not need to specify a connection string or
        host information. Otherwise, specify a connection string or
        host information for the machine where the tunnel is running.

      - If you have changed the port that the tunnel is listening on,
        you must specify the port information when connecting.
