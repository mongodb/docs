=================
The MongoDB Shell
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The :program:`mongo` shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to
MongoDB and is a component of the MongoDB package. You can use the
:program:`mongo` shell to query and update data as well as perform
administrative operations.

Start ``mongo``
---------------

Once you have :doc:`installed and are running MongoDB </installation>`,
connect the :program:`mongo` shell to your running instance.

On the same system where the MongoDB is running, open a terminal window
(or a command prompt for Windows) and run the :program:`mongo` shell
with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

On Windows systems, add ``.exe`` as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo.exe

You may need to specify the path as appropriate.

When you run :program:`mongo` without any arguments, the
:program:`mongo` shell will attempt to connect to the MongoDB instance
running on the ``localhost`` interface on port ``27017``. To specify a
different host or port number, as well as other options, see
:manual:`mongo Shell Reference Page </reference/program/mongo>`.

Help in ``mongo`` Shell
-----------------------

For help in ``mongo`` shell, use the ``help`` command in the
:program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   help

The :program:`mongo` shell also provides ``<tab>`` key completion as
well as keyboard shortcuts similar to those found in the bash shell or
in Emacs. For example, you can use the ``<up-arrow>`` and the
``<down-arrow>`` to retrieve operations from its history.
