Manual Compaction Options
-------------------------

Manual compaction can be used for applications that require stricter 
management of file size.

Realm manual compaction works by:

1. Reading the entire contents of the realm file
2. Writing the contents to a new file at a different location
3. Replacing the original file

If the file contains a lot of data, this can be an expensive operation.

Use the 
:cpp-sdk:`should_compact_on_launch() <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
method on the database configuration to attempt to compact the database. 
Specify conditions to execute this method, such as:

- The size of the file on disk
- How much free space the file contains

The following example shows setting the conditions to compact a realm if the 
file is above 100 MB and 50% or less of the space in the realm file is used.
