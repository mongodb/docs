This page explains how to work with errors in Atlas Functions.

.. note:: Custom Error Handling for Database Triggers Using AWS EventBridge

  You can create a custom error handler specifically for database
  Triggers using AWS EventBridge. For more information, refer to
  :ref:`Custom Error Handling <atlas-eventbridge-error-handling>`.

.. _atlas-functions-basic-error-handling:

You can handle Function errors using standard JavaScript error handling techniques
like :mdn:`try...catch statements <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch>`.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/triggers/willThrowAndHandleError.snippet.handle-error-try-catch.js
   :language: js

.. _atlas-functions-view-logs:

View Logs
---------

You can view records of all Function executions invoked by an |service| Trigger
on the :guilabel:`Logs` page. This includes Functions that failed to
successfully execute due to an error.

For more information, see :ref:`atlas-logs`.

.. _atlas-functions-retry:

Retry Functions
---------------

Atlas Functions do not have built-in retry behavior.

You can add custom retry behavior. For example, you might want to add
retry behavior if the third-party service that your Function calls has
intermittent connectivity, and you want the Function to re-execute
even if the third-party service is temporarily down.

The following sections describe the available strategies to add retry
behavior to your Functions:

- :ref:`Recursively Call Functions in Error Handling Blocks <functions-recursive-call>`
- :ref:`Use Database Triggers to Retry Functions <functions-database-trigger-retry>`

.. _atlas-functions-recursive-call:

Recursively Call Function in Error Handling Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can handle operations that might fail by calling a Function recursively.

On a high level, this process includes the following components:

- Execute operations that you want to retry in a ``try`` statement
  and have the Function call itself in a ``catch`` statement.
- To prevent indefinite execution, set a maximum number of retries.
  Every time the Function fails and enters the ``catch`` statement,
  increment a count of the current number of retries.
  Stop the recursive execution when the Function's current number of retries
  reaches the max number of retries.
- You may also want to throttle retries to reduce the total number of executions
  in a time frame.

The following table describes some advantages and disadvantages
of handling Function retries with the recursive call strategy.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Advantages
     - Disadvantages

   * - - All retry logic occurs within one function.
       - Function can return a value after a retry.
       - Minimal additional code.
     - - All retries must occur within a single Function's max execution time.

The following code example demonstrates an implementation of retrying a Function
by using recursion in error-handling blocks:

   :language: js
   :caption: Recursive Call Strategy Example

.. _atlas-functions-database-trigger-retry:

Use Database Triggers to Retry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also retry Functions by using a :ref:`Database Trigger <atlas-database-trigger>` to execute retries and a MongoDB collection to track previously-failed executions.

On a high level, this process includes the following components:

- **Main Function** that executes the logic you want to retry,
  wrapped in the handler function.
- **Failed execution tracker MongoDB collection**
  that tracks failed executions of the main Function.
- **Handler Function** that invokes the main Function and logs when the function fails
  to the failed execution tracker collection.
- **Database Trigger Function** that reruns the handler function whenever
  the handler function adds an error to the failed execution tracker collection.

You can support multiple main functions with one set of a handler Function,
execution tracker collection, and Database Trigger Function.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Advantages
     - Disadvantages

   * - - Each retry is its own Function execution, with own max execution time
         and resources.
     - - If the Function is retried, it cannot return a value.
       - Each Function call requires two Function invocations, one for the Function
         itself and one for the retry handler.
       - More complex logic, which can be more difficult to write, debug, and monitor.

You can create a retry mechanism for Functions in the {+atlas-ui+} or using the
App Services CLI. The following procedure walks you through creating a handler,
a retry Database Trigger Function, and a main Function.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create the Handler Function

      First, create the handler Function ``handleRetry`` that invokes the main Function.

      ``handleRetry`` accepts the following parameters:

      .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 25 25 50

        * - Parameter
          - Type
          - Description

        * - ``functionToRetry``
          - JavaScript Function
          - Function to retry.
        * - ``functionName``
          - String
          - Name of the function you want to retry.
        * - ``operationId``
          - ObjectId
          - Unique identifier for the main function's execution, including retries.
        * - ``previousRetries``
          - Number
          - How many times the main function has previously been tried.
        * - ``...args``
          - Rest parameters
          - Indefinite number of arguments passed to the main function.

      ``handleRetry`` performs the following operations:

      a. Attempts to execute ``functionToRetry`` in a ``try`` statement.
         If the execution is successful, ``handleRetry`` returns the value
         returned by ``functionToRetry``.
      #. If the execution of ``functionToRetry`` in the previous step throws an error,
         the ``catch`` statement handles the error as follows:

         i. Checks if the number of previous retries equals the
            maximum permitted number of retries.
            If the two numbers are the same, then the function throws an error
            because the max retries has been reached. The function no longer attempts
            to retry.
         #. Build a function execution log entry object to insert into the database.
         #. Get a reference to the failed execution tracker collection.
         #. Insert the function log execution log entry into
            the failed execution tracker collection. This insertion operation
            causes the Database Trigger Function, which you will make in the next step,
            to fire.

      The main function is passed as the argument ``functionToRetry``.
      ``handleRetry`` attempts to execute the main Function.
      If the execution fails, this function attempts to retry the main function.

            #. Deploy your changes:

               .. include:: /includes/triggers/app-services/cli-deploy.rst

   .. step:: Create the Main Function

      Now that you have the function handler and the retry Database Trigger Function,
      you can write the main function.

      In the following example, the Function randomly throws an error when performing addition.
      The JavaScript functions that execute this logic are the following:

      - ``getRandomOneTwoThree()``: Helper function for generating errors
        for the example.
      - ``additionOrFailure()``: Function with the main logic.

      The invocation of ``additionOrFailure()`` wrapped by the retry handler
      occurs in the exported function ``additionWithRetryHandler()``.
      *All* functions that use the retry handler function should resemble this function.

      You must include the correct parameters to make this function work
      with the rest of the retry logic. These parameters are:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 25 50

         * - Parameter
           - Type
           - Description

         * - ``...args``
           - Rest parameters
           - Zero or more parameters to pass to the function with main logic.
             In the case of this example, the two numbers added
             in ``additionOrFailure()``, ``num1`` and ``num2``.

         * - ``operationId``
           - :ref:`BSON.Object.Id<bson-objectid>`
           - Unique identifier for the Function
             call and retries. Set default value to a ``new BSON.ObjectId()``.

         * - ``retries``
           - Number
           - Set default value to 0.

      The body of ``additionWithRetryHandler`` is the retry handler ``handleRetry``
      invoked by ``context.functions.execute()``,
      which in turn invokes ``additionOrFailure``. The arguments you pass to
      ``context.functions.execute()`` are the following:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 25 50

         * - Argument
           - Type
           - Description

         * - ``"handleRetry"``
           - String
           - Name of the Function you defined to invoke the main function
             and post to the retry logs if the main function doesn't properly execute.

         * - ``additionOrFailure``
           - JavaScript function
           - The main function that ``handleRetry()`` invokes.

         * - ``operationId``
           - BSON.ObjectId
           - Passed in as argument from the parameter ``operationId`` of ``additionWithRetryHandler()``.

         * - ``retries``
           - Number
           - Passed in as argument from the parameter ``retries`` of ``additionWithRetryHandler()``.

         * - ``...args``
           - Spread arguments
           - Zero or more arguments to pass to the function with main logic.
             Passed in as argument from the parameter ``...args`` of
             ``additionWithRetryHandler()``

         .. tab:: App Services CLI

                  :caption: functions/config.json

                  [
                      // ...other configuration
                      {
                        "name": "additionWithRetryHandler",
                        "private": false
                      }
                  ]

            #. Add the following code to the file :file:`functions/additionWithRetryHandler.js`:

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/triggers/additionWithRetryHandler.snippet.addition-with-retry-handler.js
                  :language: js

            #. Deploy your changes:

               .. include:: /includes/triggers/app-services/cli-deploy.rst

      Now when you invoke ``additionWithRetryHandler``, the Function will retry if it fails.
