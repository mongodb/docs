title: Disable the balancer.
stepnum: 1
ref: disable-balancer
pre: |
  Disable the :term:`balancer` process that equalizes the distribution
  of data among the :term:`shards <shard>`. To disable the balancer, use
  the :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
action:
  pre: "Consider the following example:"
  language: sh
  code: |
    use config
    sh.stopBalancer()
post: |
  For more information, see the
  :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

title: If necessary, lock one secondary member of each replica set in each shard.
stepnum: 2
ref: lock
content: |
  If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not have journaling enabled *or* your
  journal and data files are on different volumes, you **must** lock
  your :binary:`~bin.mongod` before capturing a back up.

  If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has journaling enabled and your journal
  and data files are on the same volume, you may skip this step.

  If you need to lock the :binary:`~bin.mongod`, attempt to lock one
  secondary member of each replica set in each shard so that your
  backups reflect the state of your database at the nearest possible
  approximation of a single moment in time.

  To lock a secondary, connect through the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
  secondary member's :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and issue the
  :method:`db.fsyncLock()` method.

title: Back up one of the config servers.
stepnum: 3
ref: backup-config-server
pre: |
  Backing up a :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` backs up the
  sharded cluster's metadata. You need back up only one config server, as
  they all hold the same data. Do one of the following to back up one of
  the config servers:
action:
  - heading: "Create a file-system snapshot of the config server."
    content: |
      Do this **only if** the config server has :term:`journaling
      <journal>` enabled. Use the procedure in
      :doc:`/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots`. **Never** use
      :method:`db.fsyncLock()` on config databases.
  - heading: "Create a database dump to backup the config server."
    pre: |
      Issue :binary:`~bin.mongodump` against one of the config
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. If you are
      running MongoDB 2.4 or later with the
      :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` option, then include the
      :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to ensure that the dump
      includes a partial oplog
      containing operations from the duration of the mongodump operation.
      For example:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongodump --oplog
---
title: Back up the replica set members of the shards that you locked.
stepnum: 4
ref: backup-locked-shards
content: |
  You may back up the shards in parallel. For each shard, create a
  snapshot. Use the procedure in
  :doc:`/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots`.
---
title: Unlock locked replica set members.
stepnum: 5
ref: unlock
content: |
  If you locked any :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances to capture the backup,
  unlock them now.

  Unlock all locked replica set members of each shard using the
  :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
---
title: Enable the balancer.
stepnum: 6
ref: enable-balancer
pre: |
  Re-enable the balancer with the :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`
  method. Use the following command sequence when connected to the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use config
    sh.setBalancerState(true)
...
