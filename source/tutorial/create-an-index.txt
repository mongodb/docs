Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by
creating small and efficient representations of the documents in a
:term:`collection`. Users can create indexes for any collection on any
field in a :term:`document`. By default, MongoDB creates an index on
the ``_id`` field of every collection.

This tutorial describes how to create an index on a single
field. MongoDB also supports :ref:`compound indexes
<index-type-compound>`, which are indexes on multiple fields. See
:ref:`index-create-compound-index` for instructions on building
compound indexes.

Create an Index on a Single Field
---------------------------------

To create an index, use :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` or a
similar :api:`method from your driver <>`. The
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method only creates an index if
an index of the same specification does not already exist.

For example, the following operation creates an index on the ``userid``
field of the ``records`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { userid: 1 } )

.. include:: /includes/fact-index-specification-field-value.rst

The created index will support queries that select on the field
``userid``, such as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { userid: 2 } )
   db.records.find( { userid: { $gt: 10 } } )

But the created index does not support the following query on the
``profile_url`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { profile_url: 2 } )

For queries that cannot use an index, MongoDB must scan
all documents in a collection for documents that match the query.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Although indexes can improve query performances, indexes also present
some operational considerations. See :ref:`Operational Considerations
for Indexes <data-model-indexes>` for more information.
