rs.remove()
===========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. method:: rs.remove(hostname)

   :param hostname: Specify one of the existing hosts to remove from
                    the current replica set.

   Removes the node described by the ``hostname`` parameter from the
   current :term:`replica set`. This function will disconnect the
   shell briefly and forces a reconnection as the :term:`replica set`
   renegotiates which node will be :term:`primary`. As a
   result, the shell will display an error even if this command
   succeeds.

   .. note::

      Before running the :method:`rs.remove()` operation, you must *shut
      down* the replica set member that you're removing.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.2
         This procedure is no longer required when using
         :method:`rs.remove()`, but it remains good practice.
