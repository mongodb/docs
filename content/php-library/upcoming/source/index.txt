Overview
--------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+php-library+}.

The {+library-short+} provides a high-level abstraction around the lower-level
:php:`mongodb extension <mongodb>`.

The ``mongodb`` extension provides a limited API to connect to a MongoDB
database and execute generic commands, queries, and write operations. In
contrast, the {+library-short+} provides a full-featured API and models client,
database, and collection objects. If you are developing a PHP application with
MongoDB, consider using the {+library-short+} instead of the extension alone.
