========================
Deploy a Sharded Cluster
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use the following sequence of tasks to deploy a sharded cluster:

.. include:: /includes/warning-sharding-hostnames.rst

.. _sharding-setup-start-cfgsrvr:

Start the Config Server Database Instances
------------------------------------------

The config server processes are :program:`mongod` instances that store
the cluster's metadata. You designate a :program:`mongod` as a config
server using the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` option. Each
config server stores a complete copy of the cluster's metadata.

In production deployments, you must deploy exactly three config server
instances, each running on different servers to assure good uptime and
data safety. In test environments, you can run all three instances on a
single server.

.. important:: All members of a sharded cluster must be able to
   connect to *all* other members of a sharded cluster, including all
   shards and all config servers. Ensure that the network and
   security systems including all interfaces and firewalls, allow
   these connections.


1. Create data directories for each of the three config server
   instances. By default, a config server stores its data files in the
   `/data/configdb` directory. You can choose a different location. To
   create a data directory, issue a command similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir /data/configdb

#. Start the three config server instances. Start each by issuing a
   command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr --dbpath <path> --port <port>

   The default port for config servers is ``27019``. You can specify a
   different port. The following example starts a config server using
   the default port and default data directory:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr --dbpath /data/configdb --port 27019

   For additional command options, see :doc:`/reference/program/mongod` or
   :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

   .. include:: /includes/note-config-server-startup.rst

.. _sharding-setup-start-mongos:

Start the ``mongos`` Instances
------------------------------

The :program:`mongos` instances are lightweight and do not require data
directories. You can run a :program:`mongos` instance on a system that
runs other cluster components, such as on an application server or a
server running a :program:`mongod` process. By default, a
:program:`mongos` instance runs on port ``27017``.

When you start the :program:`mongos` instance, specify the hostnames of
the three config servers, either in the configuration file or as command
line parameters.

.. include:: /includes/tip-hostnames.rst

To start a :program:`mongos` instance, issue a command using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongos --configdb <config server hostnames>

For example, to start a :program:`mongos` that connects to config server
instance running on the following hosts and on the default ports:

- ``cfg0.example.net``
- ``cfg1.example.net``
- ``cfg2.example.net``

You would issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongos --configdb cfg0.example.net:27019,cfg1.example.net:27019,cfg2.example.net:27019

Each :program:`mongos` in a sharded cluster must use the same
:setting:`configdb` string, with identical host names listed in
identical order.

If you start a :program:`mongos` instance with a string that *does
not* exactly match the string used by the other :program:`mongos`
instances in the cluster, the :program:`mongos` return a
:ref:`config-database-string-error` error and refuse to start.

.. _sharding-setup-add-shards:

Add Shards to the Cluster
-------------------------

A :term:`shard` can be a standalone :program:`mongod` or a
:term:`replica set`. In a production environment, each shard
should be a replica set.

1. From a :program:`mongo` shell, connect to the :program:`mongos`
   instance. Issue a command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host <hostname of machine running mongos> --port <port mongos listens on>

   For example, if a :program:`mongos` is accessible at
   ``mongos0.example.net`` on port ``27017``, issue the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host mongos0.example.net --port 27017

#. Add each shard to the cluster using the :method:`sh.addShard()`
   method, as shown in the examples below. Issue :method:`sh.addShard()`
   separately for each shard. If the shard is a replica set, specify the
   name of the replica set and specify a member of the set. In
   production deployments, all shards should be replica sets.

   .. optional:: You can instead use the :dbcommand:`addShard` database
      command, which lets you specify a name and maximum size for the
      shard. If you do not specify these, MongoDB automatically assigns
      a name and maximum size. To use the database command, see
      :dbcommand:`addShard`.

   The following are examples of adding a shard with
   :method:`sh.addShard()`:

   - To add a shard for a replica set named ``rs1`` with a member
     running on port ``27017`` on ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the
     following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27017" )

     .. versionchanged:: 2.0.3

     For MongoDB versions prior to 2.0.3, you must specify all members of the replica set. For
     example:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27017,mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017" )

   - To add a shard for a standalone :program:`mongod` on port ``27017``
     of ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShard( "mongodb0.example.net:27017" )

   .. note:: It might take some time for :term:`chunks <chunk>` to
      migrate to the new shard.

.. _sharding-setup-enable-sharding:

Enable Sharding for a Database
------------------------------

Before you can shard a collection, you must enable sharding for the
collection's database. Enabling sharding for a database does not
redistribute data but make it possible to shard the collections in that
database.

Once you enable sharding for a database, MongoDB assigns a
:term:`primary shard` for that database where MongoDB stores all data
before sharding begins.

1. From a :program:`mongo` shell, connect to the :program:`mongos`
   instance. Issue a command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host <hostname of machine running mongos> --port <port mongos listens on>

#. Issue the :method:`sh.enableSharding()` method, specifying the name
   of the database for which to enable sharding. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.enableSharding("<database>")

Optionally, you can enable sharding for a database using the
:dbcommand:`enableSharding` command, which uses the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { enableSharding: <database> } )

.. _sharding-setup-shard-collection:

Enable Sharding for a Collection
--------------------------------

You enable sharding on a per-collection basis.

1. Determine what you will use for the :term:`shard key`. Your selection
   of the shard key affects the efficiency of sharding. See the
   selection considerations listed in the :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

#. If the collection already contains data you must create an index on
   the :term:`shard key` using :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()`.
   If the collection is empty then MongoDB will create the index as part
   of the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` step.

#. Enable sharding for a collection by issuing the
   :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell.
   The method uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", shard-key-pattern)

   Replace the ``<database>.<collection>`` string with the full
   namespace of your database, which consists of the name of your
   database, a dot (e.g. ``.``), and the full name of the collection.
   The ``shard-key-pattern`` represents your shard key, which you
   specify in the same form as you would an :method:`index
   <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` key pattern.

   .. example:: The following sequence of commands shards four collections:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.shardCollection("records.people", { "zipcode": 1, "name": 1 } )
         sh.shardCollection("people.addresses", { "state": 1, "_id": 1 } )
         sh.shardCollection("assets.chairs", { "type": 1, "_id": 1 } )

         db.alerts.ensureIndex( { _id : "hashed" } )
         sh.shardCollection("events.alerts", { "_id": "hashed" } )

   In order, these operations shard:

   #. The ``people`` collection in the ``records`` database using the
      shard key ``{ "zipcode": 1, "name": 1 }``.

      This shard key distributes documents by the value of the
      ``zipcode`` field. If a number of documents have the same value
      for this field, then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splittable
      <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``name``
      field.

   #. The ``addresses`` collection in the ``people`` database using the
      shard key ``{ "state": 1, "_id": 1 }``.

      This shard key distributes documents by the value of the ``state``
      field. If a number of documents have the same value for this
      field, then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splittable
      <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``_id``
      field.

   #. The ``chairs`` collection in the ``assets`` database using the shard key
      ``{ "type": 1, "_id": 1 }``.

      This shard key distributes documents by the value of the ``type``
      field. If a number of documents have the same value for this
      field, then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splittable
      <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``_id``
      field.

   #. The ``alerts`` collection in the ``events`` database using the shard key
      ``{ "_id": "hashed" }``.

      .. versionadded:: 2.4

      This shard key distributes documents by a hash of the value of
      the ``_id`` field.  MongoDB computes the hash of the ``_id``
      field for the :ref:`hashed index <index-hashed-index>`,
      which should provide an even distribution of documents across a
      cluster.
