title: "Deploy a new replica set for each shard."
stepnum: 1
ref: deploy-replica-sets
content: |
  For each shard, deploy a new replica set:

  #. Start a new :program:`mongod` for each member of the replica set.
     Include the ``--shardsvr`` and the ``--port`` options. Include any
     other configuration as appropriate.

  #. Connect a :program:`mongo` to *one* of the :program:`mongod`
     instances. In the :program:`mongo` shell:

     a. Run :method:`rs.initiate()`.

     b. Use :method:`rs.add()` to add the other members of the replica set.

title: "Start the ``mongos`` instances."
stepnum: 3
ref: deploy-mongos
content: |

  Start the :program:`mongos` instances, specifying the name of the
  config server replica set and a seed list of members in the
  ``--configdb``. Include any other configuration as appropriate.

  For detailed instructions, see :ref:`sharding-setup-start-mongos`.

title: "Add shards to the cluster."
stepnum: 4
ref: add-shards
content: |
  Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to a :program:`mongos` instance.
  Use :method:`sh.addShard()` to add each replica sets as a shard. 

  For detailed instructions in adding shards to the cluster, see
  :ref:`sharding-setup-add-shards`.

  Once the new sharded cluster is up, shut down all :program:`mongos`
  instances.

title: "Restore the shard data."
stepnum: 6
ref: restore-shard-data
pre: |
  For each shard, use :program:`mongorestore` to restore the data dump
  to the primary's data directory. Include the ``--drop`` option to
  drop the collections before restoring and, because the :doc:`backup
  procedure </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>`
  included the :option:`--oplog` option, include the
  :option:`--oplogReplay` option for :program:`mongorestore`.
action:
  pre: |
    For example, on the primary for ShardA, run the
    :program:`mongorestore`. Specify any other configuration as
    appropriate.
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongorestore --drop --oplogReplay /data/dump/shardA --port <port>
post: |
  After you have finished restoring all the shards, shut down all shard
  instances.

    pre: |
      To restore to a :ref:`config server replica set <csrs>`, run
      :program:`mongorestore` against the primary of the CSRS. 
      Include the ``--drop`` option to drop the collections before
      restoring and, because the :doc:`backup procedure
      </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>` included
      the :option:`--oplog` option, include the :option:`--oplogReplay`
      option for :program:`mongorestore`.
