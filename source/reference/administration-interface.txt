Administration Interface
========================

The *MMS Administration* section of the |mms| application
provides access to user management, system status, and system-wide
messaging.

Background
----------

Access the *MMS Administration* section by
clicking the :guilabel:`Admin` in the upper right hand corner of the
MMS interface.

Only users with the *MMS Administrator* role have access to the
*MMS Administration* section of the |mms| application. The
first user that registers for the |mms| application has the *MMS
Administrator* role. Users *MMS Administrator* also have *Group Admin*
level access for all groups.

Sections
--------

System Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Overview` page of the *MMS Administration* section
reports system use and activity. First, a table reports totals for
numbers of:

- groups

- active groups

- active hosts

- users

- users active

- ping spillover queue

- increment spillover queue

Additionally two charts report:

- total page views

- total chart requests

These charts have the same zoom features as other MMS charts.

UI Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Messages` tab holds the *UI Messages* page. Use this
interface to create bulletins inside of the MMS application to
announce impending maintenance windows or other calls to action for
users.

Messages may be *active*, or visible, on all pages or a subset of
pages.

Create Message
``````````````

To create a new message click on the :guilabel:`Add Message` button
next to the page title. This will raise the *Add Message* interface
where you can create a message and specify:

- The text of a message.

- An optional page name (URL) or page prefix.

  When you create a Message, you can specify an optional *prefix*
  of pages on which to include the message. This prefix allows you to
  specify a path, beginning with a ``/`` character, of a single page
  or the URL prefix of a group of pages.

- A toggle to enable (i.e. :guilabel:`Active`) or leave the page
  disable.

After creating an active message, the message may take up to 60
seconds to propagate to users.

Message Table
`````````````

The *UI Messages* page holds a table of all available messages. You
can use the search interface on the upper right corner of the table to
narrow the list of messages.

For each message, the message table reports:

- which page or page prefix the message will appear on.

- the text of the message.

- whether the message is active or inactive.

  Active messages are also highlighted in orange on the *UI Messages*
  page.

- the creation date and time for the message.

- the date and time of the last modification for the message.

  .. COMMENT: there doesn't seem to be a way to modify a message, so
     this seems to be a bit silly.

Manage Active Messages
``````````````````````

On the right side of the message table, for each message there are two
buttons: a toggle to enable or disable a UI message, as well as a
button to delete a message.

After enabling a message, the message may take up to 60 seconds
to propagate to users.

Edit Users
``````````

On the right side of the users table, for each user there is an edit
button that allows administrators to modify the user account. Use this
interface to:

- add or change the email address associated with the account.

- change the role, for each group. Available roles are: "group admin"
  or "read only."

- toggle the "account locked" flag which prevents users from logging
  in.

  role to the user.
