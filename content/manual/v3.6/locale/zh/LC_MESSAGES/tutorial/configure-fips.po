"The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government "
"computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries"
" that encrypt and decrypt data securely.  You can configure MongoDB to "
"run with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to "
"run by default or as needed from the command line."
