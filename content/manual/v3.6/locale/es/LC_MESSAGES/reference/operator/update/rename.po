msgid "Behavior"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/operator/update/rename.txt:40
msgid ""
"The :update:`$rename` operator logically performs an :update:`$unset` of "
"both the old name and the new name, and then performs a :update:`$set` "
"operation with the new name. As such, the operation may not preserve the "
"order of the fields in the document; i.e. the renamed field may move "
"within the document."

#: ../source/reference/operator/update/rename.txt:46
msgid ""
"If the document already has a field with the ``<newName>``, the "
":update:`$rename` operator removes that field and renames the specified "
"``<field>`` to ``<newName>``."

"If the field to rename does not exist in a document, :update:`$rename` "

"For fields in embedded documents, the :update:`$rename` operator can "
