   * - Problem

     - Solution

   * - Slow application-side operation times that are not reflected in 
       the database :ref:`server logs <log-messages-ref>` or the
       real time panel.
  
     - Use :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to ensure the driver does not 
       wait indefinitely during the connection phase.

       Set :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to a value greater than the 
       longest network latency you have to a member of the set. 
       
       For example: if a member has a latency of 10000 milliseconds, 
       setting :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to ``5000`` 
       (milliseconds) prevents the driver from connecting to that 
       member.

   * - A misconfigured firewall closes a socket connection incorrectly
       and the driver cannot detect that the connection closed 
       improperly. 

     - Use :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to ensure that sockets are 
       always closed. 

       Set :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to two or three times the 
       length of the slowest operation that the driver runs.
     
   * - The server logs or real time panel show that the application 
       spends too much time creating new connections.

     - Not enough connections are available at startup. 
       Allocate connections in the pool by setting 
       :urioption:`minPoolSize`. 
       
       Set :ref:`minPoolSize <minpoolsize-cp-setting>` to the number 
       of connections you want to be available at startup.
       
       The ``MongoClient`` instance ensures that number of 
       connections exists at all times. 

   * - The load on the database is low and there's a small number of 
       active connections at any time. Application performs fewer 
       operations at any one time than expected. 

     - Increase :ref:`maxPoolSize <maxpoolsize-cp-setting>`, or increase 
       the number of active threads in your application or the framework 
       you are using. 

   * - Database CPU usage is higher than expected. The 
       server logs or real time panel show more connection attempts 
       than expected.
     
     - Decrease the :ref:`maxPoolSize <maxpoolsize-cp-setting>` or 
       reduce the number of threads in your application. This can reduce 
       load and response times.

.. warning::

   Do not use :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to prevent long-running 
   server operations. Instead, use :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS` with 
   queries so that the server can cancel long-running operations.
       

Calculate Maximum Number of Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate usage to find the number of operations running for each
connection.

Consider an application server connecting to a replica set with three
members. In this scenario, the application server creates a connection pool for 
each replica set member. You also need to consider 
the connections each client, on each node, creates for monitoring. 

The maximum number of connections that are opened by 
the application server is based on the :urioption:`maxPoolSize`, the number of 
members, and each member's monitoring and RTT connections. 

For example, you can calculate the outgoing connections from an application to a 
three-member replica set with the following formula:

.. code-block:: sh

   (
      **100** {:urioption:`maxPoolSize`}
     + **1** monitoring connection 
     + **1** RTT connection
   ) 
   * 3 replica set members  

   = **306** outgoing connections from the application.
