   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` Dialog.

      - If you already have one or more {+database-deployments+}, click
        :guilabel:`Create` to display the 
        :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      - If this is your first {+database-deployment+}:
        
        a. Click :guilabel:`Build a Database`.
        #. Click :guilabel:`advanced configuration options` at the top of
           the screen to display the
           :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      
   .. step:: Enable Global Writes for your {+cluster+}.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Create New {+Cluster+}` dialog box, select
         the :guilabel:`Dedicated` {+cluster+} type. For more information,
         see :ref:`create-new-cluster`.
         
      #. Click :guilabel:`Global {+Cluster+} Configuration` to expand the
         section.
      
      #. Toggle :guilabel:`Enable Global Writes (M30 and Up)` to
         :guilabel:`On` to display the |global-write-cluster| configuration.
      
   .. step:: Select your sharding configuration.
      
      By default, global {+clusters+} enable :guilabel:`Atlas-Managed Sharding`
      to automatically configure the :term:`shard keys <shard key>`
      and :term:`zones <zone>` for the {+cluster+}.
      For each shard, |service| creates a ``location`` field in the shard key  
      associated with the corresponding zone so that |service| 
      can distribute data to shards based on geographic location. 
      This option is recommended for most workloads.
      
      If you're an advanced user and the default configuration is too restrictive 
      for your workload, select :guilabel:`Self-Managed Sharding`.
      If you select this option, you must manually configure the sharding
      strategy by using {+mongosh+} or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`. 
      To learn more about zone sharding, see :manual:`Zones 
      </core/zone-sharding/>`. To learn how to add shards to a zone,
      see :manual:`Manage Zones </tutorial/manage-shard-zone/>`.
      
      :gold:`IMPORTANT:` You can't change between :guilabel:`Atlas-Managed Sharding` 
      and :guilabel:`Self-Managed Sharding` after you deploy the {+cluster+}.
         
      
   .. step:: Select your preferred cloud provider.
      
      :gold:`IMPORTANT:` Each cloud provider has a selection of global regions 
      to which |service| can deploy a zone. The choice of cloud provider may
      support or constrict your ability to deploy a zone to specific
      geographic locations. The configuration options available and
      the cost for running the {+cluster+} may also vary depending on
      cloud provider selection.
      
   .. step:: Configure your |global-write-cluster| Zones.
      
      |service| provides three options for configuring your
      |global-write-cluster| zones:
      
      - Configure |global-write| Zones Using a Template
      
      - Configure a |global-write| Single Region Zone
      
      - Configure a |global-write| Multi Region Zone
      
      Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to configure
      your |global-write-cluster| zones.
      
      .. tabs::
      
         .. tab:: Use a Template
            :tabid: zone-template
      
            |service| provides two templates for configuring |global-write|
            zones for the {+cluster+}, each with a description of the purpose
            of its underlying configuration. Click on a template to view
            the Zone Map for that template. The Zone Map provides a visual
            description of the {+cluster+} zone configuration, including
            estimates of geographic latency and coverage.
      
            Click :guilabel:`Zone configuration summary` below the zone map
            to view a summary of each zone in the |global-write-cluster|.
            |service| provides the following validations for each zone:
      
            .. list-table::

                * - :guilabel:`Low latency reads and writes in <geography>`
      
                  - Indicates the geographic locale for which the zone
                    supports low latency reads and writes. The exact
                    geographic locale specified depends on the preferred
                    :guilabel:`Region` for that zone. You can modify the
                    zone's preferred region in the :guilabel:`Zone
                    Configuration` section.
      
                * - :guilabel:`Local reads in all other zones`
      
                  - Indicates whether data in this zone is replicated to
                    every other zone for local secondary reads by clients
                    in those zones.
      
                    Click the :guilabel:`Configure Local Reads in All
                    Zones` button in the :guilabel:`Zone configuration
                    summary` to automatically configure every zone in the
                    {+cluster+} for local reads.
      
                * - :guilabel:`(Not) Available during partial region outage`
      
                  - Indicates whether the zone supports high availability,
                    such that a majority of electable nodes remain healthy
                    and reachable in the event of a partial region outage.
                    :guilabel:`Regions` marked as :guilabel:`Recommended`
                    in the {+atlas-ui+} support high availability during
                    partial regional outages.
      
                    To learn more, see the following pages:

                    and reachable in the event of a complete regional
                    outage.
      
            By default, each template deploys a series of single-region
            zones and builds a map of country and subdivision locations
            geographically near each zone. MongoDB uses this location-zone
            map to route read and write operations which contain
            :ref:`location data <global-writes-collections>` to the shard
            or shards in the corresponding zone.
      
            If you enabled :guilabel:`Atlas-Managed Sharding`,
            click :guilabel:`Configure Location Mappings` in the Zone
            Map to view the list of location-zone mappings. To customize
            the location-zone mapping, click the :guilabel:`Zone` dropdown
            for a given :guilabel:`Location Name` and select a new zone.
            Click the :guilabel:`Reset` button to reset a custom mapping
            for any given location. Click the :guilabel:`Reset All Zone
            mappings` button to reset all custom mappings for the {+cluster+}.
      
            You can make additional configuration changes to each zone
            after selecting a zone template. For instructions, see the
            :guilabel:`Single Region Zone` tab.
      
            You can also create Multi-region zones. For instructions, see
            the :guilabel:`Multi-Region Zone` tab. Clicking
            :guilabel:`Configure Local Reads in All Zones` converts all
            zones to multi-region.
      
            Click :guilabel:`View Zone Templates` in the Zone Map to return
            to the template selection.
      
         .. tab:: Single Region Zone
            :tabid: single-region
      
            The :guilabel:`Zone Configuration` section allows you to
            configure each zone in your {+cluster+}. |service| displays a
            drop-down box directly above the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration`
            that indicates the currently selected zone. Click the
            :guilabel:`+ Add a Zone` button to add additional zones to the
            |global-write-cluster|, up to a maximum of nine (9) zones. If
            you require more than nine zones, contact `Atlas support
            <https://cloud.mongodb.com/support>`_.
      
            The Zone Map updates as you modify each zone. If the Zone Map
            currently displays the template selection menu, click

            drop-down box and select a region as the :guilabel:`Highest
            Priority` region for each shard assigned to the zone. |service|
            builds a map of countries and subdivisions that are
            geographically near the selected region. MongoDB uses this
            location-zone map to route read and write operations which
            contain :ref:`location data <global-writes-collections>` to the
            shard or shards in the corresponding zone.
      
            If you enabled :guilabel:`Atlas-Managed Sharding`,
            click :guilabel:`Configure Location Mappings` in the Zone Map

            location-zone mapping, click the :guilabel:`Zone` dropdown for
            a given :guilabel:`Location Name` and select a new zone. Click
            the :guilabel:`Reset` button to reset a custom mapping for any
            given location. Click the :guilabel:`Reset All Zone mappings`
            button to reset all custom mappings for the {+cluster+}.
      
            For each shard in the zone, |service| distributes the shard
            nodes with respect to the :guilabel:`Zone Configuration`. You
            can add additional shards to the zone by clicking
            :guilabel:`Additional Options` in the :guilabel:`Zone
            Configuration` section and selecting the total number of shards
            in the zone from the drop-down box. By default, |service|
            deploys one shard per zone. |service| recommends creating
            additional zones to support heavy write load in a geographic
            region instead of adding multiple shards to a single zone.
            |service| supports no more than 70 shards per
