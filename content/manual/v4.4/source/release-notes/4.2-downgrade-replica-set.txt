Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-downgrade-floor.rst

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-rc-majority-4.2.rst

Once you downgrade to |oldseries|, change streams will be disabled if
you have disabled read concern ``"majority"``.

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control
--------------

If your replica set has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required
privileges.

Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from 4.2 to 4.0, you must remove incompatible features
that are persisted and/or update incompatible configuration settings.
These include:

.. |target| replace:: primary

.. _4.2-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   - Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an
     initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

   - Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
     :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your replica set:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.2-downgrade-fcv.rst

#. To ensure that all members of the replica set reflect the updated
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member and
   check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.0" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of ``"4.2"``,
   wait for the member to reflect version ``"4.0"`` before proceeding.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/arbiter-fcv.rst

   .. include:: /includes/arbiter-fcv-version.rst


For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove fCV 4.2 Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
``"4.2"``.

Remove all persisted 4.2 features that are :ref:`incompatible with 4.0
<4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-downgrade-fcv-unique-index.rst

.. tip::

   Perform this operation after you have resolved any :ref:`index
   key size <4.2-downgrade-index-key-repl>` and :ref:`index name
   length <4.2-downgrade-index-name-repl>` issues first.

3. Update ``tls``-Prefixed Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-options-tls-ssl-downgrade.rst

4. Prepare Downgrade from ``zstd`` Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _downgrade-repl-prereq-zstd:

``zstd`` Data Compression
`````````````````````````

.. important::

   If you also use
   :ref:`downgrade-repl-prereq-zstd-journal`, perform these
   steps *after* you perform the :ref:`prerequisite steps for the
   journal compressor <downgrade-repl-prereq-zstd-journal>`.

The :term:`zstd` compression library is available starting in
version 4.2. For any member that has data stored using :term:`zstd`
compression, the downgrade procedure will require an initial sync
for that member. To prepare:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-zstd-downgrade-prereq.rst

Repeat for any other members that used :term:`zstd` compression.

.. _downgrade-repl-prereq-zstd-journal:

``zstd`` Journal Compression
````````````````````````````

The :term:`zstd` compression library is available for journal data
compression starting in version 4.2.

For any member that uses :term:`zstd` library for its journal
compressor:

If the member uses ``zstd`` for journal compression and :ref:`data compression <downgrade-repl-prereq-zstd>`, 
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-zstd-journal-compression-config-only.rst

If the member uses ``zstd`` for journal compression only,
   .. note::

      The following procedure involves restarting the replica member as a
      standalone without the journal.

   #. Perform a clean shutdown of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getSiblingDB('admin').shutdownServer()

   #. Update the :doc:`configuration file
      </reference/configuration-options>` to prepare to restart as a
      standalone:

      - Set :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` to ``false``.

      - Comment out the :ref:`replication <replication-options>` settings
        for your deployment.

      - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
        ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: none

         storage:
            journal:
               enabled: false
         #replication:
         #   replSetName: replA
         setParameter:
             disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh: true

      If you use command-line options instead of a configuration file, you
      will have to update the command-line option during the restart.
   
   #. Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      - If you are using a configuration file:

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod -f <path/to/myconfig.conf>

      - If you are using command-line options instead of a
        configuration file, 

        - Include the :option:`--nojournal <mongod
          --nojournal>` option
        
        - Remove any :ref:`replication command-line options
          <cli-mongod-replica-set>` (such as :option:`--replSet
          <mongod --replSet>`):
        
        - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
          to ``true`` in the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
          --setParameter>` option.
               
        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --nojournal --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true  ...

   #. Perform a clean shutdown of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getSiblingDB('admin').shutdownServer()

      Confirm that the process is no longer running.

   #. Update the configuration file to prepare to restart as a replica set
      member with the new journal compressor:

      - Remove the :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` setting.

      - Uncomment the :ref:`replication <replication-options>`
        settings for your deployment.

      - Remove the ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` parameter.

      - Remove
        :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.journalCompressor` setting
        to use the default journal compressor or specify a  new value.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: none

         storage:
            wiredTiger:
               engineConfig:
                  journalCompressor: <newValue>
         replication:
            replSetName: replA

      If you use command-line options instead of a configuration file, you
      will have to update the command-line options during the restart
      below.


   #. Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a replica set member:

      - If you are using a configuration file:

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod -f <path/to/myconfig.conf>

      - If you are using command-line options instead of a configuration
        file:

        - Remove the :option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>` option.

        - Remove the :option:`--wiredTigerJournalCompressor <mongod
          --wiredTigerJournalCompressor>` command-line option to use
          the default journal compressor or update to a new value.

        - Include your :ref:`replication command-line options
          <cli-mongod-replica-set>` as well as any additional
          options for your replica set member.

        - Remove the ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` parameter.

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --wiredTigerJournalCompressor <differentCompressor|none> --replSet ...

.. note::

   If you encounter an unclean shutdown for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   during the downgrade procedure such that you need to use the
   journal files to recover, recover the
   instance using the 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongod` and then retry the
   downgrade of the instance.

5. Remove Client-Side Field Level Encryption Document Validation Keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Remove client-side field level encryption code in applications
   *prior* to downgrading the server.

MongoDB 4.2 adds support for 
:ref:`enforcing client-side field level encryption 
<field-level-encryption-enforce-schema>` as part of a collection's
:ref:`schema-validation-json` document validation. Specifically, 
the :query:`$jsonSchema` object supports the
:autoencryptkeyword:`encrypt` and :autoencryptkeyword:`encryptMetadata`
keywords. MongoDB 4.0 does **not** support these keywords and fails to 
start if any collection specifies those keywords as part of its 
validation :query:`$jsonSchema`.

Use :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` on each database to identify
collections specifying automatic field level encryption rules as part of
the :query:`$jsonSchema` validator. To prepare for downgrade, connect to
the replica set primary and perform either of the following operations
for each collection using the 4.0-incompatible keywords:

- Use :dbcommand:`collMod` to modify the collection's 
  :collflag:`validator` and replace the :query:`$jsonSchema` with
  a schema that contains only 
  `4.0-compatible document validation syntax 
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema#available-keywords>`__:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand({ 
       "collMod" : "<collection>",
       "validator" : {
         "$jsonSchema" : { <4.0-compatible schema object> }
       }
     })

  -*or*-

- Use :dbcommand:`collMod` to remove the :collflag:`validator` object
  entirely:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runComand({ "collMod" : "<collection>", "validator" : {} })

.. |binary| replace:: any replica set member


Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect
   the prerequisite changes. That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
