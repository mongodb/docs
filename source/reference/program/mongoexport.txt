Synopsis
--------

:program:`mongoexport` is a utility that produces a JSON or CSV export
of data stored in a MongoDB instance. See
:ref:`human-intelligible-exports` for a more in-depth
usage overview, and the :doc:`mongoimport` document for more
information regarding the :program:`mongoimport` utility, which
provides the inverse "importing" capability.

Required Access
---------------

In order to connect to a :program:`mongod` that enforces authorization
with the :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` option, you must use the
:option:`--username <mongoexport --username>` and :option:`--password
<mongoexport --password>` options. The connecting user must possess at a
minimum, the :authrole:`read` role on the database that they are exporting.
