   When starting *each* :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specify the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` settings either via a configuration file or the
   command line.

  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: Configuration File
        :tabid: config-file

        If using a configuration file, set:

        .. code-block:: yaml

          sharding:
              clusterRole: shardsvr
          replication:
              replSetName: <replSetName>
          net:
              bindIp: localhost,<ip address>

        - :setting:`replication.replSetName` to the desired name of the
          replica set,

        - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option to ``shardsvr``,

        - :setting:`net.bindIp` option to the ip or a comma-delimited
          list of ips that remote clients (including the other members
          of the config server replica set as well as other members of
          the sharded cluster) can use to connect to the instance.

          .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

        - Additional settings as appropriate to your deployment, such as
          :setting:`storage.dbPath` and :setting:`net.port`. For more
          information on the configuration file, see :doc:`configuration
          options</reference/configuration-options>`.

        Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``--config`` option set
        to the configuration file path.

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --config <path-to-config-file>

     .. tab:: Command Line
        :tabid: command-line

        If using the command line option,  start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with
        the ``--replSet``, and ``--shardsvr``, ``--bind_ip`` options,
        and other options as appropriate to your deployment.  For example:

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --shardsvr --replSet <replSetname>  --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

        For more information on startup parameters, see the
        :binary:`~bin.mongod` reference page.
