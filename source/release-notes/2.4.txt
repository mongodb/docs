Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The ``text`` index type is currently an experimental feature and
   you must enable it at run time. Interfaces and on-disk format may
   change in future releases.

Background
``````````

MongoDB2.3.2 includes a new ``text`` index type.  ``text`` indexes
support boolean text search queries.  Any set of fields containing
string data may be text indexed.  You may only maintain a single
``text`` index per collection.  ``text`` indexes are fully consistent
and updated in real-time as applications insert, update, or delete
documents from the database. The ``text`` index and query system
supports language specific stemming and stop-words. Additionally:

- indexes and queries drop stop words (i.e. "the," "an," "a," "and,"
  etc.)

- MongoDB stores words stemmed during insertion in the index, using
  simple suffix stemming, including support for a number of
  languages. MongoDB automatically stems :dbcommand:`text` queries at
  before beginning the query.

However, ``text`` indexes have large storage requirements and incur
**significant** performance costs:

- Text indexes can be large.  They contain one index entry for each
  unique word indexed for each document inserted.

- Building a ``text`` index is very similar to building a large
  multi-key index, and therefore may take longer than building a
  simple ordered (scalar)index.

- ``text`` indexes will impede insertion throughput, because MongoDB
  must add an index entry for each unique word in each indexed field
  of each new source document.

- some :dbcommand:`text` searches may affect performance on your
  :program:`mongod`, particularly for negation queries and phrase
  matches that cannot use the index as effectively as other kinds of
  queries.

Additionally, the current *experimental* implementation of ``text``
indexes have the following limitations and behaviors:

- ``text`` indexes do not store phrases or information about the
  proximity of words in the documents. As a result, phrase queries
  will run much more effectively when the entire collection fits in
  RAM.

- MongoDB does not stem phrases or negations in :dbcommand:`text`
  queries.

- the index is case insensitive.

- a collection may only have a single ``text`` index at a time.

.. important:: Do not enable or use ``text`` indexes on production
   systems.

.. May be worth including this: 

   For production-grade search requirements consider using a
   third-party search tool, and the `mongo-connector
   <https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector>`_ or a similar
   integration strategy to provide more advanced search capabilities.

Test ``text`` Indexes
`````````````````````

.. important:: The ``text`` index type is an experimental feature and
   you must enable the feature before creating or accessing a text
   index. To enable text indexes, issue the following command at the
   :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, textSearchEnabled: true } )

   You can also start the :program:`mongod` with the following
   invocation:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --setParameter textSearchEnabled=true

Create Text Indexes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a ``text`` index, use the following invocation of
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text" } )

``text`` indexes catalog all string data in the ``content`` field. Your
``text`` index can include content from multiple fields, or arrays,
and from fields in sub-documents, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text",
                                "users.comments": "text",
                                "users.profiles": "text" } )

The default name for the index consists of the ``<field name>``
concatenated with ``_text``, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "content_text_users.comments_text_users.profiles_text"

These indexes may run into the :limit:`Index Name Length` limit. To
avoid creating an index with a too-long name, you can specify a name
in the options parameter, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text",
                                "users.profiles": "text" },
                              { name: "TextIndex" } )

When creating ``text`` indexes you may specify *weights* for specific
fields. *Weights* are factored into the relevant score for each
document. The score for a given word in a document is the weighted sum
of the frequency for each of the indexed fields in that document.
Consider the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text",
                                "users.profiles": "text" },
                              { name: "TextIndex",
                                weights: { content: 1,
                                           "users.profiles": 2 } } )

This example creates a ``text`` index on the top-level field named
``content`` and the ``profiles`` field in the ``users``
sub-documents. Furthermore, the ``content`` field has a weight of 1 and
the ``users.profiles`` field has a weight of 2.

You can add a conventional ascending or descending index field(s) as a
prefix or suffix of the index so that queries can limit the number of
index entries the query must review to perform the query. You cannot
include :ref:`multi-key <index-type-multi-key>` index field nor
:ref:`geospatial <index-feature-geospatial>` index field.

If you create an ascending or descending index as a prefix of a
``text`` index: 

- MongoDB will only index documents that have the prefix field
  (i.e. ``username``) and

- All :dbcommand:`text` queries using this index must specify the
  prefix field in the ``filter`` query.

Create this index with the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { username: 1,
                                "users.profiles": "text" } )

Alternatively you create an ascending or descending index as a suffix
to a ``text`` index. Then the ``text`` index can support
:ref:`covered queries <indexes-covered-queries>` if the
:dbcommand:`text` command specifies a ``projection`` option.

Create this index with the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { "users.profiles": "text",
                                username: 1 } )

Finally, you may use the special wild card field specifier (i.e.
``$**``) to specify index weights and fields. Consider the following
example that indexes any string value in the data of every field of
every document in a collection and names it ``TextIndex``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { "$**": "text",
                                username: 1 },
                              { name: "TextIndex" } )

By default, an index field has a weight of ``1``. You may specify
weights for a ``text`` index with compound fields, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text",
                                "users.profiles": "text",
                                comments: "text",
                                keywords: "text",
                                about: "text" },
                              { name: "TextIndex",
                                weights:
                                { content: 10,
                                  "user.profiles": 2,
                                  keywords: 5,
                                  about: 5 } } )

This index, named ``TextIndex``, includes a number of fields, with the
following weights: 

- ``content`` field that has a weight of 10,
- ``users.profiles`` that has a weight of 2,
- ``comments`` that has a weight of 1,
- ``keywords`` that has a weight of 5, and
- ``about`` that has a weight of 5.

This means that documents that match words in the ``content`` field
will appear in the result set more than all other fields in the index,
and that the ``user.profiles`` and ``comments`` fields will be less
likely to appear in responses than words from other fields.

Text Queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^

MongoDB 2.3.2 introduces the :dbcommand:`text` command to provide
query support for ``text`` indexes. Unlike normal MongoDB queries,
:dbcommand:`text` returns a document rather than a
cursor. 

.. dbcommand:: text

   The :dbcommand:`text` provides an interface to search text context
   stored in the ``text`` index. Consider the following prototype:
   :dbcommand:`text`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: <string>,
                                          filter: <document>,
                                          projection: <document>,
                                          limit: <number>,
                                          language: <string> } )

   The :dbcommand:`text` command has the following parameters:

   :param string search:

      A text string that MongoDB stems and uses to query the ``text``
      index. When specifying phrase matches, you must escape quote
      characters as ``\"``.

   :param document filter:

      Optional. A :ref:`query document <mongodb-query-document>` to
      further limit the results of the query using another database
      field. You can use any valid MongoDB query in the filter
      document, except if the index includes an ascending or descending
      index field as a prefix.
      
      If the index includes an ascending or descending index field, the
      ``filter`` is required and the ``filter`` query must be an
      equality match.

   :param document projection:

      Optional. Allows you to limit the fields returned by the query
      to only those specified.

   :param number limit:
      
      Optional. Specify the maximum number of documents to include in
      the response. 

   :param string language:
   
      Optional. Specify the language that determines the tokenization,
      stemming, and the stop words for the search.
   
   :return:

      :dbcommand:`text` returns results in the form of a
      document. Results must fit within the :limit:`BSON Document
      Size`. Use a projection setting to limit the size of the result
      set.

   The implicit connector between the terms of a multi-term search is a
   disjunction (``OR``). Search for ``"first second"`` searches
   for ``"first"`` or ``"second"``. The scoring system will prefer
   documents that contain all terms.

   However, consider the following behaviors of :dbcommand:`text`
   queries:

   - With phrases (i.e. terms enclosed in escaped quotes), the search
     performs an ``AND`` with any other terms in the search string;
     e.g. search for ``"\"twinkle twinkle\" little star"`` searches for
     ``"twinkle twinkle"`` and (``"little"`` or ``"star"``).

   - :dbcommand:`text` adds all negations to the query with the
     logical ``AND`` operator.

.. example::

   Consider the following examples of :dbcommand:`text` queries. All
   examples assume that you have a ``text`` index on the field named
   ``content`` in a collection named ``collection``.

   #. Create a ``text`` index on the ``content`` field to enable text
      search on the field:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
   
         db.collection.ensureIndex( { content: "text" } )
   
   #. Search for a single word ``search``:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: "search" } )
         
      This query returns documents that contain the word
      ``search``, case-insensitive, in the ``content`` field. 
      
   #. Search for multiple words, ``create`` or ``search`` or  ``fields``:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: "create search fields" } )
         
      This query returns documents that contain the either ``create``
      **or** ``search`` **or** ``field`` in the ``content`` field.
   
   #. Search for the exact phrase ``create search fields``:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: "\"create search fields\"" } )
         
      This query returns documents that contain the exact phrase
      ``create search fields``.

   #. Search for documents that contain the words ``create`` or ``search``,
      but **not** ``fields``:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
   
         db.collection.runCommand( "text", { search: "create search -fields" } )
      
      Use the ``-`` as a prefix to terms to specify negation in the
      search string. The query returns documents that contain the
      either ``creat`` **or** ``search``, but **not** ``field``, all
      case-insensitive, in the ``content`` field. Prefixing a word
      with a hyphen (``-``) negates a word:
      
      - The negated word filters out documents from the result set,
        after selecting documents. 
      
      - A ``<search string>`` that only contains negative words returns no match.
      
      - A hyphenated word, such as ``case-insensitive``, is not a
        negation. The :dbcommand:`text` command treats the hyphen and
        as a delimiter.

   #. Search for a single word ``search`` with an additional ``filter`` on
      the ``about`` field, but **limit** the results to 2 documents with the
      highest score and return only the ``comments`` field in the matching
      documents:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.collection.runCommand( "text", { 
                                             search: "insensitive", 
                                             filter: { about: /something/ }, 
                                             limit: 2, 
                                             projection: { comments: 1, _id: 0 } 
                                           } 
                                 )
      
      - The ``filter`` :ref:`query document <mongodb-query-document>`
        is uses a :operator:`regular expression <$regex>`. See the
        :ref:`query operators <operator>` page for available query
        operators.
        
      - The ``projection`` must explicitly exclude (``0``) the ``_id``
        field. Within the ``projection`` document, you cannot mix
        inclusions (i.e. ``<fieldA>: 1``) and exclusions (i.e. ``<fieldB>:
        0``), except for the ``_id`` field.
     
Additional Authentication Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   These features are only present in the `MongoDB Subscriber Edition
   <https://www.10gen.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download>`_. To
   download 2.3 development releases of the Subscriber Edition, use
   the following resources:

   - `Amazon Linux 6.4 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-amzn64-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-rhel62-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `Ubuntu 11.04 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-ubuntu1104-2.3.1.tgz>`_
   - `SUSE 11 <http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.10gen.com/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-subscription-suse11-2.3.1.tgz>`_

An improved authentication system is a core focus of the entire 2.3
cycle, as of 2.3.1, the following components of the new authentication
system are available for use in MongoDB:

- SASL Support in :program:`mongod`, the :program:`mongo` shell, and C++ client library
  (driver.)

- New :dbcommand:`acquirePrivilege`, :dbcommand:`saslBegin`, and :dbcommand:`saslContinue`
  database commands.

.. note::

   As of 2.3.1 support for SASL/Kerberos in :program:`mongos` is
   forthcoming. Test Kerberos with standalone :program:`mongod`
   instances and :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.

Initial SASL/Kerberos  Support
``````````````````````````````

Development work on this functionality is ongoing, and additional
related functionality is forthcoming. To use Kerberos with MongoDB as
of the current 2.3-series release, consider the following requirements:

- add users to MongoDB as with the existing authentication
  mechanism:

  - Usernames *must* correspond to the Kerberos
    principal (e.g. ``<username>@<REALM>`` as in
    ``mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM``),

  - You *must* have a user document in the :data:`system.users
    <<database>.system.users>` collection with the Kerberos principal
    for any database that you want to grant access.

- every :program:`mongod` using Kerberos must have a fully resolvable
  fully qualified domain name. This includes all members of replica
  sets.

- every :program:`mongod` using Kerberos must have a Kerberos service
  principal, in the form of: ``mongodb/<fqdn>@<REALM>``.

- each system running a :program:`mongod` with Kerberos must have a
  key tab file that holds key data granting access to it's principal
  that the :program:`mongod` can read.

To start :program:`mongod` with support for Kerberos, use the
following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=<path to keytab file> <mongod invocation>

You must start :program:`mongod` with :setting:`auth` or
:setting:`keyfile`, [#keyfile-auth]_ so that an actual command would
resemble:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/etc/mongodb.keytab \
       /opt/bin/mongod --auth --dbpath /opt/data/db --logpath /opt/log/mongod.log --fork

Replace the paths as needed for your test deployment.

To use Kerberos with the :program:`mongo` shell, begin by initializing
a Kerberos session with ``kinit``. Then start a 2.3.1 or greater
:program:`mongo` shell instance, and run the following operations to
associate the current connection with the Kerberos session:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getMongo().saslAuthenticate( { mechanism: "GSSAPI",
                                     principal: "<username>@<REALM>" } )

The value of the ``principal`` field *must* be the same principal that
you initialized with ``kinit``. Continue to gain privileges using the
:dbcommand:`acquirePrivilege` in an operation that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { acquirePrivilege: 1,
                      resource: <dbname>,
                      principal: <principalName>,
                      actions: [ <actionString> ] } )

Replace the ``<dbname>`` with the name of the database you want
privileges, replace ``<principalName>`` with the Kerberos principal
you initialized with ``kinit``. The ``<actionString>`` list, contains
the privileges you are acquiring, currently this value must be either:

- ``oldRead``, or

- ``oldWrite``.

The ``oldRead`` action string corresponds to the "*read only*"
privileges in the existing authentication system, while ``oldWrite``
corresponds to the existing "*read/write*" privileges.

.. see:: :doc:`/security`

.. [#keyfile-auth] :setting:`keyfile` implies :setting:`auth`, and you
   *must* use :setting:`keyfile` for replica sets.

New Authentication Control Database Commands
````````````````````````````````````````````

In the 2.3 series, MongoDB adds the following database commands:

.. leaving these undocumented at the moment, given changing use, and
   the fact that the previous section satisfies current requirements.

.. dbcommand:: acquirePrivilege

.. dbcommand:: saslBegin

.. dbcommand:: saslContinue


Default Java Script Engine Switched to v8 from SpiderMonkey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default JavaScript engine used throughout MongoDB, for the
:program:`mongo` shell, :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, :operator:`$where`,
and :dbcommand:`eval` is now v8.

.. data:: serverBuildInfo.interpreterVersion

   The :data:`interpreterVersion` field of the document output by
   :method:`db.serverBuildInfo()` in the :program:`mongo` shell
   reports which JavaScript interpreter the :program:`mongod` instance
   is running.

.. method:: interpreterVersion()

   The :method:`interpreterVersion()` in the :program:`mongo` shell
   reports which JavaScript interpreter this :program:`mongo` shell
   uses.

.. DOCS-752

New Geospatial Indexes with GeoJSON and Improved Spherical Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   In 2.3.2, the index type for Spherical Geospatial Indexes will
   become ``2dsphere``

The 2.3 series adds a new type of geospatial index that supports
improved spherical queries and GeoJSON. Create the index by specifying
``s2d`` as the value of the field in the index specification, as
any of the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { geo: "s2d" } )
   db.collection.ensureIndex( { type: 1, geo: "s2d" } )
   db.collection.ensureIndex( { geo: "s2d", type: 1 } )

In the first example you create a spherical geospatial index on the
field named ``geo``, in the second example, you create a compound
index where the first field is a normal index, and the index of the
second field is a spherical geospatial index. Unlike ``2d`` indexes,
fields indexed using the ``s2d`` type do not have to be the first
field in a compound index.

You must store data in the fields indexed using the ``s2d`` index
using the `GeoJSON`_ specification, at the moment. Support for storing
points, in the form used by the existing ``2d`` (i.e. geospatial)
indexes is forthcoming. Currently, ``s2d`` indexes only support
the following GeoJSON shapes:

- ``Point``, as in the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 40, 5 ] }

- ``LineString``, as in the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ 40, 5 ], [ 41, 6 ] ] }

- ``Polygon``, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [ [ [ 40, 5 ], [ 40, 6 ], [ 41, 6 ], [ 41, 5 ], [ 40, 5 ] ] ]
      }

To query ``s2d`` indexes, all current geospatial :ref:`query operators
<query-selectors-geospatial>` with an additional
:operator:`$intersect` operator. Currently, all queries using the
``s2d`` index must pass the query selector (e.g. :operator:`$near`,
:operator:`$intersect`) a GeoJSON document. With the exception of the
GeoJSON requirement, the operation of :operator:`$near` is the same
for ``s2d`` indexes as ``2d`` indexes.

.. operator:: $intersect

   The :operator:`$intersect` selects all indexed points that
   intersect with the provided geometry. (i.e. ``Point``, ``LineString``,
   and ``Polygon``.) You must pass :operator:`$intersect` a document
   in GeoJSON format.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $intersect: { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 40, 5 ] } } )

   This query will select all indexed objects that intersect with the
   ``Point`` with the coordinates ``[ 40, 5 ]``. MongoDB will return
   documents as intersecting if they have a shared edge.

``mongod`` Automatically Continues in Progress Index Builds Following Restart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :program:`mongod` instance was building an index when it
shutdown or terminated, :program:`mongod` will now continue building
the index when the :program:`mongod` restarts. Previously, the index
build *had* to finish building before :program:`mongod` shutdown.

To disable this behavior the 2.3 series adds a new run time option,
:setting:`noIndexBuildRetry` (or via,q ``--noIndexBuildRetry`` on the
command line,) for :program:`mongod`. :setting:`noIndexBuildRetry`
prevents :program:`mongod` from continuing rebuilding indexes that did
were not finished building when the :program:`mongod` last shut down.

.. setting:: noIndexBuildRetry

   By default, :program:`mongod` will attempt to rebuild indexes upon
   start-up *if* :program:`mongod` shuts down or stops in the middle
   of an index build. When enabled, run time option prevents this
   behavior.

New Hashed Index and Sharding with a Hashed Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support an easy to configure and evenly distributed shard key, version 2.3 adds a
new "``hashed``" index type that indexes based on hashed values. This
section introduces and documents both the new index type and its use
in sharding:

Hashed Index
````````````

The new ``hashed`` index exists primarily to support automatically
hashed shard keys. Consider the following properties of hashed
indexes:

- Hashed indexes must only have a single field, and cannot be compound
  indexes.

- Fields indexed with hashed indexes must *not* hold arrays. Hashed
  indexes cannot be multikey indexes.

- Hashed indexes cannot have a ``unique`` constraint.

  You *may* create hashed indexes with the ``sparse`` property.

- MongoDB can use the hashed index to support equality queries, but
  cannot use these indexes for range queries.

- Hashed indexes offer no performance advantage over normal indexes.
  *However*, hashed indexes may be smaller than a normal index when
  the values of the indexed field are larger than 64 bits. [#hash-size]_

- it's possible to have a hashed and non-hashed index on the same
  field: MongoDB will use the non-hashed for range queries.

.. _hashed-index-warning:

.. warning::

   Hashed indexes round floating point numbers to 64-bit integers
   before hashing. For example, a hashed index would store the same
   value for a field that held a value of ``2.3`` and ``2.2``. To
   prevent collisions do not use a hashed index for floating point
   numbers that cannot be consistently converted to 64-bit integers (and
   then back to floating point.) Hashed indexes do not support
   floating point values larger than 2\ :sup:`53`.

Create a hashed index using an operation that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { a: "hashed" } )

This operation creates a hashed index for the ``records`` collection
on the ``a`` field.

.. [#hash-size] The hash stored in the hashed index is 64 bits long.

Hashed Sharding
```````````````

To shard a collection using a hashed shard key, issue an operation in
the :program:`mongo` shell that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( "records.active", { a: "hashed" } )

This operation shards the ``active`` collection in the ``records``
database, using a hash of the ``a`` field as the shard
key. Consider the following properties when using a hashed shard key:

- As with other kinds of shard key indexes, if your collection has
  data, you must create the hashed index before sharding. If your
  collection does not have data, sharding the collection will create
  the appropriate index.

- The :program:`mongos` will route all equality queries to a specific
  shard or set of shards; however, the :program:`mongos` must route
  range queries to all shards.

- When using a hashed shard key on a new collection, MongoDB
  automatically pre-splits the range of 64-bit hash values into
  chunks. By default, the initial number of chunks is equal to twice
  the number of shards at creation time. You can change the number of
  chunks created, using the ``numInitialChunks`` option, as in the
  following invocation of :dbcommand:`shardCollection`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "test.collection",
                        key: { a: "hashed"},
                        numInitialChunks: 2001 } )

  MongoDB will only pre-split chunks in a collection when sharding
  empty collections. MongoDB will not create chunk splits in a
  collection sharding collections that have data.

.. warning::

   Avoid using hashed shard keys when the hashed field has non-integral floating
   point values, see :ref:`hashed indexes <hashed-index-warning>` for
   more information.
