You can run up to 30 simultaneous queries on your {+dl+} against:

- Data in your |s3| bucket.
- Documents in your MongoDB |service| cluster.
- Data in files hosted at publicly accessible |url|\s.

.. _query-s3:

Querying Data on S3 
-------------------

You can use {+adl+} to query and analyze data on your cloud object store 
using MongoDB Query Language (MQL). {+adl+} supports most, but not all the 
standard server commands. To learn more about the supported and unsupported 
MongoDB server commands and aggregation pipleline stages, see 
:ref:`data-lake-mql-support`.  

To query data on |s3|, your {+dl+} storage :ref:`configuration 
<datalake-configuration-file>` must contain settings that define:

- Your |s3| {+data-lake-store+}. 
- {+dl+} virtual databases and collections that map to your 
  {+data-lake-store+}.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "stores" : [
          {
            "name" : "<store-name>",
            "provider" : "s3",
            "region" : "<aws-region>",
            "bucket" : "<s3-bucket-name>",
            "prefix" : "<file-path-prefix>",
            "delimiter" : "<path-separator>"
          }
        ],
        "databases" : [ 
          {
            "name" : "<database-name>", 
            "collections" : [
              {
                "name" : "<collection-name>",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<store-name>",
                    "path" : "<path-to-file>"
                  }
                ]
              }
            ],
            "maxWildcardCollections" : <number-of-wildcard-collections>
          }
        ]
      }

To learn more about these settings, see :ref:`datalake-configuration-file`.

{+dl+} creates the virtual databases and collections you specified in your 
{+dl+} configuration for the data in your |s3| store. When you :doc:`connect 
</tutorial/connect>` to your {+dl+} and :doc:`run queries 
</tutorial/run-queries>`, {+dl+} processes your queries against the data and 
returns the query results.

When :doc:`deploying </tutorial/deploy>` your {+dl+}, if you specified an |s3| 
bucket with both read and write permissions or |aws| |s3| :aws:`s3:PutObject 
</AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-objects>` 
permission, you can also save your query results in your |s3| bucket using 
:ref:`adl-out-stage` to |s3|.

.. _query-atlas:

Querying Data in Your |service| Cluster 
---------------------------------------

You can use {+adl+} to query and analyze data in your |service| cluster using 
MongoDB Query Language (MQL). {+adl+} supports most, but not all the standard 
server commands. To learn more about the supported and unsupported MongoDB 
server commands and aggregation pipleline stages, see 
:ref:`data-lake-mql-support`.

To query data in your |service| cluster, your {+dl+} storage 
:ref:`configuration <datalake-configuration-file>` must contain settings that 
define: 

- Your |service| {+data-lake-store+}.
- {+dl+} virtual databases and collections that map to your 
  {+data-lake-store+}.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "stores" : [
          {
            "name" : "<store-name>",
            "provider": "atlas",
            "clusterName": "<atlas-cluster-name>", 
            "projectId": "<atlas-project-ID>"
          }
        ],
        "databases" : [
          {
            "name" : "<database-name>",
            "collections" : [
              {
                "name" : "<collection-name>",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<store-name>",
                    "database" : "<atlas-database-name>",
                    "collection" : "<atlas-collection-name>" 
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

To learn more about these settings, see :ref:`datalake-configuration-file`. 

{+dl+} automatically detects the file format and creates the virtual databases 
and collections you specified in your {+dl+} configuration. When you 
:doc:`connect </tutorial/connect>` to your {+dl+} and run queries, {+dl+} 
processes your queries against the data and returns the query results.

.. _query-http:

Querying Data at a |http| |url| 
-------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-http-beta-message.rst

You can use {+adl+} to query and analyze data in files hosted at publicly 
accessible |url|\s using MongoDB Query Language (MQL). To learn more about the 
supported data formats, see :ref:`data-lake-data-formats`. {+adl+} supports 
most, but not all the standard server commands. To learn more about the 
supported and unsupported MongoDB server commands and aggregation pipleline 
stages, see :ref:`data-lake-mql-support`. 

To query data in your publicly accessible |url|\s, your {+dl+} storage 
:ref:`configuration <datalake-configuration-file>` must contain settings that 
define: 

- Your |http| {+data-lake-store+}.
- {+dl+} virtual databases and collections that map to your {+data-lake-store+}.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "stores" : [
          {
            "name" : "<store-name>",
            "provider": "http",
            "urls": ["<url>"],
            "defaultFormat" : "<string>"
            "allowInsecure": <boolean>,
          }
        ],
        "databases" : [
          {
            "name" : "<database-name>",
            "collections" : [
              {
                "name" : "<collection-name>",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<store-name>",
                    "urls" : ["<url>"],
                    "defaultFormat" : "<string>"
                    "allowInsecure" : <boolean>,
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

To learn more about these settings, see :ref:`datalake-configuration-file`. 

{+dl+} creates the virtual databases and collections you specified in your 
{+dl+} configuration for the data in your |url|. {+dl+} also creates one 
partition for each |url| in your collection. When you :doc:`connect 
</tutorial/connect>` to your {+dl+} and run queries, {+dl+} processes your 
queries against the data and returns the query results.

.. _federated-queries:

Running Federated Queries 
-------------------------

You can use {+adl+} to query and analyze a unified view of data in your 
|service| cluster, |s3| bucket, and at your |http| URL. For federated queries, 
your {+dl+} storage :ref:`configuration <datalake-configuration-file>` must 
contain the settings that define: 

- Your |s3|, |service|, and |http| {+data-lake-stores+}.
- {+dl+} virtual databases and collections that map to your |s3|, |service|, 
  and |http| {+data-lake-store+}\s.

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "stores" : [
          {
            "name" : "<atlas-store-name>",
            "provider": "atlas",
            "clusterName": "<atlas-cluster-name>", 
            "projectId": "<atlas-project-ID>"
          },
          {
            "name" : "<s3-store-name>",
            "provider" : "s3",
            "region" : "<aws-region>",
            "bucket" : "<s3-bucket-name>",
            "prefix" : "<file-path-prefix>",
            "delimiter" : "<path-separator>"
          },
          {
            "name" : "<store-name>",
            "provider": "http",
            "urls": ["<url>"],
            "defaultFormat" : "<string>"
            "allowInsecure": <boolean>,
          }
        ],
        "databases" : [
          {
            "name" : "<database-name>",
            "collections" : [
              {
                "name" : "<collection-name>",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<atlas-store-name>",
                    "database" : "<atlas-database-name>",
                    "collection" : "<atlas-collection-name>" 
                  },
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<s3-store-name>",
                    "path" : "<path-to-file>"
                  },
                  {
                    "storeName" : "<store-name>",
                    "urls" : ["<url>"],
                    "defaultFormat" : "<string>"
                    "allowInsecure" : <boolean>,
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

To learn more about these settings, see :ref:`datalake-configuration-file`.

When you :doc:`connect </tutorial/connect>` to your {+dl+} and run federated
queries, {+dl+} combines data from your |service| cluster and |s3| bucket 
in virtual databases and collections and returns a union of data in the 
results.
