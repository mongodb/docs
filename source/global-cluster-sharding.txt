behavior and how to enable sharding for :ref:`global-clusters`.

Sharding Collections for Global Writes
--------------------------------------

Unsharded collections must meet the following compatibility
requirements *prior to sharding* to utilize |global-write| when
sharded:

- Every document in the collection **must** include a ``location``
  field.

- The value of the ``location`` field **must** be either an
  |iso3166-1a2| country code (``"US"``, ``"DE"``, ``"IN"``) *or* a
  supported |iso3166-2| subdivision code (``"US-DC"``, ``"DE-BE"``,
  ``"IN-DL"``). Documents that do not match this criteria can be routed
  to any shard in the cluster. To view the complete list of currently
  supported country or subdivision codes, visit
  https://cloud.mongodb.com/static/atlas/country_iso_codes.txt.

For collections that meet the stated requirements, you *must* shard
the collection using the following pattern:

.. code-block:: json

   { "location" : 1, "<secondary_field>" : 1 }

A shard key on the ``location`` field alone may result in bottlenecks,
especially for workloads where a subset of countries or subdivisions
receive the majority of write operations. |service| |global-write|
requires a :manual:`compound shard key </core/index-compound>` to
facilitate efficient distribution of sharded data across the cluster.
|service| |global-write-cluster| shard keys share the same restrictions
as MongoDB shard keys. For example: the secondary shard key field
*can't* be an array.

   To learn more about:

   - How to choose a secondary shard key field and the effect of shard
     key choice on data distribution, see
     :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-selection>`.

   - What shard key limitations are, see
     :ref:`Shard Key Limitations <limits-shard-keys>`.

.. admonition:: Changing the Shard Key
   :class: important

   After sharding, what you can modify depends upon the version of
   MongoDB that you run:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 30 30
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - MongoDB Version
        - Modify Shard Key Keys
        - Modify Shard Key Values

      * - MongoDB 4.0
        - No
        - No

      * - MongoDB 4.2
        - No
        - Yes

      * - MongoDB 4.4
        - Yes, add fields to Key
        - Yes

The |service| :ref:`data-explorer` supports creating sharded
collections with specific validations for |global-write|.

.. seealso::

   To learn more, see
   :ref:`de-shard-collection-for-global-writes`.

You can also use the |mongo| shell to execute the
:method:`sh.shardCollection() <sh.shardCollection>`. After sharding
the collection, you must use the |service| :ref:`data-explorer`
to enable |global-write| for that collection.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about sharding collections via the Data Explorer, see
   :ref:`de-shard-collection-for-global-writes`.

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |service| encounters an error while sharding a collection for global
writes, a message appears in the banner at the top of the screen.

.. figure:: /images/sharding-error1.png
   :alt: Screenshot of an Atlas sharding error alert
   :figwidth: 550px

Click :guilabel:`See Details` to learn about the error. A modal window
appears with the complete error message and a :guilabel:`Fix Now`
button:

.. figure:: /images/sharding-error2.png
   :alt: Screenshot of an Atlas sharding error modal window
   :figwidth: 550px

Click :guilabel:`Fix Now` to navigate to the Data Explorer, where you
can request to cancel the sharding operation. After making any
necessary changes to the collection as indicated by the error message,
you can start the sharding process again.

Possible errors include:

An index already exists on the custom shard key.
  If the field chosen as the second part of the compound shard key is
  already indexed, the sharding operation may fail.

The shard key field is not present.
  All documents in the collection must contain both the shard key
  fields.

The collection is already sharded.
  If the collection has already been manually sharded, the operation
  fails.

The collection has a custom default collation.
  A :manual:`custom default collation </reference/collation/>` on the
  collection may cause a sharding error.

.. _global-writes-write-operations:

|global-write-cluster| Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each write to a sharded collection *must* include the shard key for the
operation to succeed. For each document in a write operation, MongoDB
uses the ``location`` field of the shard key to determine the zone to
which to route the data. MongoDB selects a shard associated to that
zone as the target for writing the document, facilitating
geographically isolated and segmented data storage.

MongoDB can only guarantee this behavior for inserted documents that
meet the criteria defined in :ref:`global-writes-collections`.
Specifically, MongoDB can route a document whose ``location`` field
doesn't conform to |iso3166-1a2| *or* |iso3166-2| to any shard in the
cluster.

.. _global-writes-read-operations:

|global-write-cluster| Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB query routing depends on whether the read operation includes
the full shard key **and** that the ``location`` value corresponds to a
supported |iso3166-1a2| country code (``"US"``, ``"DE"``, ``"IN"``)
*or* a supported |iso3166-2| subdivision code (``"US-DC"``,
``"DE-BE"``, ``"IN-DL"``).

- For queries that do include the full shard key and whose ``location``
  value meets the requirements for |global-write|, MongoDB targets the
  read operation to the zone which maps to the ``location`` value or
  values specified in the query.

- For read operations that don't include the ``location`` value , or if
  the ``location`` value doesn't correspond to a supported
  |iso3166-1a2| country code or |iso3166-2| subdivision code, MongoDB
  must broadcast the read operation to every zone in the cluster.

- For |global-write| zones which have :guilabel:`Read-only` nodes in
  geographically distant regions, clients in those regions can query
  the local :guilabel:`Read-only` node for that zone by specifying the
  full shard key as part of the query *and* issuing the read
  operation with a :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`
  of :readmode:`nearest`.

.. important::

   Secondary reads may return stale data depending on the level
   of replication lag between the secondary node and the primary.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about:

   - MongoDB read preference, see
     :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`.

   - MongoDB query routing, see
     :manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>`.

Sharding Collections without Global Writes
------------------------------------------

|global-write| clusters support the same
:manual:`Ranged </core/ranged-sharding>` and
:manual:`Hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` sharding strategies
as a standard |service| sharded cluster. For sharded collections whose
shard keys and document schema do not support |global-write|,
MongoDB distributes the sharded data evenly across the available shards
in the cluster with respect to the chosen
:manual:`shard key </core/sharding-shard-key/>`. Consider using a
separate sharded cluster for data that cannot take advantage of
|global-write| functionality.

You cannot modify a collection to support |global-write| after
sharding. Consider whether you might want to use |global-write|
for a collection in the future before choosing an incompatible shard
key.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about |global-write| sharding requirements, see
   :ref:`global-writes-collections`.

Unsharded Collections in Global Write Clusters
----------------------------------------------

|global-write-clusters| provide the same support for unsharded
collections as a standard |service| sharded cluster. For each database
in the cluster, MongoDB stores its unsharded collections on a
:term:`primary shard`. Use :method:`sh.status() <sh.status>` from the
|mongo| shell to determine the primary shard for the database.
