  commmand to update your Helm repo:

  .. code-block:: sh

  Populate the ``<version>`` placeholder and run the following ``kubectl`` 
  command to deploy the CRDs to your |k8s| cluster:

  Run the following ``helm`` command to deploy the |k8s-op-short| to the 
  default namespace in your |k8s| cluster:

  .. code-block:: sh

     helm upgrade mongodb-kubernetes-operator mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes

     
  You can pass the ``--namespace`` and ``--namespace-create`` flags to deploy 
  the |k8s-op-short| to a non-default namespace, like so:

  .. code-block::
     
     helm upgrade mongodb-kubernetes-operator mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes \
     --namespace mongodb \
     --create-namespace
