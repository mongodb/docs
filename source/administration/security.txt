Security Practices and Management
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

As with all software running in a networked environment,
administrators of MongoDB must consider security and risk
exposures for a MongoDB deployment. There are no magic solutions for risk
mitigation, and maintaining a secure MongoDB deployment is an ongoing
process. This document takes a *Defense in Depth* approach to securing
MongoDB deployments, and addresses a number of different methods for
managing risk and reducing risk exposure

The intent of *Defense In Depth* approaches are to ensure there are no
exploitable points of failure in your deployment that could allow an
intruder or un-trusted party to access the data stored in the MongoDB
database. The easiest and most effective way to reduce the risk of
exploitation is to run MongoDB in a trusted environment, limit access,
follow a system of least privilege, and follow best development and
deployment practices. See the :ref:`security-reduce-risk` section in this document for
more information.

For information on controlling user access through MongoDB user
privileges, see the :ref:`security-authorization` section in this
document. See also the following documents:

- :doc:`/reference/user-privileges`

- :doc:`/reference/privilege-documents`

For information on Kerberos authentication, which is available in
MongoDB Enterprise, see
:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`.

.. _security-reduce-risk:

Strategies for Reducing Risk
----------------------------

The most effective way to reduce risk for MongoDB deployments is to
run your entire MongoDB deployment, including all MongoDB components
(i.e. :program:`mongod`, :program:`mongos` and application instances)
in a *trusted environment*. Trusted environments use the following
strategies to control access:

- network filter (e.g. firewall) rules that block all connections
  from unknown systems to MongoDB components.

- bind :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances to specific
  IP addresses to limit accessibility.

- limit MongoDB programs to non-public local networks, and virtual
  private networks.

You may further reduce risk by:

- requiring authentication for access to MongoDB instances.

- requiring strong, complex, single purpose authentication credentials.
  This should be part of your internal security policy but is not
  currently configurable in MongoDB.

- deploying a model of least privilege, where all users have *only* the
  amount of access they need to accomplish required tasks, and no
  more.

- following the best application development and deployment practices,
  which includes: validating all inputs, managing sessions, and
  application-level access control.

Continue reading this document for more information on specific
strategies and configurations to help reduce the risk exposure of
your application.

Vulnerability Notification
--------------------------

10gen takes the security of MongoDB and associated products very
seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in MongoDB or another
10gen product, or would like to know more about our vulnerability
reporting and response process, see the
:doc:`/administration/vulnerability-notification` document.

Networking Risk Exposure
------------------------

.. _security-port-numbers:

Interfaces and Port Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following list includes all default ports used by MongoDB:

``27017``
   This is the default port for :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
   instances. You can change this port with :setting:`port` or
   :option:`--port <mongod --port>`.

``27018``
   This is the default port when running with :option:`--shardsvr
   <mongod --shardsvr>` runtime operation or :setting:`shardsvr`
   setting.

``27019``
   This is the default port when running with :option:`--configsvr
   <mongod --configsvr>` runtime operation or :setting:`configsvr`
   setting.

``28017``
   This is the default port for the web status page. This is always
   accessible at a port that is ``1000`` greater than the port
   determined by :setting:`port`.

By default MongoDB programs (i.e. :program:`mongos` and
:program:`mongod`) will bind to all available network interfaces
(i.e. IP addresses) on a system. The next section outlines various
runtime options that allow you to limit access to MongoDB programs.

Network Interface Limitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can limit the network exposure with the following configuration options:

- the :setting:`nohttpinterface` setting for
  :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances.

  Disables the "home" status page, which would run on port ``28017``
  by default. The status interface is read-only by default. You may
  also specify this option on the command line as
  :option:`mongod --nohttpinterface` or :option:`mongos --nohttpinterface`.
  Authentication does not control or affect access to this interface.

  .. important:: Disable this option for production deployments. If
     you *do* leave this interface enabled, you should only allow trusted
     clients to access this port. See :ref:`security-firewalls`.

- the :setting:`port` setting for :program:`mongod` and
  :program:`mongos` instances.

  Changes the main port on which the :program:`mongod` or
  :program:`mongos` instance listens for connections. Changing the
  port does not meaningfully reduce risk or limit exposure.

  You may also specify this option on the command line as
  :option:`mongod --port` or :option:`mongos --port`.

  Whatever port you attach :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
  instances to, you should only allow trusted clients to connect to
  this port. See :ref:`security-firewalls`.

- the :setting:`rest` setting for :program:`mongod`
  and :program:`mongos` instances.

  Enables a fully interactive administrative :term:`REST` interface,
  which is *disabled by default.* The status interface, which *is*
  enabled by default, is read-only. This configuration makes that
  interface fully interactive. The REST interface does not support any
  authentication and you should always restrict access to this
  interface to only allow trusted clients to connect to this port.

  You may also enable this interface on the command line as
  :option:`mongod --rest`.

  .. important:: Disable this option for production deployments. If
     *do* you leave this interface enabled, you should only allow trusted
     clients to access this port.

- the :setting:`bind_ip` setting for :program:`mongod` and
  :program:`mongos` instances.

  Limits the network interfaces on which MongoDB programs will listen
  for incoming connections. You can also specify a number of
  interfaces by passing :setting:`bind_ip` a comma separated list of
  IP addresses. You can use the :option:`mongod --bind_ip` and
  :option:`mongos --bind_ip` option on the command line at run time to
  limit the network accessibility of a MongoDB program.

  .. important::

     Make sure that your :program:`mongod` and
     :program:`mongos` instances are only accessible on trusted
     networks. If your system has more than one network interface,
     bind MongoDB programs to the private or internal network
     interface.

.. _security-firewalls:

Firewalls
~~~~~~~~~

Firewalls allow administrators to filter and control access to a
system by providing granular control over what network
communications. For administrators of MongoDB, the following
capabilities are important:

- limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to specific
  systems.

- limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts.

On Linux systems, the ``iptables`` interface provides access to the
underlying ``netfilter`` firewall. On Windows systems ``netsh``
command line interface provides access to the underlying Windows
Firewall. For additional information about firewall configuration
consider the following documents:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`

For best results and to minimize overall exposure, ensure that *only*
traffic from trusted sources can reach :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances and that the :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances can only connect to trusted outputs.

.. seealso:: For MongoDB deployments on Amazon's web services, see the
   :ecosystem:`Amazon EC2 </platforms/amazon-ec2>` page, which addresses Amazon's
   Security Groups and other EC2-specific security features.

Virtual Private Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two
networks over an encrypted and limited-access trusted
network. Typically MongoDB users who use VPNs use SSL rather than
IPSEC VPNs for performance issues.

Depending on configuration and implementation VPNs provide for
certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which
requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all
clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, using a
VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can
prevent tampering and "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

.. _security-operations:

Operations
----------

Always run the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` process as a
*unique* user with the minimum required permissions and access. Never
run a MongoDB program as a ``root`` or administrative users. The
system users that run the MongoDB processes should have robust
authentication credentials that prevent unauthorized or casual
access.

To further limit the environment, you can run the :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` process in a ``chroot`` environment. Both user-based
access restrictions and ``chroot`` configuration follow recommended
conventions for administering all daemon processes on Unix-like
systems.

You can disable anonymous access to the database by enabling
authentication using the :setting:`auth` as detailed in the
:ref:`security-authentication` section.

.. _security-authentication:

Authentication
--------------

MongoDB provides basic support for authentication with the
:setting:`auth` and :setting:`keyFile` configuration settings.
To require authentication on a single-instance deployment, start the
:program:`mongod` instance with the :setting:`auth` setting.
For multi-instance deployments
(i.e. :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and :term:`sharded clusters
<sharded cluster>`) use the :setting:`keyFile` setting, which implies
:setting:`auth` and allows intra-deployment authentication and
operation.

For MongoDB Enterprise installations, MongoDB also supports
authentication using a Kerberos service. See
:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`.

For basic authentication, be aware of the following behaviors:

- Authentication is **disabled** by default.

- The ``system.users`` collection in each database stores all
  credentials. If you have the ``userAdmin`` role on a database, you can
  query authenticated users in that database with the following
  operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.system.users.find()

- When setting up authentication for the first time you must either:

  - add at least one user to the ``admin`` database before starting
    the :program:`mongod` instance with :setting:`auth`.

  - add the first user to the ``admin`` database when connected to
    the :program:`mongod` instance from a ``localhost`` connection. [#sharded-localhost]_

  To add and maintain users, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-authentication`.

- Support for authentication with sharded clusters.

  .. versionadded:: 2.0

  Before 2.0 sharded clusters *had* to run with trusted applications and
  a trusted networking configuration.

.. [#sharded-localhost] Because of :issue:`SERVER-6591`, you cannot
   add the first user to a sharded cluster using the ``localhost``
   connection in 2.2. If you are running a 2.2 sharded cluster, and
   want to enable authentication, you must deploy the cluster and add
   the first user to the ``admin`` database before restarting the
   cluster to run with :setting:`keyFile`.

.. _security-authorization:

Authorization
-------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

MongoDB provides role-based access to databases and database operations
through each database's :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>`
collection.

Be aware of the following behaviors:

- MongoDB provisions access on a per-database level. Users exist in the
  context of a single logical database.

- Roles determine the user's access to the database. For a list of
  available roles, see :ref:`user-roles`.

- User documents in the :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>`
  collection in one database can grant access to users defined in
  another database. See :ref:`user-roles`.

- The ``admin`` database provides roles not available in other
  databases. You can assign ``admin`` users roles that effectively make
  them MongoDB system superusers. See :ref:`database-admin-roles` and
  :ref:`admin-roles`.

- The ``system.users`` collection in each database stores all users and
  their roles. If you have the ``userAdmin`` role on a database, you can
  query authorized users in that database with the following operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.system.users.find()

- The ``system.users`` collection is protected to prevent privilege
  escalation attacks by requiring you to have the ``userAdmin`` role.

- You can be logged in as only one user for a given database, including
  the ``admin`` database. If you authenticate to a database as one user
  and later authenticate on the same database as a different user, the
  second authentication invalidates the first. Logging into a
  *different* database, however, does not invalidate authentication on
  other databases.

For more information on controlling user access, see the following:

- :doc:`/reference/user-privileges`

- :doc:`/reference/privilege-documents`

Interfaces
----------

Simply limiting access to a :program:`mongod` is not sufficient for
totally controlling risk exposure. Consider the recommendations in the
following section, for limiting exposure other interface-related
risks.

JavaScript and the Security of the ``mongo`` Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be aware of the following capabilities and behaviors of the
:program:`mongo` shell:

- :program:`mongo` will evaluate a ``.js`` file passed to the
  :option:`mongo --eval` option. The :program:`mongo`
  shell does not validate the input of JavaScript input to
  :option:`--eval <mongo --eval>`.

- :program:`mongo` will evaluate a ``.mongorc.js`` file before
  starting. You can disable this behavior by passing the
  :option:`mongo --norc` option.

  On Linux and Unix systems, :program:`mongo` reads the
  :file:`.mongorc.js` file from :file:`{$HOME}/.mongorc.js`
  (i.e. :file:`~/.mongorc.js`), and Windows :program:`mongo.exe` reads the
  :file:`.mongorc.js` file from :file:`{%HOME%}\.mongorc.js` or
  :file:`{%HOMEDRIVE%}\{%HOMEPATH%}\.mongorc.js`.

HTTP Status Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTTP status interface provides a web-based interface that includes
a variety of operational data, logs, and status reports regarding the
:program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance. The HTTP interface is
always available on the port numbered ``1000`` greater than the
primary :program:`mongod` port. By default this is ``28017``, but is
indirectly set using the :setting:`port` option which allows you to
configure the primary :program:`mongod` port.

Without the :setting:`rest` setting, this interface is entirely
read-only, and limited in scope; nevertheless, this interface may
represent an exposure. To disable the HTTP interface, set the
:setting:`nohttpinterface` run time option or the
:option:`--nohttpinterface <mongod --nohttpinterface>` command line
option.

REST API
~~~~~~~~

The REST API to MongoDB provides additional information and
write access on top of the HTTP Status interface. The REST interface
is *disabled* by default, and is not recommended for production use.

While the REST API does not provide any support for insert, update, or
remove operations, it does provide administrative access, and its
accessibility represents a vulnerability in a secure environment.

If you must use the REST API, please control and limit access to the
REST API. The REST API does not include any support for
authentication, even when running with :setting:`auth` (authorization) enabled.

See the following documents for instructions on restricting access to
the REST API interface:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`

Data Encryption
---------------

To support audit requirements, you may need to encrypt data stored in
MongoDB. For best results you can encrypt this data in the application
layer, by encrypting the content of fields that hold secure data.

Additionally, `10gen`_ has a `partnership`_ with `Gazzang`_ to encrypt
and secure sensitive data within MongoDB. The solution encrypts data in
real time and Gazzang provides advanced key management that ensures
only authorized processes and can access this data. The Gazzang
software ensures that the cryptographic keys remain safe and ensures
compliance with standards including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and FERPA. For
more information consider the following resources:
