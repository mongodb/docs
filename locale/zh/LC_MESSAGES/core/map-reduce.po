"In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each "
"input document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the query"
" condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those keys that "
"have multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which collects "
"and condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results in a "
"collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may pass "
"through a *finalize* function to further condense or process the results "
"of the aggregation."

"All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run within the "
":program:`mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the documents of a "

"sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage. "
":dbcommand:`mapReduce` can return the results of a map-reduce operation "
"as a document, or may write the results to collections. The input and the"

"The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to map-reduce "
"operations. For instance, when processing a document, the map function "
"can create more than one key and value mapping or no mapping. Map-reduce "
"operations can also use a custom JavaScript function to make final "
"modifications to the results at the end of the map and reduce operation, "
"such as perform additional calculations."
