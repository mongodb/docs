MongoDB provides different text search capabilities depending on whether
your data is hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` or a self-managed
deployment.

MongoDB Atlas Search
--------------------

To perform text search on data hosted on MongoDB Atlas, use
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Search </atlas-search>`. Atlas Search supports
fine-grained text indexing and a rich query language for fast, relevant
search results.

To learn more and get started with Atlas Search, see: 

- :atlas:`Atlas Search Aggregation Pipeline Stages 
  </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/>`
- :atlas:`Defining Atlas Search Indexes 
  </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`
- :atlas:`Running Atlas Search Queries 
  </reference/atlas-search/searching/>`

Text Search on Self-Managed Deployments
---------------------------------------

For self-managed (non-Atlas) deployments, MongoDB's text search
capability supports query operations that perform a text search of
string content. To perform text search, MongoDB uses a :ref:`text index
<index-feature-text>` and the :query:`$text` operator.

To learn more about text search for self-managed deployments, see:

- :ref:`text-search-operators-on-premises`

MongoDB also supports text search for various languages. For a list of
supported languages, see :ref:`text-search-languages`.
