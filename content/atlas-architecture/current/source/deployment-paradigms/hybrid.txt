Hybrid {+service+} deployments are a combination of cloud deployments and 
on-premise deployments. The cloud deployments can be 
:ref:`single-region <arch-center-paradigms-single>` or 
:ref:`mutli-region <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>` deployments. On-premises
deployments can be either local deployments that you create with the
{+atlas-cli+}, or self-managed deployments in 
:manual:`MongoDB Enterprise </administration/install-enterprise/>` or
:manual:`MongoDB Community </administration/install-community/>`.

Hybrid deployments allow you to keep some data on premises for
development or compliance, while still leveraging
the following benefits of {+service+} cloud deployments:

- Scalability and cost savings
- High availability and low latency on a regional or global scale
- Features to help meet cloud compliance requirements for 
  :ref:`data sovereignty <arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>` 

.. note::

   {+service+} does not support splitting a single cluster to span the 
   two deployment types.

The following diagram shows one example of a hybrid deployment, in 
which an application has one cluster in an AWS region and an on-prem 
cluster:

Use Case for Hybrid Deployments
-------------------------------

A hybrid deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to deploy your production workloads in the cloud, which
  allows you to scale your resources based on the needs of your
  application and pay only for the resources you use.
- You want to develop on local {+clusters+}, which reduces
  costs when compared to cloud-hosted development.

If this is your use case, we recommend that you deploy locally 
by using the :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. You
can deploy your cloud databases as single-region, multi-region, and 
multi-cloud.

Use the following resources to select your cloud deployment type based
on your cloud needs:

- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`

Recommendations for Hybrid Deployments
--------------------------------------

The {+atlas-arch-center+} does not currently cover recommendations
specific to hybrid deployments. Contact {+ps+}
team to create a custom landing zone for your {+service+} hybrid
deployments.

Creating Hybrid Deployments
---------------------------

To learn how to configure cloud deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see :atlas:`Create a Cluster 
</tutorial/create-new-cluster/>` in the {+service+} documentation.

To learn how to configure an on-premises deployment, see 
:atlascli:`Create a Local {+service+} Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>` 
with the {+atlas-cli+} and :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>` for 
self-managed deployments in MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB Community.
