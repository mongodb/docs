Customize the Score in Results

Every document returned by an |fts| query is assigned a score based
on relevance, and the documents included in a result set are returned
in order from highest score to lowest.

Behavior
--------

Many factors can influence a document's score, including:

- The position of the search term in the document,
- The frequency of occurrence of the search term in the document,
- The type of :ref:`operator <fts-operators>` the query uses,
- The type of :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` the query uses.

The score assigned to a returned document is part of the document's
metadata. You can include each returned document's score along with the
result set by using a :pipeline:`$project` in your aggregation
pipeline. After a :pipeline:`$project` stage, you do not need to 
include a descending :pipeline:`$sort` because |fts| returns the documents 
from highest score to lowest by default. 

The following example query uses a :pipeline:`$project` stage to add a
field named ``score`` to the returned documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.movies.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "text": {
           "query": "Helsinki",
           "path": "plot"
         }
       }
     },
     {
       $project: {
         plot: 1,
         title: 1,
         score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
       }
     }
   ])

More information about the Lucene scoring algorithm can be found in the
`Lucene documentation <https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_5_0/scoring.html>`__.

Options
-------

The following score modifying options are available to all operators.
For details and examples, click any of the following options:

- :ref:`scoring-boost`
- :ref:`scoring-constant`
- :ref:`scoring-function`

.. _scoring-boost:

``boost`` 
~~~~~~~~~

The ``boost`` option multiplies a result's base score by a given number 
or the value of a numeric field in the documents. For example, you can 
use ``boost`` to increase the importance of certain matching documents 
in the result.

.. note::

   - The ``boost`` and ``constant`` options can't be used together.
   - The ``boost`` option with ``path`` is the same as multiplying 
     using the :ref:`scoring-function` option with a :ref:`path 
     expression <function-score-expression>`.

Fields 
``````

The ``boost`` option takes the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 15 60

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description 

   * - ``value`` 
     - float 
     - Conditional 
     - Number to multiply the default base score by. Value must be a 
       positive number. Either ``value`` or ``path`` is required, but 
       you can't specify both.

   * - ``path`` 
     - string 
     - Conditional 
     - Name of the numeric field whose value to multiply the default 
       base score by. Either ``path`` or ``value`` is required, but you 
       can't specify both.

   * - ``undefined`` 
     - float 
     - Optional 
     - Numeric value to substitute for ``path`` if the numeric field 
       specified through ``path`` is not found in the documents. If 
       omitted, defaults to ``0``. You can specify this only if you 
       specify ``path``.

Examples 
````````

The following examples use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. If you have the :ref:`sample dataset
<available-sample-datasets>` on your cluster, you can create the |fts|
``default`` index and run the example queries on your cluster.  
 
The  sample :ref:`compound-ref` queries demonstrate how to increase the 
importance of one search criteria over another. The queries include a 
``$project`` stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` and 
``score``. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: ``value`` Field Example
      :tabid: number

      In the following example, the :ref:`compound-ref` operator uses 
      :ref:`text-ref` operator to search for the the term ``Helsinki`` 
      in the ``plot`` and ``title`` fields. The query for the ``title`` 
      field uses ``score`` with the ``boost`` option to multiply the 
      score results by 3, as specified in the ``value`` field.

      .. code-block:: json
         :linenos:

         db.movies.aggregate([
           {
             "$search": {
               "compound": {
                 "should": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "Helsinki",
                     "path": "plot"
                   }
                 },
                 {
                   "text": {
                     "query": "Helsinki",
                     "path": "title",
                     "score": { "boost": { "value": 3 } }
                   }
                 }]
               }
             }
           },
           {
             "$limit": 5
           },
           {
             $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "score": { "$meta": "searchScore" }
             }
           }
         ])

      The above query returns the following results, in which the score 
      for documents where the ``title`` matches the query term is 
      multiplied by 3 from its base value:

   .. tab:: ``path`` Field Example
      :tabid: patheg

      In the following example, the :ref:`compound-ref` operator 
      uses :ref:`text-ref` operator to search for the the term 
      ``Helsinki`` in the ``plot`` and ``title`` fields. The query 
      against the ``title`` field uses ``score`` with the ``boost`` 
      option to multiply the score results by the numeric field 
      ``imdb.rating`` in ``path``. If the numeric field isn't found in 
      the specified ``path``, the operator multiplies the score of the 
      documents by ``3``.

      .. code-block:: json 
         :linenos:

         db.movies.aggregate([
           {

                         "undefined": 3
                       }
                     }

             }
           }
         ])

      The above query returns the following results, in which the score 
      for documents where the ``title`` field matches the query term is 
      multiplied from its base value by the value of the numeric field 
      ``imdb.rating`` or ``3``, if the field couldn't be found in the 
      documents:

.. _scoring-constant:

``constant``
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``constant`` option replaces the base score with a specified number. 

.. note::

  The ``constant`` and ``boost`` options may not be used together.

Examples
````````

The following example uses the default index on the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection to query the ``plot`` and ``title`` 
fields using the :ref:`compound-ref` operator. In the query, the 
:ref:`text-ref` operator uses ``score`` with the ``constant`` option to 
replace all score results with ``5`` for results that match the query 
against the ``title`` field only.

.. _scoring-function:

``function``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``function`` option allows you to alter the final score of the 
document using a numeric field . You can specify the numeric field for 
computing the final score through an :ref:`expression 
<function-score-expression>`. If the final result of the function score is less than 
``0``, |fts| replaces the score with ``0``.

.. _function-score-expression:

Expressions
```````````
Use the following expressions with the ``function`` option 
to alter the final score of the document:

- Arithmetic expressions, which add or multiply a series of numbers. 

- Constant expressions, which allow a :ref:`constant 
  <scoring-constant>` number in the function score.

- Gaussian decay expressions, which decay, or reduces, the scores by 
  multiplying at a specified rate.

- Path expressions, which incorporate an indexed numeric field value 
  into a function score. 

- Score expressions, which return the relevance score assigned by |fts|.

- Unary expressions, which are expressions that take a single argument. 
  In |fts|, you can calculate the log10(x) or log10(x+1) of a specified 
  number. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Arithmetic
      :tabid: arithmetic

      An arithmetic expression adds or multiplies a series of numbers. 
      For example, you can use arithmetic expression to modify 
      relevance ranking through a numeric field from a data enrichment 
      pipeline. It must include one of the following options:

           - Adds a series of numbers. Takes an array of 
             :ref:`expressions <function-score-expression>`, which can 
             have negative values. Array length must be greater than or 
             equal to ``2``. 

             .. example:: 

                .. code-block:: json

                     ]
                   }

                |fts| uses the ``path`` and ``score`` expressions to 
                add the following: 
                
                - Numeric value of the ``rating`` field or ``0``, if 
                  the ``rating`` field is not present in the document
                - Relevance score, which is the score |fts| assigns 
                  based on relevance

         * - ``multiply``
           - array of :ref:`expressions <function-score-expression>`
           - Multiplies a series of numbers. Takes an array of   
             :ref:`expressions <function-score-expression>`, which can 
             have negative values. Array length must be greater than or 
             equal to ``2``.

                     ]
                   }

                |fts| uses the ``path``, ``score``, and ``constant`` 
                expressions to alter the final score of the document. 
                It multiplies the following: 
              
                - Numeric value of the path expression, which is the 
                  numeric value of the ``popularity`` field or 
                  ``2.5``, if the ``popularity`` field is not present 
                  in the document
                - Relevance score, which is the score |fts| assigns 
                  based on relevance
                - Constant value of ``0.75``

      .. note:: 
       
         You can't replace an arithmetic expression that evaluates to 
         ``undefined`` with a constant value.

   .. tab:: Constant
      :tabid: constant 

      A constant expression allows a :ref:`constant <scoring-constant>` 
      number in the function score. For example, you can use 
      ``constant`` to modify relevance ranking through a numeric value 
      from a data enrichment pipeline. It must include the following 
      option: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 10 15 60  

         * - Option

           - Description

         * - ``constant``
           - float
           - Number that indicates a fixed value. |fts| supports 
             negative values. 

      .. example::

              }
            } 

   .. tab:: Gaussian
      :tabid: gauss

      A gaussian decay expression allows you to decay, or reduce by 
      multiplying, the final scores of the documents based on the 
      distance of a numeric field value from a specified origin point. 
      ``decay`` is computed as:

      For example, you can use ``gauss`` to adjust the relevant score 
      of documents based on document freshness, or date influencing  
      higher ranking. ``gauss`` takes the following options:

         * - ``decay`` 
           - double 
           - Optional 
           - Rate at which you want to multiply the scores. Value must 
             be a positive number between ``0`` and ``1`` exclusive. If 
             omitted, defaults to ``0.5``.

             For documents whose numeric field value (specified using 
             ``path``) is at a distance (specified using ``scale``) 
             away from ``origin`` plus or minus (``±``) ``offset``, 
             |fts| multiplies the current score using ``decay``. 

         * - ``offset`` 
           - double 
           - Optional 
           - Number to use to determine the distance from origin. The 
             decay operation is performed only for documents whose 
             distances are greater than ``origin`` plus or minus 
             (``±``) ``offset``. If ommitted, defaults to ``0``.

         * - ``origin`` 
           - double 
           - Required 
           - Point of origin from which to calculate the distance. 

         * - ``path`` 
           - :ref:`expression <function-score-expression>` 
           - Required 
           - Name of the numeric field whose value you want to use to

           - Distance from ``origin`` plus or minus (``±``) ``offset`` 
             at which scores must be multiplied. 

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: sh 
            :copyable: false 

            {

                }
              }
            } 

         Suppose the max rating is ``100``. |fts| uses the ``rating`` 
         field in the documents to decay the score:
         
         - Retains the current score for documents with rating between 
           ``90`` to ``100``.
         - Multiplies the current score by ``0.5`` for documents with a 
           rating lower than ``90``. 
         - Multiplies the current score by ``0.25`` for documents with 
           a rating lower than ``85``, and so on.

   .. tab:: Path
      :tabid: path 

      A path expression incorporates an indexed numeric field value 
      into a function score. It can either be a ``string`` or an 
      ``object``. 
       
      If ``string``, the value is the name of the numeric field to 
      search over for the path expression. 

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: sh 
            :copyable: false 

            {
              "function": {
                "path": "rating"
              }
            }

         |fts| incorporates the numeric value of the ``rating`` 
         field in the final score of the document.
       
      If ``object``, the path expression takes the following options: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 15 10 15 70 

         * - Option
           - Type
           - Necessity
           - Description

         * - ``value``
           - string
           - Required
           - Name of numeric field. Field can contain negative numeric 
             values.

         * - ``undefined``
           - float
           - Optional
           - Value to use if the numeric field specified using 
             ``value`` is missing in the document. If omitted, defaults 
             to ``0``.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: sh 
            :copyable: false 

            {
              "function": {
                "path": {"value": "quantity", "undefined": 2}
              }
            }

         |fts| incorporates numeric value of the ``quantity`` field 
         or ``2``, if the ``quantity`` field is not present in the 
         document, in the final score of the document.
       
      A path expression can't be an ``array`` and can't contain 
      :ref:`regex-ref` or :ref:`wildcard-ref` in the ``path``. 

   .. tab:: Score
      :tabid: score 

      A score expression represents the relevance score, which is the 
      score |fts| assigns documents based on relevance, of the query. 
      It is the same as the current score of the document. It must 
      include the following option: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 10 15 60

         * - Option
           - Type
           - Description

         * - ``score``
           - string
           - Value of relevance score of the query. Value must be 
             ``relevance``. 

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: sh 
            :copyable: false 

            {
              "function": {
                "score": "relevance"
              }
            }

   .. tab:: Unary
      :tabid: unary 

      A unary expression is an expression that takes a single argument. 
      In |fts|, you can use unary expressions to calculate the log10(x) 
      or log10(x+1) of a specified number. For example, you can use 
      ``log1p`` to influence the relevance score by document popularity 
      score. It must include one of the following options:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 10 15 60

         * - Option
           - Type
           - Description

         * - ``log``
           - :ref:`expression <function-score-expression>`
           - Calculates the log10 of a number. 

             .. example:: 

                .. code-block:: json 
                   :copyable: false 

                   {
                     "function": {
                       "log": {
                         "multiply": [
                           {"path": "popularity"},
                           {"constant": 0.5},
                           {"score": "relevance"}
                         ]
                       }
                     }
                   }

                The preceding example uses the arithmetic expression 
                ``multiply`` option. |fts| calculates the log10 of the 
                arithmetic expression.
              
             If the specified expression evaluates to less than or 
             equal to ``0``, then the ``log`` evaluates to undefined. 
            
             .. example:: 

                .. code-block:: json 
                   :copyable: false 

                   {
                     "function": {
                       "log": {
                         "constant": -5.1
                       }
                     }
                   }  

                In the preceding example, log10 of ``-5.1``, specified 
                using a constant expression, evaluates to undefined. 
                Therefore, the final score of the document is ``0``.

         * - ``log1p``
           - :ref:`expression <function-score-expression>`
           - Adds ``1`` to the number and then calculates its log10. 
             For example: 

             .. code-block:: json 
                :copyable: false 

                {
                  "function": {
                    "log1p": {
                      "path": {
                        "value": "rating",
                        "undefined": 4
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }

             The preceding example uses the path expression. |fts| adds 
             ``1`` to the numeric value of the path expression and then 
             calculates the log10.

      .. example:: 

         In this example, the :ref:`text-ref` operator uses ``score``

         ``5``, away from ``origin``, which is ``9.5``, plus or minus 
         ``offset``, which is ``0``, |fts| must multiply the score 
         using ``decay``, which starts at ``0.5``. This query includes 
         a :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to up to ``10`` 
         results and a :pipeline:`$project` stage to add the

      .. example:: 

         In this example, the :ref:`text-ref` operator uses ``score`` 
         with the ``function`` option to replace the relevance score 
         of the query with the value of the numeric field 
         ``imdb.rating`` or ``4.6``, if the ``imdb.rating`` field is 
         not present in the documents.

   .. tab:: Score
      :tabid: score 

      .. example:: 

         In this example, the :ref:`text-ref` operator uses ``score`` 
         with the ``function`` option to return the relevance score, 
         which is the same as the current score, of the documents.

         In this example, the :ref:`text-ref` operator uses ``score`` 
         with the ``function`` option to calculate the log10 of the 
         ``imdb.rating`` field or ``10``, if the ``imdb.rating`` field 
         is not present in the document.
