`Register for an {+service+} account <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register/>`__ using your GitHub account, your Google
account or your email address.

Considerations
--------------

To register with and log in to |service|, you can use one -- and only
one -- of the following options:

- Your email account
- Your GitHub account
- Your Google account

.. note:: 
   If your company uses :doc:`Federated Authentication </security/federated-authentication>`,
   you must use your company email address.

.. _github-accounts:

GitHub Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you register with your GitHub Account, the following differences
apply when using your GitHub account with |service|:

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/account-details.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/2fa.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/unlink-account.rst

.. _google-accounts:

Google Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you register with your Google Account, the following differences
apply when using your Google account with |service|:

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/account-details.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/2fa.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/unlink-account.rst

|mms-full| Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |mms-full|, use your |mms| credentials to
:ref:`log in <atlas-account-login>` to |service|. You can then
create a new |service| project from |mms|.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCSP-22813

Add the |service| CDN Host to your Allow List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-cdn.rst
            
GitHub Accounts Require a Public Email Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you try to register with Github, you must have an public email
address associated with your GitHub account. |service| returns an error
if you attempt to register without a public email address.

To set a public GitHub email address:

1. After you log into GitHub, click :guilabel:`Settings` on your
   profile menu. Your :guilabel:`Public Profile` page should display.

2. Select one email address from the :guilabel:`Public email` dropdown
   in your :guilabel:`Public Profile`.

   If GitHub greys out this dropdown menu:

   a. Click :guilabel:`Emails` from the left-side menu.

   b. Clear the :guilabel:`Keep my email addresses private` box.

   c. Return to the :guilabel:`Public Profile` page and select an email
      address from the :guilabel:`Public email` dropdown.

3. Click :guilabel:`Update profile` to save the changes.

.. _atlas-organization-project:

Create an |service| Organization and Project
--------------------------------------------

|service| creates an organization and project for you. You can 
also create them on your own.

At the :doc:`Organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>` level, you
can implement security controls and create users which work across one
or more :doc:`Projects </tutorial/manage-projects>`. To learn more, see :ref:`org-level-best-practices`.

You can create project-level |service|
:doc:`users and roles </security-add-mongodb-users>` with appropriate
access to the different production and development application
environments. To learn more, see :ref:`project-level-best-practices`.

:ref:`Create an Atlas organization <create-organization>` and
then :ref:`create a project <create-project>` in this organization.
You will deploy your first cluster in this project.

Next Steps
----------

With your |service| account, open the organization and its project, and
then proceed to :doc:`Deploy a {+Free-Cluster+}
</tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster>`.

   To learn about shortcuts you can use to navigate your new |service|
   account, see :ref:`<atlas-go-to>`.
