{+Database-deployment+} :guilabel:`Connect` button is disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

Your {+database-deployment+}'s :guilabel:`Connect` button may be disabled if your
{+database-deployment+} is in the provisioning state. Your
{+database-deployment+} needs to provision when it is first deployed.
{+Clusters+} also must provision when you 
:doc:`scaled them up or down </scale-cluster>`. 

The :guilabel:`Connect` button will become enabled after
|service| provisions the cluster.

For free clusters, provisioning takes less than 15 seconds.

For Flex and Dedicated clusters, provisioning might take 
up to 10 minutes.

Connecting IP address not in IP Access List
-------------------------------------------

Before connecting to your |service| {+database-deployment+}, check that you added your
host's IP address to the :ref:`IP access list <access-list>` for your
{+database-deployment+}'s project. |service| allows client connections only from IP
addresses and |cidr| address ranges in the IP access list.

Authentication to the {+database-deployment+} failed
----------------------------------------------------

To connect to |service|, you must authenticate with a MongoDB database
user. To create a database user for your {+database-deployment+}, see
:doc:`security-add-mongodb-users/`.

Possible solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have created a user and are having trouble authenticating,
try the following:

- Check that you are using the correct username and password for
  your database user, and that you are connecting to the correct
  {+database-deployment+}.

- Check that you are specifying the correct ``authSource`` database in
  your connection string.

- If you have a special character in your password, see
  :ref:`Special characters in connection string password
  <special-pass-characters>`.

Too many open connections to your {+database-deployment+}
---------------------------------------------------------

|service| sets limits for concurrent incoming connections to a
{+database-deployment+}. For {+clusters+}, this is based on the {+cluster+} tier. If
you try to connect when you are at this limit, MongoDB displays an error stating
``connection refused because too many open connections``.

For a detailed comparision of {+cluster+} tiers and their maximum
concurrent connections, see :ref:`connection-limits`.

Possible solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Close any open connections to your {+database-deployment+} not currently in use.

- :doc:`Scale your {+cluster+} </scale-cluster>` to a higher tier to
  support more concurrent connections.

- Restart your application.

- To prevent this issue in the future, consider using the
  :urioption:`maxPoolSize` connection string option to limit the
  number of connections in the connection pool.

To learn how to fix this issue, see
:doc:`/reference/alert-resolutions/connection-alerts`.

Degraded performance in sharded {+clusters+} during spikes in connection counts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-optimized-connection-strings-intro.rst

To learn more about optimized connection strings for sharded 
{+clusters+} behind a private endpoint, see
:ref:`optimized-connection-strings`.

Attempting to connect from behind a firewall
--------------------------------------------

Connecting to the {+atlas-ui+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-cdn.rst

Connecting to a {+Database-Deployment+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| {+database-deployments+} operate on port ``27017``. You must be able to reach
this port to connect to your {+database-deployments+}. Additionally, ensure that the
appropriate ports are open for the following:

- For sharded {+clusters+}, grant access to port 27016.

- For :doc:`BI Connector </bi-connection>`, grant access to port 27015.

You can check your ability to reach a port using the third-party
:guilabel:`Outgoing port tester`.

.. example::

   To check your ability to reach port 27017, visit
   http://portquiz.net:27017.

If you can't access these ports, check your system firewall settings
and ensure that they are not blocking access to these ports.

{+Database-Deployment+} Availability
------------------------------------

If you are using a ``mongodb+srv://`` :manual:`connection string
</reference/connection-string>` and your driver or shell can't find the
DNS host of the |service| {+database-deployment+}, the {+database-deployment+}
might be paused or deleted. Check that the {+database-deployment+} exists. If
this is a paused {+cluster+}, you can :ref:`resume
<resume-cluster>` the {+cluster+} if necessary.

.. note::

   |service| automatically pauses idle ``M0`` {+clusters+} after 30 days
   with no connections.

MongoDB Compass Troubleshooting
-------------------------------

If you use |compass| to connect to your {+cluster+} and experience issues,
see:

- :ref:`atlas-connection-refused-srv` in this section.
- :compass:`Compass Connection Errors </troubleshooting/connection-errors/>`
  in the |compass| documentation.

If you use a :ref:`self-managed X.509 certificate <self-managed-x509>`
or an :manual:`auto-generated X.509 certificate </core/security-x.509/>`
managed by |service| to authenticate to the MongoDB database, when you
connect to |compass|, you must:

1. In |compass|, choose :guilabel:`Fill in connection fields individually`.
2. In the :guilabel:`Authentication` dropdown,  select ``X.509``.
3. Select :guilabel:`More Options`.
4. In the :guilabel:`SSL` dropdown, select :guilabel:`Server and Client Validation`.
5. Add the same path to the downloaded |service|-managed certificate, or
   the self-managed certificate (depending on which you use) to each of
   these fields: :guilabel:`Certificate Authority`, :guilabel:`Client Certificate`,
   and :guilabel:`Client Private Key`.

To learn more, see :compass:`Connect to MongoDB </connect/>` in the
|compass| documentation.

.. _atlas-connection-string-troubleshooting:

Connection String Issues
------------------------

Incorrect Connection String Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :manual:`connection string format </reference/connection-string/>`
you use to connect to |service| depends on several factors, including:

- Your {+mongosh+} version. To learn more, see
  :doc:`mongo-shell-connection`.
- Your driver version. To learn more, see :doc:`/driver-connection/`.

Verify your connection string in a test environment before putting
it into production.

.. _special-pass-characters:

Special Characters in Connection String Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your password includes special characters, and you are using your
password in a connection string URI, encode the special characters.

If you try to update a password with a special character that requires 
:rfc:`percent encoding <3986#section-2.1>`, the following error message 
appears:

.. code-block::

   This password contains special characters which will be URL-encoded.

.. include:: /includes/facts/characters-not-allowed-auth.rst

.. include:: /includes/uri-encoding/encode.rst

.. important::

   Do not encode special characters in your password if you are using
   your password outside of a connection string URI (for example,
   pasting it into {+mongosh+}).

Connection String Incompatible with Driver Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see this error message, your driver is likely out of date. For
instructions on updating your driver, refer to your specific
:driver:`Driver Documentation <>`.

.. _atlas-connection-blocked-by-isp-dns:

Internet Service Provider DNS Blocks Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use the :ref:`DNS seed list connection string format <connections-dns-seedlist>`
to connect to |service|, you might see the following error:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   DNSHostNotFound: Failed to look up service "<MongoDB service name>"

This error may occur when using the default |dns| server that your
|isp| provides. That |dns| server might not support |srv| lookups that
the |dns| seed list connection string format uses.

To resolve the issue, you can try changing your |dns| configuration to
use a :wikipedia:`public DNS server <Public_recursive_name_server>`.

.. This might introduce issues using services that your |isp| provides.
.. The |isp|'s |dns| servers may advertise these unique services to
.. users of those |dns| services. Verify that |isp| services that you
.. use regularly still work as expected if you change |dns| servers.

.. example::

   You can configure your network settings to
   :google:`use Google Public DNS </speed/public-dns/docs/using>`
   instead of your |isp|'s |dns| servers.

After you update your network settings to use a public |dns| server,
:ref:`connect to the {+database-deployment+} <connect-to-database-deployment>`.

Connection String Error with DB Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might see the following error when using the :ref:`DNS seed list
connection string <connections-dns-seedlist>` format
(``mongodb+srv://``) to connect to |service| from one of the
:dbtools:`MongoDB Database Tools </>` (``mongodump``, ``mongorestore``,
etc): 

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   lookup nta8e.mongodb.net on 123.45.67.8:27017: cannot unmarshal DNS message

If so, use one of the following connection options instead:

- Use the ``--uri`` option with a
  :ref:`non-SRV connection string <connections-standard-connection-string-format>` (``mongodb://``).
- Use the ``--host`` option to specify the host to connect to.

.. _atlas-connection-refused-srv:

Connection Refused using SRV Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the
:ref:`DNS seed list connection string <connections-dns-seedlist>`
format (``mongodb+srv://``) with a driver or Compass, you may
receive in the following error:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: querySrv ECONNREFUSED _mongodb._tcp.<SRV Record>

To begin troubleshooting you will need both the DNS SRV name and the nodes' 
individual hostnames and port numbers from the seed list connection string for 
the cluster.

To find the DNS SRV name:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Follow the **Steps 1-6** in `Connect Your Application <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/driver-connection/#connect-your-application>`_.
#. In **Step 7** select the latest version of the driver you chose.
#. The DNS SRV name begins after the ``@`` symbol following the password and ends
   with ``.mongodb.net``.
   - For example, ``cluster0.dfget.mongodb.net``.

To find the nodes' hostnames and port numbers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Follow the **Steps 1-6** in `Connect Your Application <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/driver-connection/#connect-your-application>`_.
#. In **Step 7** select the latest version of the driver you chose.

#. In **Step 7** select the oldest driver version under **Non-Stable API**

   - Each of the hostnames is in a comma-separated list beginning after the ``@`` 
     symbol following the password and ending with ``.mongodb.net``.

#. Note the port numbers after each of the hostnames.

   - The cluster's connection string may have a variety of hostnames and ports, 
     depending on its topology and the connection method. 
   - For more information on how Private Endpoints work, see `Configure Private Endpoints <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-configure-private-endpoints/>`_.

Test Basic Network Connectivity:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following commands in a terminal or command prompt on the application 
server experiencing the issue:

* DNS SRV resolution test:
   **Linux/MacOS:** 

   .. code-block:: sh

      dig SRV _mongodb._tcp.<DNS SRV name>

   **Windows:** 

   .. code-block:: sh

      nslookup -debug -q=SRV  _mongodb._tcp.<DNS SRV name>

   Under the **ANSWER SECTION** in the response, you should see one result for each
   of the nodes in the cluster.
   - For example: 

   .. code-block:: sh

      ;; ANSWER SECTION:
      _mongodb._tcp.gcluster0.dfget.mongodb.net. 60 IN SRV 0 0 27017 cluster0-shard-00-00.dfget.mongodb.net.
      _mongodb._tcp.gcluster0.dfget.mongodb.net. 60 IN SRV 0 0 27017 cluster0-shard-00-01.dfget.mongodb.net.
      _mongodb._tcp.gcluster0.dfget.mongodb.net. 60 IN SRV 0 0 27017 cluster0-shard-00-02.dfget.mongodb.net.

* DNS node hostname resolution tests:

  For each hostname in the cluster run this command:

  **Linux/MacOS:**

  .. code-block:: sh

     dig <Node Hostname>

  **Windows:** 

  .. code-block:: sh

     nslookup -debug -q=A <Node Hostname>

  Under the **ANSWER SECTION** in the response, you should see the IP address that
  the DNS hostname resolved to.

  - For example: 

  .. code-block:: sh

     ;; ANSWER SECTION: cluster0-shard-00-00.ag9in.mongodb.net. 60 IN A 10.10.10.10

* Ping test:
   .. note::
      ICMP requests may be blocked by the cloud provider across Private Endpoint 
      connections.

   For each hostname in the cluster run this command:

   **Linux/Mac OS:** 

   .. code-block:: sh

      ping -c 10 <Node Hostname>

   **Windows:** 

   .. code-block:: sh

      ping /n 10 <Node Hostname>

* End-to-End network connection test:
   **Linux/Mac/OS:**

   .. code-block:: sh

      nc -zv <Node Hostname> <Node Port Number>

   **Windows:** 

   .. code-block:: sh

      Test-NetConnection -Port <Node Port Number> -InformationLevel "Detailed" -ComputerName "<Node Hostname>"
