===================================================
Configure a Highly Available MMS Application Server
===================================================

Overview
--------

The On-Prem MMS app server is horizontally scalable. To take advantage of this
capability, configure each of the MMS server's ``conf-mms.properties`` file to
point their ``mms.centralUrl`` property to a load balancer. Then configure the
load balancer to balance between the pool of MMS app servers.

Considerations
--------------

The MMS app servers are stateless between requests. Any app server can handle
requests as long as they read from the same :doc:`backing MongoDB replica
set </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`. Where
multiple MMS app servers are present for high availability, deploy a
replica set as the backing MongoDB (rather than a stand-alone).
