If you installed MongoDBSearch resource successfully, you can create
|text-search| and |vector-search| indexes as the ``mdb-user`` and run
|text-search| and |vector-search| queries using the indexes. This page
describes how to load sample data, create |text-search| and
|vector-search| indexes for the data, and run |text-search| and
|vector-search| queries against the data. 

Prerequisites 
-------------

To use |text-search| and |vector-search|, you must have the following:

- Successful deployment of ``MongoDB`` and MongoDBSearch.

  To learn more, see: 

  - :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-install-enterprise`
  - :ref:`k8s-fts-vs-install-external-enterprise`

- User with permissions to create |text-search| and |vector-search| and
  run |text-search| and |vector-search| queries.

  To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-search-create-role-user`.

- |k8s| command-line tool, ``kubectl``, configured to communicate with
  your cluster.
- Bash v5.1 or higher for running the commands in this tutorial. 

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Set the environment variables. 

      a. To set the environment variables for use in the subsequent steps
         in this procedure, copy the following, set the values for the
         environment variables, and then load the environment variables: 

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/env_variables.sh 
            :language: yaml 
            :copyable: true 
            :linenos: 

      #. To connect using the TLS-enabled connection string, as shown
         (on line 27) in the ``env_variables.sh`` file, download the
         public CA certificate for the MongoDBSearch service so that the 
         ``mongosh`` client can reference it.   

   .. step:: Deploy a MongoDB tools pod.

      Deploy a pod named ``mongodb-tools-pod`` to run MongoDB client
      tools like ``mongosh`` and ``mongorestore`` from within the |k8s|
      cluster. Running a pod inside the cluster simplifies connectivity
      to mongodb without neeeding to expose the database externally. 

      The following command deploys a pod named ``mongodb-tools-pod``
      that runs a MongoDB Community Server image. The pod is kept
      running with a ``sleep infinity`` command to allow you to use
      ``kubectl exec`` to run MongoDB client tools. 

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0410_run_mongodb_tools_pod.sh
         :language: shell 
         :copyable: true 
         :linenos: 

   .. step:: Import the sample data. 

      Import the ``sample_mflix`` database, which contains the following
      collections: 

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Collection Name
           - Description

         * - ``comments``
           - Contains comments associated with specific movies.

         * - ``embedded_movies``
           - Contains details on movies in the ``Western``, 
             ``Action``, and ``Fantasy`` genres from the ``movies``
             collection with the following additional fields: 

             - ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` - Contains 2048d embeddings
               created from the ``plot`` field using |voyage|'s
               ``voyage-3-large`` embedding model and converted to
               ``binData`` for efficient storage and retrieval.  

             - ``plot_embedding`` - Contains 1536d embeddings created from the
               ``plot`` field using OpenAI's ``text-embedding-ada-002``
               embedding model and converted to ``binData`` for efficient
               storage and retrieval. 

         * - ``movies``
           - Contains movie information, including release year, director,
             and reviews.

         * - ``sessions``
           - Metadata field. Contains users'
             `JSON Web Tokens <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token>`__.

         * - ``theaters``
           - Contains locations of movie theaters.

         * - ``users``
           - Contains user information.

      The following command downloads the sample dataset and uses
      ``mongorestore`` to load the data into the ``sample_mflix``
      database in your MongoDB deployment, connecting as the
      ``mdb-user``.  

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0420_import_movies_mflix_database.sh
         :language: shell 
         :copyable: true 
         :linenos: 

   .. step:: Create an index. 

      You can create a |text-search| or a |vector-search| index. You
      must create a |text-search| index to run :pipeline:`$search` and
      :pipeline:`$searchMeta` queries and |vector-search| index to run
      :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. 
      
      - |text-search| provides flexible index definitions that support
        dynamic and static field mappings, various analyzers (standard,
        language-specific, custom), and features like synonyms and
        faceted search. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-define-index`.
      - |vector-search| provides simple index definition that supports
        querying vector embeddings in your data based on semantic
        similarity by using :abbr:`ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)`
        and :abbr:`ENN (Exact Nearest Neighbor)` search algorithm. To
        learn more, see :ref:`Define Vector Search Index
        <avs-types-vector-search>`. 

      a. Copy, paste, and run the following command in your terminal to
         create a |text-search| or a |vector-search| index. 
        
         The command uses ``kubectl exec`` to run ``mongosh`` in the
         ``mongodb-tools-pod``. It connects to the ``sample_mflix``
         ``db.<collection>.createSearchIndex()`` method to create an index. 
    
         .. tabs:: 

            .. tab:: MongoDB Search Index 
               :tabid: fts 

               The following command creates a |text-search| index named
               ``default`` with dynamic mappings on the ``movies``
               collection. Dynamic mapping automatically indexes all
               dynamically indexable field types.

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0430_create_search_index.sh
                  :language: shell 
                  :copyable: true 
                  :linenos:

            .. tab:: MongoDB Vector Search Index 
               :tabid: vs
     
               The following command creates a |vector-search| index named
               ``vector_index`` on the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large``
               field with ``2048`` number of dimensions in the
               ``embedded_movies`` collection for running :abbr:`ANN
               (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)` queries. 

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0435_create_vector_search_index.sh
                  :language: shell 
                  :copyable: true 
                  :linenos:

      #. Wait for index creation to complete. 

         Index creation is an asynchronous process. Run the following
         script to wait for 60 seconds for the index creation to
         complete. 
         
         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0440_wait_for_search_index_ready.sh
            :language: shell 
            :copyable: true 
            :linenos:

         Alternatively, run the following command to retrieve the list of
         indexes for the collection.

         .. tabs:: 

            .. tab:: MongoDB Search Index 
               :tabid: fts 

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0444_list_search_indexes.sh
                  :language: shell 
                  :copyable: true 
                  :linenos:

            .. tab:: MongoDB Vector Search Index 
               :tabid: vs

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0445_list_vector_search_indexes.sh
                  :language: shell 
                  :copyable: true 
                  :linenos:

   .. step:: Query the data using the index. 

      After the index creation is successful, you can run |text-search|
      or |vector-search| queries using the index. You can also combine
      |text-search| with |vector-search|. To learn more about running
      |text-search| queries, see :ref:`fts-define-query`. To learn more
      about |vector-search| queries, see :ref:`return-vector-search-results`. 

      The following script defines the aggregation pipeline query
      criteria and uses the ``kubectl exec`` command to load ``mongosh``
      to execute the query. 

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: MongoDB Search Query
            :tabid: fts 

            The following query searches the ``plot`` field for movie
            plots that contain the term ``baseball``. It excludes movies
            in the ``comedy`` and ``romance`` genres. 

            .. io-code-block:: 
               :copyable: true 
              
               .. input:: /includes/code-examples/search/03-search-query-usage/code_snippets/03_0450_execute_search_query.sh
                  :language: shell 
                  :linenos:

               .. output:: /includes/code-examples/outputs/test_kind_search_community_snippets/03_0450_execute_search_query.out
                  :language: shell
                  :linenos:

         .. tab:: MongoDB Vector Search Query
            :tabid: vs 

            The following query searches the
            ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field using 2048 dimension 
            vector embeddings for the string ``time travel``, generated
            using Voyage AI's ``voyage-3-large`` model. 

            .. io-code-block::
