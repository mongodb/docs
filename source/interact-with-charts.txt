Click to Emphasize Series
-------------------------

Chart viewers can interact with a chart to highlight one or more series 
in a multi-series chart. This behavior applies to any chart type that 
displays a discrete color legend, except for geospatial charts. The 
following chart types support emphasizing specific series: 

- :ref:`Grouped and Stacked Bar/Column charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line/Area charts <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Scatter charts <scatter-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Donut charts <donut-chart-ref>`


Emphasize a Single Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you click a label in the chart legend at the top right, |charts-short| 
emphasizes the selected data series by reducing the opacity of all the 
other data series.

Emphasize Multiple Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To emphasize multiple data series at once, **shift-click** as many 
labels in the legend as you would like. Charts adjusts the opacity of
the selected data series from de-emphasized to emphasized.

Emphasize all Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore the opacity of all data series to the default emphasized 
state, click the chart background.

Zoom and Pan a Scatter Chart
----------------------------

Chart viewers can zoom and pan a non-geospatial :ref:`scatter chart <scatter-chart-ref>`. 

Zoom
~~~~

To zoom in or out of the chart, scroll up or down. |charts-short| automatically 
adjusts the axis bounds to change the viewport, while keeping the 
plotted points the same size.


The resulting view after zooming and panning is only visible to you and 
does not persist page reloads. To revert back to the original axis 
bounds, reload the chart page. 


Pan
~~~

To pan the chart, click and drag over the chart surface. 

View the Percentage of the Whole
--------------------------------

Chart viewers can hover on each data point to view the value as a 
percentage of the whole. The part to whole relationship appears in the 
tooltip for the data point. This behavior applies to any chart type 
that displays a part of the whole relationship, specifically:

- :ref:`100% Stacked Bar Charts <one-hundred-stacked-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Column Charts <stacked-ref-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Area Charts <one-hundred-stacked-area>`
- :ref:`Donut Charts <donut-chart-ref>`

For stacked charts, the whole value is the total value of the 
current category. For donut charts, the whole value is the total
value of the entire chart.
