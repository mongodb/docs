  Use the :doc:`automationConfig </reference/api/automation-config>`
  resource to retrieve the configuration. Issue the following command,
  replacing ``<user@example.net>`` with your user credentials,
  ``<public_api_key>`` with the
  previously retrieved :term:`Public API key`, ``<app-example.net>`` with the URL of
  |mms|, and ``<group_id>`` with the previously retrieved group ID:

    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<public_api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationConfig" --digest -i
post: |
  Confirm that the ``version`` field of the retrieved :ref:`automation
  configuration <automation-configuration-sample-entity>` matches the
  ``version`` field in the :ref:`mms-cluster-config-backup.json
  <other-representations-automation-configuration>` file,
  which is found on any server running the Automation Agent.

  In the ``mongoDbVersions`` array, add the versions of MongoDB to have
  available to the deployment. Add only those versions you will use. For
  this tutorial, the
  following array includes just one version, ``3.2.12``, but you can specify multiple
  versions. Using ``3.2.12`` allows this deployment to later upgrade to
  ``3.4``, as described in
  :doc:`/tutorial/update-mongodb-version-of-deployment-via-api`.

  In the ``monitoringVersions.hostname`` field, enter the hostname of the
  server where |mms| should install the Monitoring Agent. Use the fully
  qualified domain name that running ``hostname -f`` on the
  server returns, as in the following:
action:

  This configuration example also includes the ``logPath`` field, which
  specifies the log location, and ``logRotate``, which specifies the log
  thresholds.

title: Add the servers to the automation configuration.
stepnum: 5
ref: add-servers
pre: |
  This sharded cluster has 10 MongoDB instances, as
  described in the :ref:`create-cluster-with-api-overview`, each running
  on its own server. Thus, the automation configuration's ``processes`` array will have 10
  documents, one for each MongoDB instance.

  The following example adds the first document to the ``processes``
  array. Replace ``<process_name_1>`` with any name you choose, and
  replace ``<server1.example.net>`` with the FQDN of the server. You
  will need to add 9 documents: one for each MongoDB instance in your
  sharded cluster.

  Specify the ``args2_6`` syntax for the ``processes.<args>``
  field.
  See :doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options` for more
  information.

  Use the ``groups/<group_id>/automationConfig`` endpoint to

  Replace ``<configuration_document>`` with the configuration document you
  created in the previous steps. Replace the credentials, Public API key,
  URL, and group ID as in previous steps.
action:

title: Confirm successful update of the automation configuration.
stepnum: 8
ref: confirm-update-of-configuration-doc
pre: |
  Retrieve the automation configuration
  and confirm it contains the changes.

  To retrieve the automation configuration, issue a command similar to the
  following. Replace the credentials, URL, and group ID as in previous steps.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<public_api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationConfig" --digest -i
---
title: Verify that the configuration update is deployed.
stepnum: 9
ref: check-deployment-status
pre: |
  Use the :doc:`automationStatus </reference/api/automation-status>`
  resource to verify the configuration update is fully deployed. Issue
  the following command, replacing the credentials, Public API key, URL,
  and group ID with your credentials, as in previous steps.

  .. code-block:: sh

    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<public_api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationStatus" --digest -i

  The ``curl`` command returns a JSON object containing the ``processes``
  array and the ``goalVersion`` key and value. The ``processes`` array
  contains a document for each server that hosts a MongoDB instance. 
  The new configuration is successfully deployed when all ``lastGoalVersionAchieved``
  fields in the ``processes`` array equal the value specified for ``goalVersion``. 

  In the example response, ``processes[2].lastGoalVersionAchieved``
  is behind ``goalVersion``. This indicates that the MongoDB instance at 
  ``server3.example.net`` is running one version behind the ``goalVersion``. 
  Wait several seconds and issue the ``curl`` command again. 

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "goalVersion": 2,
      "processes": [{
        "hostname": "server1.example.net",
        "lastGoalVersionAchieved": 2,
        "name": "ReplSet_0",
        "plan": []
      }, {
        "hostname": "server2.example.net",
        "lastGoalVersionAchieved": 2,
        "name": "ReplSet_1",
        "plan": []
      }, {
         "hostname": "server3.example.net",
         "lastGoalVersionAchieved": 1,
         "name": "ReplSet_2",
         "plan":[...]
      }]
    }
