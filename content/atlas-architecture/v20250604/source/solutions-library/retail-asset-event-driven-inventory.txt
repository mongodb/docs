Solution Overview
-----------------

Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the competitive business landscape of retail and manufacturing,
having the right inventory of goods in the right place at the right time
is crucial. Insufficient inventory can lead to operational disruptions
and missed opportunities, while excess inventory can increase costs and
risks associated with storage. Companies of all sizes struggle with
inventory management. Solutions such as a single view of inventory,
real-time analytics, and event-driven architectures can help businesses
overcome these challenges and elevate their inventory management to the
next level. This demo will guide you through the process of building an
inventory management system with all the capabilities mentioned above,
tailored for diverse industries such as retail and manufacturing.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Effective inventory management is critical to ensure operational success
and customer service excellence. With the increasing complexity of
supply chains and rising customer expectations, businesses need robust
systems to track inventory levels, automate processes, and analyze
trends in real time. As industries continue to evolve, the importance of
integrated and event-driven inventory solutions becomes more pronounced
as they allow businesses to respond swiftly to market demands, minimize
costs, and maintain competitiveness.

Businesses must adopt strategies that allow for dynamic adjustments to
inventory levels, optimizing stock management, and reducing
inefficiencies. Automation and real-time data integration are key
components of these strategies. They provide the capabilities needed to
enhance operational agility, streamline supply chain processes, and
ensure timely delivery of products.

Inventory Management in the Retail Industry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In today’s fast-paced retail landscape, ensuring your inventory is in
the right place at the right time is essential. However, the retail
industry faces significant challenges in achieving this goal. In 2022,
unsold stock in the U.S. surged by a staggering `$78 billion, reaching
approximately $740 billion — a shocking 12 percent increase
<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/thinking-beyond-markdowns-to-tackle-retails-inventory-glut>`__.

Retailers today need a unified view of their inventory to meet customer
expectations for immediate availability and seamless purchasing
experiences. The disparity between online and in-store stock can lead to
missed sales opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.

Effective stock management enables retailers to leverage distributed
supply chains, moving inventory fluidly between channels to meet demand
where it arises. This reduces the risk of dead stock in physical stores
and stockouts in online channels, enhancing overall inventory
efficiency. Real-time analytics empower retailers to make data-driven
decisions, adapting quickly to changing market conditions and consumer
behavior. Furthermore, automated processes reduce manual errors and free
up staff to focus on value-added activities, such as enhancing service
quality. Event-driven architectures facilitate these improvements,
allowing for seamless inventory data integration and synchronization
across various platforms and devices.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

With MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inventory management solution leverages a `Next.js
<https://nextjs.org/>`__ application seamlessly integrated with `MongoDB
Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas>`__, providing a flexible and
scalable backend. At the core of this architecture is a `MongoDB Atlas
Database <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database>`__
that houses four key collections: products, transactions, users, and
locations. These collections are central to managing inventory,
processing transactions, and tracking user and location data.

MongoDB ensures data consistency and integrity through `ACID-compliant
operations
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/capabilities/transactions>`__. For
instance, when a stock level changes due to a
transaction, updates are made to both the products and transactions
collections in a way that guarantees reliability and consistency across
the system.

Data access between the Next.js application and MongoDB is facilitated
by the `MongoDB Node.js driver
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/>`__, enabling
efficient retrieval and manipulation of information. To enhance the
application’s search capabilities, `Atlas Search
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-search>`__ is utilized,
offering advanced full-text search features. This allows users to
perform complex queries, such as searching by product category or
applying filters through `facets
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/tutorial/facet-tutorial/>`__,
improving the overall user experience with quick, intuitive searches.

The system's responsiveness is further enriched by `MongoDB Atlas
Triggers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/>`__ and
`Change Streams <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/>`__.
Triggers automate backend logic by executing functions in response to
database changes. For example, when a product’s stock falls below a
certain threshold, a Trigger can automatically reorder inventory.
Meanwhile, Change Streams act as real-time listeners, detecting data
changes and pushing updates to the application instantly. This ensures
that critical alerts, such as low stock notifications, are promptly
delivered to inventory managers.

For real-time analytics, `Atlas Charts
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-charts>`__ provides a
powerful tool to visualize data directly from MongoDB without the need
for ETL pipelines. This allows decision-makers to track key metrics,
like inventory levels or sales trends, in real time. With `workload
isolation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/workload-isolation/>`__
enabled, analytics queries run on a dedicated node, ensuring that
operational performance remains unaffected. 

This cohesive architecture not only supports real-time data interactions
but also streamlines processes by automating key tasks. It allows the
Next.js application to provide a responsive and dynamic user experience,
underpinned by MongoDB’s robust data management features. Through this
integration, the solution effectively balances performance, automation,
and scalability, making it well-suited for modern inventory management
challenges.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

The primary collections — products, transactions, users and locations —
form the foundation of our inventory management system. These
collections represent your stock, incoming and outgoing movements that
affect stock levels, your app users, and the different locations that
the inventory system is serving.

What sets the document data model apart from traditional tabular models
is its remarkable flexibility, making it the perfect choice for
achieving a single view of inventory. With a tabular approach, achieving
a comprehensive overview of your inventory would typically involve
complex joins across multiple tables. However, with MongoDB's document
model, this complexity is eliminated. 

For instance, in the transactions collection we take advantage of the
`Extended Reference pattern
<https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern>`__
when referencing an item. We not only include the *product.id*, but also
the *product.name* to be displayed in the UI without the need of a join or
an extra query to the products collection.

If we now consider the products collection, we see how it encompasses
what would have otherwise demanded over 10 tables in a relational
system. For example, the product variants are contained as an embedded
array in the same document, and other attributes such as product stock
or locations would traditionally require additional tables. This
transformational power stems from the document model's inherent
flexibility. It not only empowers a more intuitive design but also
ensures that related data is stored together, optimizing access.
