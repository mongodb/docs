The `TypedDict <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict>`__ class
is in the ``typing`` module, which
is available only in Python 3.8 and later. To use the ``TypedDict`` class in
earlier versions of Python, install the
`typing_extensions <https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/>`__ package.
