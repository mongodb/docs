This procedure restores a sharded cluster from an existing backup
snapshot, such as :ref:`Logical Volume Manager (LVM) snapshots <backup-sharded-lvm>`. The
source and target sharded cluster must have the same number of shards.
For information on creating LVM snapshots for all components of a
sharded cluster, see :ref:`backup-sharded-lvm`.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-aes256-backups.rst

A. (Optional) Review Replica Set Configurations
-----------------------------------------------

This procedure initiates a new replica set for the 
Config Server Replica Set (CSRS) and each shard replica set using
the default configuration. To use a different replica set
configuration for your restored CSRS and shards, you must
reconfigure the replica set(s).

If your source cluster is running correctly and is accessible, connect a 
:binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the primary replica set member
in each replica set. Next, run :method:`rs.conf()` to view the
replica configuration document.

If you cannot access one or more components of the source sharded 
cluster, please reference any existing internal documentation to 
reconstruct the configuration requirements for each shard replica set 
and the config server replica set.

B. Prepare the Target Host for Restoration
------------------------------------------

Storage Space Requirements
  Ensure the target host hardware has sufficient open storage space
  for the restored data. If the target host contains existing sharded
  cluster data that you want to keep, ensure that you have enough 
  storage space for both the existing data and the restored data.

LVM Requirements
  For LVM snapshots, you must have at least one LVM managed
  volume group and a logical volume with enough free space for the
  extracted snapshot data.

MongoDB Version Requirements
  Ensure the target host and source host have the same MongoDB Server
  version. To check the version of MongoDB available on a host machine,
  run ``mongod --version`` from the terminal or shell.

  For complete documentation on installation, see
  :doc:`/installation`.

Shut Down Running MongoDB Processes
  If restoring to an existing cluster, shut down the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` 
  process on the target host.

  For hosts running :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, connect a 
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the ``mongos`` and
  run :method:`db.shutdownServer()` from the ``admin`` database:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     use admin
     db.shutdownServer()

  For hosts running a :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`, connect a 
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the ``mongod`` and
  run :method:`db.hello()`:

  * If :data:`~hello.isWritablePrimary` is false, the ``mongod`` is a
    :term:`secondary` member of a replica set. You
    can shut it down by running :method:`db.shutdownServer()` from
    the ``admin`` database.

  * If :data:`~hello.isWritablePrimary` is true, the ``mongod`` is the
    :term:`primary` member of a replica set. Shut down
    the secondary members of the replica set *first*. Use
    :method:`rs.status()` to identify the other members of
    the replica set.

    The primary automatically steps down after it detects a
    majority of members are offline. After it steps down
    (:method:`db.hello` returns
    :data:`isWritablePrimary: false <hello.isWritablePrimary>`), you can
    safely shut down the ``mongod``.

Prepare Data Directory
  Create a directory on the target host for the restored database
  files. Ensure that the user that runs the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read, write, and execute permissions
  for all files and subfolders in that directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo mkdir /path/to/mongodb
     sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb
     sudo chmod -R 770 /path/to/mongodb

  Substitute ``/path/to/mongodb`` with the path to the data directory
  you created. On :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS,
  Amazon Linux, and SUSE, the default username is ``mongod``.

Prepare Log Directory
  Create a directory on the target host for the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` log files. Ensure that the user that 
  runs the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read, write, and execute 
  permissions for all files and subfolders in that directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo mkdir /path/to/mongodb/logs
     sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb/logs
     sudo chmod -R 770 /path/to/mongodb/logs

  Substitute ``/path/to/mongodb/logs`` with the path to the log 
  directory you created. On :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` /
  CentOS, Amazon Linux, and SUSE, the default username is ``mongod``.

Create Configuration File
  This procedure assumes starting a :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`
  with a :ref:`configuration file <configuration-file>`. 

  Create the configuration file in your preferred location. Ensure that
  the user that runs the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read and
  write permissions on the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo touch /path/to/mongod.conf
     sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb/mongod.conf
     sudo chmod 644 /path/to/mongodb/mongod.conf

  On :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS, Amazon Linux,
  and SUSE, the default username is ``mongod``.

  Open the configuration file in your preferred text editor and
  modify at it as required by your deployment. Alternatively,
  if you have access to the original configuration file for the
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`, copy it to your preferred location
  on the target host.

  .. important::

     Validate that your configuration file includes the following
     settings:

     - :setting:`storage.dbPath` must be set to the path to your
       preferred data directory.

     - :setting:`systemLog.path` must be set to the path to your
       preferred log directory

     - :setting:`net.bindIp` must include the IP address of the
       host machine.

     - :setting:`replication.replSetName` has the same value across
       each member in any given replica set.

     - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` has the same value across each
       member in any given replica set. 

     - You must also specify the same :ref:`startup options
       <mongod-options>` for your new deployment that were specified in
       the snapshot.

C. Restore Config Server Replica Set
------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-sharded-config-primary-from-backup.rst

D. Restore Each Shard Replica Set
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-sharded-shard-primary-from-backup.rst

E. Restart Each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
---------------------------------------------

Restart each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` in the cluster. 

.. code-block:: bash

   mongos --config /path/to/config/mongos.conf

Include all other command line options as required by your deployment.

If the CSRS replica set name or any member hostname changed, update the 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` configuration file setting 
:setting:`sharding.configDB` with updated configuration server 
connection string:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sharding:
     configDB: "myNewCSRSName/config1.example.net:27019,config2.example.net:27019,config3.example.net:27019"


F. Validate Cluster Accessibility
---------------------------------

Connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to one of the 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes for the cluster. Use
:method:`sh.status()` to check the overall cluster status. If 
:method:`sh.status()` indicates that the balancer is not running, use 
:method:`sh.startBalancer()` to restart the balancer. [#autosplit]_


To confirm that all shards are accessible and communicating, insert
test data into a temporary sharded collection. Confirm that data is
being split and migrated between each shard in your cluster. You can
connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to each shard primary and
use :method:`db.collection.find()` to validate that the data was
sharded as expected.
