     **Skip this step** if |cloudgov-short| indicates in the
     :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have at least
     one database user configured in your project. To manage existing
     database users, see :ref:`database-access`.

  To access the cluster, you need a MongoDB user with access to the
  desired database or databases on the cluster in your project. If your
  project has no MongoDB users, |cloudgov-short| prompts you to 
  create a new user with the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` 
  role.

  a. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username`.
  b. Enter a :guilabel:`Password` for this new user or click
     :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.
  c. Click :guilabel:`Create Database User` to save the user.

  Use this user to connect to your cluster in the following step.

  Once you have added an IP address to your IP access list and added a
  database user, click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.

  Private endpoint-aware connection strings are available in one 
  of the following formats:

  - DNS seedlist connection

    .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false

       mongodb+srv://cluster0-pl-0-auylw.mongodb.net

  - Standard connection string

    .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false

       mongodb://pl-0-us-east-1-auylw.mongodb.net:1024,pl-0-us-east-1-auylw.mongodb.net:1025,pl-0-us-east-1-auylw.mongodb.net:1026/?ssl=true&authSource=admin&replicaSet=Cluster0-shard-0-shard-0

  MongoDB recommends that your clients use the DNS seedlist connection
  string format. If your driver doesn't support this format, select an
  older version of your driver or version :guilabel:`3.4 or earlier` of
  the |mongo| shell from the :guilabel:`Connect` tab to use the
  standard connection string format.
