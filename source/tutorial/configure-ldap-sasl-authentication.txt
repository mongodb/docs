================================
Authenticate Using SASL and LDAP
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB Enterprise provides support for proxy authentication of users.
This allows administrators to configure a MongoDB cluster to
authenticate users by proxying authentication requests to a specified
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

MongoDB does **not** support LDAP authentication in mixed sharded
cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4 and version 2.6
shards. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for upgrade instructions.

Considerations
--------------

Because the transmission of the username and password from the client
to the MongoDB server, from the MongoDB server to ``saslauthd``, and
from ``saslauthd`` to the LDAP server uses ``SASL PLAIN`` mechanism,
i.e. in **plain text**, you should, in general, use only on a trusted
channel (VPN, SSL, trusted wired network).

Configure ``saslauthd`` 
-----------------------

LDAP support for user authentication requires proper configuration of
the ``saslauthd`` daemon process as well as the MongoDB server.
