.. dbcommand:: replSetReconfig

   The :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` administrative command modifies the
   configuration of an existing replica set. You can use this command to
   add and remove members, and to alter the options set on existing
   members. You must run this command on the ``admin``
   database of the :term:`primary` replica set member.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand({ 
        replSetReconfig: <new_config_document>, 
        force: <boolean>,
        maxTimeMS: <int>
      })

   The command takes the following optional field:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - .. _replSetReconfig-cmd-force:
          
          :ref:`force <replSetReconfig-cmd-force>`

        - Defaults to ``false``. Specify ``true`` to force the
          available replica set members to accept the new configuration.

          Force reconfiguration can result in unexpected or
          undesired behavior, including :ref:`rollback
          <replica-set-rollbacks>` of :writeconcern:`"majority"`
          committed writes.

      * - .. _replSetReconfig-cmd-maxTimeMS:

          :ref:`maxTimeMS <replSetReconfig-cmd-maxTimeMS>`

        - Optional. Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds
          for processing the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig`. By default,
          :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` waits indefinitely for the
          replica configuration to propagate to a majority of replica
          set members. Setting ``maxTimeMS`` may result 
          in the operation failing *before* it can apply the new 
          configuration. See :ref:`replSetReconfig-cmd-majority-install` 
          for more information.

          .. versionadded:: 4.4

   You may also run :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` with the shell's
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` method.

Behavior
--------

Global Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-set-global-write-concern-before-reconfig.rst

``term`` Replica Configuration Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.4 adds the :rsconf:`term` field to the replica set
configuration document. The :rsconf:`term` field is set by the
:term:`primary` replica set member. The primary ignores the
:rsconf:`term` field if set explicitly in the
:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` operation.

.. |reconfig| replace:: :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig`
.. |reconfig-force| replace:: :ref:`force <replSetReconfig-cmd-force>`
.. |reconfig-maxTimeMS| replace:: :ref:`maxTimeMS <replSetReconfig-cmd-maxTimeMS>`

.. _replSetReconfig-cmd-single-node:

Reconfiguration Can Add or Remove No More than One Voting Member at a Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/replSetReconfig-single-node.rst

.. _replSetReconfig-cmd-majority-install:

Reconfiguration Waits Until a Majority of Members Install the Replica Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/replSetReconfig-majority.rst

Automatic Reconfiguration for New Voting Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/initial-sync-semantics.rst

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the command on deployments that enforce :doc:`access
control</core/authorization>`, the user must have
:authaction:`replSetConfigure` privilege action on the cluster
resource. The :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in role, available in
the ``admin`` database, provides the required privileges for this
command.

Locking Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` obtains a special mutually
exclusive lock to prevent more than one
:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` operation from occurring at the same
time.

Mixed Version Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: 
   .. include:: /includes/warning-mixed-version-rs-config.rst

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A majority of the set's members must be operational for the changes to 
propagate properly.

:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` can trigger the current 
primary to step down in some situations. Primary step-down triggers 
an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>` to select a new 
:term:`primary`:

- Starting in MongoDB 4.4, when the new primary steps up, it 
  increments the :rsconf:`term` field to distinguish configuration 
  changes made on the new primary from changes made on the previous 
  primary.

- Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when the primary steps down, it no longer
  closes all client connections; however, writes that were in progress
  are killed. For details, see :ref:`replSetStepDown-behavior`.

- In MongoDB 4.0 and earlier, when the primary steps down, it closes
  all client connections.

.. include:: /includes/fact-election-latency.rst

During the election process, the cluster cannot
accept write operations until it elects the new primary.

.. include:: /includes/fact-retryable-writes-failover-election.rst

To further reduce potential impact to a production cluster,
reconfigure only during scheduled maintenance periods.

``{ force: true }``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Forcing the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command can lead to a
   :term:`rollback` situation. Use with caution.

Drop Outgoing Connections After Removing a Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` to remove a replica set member does
not automatically drop open outgoing connections from other replica
set members to the removed member.

By default, replica set members wait for 5 minutes before dropping
connections to the removed member. In sharded replica sets, you can
modify this timeout using the
:parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolHostTimeoutMS` server parameter.

.. versionadded:: 4.2

   To immediately drop all outgoing connections from the replica set to
   the removed member, run the :dbcommand:`dropConnections`
   administrative command on each remaining member on the replica set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
     {
       "dropConnections" : 1,
       "hostAndPort" : [
         "<hostname>:<port>"
       ] 
     } 
   )

Replace ``<hostname>`` and ``<port>`` with those of the removed 
member.

Member Priority and Votes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

- .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-nonzero-priority-vote-restriction.rst
   
- .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-non-voting-priority-restriction.rst
