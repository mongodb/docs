Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use {+odm+} in a new **{+ror+} 8 (Rails)**
web application, connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB
Atlas, and perform read and write operations on the data in your
cluster.

To learn how to integrate {+odm+} into an existing application, see the
:ref:`mongoid-add-to-existing` guide.

.. tip::

   If you prefer to connect to MongoDB by using the {+ruby-driver+} without
   {+odm+}, see the {+ruby-driver+} :ruby:`Quick Start guide
   </tutorials/quick-start/>`.

{+odm+} is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) framework for MongoDB in
{+language+}. By using {+odm+}, you can easily interact with your data and
create flexible data models.

{+ror+} is a web application framework for
{+language+}. Rails applications use a model-view-controller (MVC)
architecture that allows you to easily control how your data is
modeled and displayed. {+odm+} replaces the default Active Record
adapter for data modeling in Rails.

To learn more about {+ror+}, see the `Getting Started
with Rails <{+active-record-docs+}/getting_started.html>`__
guide in the Rails documentation.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to create a sample {+odm+} web application
that connects to a MongoDB deployment.
