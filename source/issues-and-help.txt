We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Java community that includes users
with varying levels of experience using the Java driver. We find the quickest 
way to get support for general questions is through the `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`_.

Refer to our `support channels <http://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`_
documentation for more information.

Bugs / Feature Requests
-----------------------

If you think you've found a bug or want to see a new feature in the Java
driver, please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

* `Create an account and login <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_.
* Navigate to `the JAVA project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA>`_.
* Click **Create Issue**. Please provide as much information as possible
  about the issue and the steps to reproduce it.

Bug reports in JIRA for the Java driver and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are **public**.

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the instructions found in the
`Create a Vulnerability Report page <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`_.

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the driver. We will guide
user contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Please
ensure that any pull requests include documentation, tests, and pass the
