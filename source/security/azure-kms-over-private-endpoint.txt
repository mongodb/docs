You can use a customer-managed key (CMK) from Azure Key Vault (AKV)
to further encrypt your data at rest in |service|. You can also
configure all traffic to your |akv| to use {+az-pl+}.

This page describes how to use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to automatically
set up {+az-pl+} in your |akv| to ensure that all traffic between
|service| and |akv| take place over |azure|\'s private network
interfaces. 

Considerations 
--------------

Before you enable Encryption at Rest using |akv| over private endpoints,
review the following use cases, benefits, limitations, and prerequisites.

Use Case 
~~~~~~~~

Suppose your |service| deployment is on a single cloud service provider.
You now have a requirement that all access to your |akv| occur over your
cloud provider's private networking infrastructure. This page walks you
through the steps to enable private endpoint connections for your
|service| project. 

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

You can use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to allow |service| to configure
Encryption At Rest with |akv| using Private Endpoints. This allows all
traffic to |akv| to pass through a set of private endpoints and avoid
exposing |akv| to the public internet or public IP addresses. It
eliminates the need to maintain allowed IP addresses while enhancing
data security by keeping all |akv| traffic within |azure|'s private
network.  

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| doesn't support Encryption at Rest using |cmk| over
Private Endpoints for multi-cloud deployments. If you enable encryption
at rest using |cmk| over {+az-pl+} in an existing project with
multi-cloud {+clusters+}, |service| disables the multi-cloud
{+clusters+} in your project.

|service| doesn't support Encryption at Rest using |cmk| over
Private Endpoints for projects in ``INACTIVE`` state.

|service| doesn't support |akv| access over private networking for
|aws| or |gcp| {+clusters+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |akv| for a MongoDB project, you
must:

.. include:: /includes/fact-azure-kms-prereqs.rst

.. note:: 

   You must register **Microsoft.Network** under your |azure|
   subscription resource providers. To learn more, see :azure:`Azure
   documentation </azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types>`. 

Procedures 
----------

.. _azure-kms-configure-project-pvt-endpoint:

Enable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must enable |cmk| for a project before you can enable it on a
{+cluster+} in that project. You can enable |cmk| for a project from the
{+atlas-ui+} and {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-api.rst  

.. _azure-kms-enable-pvt-endpoint:

Enable and Set up Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable and set up private endpoint only by using the 
{+atlas-admin-api+}. To enable private networking and set up a private
endpoint in your |akv|, you must do the following: 

.. include:: /includes/steps-azure-enable-private-endpoint-connections.rst

After you enable Encryption at Rest Using |cmk| (Over Private
Networking) for your project, you can enable :ref:`Encryption at Rest 
<azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint>` using |cmk| for
each |service| {+cluster+} in your project. 

.. _azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`azure-kms-configure-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| {+cluster+} that contains data that you want
to encrypt. If you configured private endpoint connections for your
|service| project, |service| automatically migrates all {+clusters+} for
which you already enabled :ref:`customer managed keys
<azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint>`, including
existing {+clusters+} that allow connections using public internet, to
use only the private endpoint connection. 

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for {+clusters+} in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the :ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>` setting to :guilabel:`Yes`, if it
isn't already enabled, when you create the cluster.  

For existing clusters:

.. include:: /includes/steps-cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Disable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable |cmk| for a project, you must first :ref:`remove
<azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints associated 
with the project, regardless of their state. |service| displays an error if
you attempt to disable |cmk| for a project that is associated with
active private endpoints. 

After removing all private endpoints for a project, you must disable
customer key management on each {+cluster+} in the project before you 
disable the feature for the project.

.. warning::

   Do *not* disable or delete any |akv| keys that any {+cluster+} in your
   |service| project uses before you have disabled customer key
   management within the |service| project. If |service| can't access
   an |akv| key, any data that the key encrypted becomes inaccessible.

.. _azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint:

Reject or Remove Private Endpoint Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To successfully remove a private endpoint, send a ``DELETE`` request to
the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint
</requestEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpointDeletion>` and specify the ID of
the project and of the private endpoint that you want to delete. You can 
retrieve the ID of the private endpoint that you want to delete by sending 
a ``GET`` request to the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Private 
Endpoint Service for One Provider 
</Private-Endpoint-Services/operation/getPrivateEndpointService>` endpoint.

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: json
      
      curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
      --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin API
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --include \
      --request DELETE "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AZURE/privateEndpoints/{endpointId}" \ 
      --data '
        {
          "cloudProvider": "AZURE",
          "regions": [
            "string"
          ]
        }'

When you delete a private endpoint by using the {+atlas-admin-api+}, the
private endpoint transitions to the ``DELETING`` status while |service|
deletes the private endpoint.

If you remove or reject an active private endpoint from the |azure| UI,
|service| automatically attempts to recreate a new private endpoint in
the same region. You can check the status of the private endpoint by
sending a ``GET`` request to the {+atlas-admin-api+}
``encryptionAtRest`` :oas-atlas-op:`get all </getEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpointsForCloudProvider>` 
endpoint or :oas-atlas-op:`get one </getEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpoint>` 
endpoint, for which you must specify the ID of the private endpoint
in the path. 

.. example:: Return All Private Endpoints for One Project

   .. code-block:: 
      :copyable: true

      
      curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
      --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin API
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --include \
      --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AZURE/privateEndpoints/"      
      
While |service| attempts to create a new private endpoint, the status of
the private endpoint that you rejected or removed transitions to
``PENDING_RECREATION`` and the new endpoint that |service| attempts to
create is in ``INITIATING`` state. You must approve the new private
endpoint after it is created. 

.. _azure-disable-pvt-endpoint:

Disable Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable private endpoint connections for a project, you must first
:ref:`remove <azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints, 
associated with the project, regardless of their state. |service|
doesn't disable private endpoint connections for a project if the
project is associated with active private endpoints.

After removing all private endpoints for a project, you can disable
private endpoint connections for the project by using the
{+atlas-admin-api+}. To disable a private endpoint connection, send a 
``PATCH`` request to the :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint
</updateEncryptionAtRest>` with the ``requirePrivateNetworking`` boolean
flag value set to ``false``.

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :emphasize-lines: 8

      {
        "azureKeyVault": {
          "azureEnvironment": "AZURE",
          "clientID": "632ff709-32a8-48a3-8224-30d2386fadaf",
          "enabled": true,
          "keyIdentifier": "https://EXAMPLEKeyVault.vault.azure.net/keys/EXAMPLEKey/d891821e3d364e9eb88fbd3d11807b86",
          "keyVaultName": "string",
          "requirePrivateNetworking": false,
          "resourceGroupName": "string",
          "secret": "string",
          "subscriptionID": "a39012fb-d604-4cd1-8841-77f705f3e6d5",
          "tenantID": "ee46317d-36a3-4472-a3dd-6549e901da0b"
        }
      }

Revoke Access to an Encryption Key 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can revoke |service|'s access to an encryption key from within
|akv| to freeze your data. |service| automatically pauses your
{+clusters+} when you revoke access to the encryption key.

Rotate your Azure Key Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. meta::
   :keywords: encryption

.. include:: /includes/unavailable-serverless-m0-m2-m5-clusters.rst

Before you begin, learn :ref:`azure-kms-rotate-key`.

You must create a new key in the |akv| associated with your
|service| project. The following procedure documents how to rotate your
|service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new key identifier in
|service|. 

.. include:: /includes/steps-rotate-azure-encryption-key.rst
