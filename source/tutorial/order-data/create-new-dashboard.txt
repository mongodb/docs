*Time to Complete: 3 minutes*

Instructions
------------

Now that you have created your data source, create a dashboard to hold
all of your visualizations:

1. Click :guilabel:`Dashboards` in the sidebar.

#. Click the :guilabel:`New Dashboard` button.

#. Copy the following into the :guilabel:`Title` input:

   .. code-block:: none

      Super Supply Store Orders

4. Copy the following into the :guilabel:`Description` input:

   .. code-block:: none

      Sales, Customer Analytics, and More.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

After clicking create, |charts-short| navigates you to your newly
created dashboard and prompts you to add your first chart.

Next Steps
----------

The following sections of the tutorial walk through
:doc:`building each chart </build-charts>` for your dashboard. You
will be populating the dashboard with the following visualizations:

- A :ref:`column chart <order-data-column-chart>` for total sales by
  store location

- A :ref:`donut chart <order-data-donut-chart>` showing the frequencies
  of tags occurring in each item sold

- A :ref:`grouped column chart <order-data-grouped-column>` showing the
  most common items sold in each store location

- An :ref:`area chart <order-data-area-chart>` showing a distribution
  of customer ages

To create each chart, you will populate the chart's
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` with fields from your
schema. Encoding channels represent the information passed to
|charts| which allows |charts-short| to create the visualization.
For more information on encoding channels and the different types of
channels available, refer to the
:ref:`encoding channels section <encoding-channels>` of the
documentation.

Follow along to the next section of the tutorial to build a
:ref:`column chart <order-data-column-chart>` showing total sales by
store location.
