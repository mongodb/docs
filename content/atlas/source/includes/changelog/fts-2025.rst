25 September 2025 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds support for configuring dynamic indexing with ``typeSets``. To learn more, see
  :ref:`fts-configure-dynamic-mappings`.
- Starting with :manual:`MongoDB 8.0.14 </release-notes/8.0/#8.0.14-changelog>`,
  the ``returnStoredSource`` and ``scoreDetails`` options must be set to ``true`` or
  ``false``. Queries that specify ``null`` for these options will fail.
- Adds support for specifying the ``stableTfl`` or ``boolean``
  similarity algorithms when indexing ``string`` fields as the |fts|
  :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` and :ref:`autocomplete
  <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` types. These algorithms are applied at
  query time to calculate |fts| scores with the :ref:`text <text-ref>`,
  :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>`, :ref:`queryString <querystring-ref>`, and
  :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>` operators. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Score Details <fts-similarity-algorithms>`.
