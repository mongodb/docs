     :doc:`{+old-backup+} snapshot </backup/legacy-backup/overview>`,
     see :doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/restore`.

Restore Restrictions
--------------------

- |service| can only restore to a :term:`replica set` or
  :term:`sharded cluster` that uses the same encryption provider as
  the source snapshot cluster.

- The target cluster must run the same or newer release version of
  MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version.

- |service| can't restore a sharded cluster snapshot to a replica set.

.. _cps-failback-snapshots:

Fallback Snapshots
------------------

If a scheduled snapshot fails for any reason, |service| attempts to
repeat the snapshot process. If necessary, you may use the resulting
fallback snapshot to :ref:`restore the cluster
<restoration-cloud-provider-snapshot>`. This isn't recommended:
fallback snapshots use a different process from regular snapshots. They
may contain inconsistent data.

Fallback snapshots are marked in the UI with a warning icon, and a
warning message appears in the restore modal window if the restore uses
a fallback snapshot.

.. warning::

   Restoring your cluster from a fallback snapshot may result in
   inconsistent data across your cluster, and should be considered an
   option of last resort.

Procedure
---------

.. important:: Restoring Snapshots for Clusters using Encryption at Rest

   |service| automatically encrypts
   :ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s <backup-cloud-provider>` for
   clusters using :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`, in addition to the
   existing encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot
   volumes. For documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, see
   :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`

   The following instructions only apply to snapshots for
   clusters not using Encryption at Rest.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Restore
      :tabid: snapshot-restore

      #. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
         are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
         You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Select a cluster's snapshot to restore.

         Click :guilabel:`Restore` or :guilabel:`Download`.

      #. Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

         - :ref:`Download your snapshot via HTTPS <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>`.

         - :ref:`Restore your snapshot to an Atlas cluster <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-atlas>`.

   .. tab:: {+PIT-Restore+}
      :tabid: pit-restore

      You can enable {+PIT-Restore+}s when you :ref:`create
      <create-new-cluster>` or :ref:`scale <scale-cluster-backups>` a
      cluster.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service|
         backups are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are
         available. You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore` button on the far
         right side of the screen.

      #. Select either the :guilabel:`Date & Time` or :guilabel:`Oplog
         Timestamp` tab.

         .. note::

            If you select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` option, you can
            specify the time of restore with one minute of granularity.
            If you select the :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp` option, you
            can specify the time of restore with one second of
            granularity.

      #. Enter the desired point in time to restore from.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

      #. Choose a project and cluster to restore to from the dropdown
         menus.

         .. important::

            |service| might create a host rollback alert due to
            differences in the data between the source and target
            clusters. You can ignore this alert.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.

.. _restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-atlas:

Restore your Snapshot to an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning.rst

1. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target cluster to
   which you want to restore.

   .. note::

      The amount of time it takes to restore from a backup depends on 
      the project and region. For best possible restore performance, 
      select a target cluster that isn't a global, multi-region, or 
      multi-cloud cluster and belongs to:

      - The same |service| project as the snapshot.
      - The same cloud provider region as the snapshot.
      - A tier with a maximum disk capacity that exceeds size of the
        snapshot.

        If the target cluster runs on |aws| with configured |iops|, the
        configured |iops| must fall within the valid range when you set
        its disk size to the snapshot size.

      - A tier that hasn't been configured to use |nvme| storage.

        The tier can support |nvme| storage, but if you enable |nvme|,
        restore performance degrades.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target cluster.

.. _restore-encrypted-snapshot:

Restore a Snapshot of a Cluster with Encryption at Rest
-------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   Snapshots of clusters using
   :doc:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management </security-kms-encryption>`
   can only restore to other clusters that use Encryption at Rest. You
   cannot restore a snapshot with Encryption at Rest to a |mms|
   project.

   If the target project does not have a cluster with Encryption at
   Rest enabled, you can either
   :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a cluster with
   Encryption at Rest, or
   :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
   in an existing cluster.

   Clusters which use :ref:`AWS KMS <security-aws-kms>` encrypt their
   |pit| restore :term:`oplog` data with the customer's |cmk|. The
   current |cmk| must be valid for the encrypted oplog data to perform
   a restore from a snapshot.

#. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

#. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

   If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
   are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
   You can enable backups when
   :ref:`modifying the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target |service|
   :guilabel:`Project` to which you want to restore. You can restore to
   any |service| project for which the authenticated |service| user has
   the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Cluster` to restore to. You can only restore
   to an |service| replica set running Encryption at Rest. The target
   cluster must run the same or greater version of MongoDB as the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Version` of the snapshot.


   After the restoration procedure, |service| triggers a key rotation
   for MongoDB encryption key. |service| then encrypts the new MongoDB
   encryption keys based on the configured Encryption at Rest provider
   for the target cluster.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target
   cluster.

Troubleshooting Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |service| has an issue with the encryption of either the snapshot
or the target cluster, it displays one of the following errors:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error

     - Result

   * - Cannot restore a non-encrypted snapshot to a cluster with
       Encryption at Rest enabled.

     - The snapshot cannot be restored to |service|.

   * - Target cluster does not have encryption enabled.

     - You can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       a new target cluster with Encryption at Rest, or
       :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       on your desired target cluster.

   * - Encryption provider of target cluster does not match selected
       snapshot's encryption provider.

     - The encryption provider for the snapshot and target cluster
       do not match. You can either:

       1. Create a new snapshot with the same encryption provider.
       #. Change the encryption provider for the target cluster.

   * - Encryption credentials on snapshot are not present.

     - |service| cannot restore a snapshot whose encryption key was
       deleted.

View Status of Snapshot Restorations
------------------------------------

|service| provides a detailed list of completed and in-progress
snapshot restorations, including when |service| took the snapshot and
the snapshot's delivery type. To view this list, from a cluster's
:guilabel:`Backup` tab, click the :guilabel:`Restores & Downloads` tab.

The :guilabel:`Status` column of the table displays the results of
completed snapshots, and the progress of snapshots currently
being restored.

- For manually downloaded snapshots, the :guilabel:`Status` column
  displays progress while |service| prepares the download link. Once
  the download is ready, the column displays the link to download the
  snapshot.

- For automated restores and {+PIT-Restore+} restores, the
  :guilabel:`Status` column updates as the restoration progresses on
  each node in the cluster. When the restoration completes, the column
  displays the time of completion and the cluster to which |service|
  restored the snapshot.
