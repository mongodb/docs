Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor the
outcome of commands that the driver sends to your MongoDB deployment.

You can use information about command events in your
application, or you can monitor commands to learn more about
how the driver executes them.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Event Descriptions <rust-command-monitoring-descriptions>` describes
  the command events that the driver can generate.

- :ref:`Event Subscription Example <rust-command-monitoring-example>`
  provides sample code that shows how to subscribe to command events.

- :ref:`Example Event Documents <rust-command-monitoring-documents>`
  provides samples of each command event.
  
- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-command-monitoring-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide.

Event Descriptions
------------------

You can monitor the following command events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - `CommandStartedEvent <{+api+}/event/command/struct.CommandStartedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a command starts.

   * - `CommandSucceededEvent <{+api+}/event/command/struct.CommandSucceededEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a command succeeds.

   * - `CommandFailedEvent <{+api+}/event/command/struct.CommandFailedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a command does not succeed.

.. _rust-command-monitoring-example:

Event Monitoring Example
------------------------

You can monitor command events by assigning an ``EventHandler`` instance as the value of the
``command_event_handler`` client option. To construct an ``EventHandler``, which processes all
command events, use the ``callback()`` or ``async_callback()`` method.

The following example connects to a MongoDB deployment, instructs the client to monitor
command events, and prints each event:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/monitoring/command-subscribe.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-command
   :end-before: end-command

Example Event Documents
-----------------------

The following sections show sample output for each type of command monitoring event.

CommandStartedEvent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   CommandStartedEvent {
     request_id: 12,
     db: "testdb",
     command_name: "find",
     connection: ...,
     command: ...,
     service_id: ...
   }

CommandSucceededEvent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   CommandSucceededEvent {
       duration: ...,
       reply: ...,
       command_name: "find",
       request_id: 12,
       connection: ...,
       service_id: ...,
   }

CommandFailedEvent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   CommandFailedEvent {
       duration: ...,
       command_name: "find",
       failure: ...,
       request_id: 12,
       connection: ...,
       service_id: ...,
   }
