.. note:: 

   {+adf+} doesn't include a server-side JavaScript engine. So, it 
   doesn't support commands like :manual:`mapReduce
   </reference/command/mapReduce/>` that require server-side 
   scripting :manual:`enabled 
   </reference/operator/query/where/#javascript-enablement>`. 

``aggregate``
-------------

For the :manual:`aggregate </reference/command/aggregate>` command, the 
following limitation applies:

- {+adf+} supports the ``explain``, ``cursor``, ``comment``, and 
  ``background`` options only. 
  
- For the ``comment`` option, {+adf+} supports only type ``string``. 
       
- {+adf+} supports ``{"background" : <boolean>}`` option for 
  :ref:`adf-out-stage` to |s3| and |service| cluster only. The 
  ``background`` option is not available for other :manual:`aggregation 
  pipeline stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline>`. See 
  :ref:`$out Options <adf-out-stage-options>` for more information.

.. seealso::
       
   :ref:`adf-aggregation-pipeline-support`.

``count`` 
---------

For the :manual:`count </reference/command/count>` command, the 
following limitations apply:

- {+adf+} converts ``count()`` to an aggregation pipeline internal to 
  {+df+}.
- {+adf+} supports only the ``query`` option.

``find``
--------

For :manual:`find </reference/command/find>` command, {+adf+} supports 
the following options:

- ``batchSize``
- ``singleBatch``
- ``filter``
- ``limit``
- ``projection``
- ``skip``
- ``sort``

``find()`` is converted to an aggregation pipeline internal to the 
{+fdi+}.
