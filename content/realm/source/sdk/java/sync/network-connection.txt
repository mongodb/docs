To check the current network connection, call :java-sdk:`getConnectionState() <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.html#getConnectionState-->` on your :java-sdk:`SyncSession <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.html>`:

.. important:: Connection States vs. Session States

   The SDK manages communication with App Services at two levels:
   **connection state** and **session state**. *Connection state* tracks
   the state of the network connection between a client device and your
   backend App. *Session state* refers to a single user's
   synchronization state, which can be :ref:`paused and resumed
   <java-pause-or-resume-a-sync-session>` in the SDK at will. As a
   result, you must check *both* states to determine whether
   a user's local changes will sync to the backend. Synchronization
   only occurs when the connection state is "connected" and the session
   state is "active".

You can also subscribe to connection changes on your ``SyncSession``
with :java-sdk:`addConnectionChangeListener()
<io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.html#addConnectionChangeListener-io.realm.mongodb.sync.ConnectionListener->`,
which works similarly to :ref:`upload and download listeners
<java-check-sync-progress>`.
