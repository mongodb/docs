Red Hat OpenShift
=================

OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from RedHat, which
provides support for rapid deployment and automatic scalability support
for web applications developed with Java EE, Node.js, Python, PHP, Perl
and Ruby. OpenShift Express is a free shared-cloud solution for
deploying your applications. With Express, you simply push your app
using the command line tools to OpenShift and the platform takes care
of the hosting infrastructure.

In this guide, we'll take a simple Java web application and deploy it
onto OpenShift Express. We'll walk through the steps required to setup
and administer MongoDB as well as backing up your data.

Cloning the App
---------------

We'll be deploying an existing Java web application onto OpenShift. The
app is a simple REST-style checkin mechanism with a single endpoint.
The app supports POST-ing new checkins (by supplying a comment and
location) and GET-ing checkins near a given location (by supplying a
pair of coordinates). The app was built using `Java SE 6
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-13836
3.html>`_ and `Maven <http://maven.apache.org>`_. Make sure to have
those components installed, along with `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for
your platform, before continuing.

First, start by cloning the repository for the web application:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/crcsmnky/openshift-checkins.git
   cd openshift-checkins

Next, make sure you can build the app as-is using Maven:

.. code-block:: sh

   mvn package
    
If that completes successfully, you're ready to move on. To prepare our
app for deployment, we'll need to setup our OpenShift Express account.

Deploying onto Express
----------------------

To deploy apps onto Express you'll need to create an OpenShift account
from the `OpenShift sign up page
<https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new>`_ and install the
OpenShift command line tools.

First, follow the steps from the `OpenShift Express getting started
guide <https://openshift.redhat.com/app/getting_started>`_ in the
**Install the client tools** section for your platform. Once the tools
have been installed we'll create a domain name, app name and then push
the sample app to OpenShift Express (the URL for the app will be
something like *http://appname-domainname.rhcloud.com*).

First, create the domain name:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ rhc domain create -n your-domain -l your-openshift-login
    
This command will prompt you for your account password then for an SSH
passphrase (it generates a public/private keypair to use for connecting
to the OpenShift service). Next, create an entry for the app that we'll
be deploying. Here you'll need to supply the app name (example,
``expresscheckin``) and ``jbossas-7.0`` as the app type:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ rhc app create -a expresscheckin -t jbossas-7
   Password: 
   Creating application: expresscheckin
   Now your new domain name is being propagated worldwide (this might take a minute)...
   Warning: Permanently added 'expresscheckin-your-domain.rhcloud.com,50.16.164.248' (RSA) to the           
   list of known hosts.
   Confirming application 'expresscheckin' is available:  Success!

   expresscheckin published:  http://expresscheckin-your-domain.rhcloud.com/
   git url:  ssh://429827960cbf4518b1785ed928db9be7@expresscheckin-your-      
   domain.rhcloud.com/~/git/expresscheckin.git/
   Successfully created application: expresscheckin
    
After the app is created the command will also clone the app's
repository locally. Before continuing, we need to set up MongoDB on
OpenShift and also update our app's MongoDB connection information:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ rhc app cartridge add -a expresscheckin -c mongodb-2.0

   RESULT:

   MongoDB 2.0 database added.  Please make note of these credentials:

          Root User: admin
      Root Password: 1wbLGYAmPgDM
      Database Name: expresscheckin
     Connection URL: mongodb://127.6.85.129:27017/

   You can manage your new MongoDB by also embedding rockmongo-1.1

Now that we've added support for MongoDB to our app (on OpenShift)
we'll need to take the credentials returned and update our
``openshift-checkins`` app configuration. Go back to the
``openshift-checkins`` directory and edit ``CheckinServlet.java`` and
add/update the following lines in the ``init`` function using the
MongoDB details provided by OpenShift (don't forget to uncomment the
``if`` statement with the authentication statement):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd openshift-checkins
   $ nano src/main/java/CheckinServlet.java
   ...
   conn = new Mongo("127.6.85.129", 27017);
   db = conn.getDB("expresscheckin");

   if (!db.authenticate("admin", "1wbLGYAmPgDM".toCharArray())) {
     throw new MongoException("unable to authenticate");
   }
   ...
    
Then build the :file:`openshift-checkins` WAR file:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mvn package
    
Now, return to the cloned repository, remove the sample code generated
from the ``expresscheckin`` app repo that was cloned to our system and
copy the :file:`checkins.war` file into the ``deployments`` as
:file:`ROOT.war`:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd ../expresscheckin
   $ rm -rf pom.xml src
   $ cp ../openshift-checkins/target/checkins.war deployments/ROOT.war

As part of the deployment process, we also need to flag our WAR file to
be deployed (expanded and copied to the right places):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ touch deployments/ROOT.war.dodeploy
    
Now we can add it to the repository, commit and push:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ git add -A
   $ git commit -m "initial deployment of expresscheckin app onto OpenShift Express"
   $ git push origin
    
After pushing the app, it will take a few minutes for the app to become
available at *http://expresscheckin-your-domain.rhcloud.com*. That's it, you've
deployed a simple Java app that uses MongoDB to OpenShift Express.
Refer to :ref:`testing-the-deployment` below for some notes on testing
the app's functionality.

.. _testing-the-deployment:

Testing the Deployment
----------------------

Once you've deployed your app onto OpenShift Express, the URL for the
app will be something of the form
*http://expresscheckin-your-domain.rhcloud.com*. We'll now use that URL
to conduct some tests on our deployed app.

Since the app is a simple RESTish mechanism we can use ``curl`` to test
it out. Let's start by posting a new comment and location to the URL
(ex. `http://appurl.rhcloud.com/checkin
<http://appurl.rhcloud.com/checkin>`_):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -X POST -d "comment=hello&x=1&y=1" http://appurl.rhcloud.com/checkin
    
Now let's see if we can find the comment we just posted at that
location (``x = 1``, ``y = 1``):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl "http://appurl.rhcloud.com/checkin?x=1&y=1"
   { "_id" : { "$oid" : "4f0e068c3004bfd40822840b"} , "comment" : "hello" , "location" : [ 1.0 ,    
   1.0]}
    
If these worked, then it looks like we've got a functional app deployed
onto OpenShift.

Advanced Functionality
----------------------

Once you've deployed your app, you'll probably need to connect to your
server at some point so you can do things like reviewing app logs or
query data in MongoDB. The following steps will cover how you can do
that (and if available, set up some advanced functionality).

App Administration
------------------

Using the command line tools, we can connect to the server our app is
deployed on. Run the following command to get information about the
current running apps:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ rhc domain show
   Password: 

   User Info
   =========
   Namespace: checkins
     RHLogin: sandeep@clusterbeep.org


   Application Info
   ================
   expresscheckin
       Framework: jbossas-7
        Creation: 2012-04-14T14:04:54-04:00
            UUID: 485daa768043454d9cdcb9343018eb6e
         Git URL: ssh://485daa768043454d9cdcb9343018eb6e@expresscheckin-   
   checkins.rhcloud.com/~/git/expresscheckin.git/
      Public URL: http://expresscheckin-checkins.rhcloud.com/

    Embedded: 
         mongodb-2.0 - Connection URL: mongodb://127.6.85.129:27017/

The ``UDID`` above shows the user ID we can use to SSH into our server:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ssh 429827960cbf4518b1785ed928db9be7@expresscheckin-your-domain.rhcloud.com

   Welcome to OpenShift shell

   This shell will assist you in managing openshift applications.

   !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!
   Shell access is quite powerful and it is possible for you to
   accidentally damage your application.  Proceed with care!
   If worse comes to worse, destroy your application with rhc-ctl-app
   and recreate it
   !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

   type "help" for more info.
    
Now at the prompt type ``help`` to see the available commands (in
addition to normal shell commands):

.. code-block:: sh

   [openshift]$ help
   Help menu: The following commands are available to help control your openshift
   application and environment.

   ctl_app         control your application (start, stop, restart, etc)
   ctl_all         control application and deps like mysql in one command
   tail_all        tail all log files
   export          list available environment variables
   rm              remove files / directories
   ls              list files / directories
   ps              list running applications
   kill            kill running applications
   mongo           interactive MongoDB shell

To connect to MongoDB, we'll need to use the credentials provided to us
from OpenShift above when we set it up initially. Once you have those
in hand, here's how you should connect to the database:

.. code-block:: sh

   [openshift]$ mongo expresscheckin -u admin -p 1wbLGYAmPgDM
   MongoDB shell version: 2.0.2-rc1
   connecting to: 127.1.13.1:27017/expresscheckin
   >
    
From here you can query your data as needed for your application.
Finally, to backup your app's data, follow the instructions found on
the `MongoDB Backup docs
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/backups>`_.
Specifically you'll need to use the `mongodump
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/import-export/#ImportExpo
rtTools-mongodump>`_ command to do a live backup of your data.

Backing up your app is a simple single step where we create a
**snapshot** of the entirety of the application including data, which
we can do locally on our development machine:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ rhc app snapshot save -a expresscheckin
   Password: 
   Pulling down a snapshot to expresscheckin.tar.gz

   Running extra dump: mongodb_dump.sh
   MongoDB already running
   Stopping application...
   Done
   Creating and sending tar.gz
   Running extra cleanup: mongodb_cleanup.sh
   Starting application...
   Done
