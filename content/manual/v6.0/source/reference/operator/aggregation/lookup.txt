.. pipeline:: $lookup

   .. versionchanged:: 5.1

   Performs a left outer join to a collection in the *same* database to
   filter in documents from the "joined" collection for processing. The
   :pipeline:`$lookup` stage adds a new array field to each input
   document. The new array field contains the matching documents from
   the "joined" collection. The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage passes these
   reshaped documents to the next stage.

   Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can use :pipeline:`$lookup` with sharded 
   collections.

   To combine elements from two different collections, use the
   :pipeline:`$unionWith` pipeline stage.

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage has the following syntaxes:

.. _lookup-single-equality:

Equality Match with a Single Join Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an equality match between a field from the input documents
with a field from the documents of the "joined" collection, the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage has this syntax:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      $lookup:
        {
          from: <collection to join>,
          localField: <field from the input documents>,
          foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
          as: <output array field>
        }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` takes a document with these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :ref:`from <lookup-eq-from>`

     - .. _lookup-eq-from:
     
       Specifies the collection in the *same* database to perform the
       join with.

       .. include:: /includes/lookup-from.rst

       Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the collection specified in the ``from``
       parameter can be sharded.

   * - :ref:`localField <lookup-eq-localField>`

     - .. _lookup-eq-localField:
     
       Specifies the field from the documents input to the
       :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. :pipeline:`$lookup` performs an
       equality match on the ``localField`` to the
       ``foreignField`` from the documents of the ``from``
       collection. If an input document does not contain the
       ``localField``, the :pipeline:`$lookup` treats the
       field as having a value of ``null`` for matching purposes.

   * - :ref:`foreignField <lookup-eq-foreignField>`

     - .. _lookup-eq-foreignField:
     
       Specifies the field from the documents in the ``from``
       collection. :pipeline:`$lookup` performs an equality match on
       the ``foreignField`` to the ``localField`` from the input
       documents. If a document in the ``from`` collection does not
       contain the ``foreignField``, the :pipeline:`$lookup` treats
       the value as ``null`` for matching purposes.

   * - :ref:`as <lookup-eq-as>`

     - .. _lookup-eq-as:
     
       Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the input
       documents. The new array field contains the matching
       documents from the ``from`` collection. If the specified name
       already exists in the input document, the existing field is
       *overwritten*.

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, (
      SELECT ARRAY_AGG(*)
      FROM <collection to join>
      WHERE <foreignField> = <collection.localField>
   ) AS <output array field>
   FROM collection;

.. note::

   The SQL statements on this page are included for comparison to the
   MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax. The SQL statements aren't
   runnable.

.. _lookup-syntax-let-pipeline:

Join Conditions and Subqueries on a Joined Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports:

- Executing a pipeline on a joined collection.

- Multiple join conditions.

- Correlated and uncorrelated subqueries.

In MongoDB, a correlated subquery is a :ref:`pipeline
<lookup-join-pipeline>` in a :pipeline:`$lookup` stage that references
document fields from a joined collection. An uncorrelated subquery does
not reference joined fields.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/uncorrelated-subquery.rst

MongoDB correlated subqueries are comparable to SQL correlated
subqueries, where the inner query references outer query values. An
SQL uncorrelated subquery does not reference outer query values.

MongoDB 5.0 also supports :ref:`concise correlated subqueries
<lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery>`.

To perform correlated and uncorrelated subqueries with two collections,
and perform other join conditions besides a single equality match, use
this :pipeline:`$lookup` syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup:
         {
            from: <joined collection>,
            let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
            pipeline: [ <pipeline to run on joined collection> ],
            as: <output array field>
         }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage accepts a document with these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :ref:`from <lookup-join-from>`

     - .. _lookup-join-from:
     
       Specifies the collection in the *same* database to perform the
       join operation.

       .. include:: /includes/lookup-from.rst

       Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the ``from`` collection can be sharded.

   * - :ref:`let <lookup-join-let>`

     - .. _lookup-join-let:
     
       Optional. Specifies variables to use in the :ref:`pipeline
       <lookup-join-pipeline>` stages. Use the variable expressions to
       access the fields from the joined collection's documents that are
       input to the ``pipeline``.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst

   * - :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>`

     - .. _lookup-join-pipeline:
     
       Specifies the ``pipeline`` to run on the joined collection. The
       ``pipeline`` determines the resulting documents from the joined
       collection. To return all documents, specify an empty
       ``pipeline`` ``[]``.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` stage or the
       :pipeline:`$merge` stage. Starting in v6.0, the ``pipeline`` 
       can contain the :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` 
       :pipeline:`$search` stage as the first stage inside the 
       pipeline. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-lookup-behavior`.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot directly access the joined document
       fields. Instead, define variables for the joined document fields
       using the :ref:`let <lookup-join-let>` option and then reference
       the variables in the ``pipeline`` stages.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst
 
   * - :ref:`as <lookup-join-as>`

     - .. _lookup-join-as:
     
       Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the joined
       documents. The new array field contains the matching documents
       from the joined collection. If the specified name already exists
       in the joined document, the existing field is overwritten.

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM collection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (
      SELECT <documents as determined from the pipeline>
      FROM <collection to join>
      WHERE <pipeline>
   );

See the following examples:

- :ref:`lookup-multiple-joins`
- :ref:`lookup-uncorrelated-subquery`

.. _lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery:

Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can use a concise syntax for a correlated
subquery. Correlated subqueries reference document fields from a joined
"foreign" collection  *and* the "local" collection on which the
:method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method was run.

The following new concise syntax removes the requirement for an equality
match on the foreign and local fields inside of an :query:`$expr`
operator:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup:
         {
            from: <foreign collection>,
            localField: <field from local collection's documents>,
            foreignField: <field from foreign collection's documents>,
            let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
            pipeline: [ <pipeline to run> ],
            as: <output array field>
         }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` accepts a document with these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :ref:`from <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-from>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-from:
     
       Specifies the foreign collection in the *same* database to join
       to the local collection.

       .. include:: /includes/lookup-from.rst
       
       Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the ``from`` collection can be sharded.

   * - :ref:`localField
       <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-localField>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-localField:
     
       Specifies the local documents' ``localField`` to perform an
       equality match with the foreign documents' ``foreignField``.
       
       If a local document does not contain a ``localField`` value, the
       :pipeline:`$lookup` uses a ``null`` value for the match.

   * - :ref:`foreignField
       <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-foreignField>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-foreignField:
     
       Specifies the foreign documents' ``foreignField`` to perform an
       equality match with the local documents' ``localField``.
       
       If a foreign document does not contain a ``foreignField`` value,
       the :pipeline:`$lookup` uses a ``null`` value for the match.

   * - :ref:`let <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-let>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-let:
     
       Optional. Specifies the variables to use in the :ref:`pipeline
       <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-pipeline>` stages. Use the
       variable expressions to access the document fields that are input
       to the ``pipeline``.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst

   * - :ref:`pipeline <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-pipeline>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-pipeline:
     
       Specifies the ``pipeline`` to run on the foreign collection. The
       ``pipeline`` returns documents from the foreign collection. To
       return all documents, specify an empty ``pipeline`` ``[]``.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` or
       :pipeline:`$merge` stages. Starting in v6.0, the ``pipeline`` 
       can contain the :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` 
       :pipeline:`$search` stage as the first stage inside the 
       pipeline. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-lookup-behavior`.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot directly access the document fields.
       Instead, define variables for the document fields using the
       :ref:`let <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-let>` option and
       then reference the variables in the ``pipeline`` stages.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst
 
   * - :ref:`as <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-as>`

     - .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-as:
     
       Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the foreign
       documents. The new array field contains the matching documents
       from the foreign collection. If the specified name already exists
       in the foreign document, the existing field is overwritten.

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM localCollection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (
      SELECT <documents as determined from the pipeline>
      FROM <foreignCollection>
      WHERE <foreignCollection.foreignField> = <localCollection.localField>
      AND <pipeline match condition>
   );

Views and Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/views-collation-agg.rst

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` or the :pipeline:`$merge`
stage in the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. That is, when specifying a
:ref:`pipeline for the joined collection
<lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>`, you cannot include either stage in
the ``pipeline`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   {
      $lookup:
      {
         from: <collection to join>,
         let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
         pipeline: [ <pipeline to execute on the joined collection> ],  // Cannot include $out or $merge
         as: <output array field>
      }
   }

.. _fts-lookup-behavior:

Atlas Search Support 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can specify the :atlas:`Atlas Search 
</atlas-search>` :pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage 
in the ``$lookup`` pipeline to search collections on the Atlas 
cluster. The :pipeline:`$search` or the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage 
must be the first stage inside the ``$lookup`` pipeline.

For example, when you :ref:`lookup-syntax-let-pipeline` or run 
:ref:`lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery`, you can specify 
:pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` inside the pipeline as 
shown below:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: $search
      :tabid: search

      .. code-block:: 
         :copyable: false 
         :emphasize-lines: 7-11

         [{
           "$lookup": {
             "from": <joined collection>,
             localField: <field from the input documents>,
             foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
             "as": <output array field>,
             "pipeline": [{
               "$search": {

                 }
               },
               ... 
             }]
           }
         }] 

   .. tab:: $searchMeta
      :tabid: searchmeta

      .. code-block:: 
         :copyable: false 
         :emphasize-lines: 7-11

         [{
           "$lookup": {
             "from": <joined collection>,
             localField: <field from the input documents>,
             foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
             "as": <output array field>,
             "pipeline": [{
               "$searchMeta": {
                 "<collector>": {
                   <collector-specification>
                 }
               },
               ... 
             }]
           }
         }] 

To see an example of :pipeline:`$lookup` with :pipeline:`$search`, 
see the Atlas Search tutorial :atlas:`Run an Atlas Search $search Query 
Using $lookup </atlas-search/tutorial/lookup-with-search/>`.

.. _lookup-sharded-collections:

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can specify :ref:`sharded collections 
<sharding-sharded-cluster>` in the ``from`` parameter of 
:pipeline:`$lookup` stages.

You **cannot** use the ``$lookup`` stage within a transaction while 
targeting a sharded collection.

.. _lookup-performance-considerations:

Performance Considerations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$lookup`` performance depends on the type of operation performed.
Refer to the following table for performance considerations for
different ``$lookup`` operations. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``$lookup`` Operation
     - Performance Considerations

   * - :ref:`Equality Match with a Single Join
       <lookup-single-equality-example>`

     - .. _equality-match-performance:

       - ``$lookup`` operations that perform equality matches with a
         single join perform better when the foreign collection contains
         an index on the ``foreignField``.

         :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If a supporting index on the ``foreignField`` does 
         not exist, a ``$lookup`` operation that performs an equality match with 
         a single join will likely have poor performance.

   * - :ref:`Uncorrelated Subqueries <lookup-uncorrelated-subquery>`

     - .. _uncorrelated-subqueries-performance:
     
       - ``$lookup`` operations that contain uncorrelated subqueries
         perform better when the inner pipeline can reference an
         index of the foreign collection.

       - MongoDB only needs to run the ``$lookup`` subquery once before
         caching the query because there is no relationship between the
         source and foreign collections. The subquery is not based on
         any value in the source collection. This behavior improves
         performance for subsequent executions of the ``$lookup``
         operation.

   * - :ref:`Correlated Subqueries <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery>`

     - .. _correlated-subqueries-performance: 

       - ``$lookup`` operations that contain correlated subqueries
         perform better when the following conditions apply:
         
         - The foreign collection contains an index on the
           ``foreignField``.

         - The foreign collection contains an index that references the
           inner pipline. 
 
       - If your pipeline passes a large number of documents to the
         ``$lookup`` query, the following strategies may improve
         performance:

         - Reduce the number of documents that MongoDB passes to the 
           ``$lookup`` query. For example, set a stricter filter
           during the ``$match`` stage. 

         - Run the inner pipeline of the ``$lookup`` subquery as a
           separate query and use ``$out`` to create a temporary
           collection. Then, run an :ref:`equality match with a single
           join <lookup-single-equality>`. 

         - Reconsider the data's schema to ensure it is optimal for the
           use case. 

For general performance strategies, see :ref:`Indexing Strategies
<manual-indexing-strategies>` and :ref:`Query Optimization
<read-operations-indexing>`. 

.. important::

   Excessive use of ``$lookup`` within a query may slow down
   performance. To avoid multiple ``$lookup`` stages, consider an
   :ref:`embedded data model <embedded-data-modeling>` to optimize query
   performance. 

Examples
--------

.. _lookup-single-equality-example:

Perform a Single Equality Join with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "item" : "almonds", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 2, "item" : "pecans", "price" : 20, "quantity" : 1 },
      { "_id" : 3  }
   ] )

Create another collection ``inventory`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "almonds", "description": "product 1", "instock" : 120 },
      { "_id" : 2, "sku" : "bread", "description": "product 2", "instock" : 80 },
      { "_id" : 3, "sku" : "cashews", "description": "product 3", "instock" : 60 },
      { "_id" : 4, "sku" : "pecans", "description": "product 4", "instock" : 70 },
      { "_id" : 5, "sku": null, "description": "Incomplete" },
      { "_id" : 6 }
   ] )

The following aggregation operation on the ``orders`` collection
joins the documents from ``orders`` with the documents from the
``inventory`` collection using the fields ``item`` from the
``orders`` collection and the ``sku`` field from the ``inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate( [
      {
        $lookup:
          {
            from: "inventory",
            localField: "item",
            foreignField: "sku",
            as: "inventory_docs"
          }
     }
   ] )

The operation returns these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "item" : "almonds",
      "price" : 12,
      "quantity" : 2,
      "inventory_docs" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "almonds", "description" : "product 1", "instock" : 120 }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "item" : "pecans",
      "price" : 20,
      "quantity" : 1,
      "inventory_docs" : [
         { "_id" : 4, "sku" : "pecans", "description" : "product 4", "instock" : 70 }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 3,
      "inventory_docs" : [ 
         { "_id" : 5, "sku" : null, "description" : "Incomplete" },
         { "_id" : 6 }
      ]
   }

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, inventory_docs
   FROM orders
   WHERE inventory_docs IN (
      SELECT *
      FROM inventory
      WHERE sku = orders.item
   );

For more information, see
:ref:`Equality Match Performance Considerations <equality-match-performance>`. 

.. _unwind-example:

Use ``$lookup`` with an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``localField`` is an array, you can match the array elements
against a scalar ``foreignField`` without an :pipeline:`$unwind` stage.

For example, create an example collection ``classes`` with these
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.classes.insertMany( [
      { _id: 1, title: "Reading is ...", enrollmentlist: [ "giraffe2", "pandabear", "artie" ], days: ["M", "W", "F"] },
      { _id: 2, title: "But Writing ...", enrollmentlist: [ "giraffe1", "artie" ], days: ["T", "F"] }
   ] )

Create another collection ``members`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.insertMany( [
      { _id: 1, name: "artie", joined: new Date("2016-05-01"), status: "A" }, 
      { _id: 2, name: "giraffe", joined: new Date("2017-05-01"), status: "D" }, 
      { _id: 3, name: "giraffe1", joined: new Date("2017-10-01"), status: "A" }, 
      { _id: 4, name: "panda", joined: new Date("2018-10-11"), status: "A" },  
      { _id: 5, name: "pandabear", joined: new Date("2018-12-01"), status: "A" },
      { _id: 6, name: "giraffe2", joined: new Date("2018-12-01"), status: "D" }
   ] )

The following aggregation operation joins documents in the ``classes``
collection with the ``members`` collection, matching on the
``enrollmentlist`` field to the ``name`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.classes.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup:
            {
               from: "members",
               localField: "enrollmentlist",
               foreignField: "name",
               as: "enrollee_info"
           }
      }
   ] )

The operation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "title" : "Reading is ...",
      "enrollmentlist" : [ "giraffe2", "pandabear", "artie" ],
      "days" : [ "M", "W", "F" ],
      "enrollee_info" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "artie", "joined" : ISODate("2016-05-01T00:00:00Z"), "status" : "A" },
         { "_id" : 5, "name" : "pandabear", "joined" : ISODate("2018-12-01T00:00:00Z"), "status" : "A" },
         { "_id" : 6, "name" : "giraffe2", "joined" : ISODate("2018-12-01T00:00:00Z"), "status" : "D" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "title" : "But Writing ...",
      "enrollmentlist" : [ "giraffe1", "artie" ],
      "days" : [ "T", "F" ],
      "enrollee_info" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "artie", "joined" : ISODate("2016-05-01T00:00:00Z"), "status" : "A" },
         { "_id" : 3, "name" : "giraffe1", "joined" : ISODate("2017-10-01T00:00:00Z"), "status" : "A" }
      ]
   }

.. _lookup-mergeObjects:

Use ``$lookup`` with ``$mergeObjects``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :expression:`$mergeObjects` operator combines multiple documents
into a single document.

Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "item" : "almonds", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 2, "item" : "pecans", "price" : 20, "quantity" : 1 }
   ] )

Create another collection ``items`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.items.insertMany( [
     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "almonds", description: "almond clusters", "instock" : 120 },
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "bread", description: "raisin and nut bread", "instock" : 80 },
     { "_id" : 3, "item" : "pecans", description: "candied pecans", "instock" : 60 }
   ] )

The following operation first uses the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage to
join the two collections by the ``item`` fields and then uses
:expression:`$mergeObjects` in the :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` to merge
the joined documents from ``items`` and ``orders``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup: {
            from: "items",
            localField: "item",    // field in the orders collection
            foreignField: "item",  // field in the items collection
            as: "fromItems"
         }
      },
      {
         $replaceRoot: { newRoot: { $mergeObjects: [ { $arrayElemAt: [ "$fromItems", 0 ] }, "$$ROOT" ] } }
      },
      { $project: { fromItems: 0 } }
   ] )

The operation returns these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     item: 'almonds',
     description: 'almond clusters',
     instock: 120,
     price: 12,
     quantity: 2
   },
   {
     _id: 2,
     item: 'pecans',
     description: 'candied pecans',
     instock: 60,
     price: 20,
     quantity: 1
   }

.. _lookup-multiple-joins:

Perform Multiple Joins and a Correlated Subquery with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pipelines can execute on a joined collection and include multiple join
conditions.

A join condition can reference a field in the local collection on which
the :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method was run and reference a
field in the joined collection. This allows a correlated subquery
between the two collections.

MongoDB 5.0 supports :ref:`concise correlated subqueries
<lookup-concise-correlated-subquery>`.

Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "almonds", "price" : 12, "ordered" : 2 },
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "pecans", "price" : 20, "ordered" : 1 },
     { "_id" : 3, "item" : "cookies", "price" : 10, "ordered" : 60 }
   ] )

Create another collection ``warehouses`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.warehouses.insertMany( [
     { "_id" : 1, "stock_item" : "almonds", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 120 },
     { "_id" : 2, "stock_item" : "pecans", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 80 },
     { "_id" : 3, "stock_item" : "almonds", warehouse: "B", "instock" : 60 },
     { "_id" : 4, "stock_item" : "cookies", warehouse: "B", "instock" : 40 },
     { "_id" : 5, "stock_item" : "cookies", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 80 }
   ] )

The following example:

- Uses a correlated subquery with a join on the ``orders.item`` and
  ``warehouse.stock_item`` fields.

- Ensures the quantity of the item in stock can fulfill the
  ordered quantity.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup:
            {
              from: "warehouses",
              let: { order_item: "$item", order_qty: "$ordered" },
              pipeline: [
                 { $match: 
                    { $expr: 
                       { $and: 
                          [ 
                            { $eq: [ "$stock_item",  "$$order_item" ] }, 
                            { $gte: [ "$instock", "$$order_qty" ] }
                          ] 
                       }
                    }
                 },
                 { $project: { stock_item: 0, _id: 0 } }
              ],
              as: "stockdata"
            }
       }
   ] )

The operation returns these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     item: 'almonds',
     price: 12,
     ordered: 2,
     stockdata: [
       { warehouse: 'A', instock: 120 },
       { warehouse: 'B', instock: 60 }
     ]
   },
   {
     _id: 2,
     item: 'pecans',
     price: 20,
     ordered: 1,
     stockdata: [ { warehouse: 'A', instock: 80 } ]
   },
   {
     _id: 3,
     item: 'cookies',
     price: 10,
     ordered: 60,
     stockdata: [ { warehouse: 'A', instock: 80 } ]
   }

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, stockdata
   FROM orders
   WHERE stockdata IN (
      SELECT warehouse, instock
      FROM warehouses
      WHERE stock_item = orders.item
      AND instock >= orders.ordered
   );

.. include:: /includes/expr-operators-and-indexes.rst

For example, if the index ``{ stock_item: 1, instock: 1 }`` exists on
the ``warehouses`` collection:

- The equality match on the ``warehouses.stock_item`` field uses the
  index.
- The range part of the query on the ``warehouses.instock`` field
  also uses the indexed field in the compound index.

.. seealso::

   - :query:`$expr`
   - :doc:`/reference/aggregation-variables/`

.. _lookup-uncorrelated-subquery:

Perform an Uncorrelated Subquery with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$lookup` stage can execute a pipeline
on the joined collection, which allows uncorrelated subqueries. An
uncorrelated subquery does not reference the joined document fields.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/uncorrelated-subquery.rst

Create a collection ``absences`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.absences.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "student" : "Ann Aardvark", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-05-01"),new Date ("2018-08-23") ] },
      { "_id" : 2, "student" : "Zoe Zebra", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-02-01"),new Date ("2018-05-23") ] },
   ] )

Create another collection ``holidays`` with these documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.holidays.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, year: 2018, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2018-01-01") },
      { "_id" : 2, year: 2018, name: "Pi Day", date: new Date("2018-03-14") },
      { "_id" : 3, year: 2018, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2018-07-15") },
      { "_id" : 4, year: 2017, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2017-01-01") },
      { "_id" : 5, year: 2017, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2017-07-16") }
   ] )

The following operation joins the ``absences`` collection with 2018
holiday information from the ``holidays`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.absences.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup:
            {
              from: "holidays",
              pipeline: [
                 { $match: { year: 2018 } },
                 { $project: { _id: 0, date: { name: "$name", date: "$date" } } },
                 { $replaceRoot: { newRoot: "$date" } }
              ],
              as: "holidays"
            }
       }
   ] )

The operation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     student: 'Ann Aardvark',
     sickdays: [
       ISODate("2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
       ISODate("2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z")
     ],
     holidays: [
       { name: 'New Years', date: ISODate("2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z") },
       { name: 'Pi Day', date: ISODate("2018-03-14T00:00:00.000Z") },
       { name: 'Ice Cream Day', date: ISODate("2018-07-15T00:00:00.000Z")
       }
     ]
   },
   {
     _id: 2,
     student: 'Zoe Zebra',
     sickdays: [
       ISODate("2018-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
       ISODate("2018-05-23T00:00:00.000Z")
     ],
     holidays: [
       { name: 'New Years', date: ISODate("2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z") },
       { name: 'Pi Day', date: ISODate("2018-03-14T00:00:00.000Z") },
       { name: 'Ice Cream Day', date: ISODate("2018-07-15T00:00:00.000Z")
       }
     ]
   }

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, holidays
   FROM absences
   WHERE holidays IN (
      SELECT name, date
      FROM holidays
      WHERE year = 2018
   );

:ref:`Uncorrelated Subquery Performance Considerations <uncorrelated-subqueries-performance>`.

.. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery:

Perform a Concise Correlated Subquery with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, an aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$lookup`
stage supports a :ref:`concise correlated subquery syntax
<lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery>` that improves joins between
collections. The new concise syntax removes the requirement for an
equality match on the foreign and local fields inside of an
:query:`$expr` operator in a :pipeline:`$match` stage.

Create a collection ``restaurants``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.insertMany( [
      {
         _id: 1,
         name: "American Steak House",
         food: [ "filet", "sirloin" ],
         beverages: [ "beer", "wine" ]
      },
      {
         _id: 2,
         name: "Honest John Pizza",
         food: [ "cheese pizza", "pepperoni pizza" ],
         beverages: [ "soda" ]
      }
   ] )

Create another collection ``orders`` with food and optional drink
orders:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
      {
         _id: 1,
         item: "filet",
         restaurant_name: "American Steak House"
      },
      {
         _id: 2,
         item: "cheese pizza",
         restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
         drink: "lemonade"
      },
      {
         _id: 3,
         item: "cheese pizza",
         restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
         drink: "soda"
      }
   ] )

The following example:

- Joins the ``orders`` and ``restaurants`` collections by matching the
  ``orders.restaurant_name`` :ref:`localField
  <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-localField>` with the
  ``restaurants.name`` :ref:`foreignField
  <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery-foreignField>`. The match is
  performed before the ``pipeline`` is run.

- Performs an :expression:`$in` array match between the ``orders.drink``
  and ``restaurants.beverages`` fields that are accessed using
  ``$$orders_drink`` and ``$beverages`` respectively.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup: {
            from: "restaurants",
            localField: "restaurant_name",
            foreignField: "name",
            let: { orders_drink: "$drink" },
            pipeline: [ {
               $match: {
                  $expr: { $in: [ "$$orders_drink", "$beverages" ] }
               }
            } ],
            as: "matches"
         }
      }
   ] )

There is a match for the ``soda`` value in the ``orders.drink`` and
``restaurants.beverages`` fields. This output shows the ``matches``
array and contains all joined fields from the ``restaurants`` collection
for the match:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id" : 1, "item" : "filet",
      "restaurant_name" : "American Steak House",
      "matches" : [ ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2, "item" : "cheese pizza",
      "restaurant_name" : "Honest John Pizza",
      "drink" : "lemonade",
      "matches" : [ ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 3, "item" : "cheese pizza",
      "restaurant_name" : "Honest John Pizza",
      "drink" : "soda",
      "matches" : [ {
         "_id" : 2, "name" : "Honest John Pizza",
         "food" : [ "cheese pizza", "pepperoni pizza" ],
         "beverages" : [ "soda" ]
      } ]
   }

Before the introduction of concise correlated subqueries, you had to use
an :expression:`$eq` equality match between the local field and the
joined field in the :query:`$expr` operator in the ``pipeline``
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage as shown in :ref:`lookup-multiple-joins`.

This example uses the older verbose syntax from MongoDB versions before
5.0 and returns the same results as the previous concise example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate( [
      {
         $lookup: {
            from: "restaurants",
            let: { orders_restaurant_name: "$restaurant_name",
                   orders_drink: "$drink" },
            pipeline: [ {
               $match: { 
                  $expr: {
                     $and: [
                        { $eq: [ "$$orders_restaurant_name", "$name" ] },
                        { $in: [ "$$orders_drink", "$beverages" ] }
                     ]
                  }
               }
            } ],
            as: "matches"
         }
      }
   ] )

The previous examples correspond to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, matches
   FROM orders
   WHERE matches IN (
      SELECT *
      FROM restaurants
      WHERE restaurants.name = orders.restaurant_name
      AND restaurants.beverages = orders.drink
   );

:ref:`Correlated Subquery Performance Considerations <correlated-subqueries-performance>`.
