content: |
  If you haven't deployed a sharded cluster, follow the instructions to
  :ref:`deploy one <deploy-sharded-cluster>`.

  You must enable |tls| for the sharded cluster by configuring the 
  following settings:

  .. include:: /includes/list-tables/resource-keys-external-access-sharded.rst

ref: create-external-services-sharded

  file: steps-create-external-services.yaml

title: "Add Subject Alternate Names to your |tls| certificates."
level: 4
stepnum: 3
ref: add-san-to-cert-sharded
content: |

  Add each external |dns| name to the certificate |san-dns|.

  Each MongoDB host uses the following |san-dns|\s:

  .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: false

      <my-sharded-cluster>-<shard>-<pod-index>.<external-domain>
      <my-sharded-cluster>-config-<pod-index>.<external-domain>
      <my-sharded-cluster>-mongos-<pod-index>.<external-domain>
  
  The |mongos| instance uses the following |san-dns|:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false
     
     <my-sharded-cluster>-mongos-<pod-index>-svc-external.<external-domain>

  Configure the :setting:`spec.security.tls.additionalCertificateDomains` setting similar
  to the following example. Each |tls| certificate that you use must include the 
  corresponding |san-dns| for the shard, config server, or ``mongos`` instance.  
  The |k8s-op-short| validates your configuration. 

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :start-after: START-exposed-sharded-tls-full
      :end-before: END-exposed-sharded-tls-full

ref: verify-external-services-sc
title: Verify the external services.
content: |
  In your sharded cluster, run the following command to verify that 
  the |k8s-op-short| created the external services for your deployment.

  .. code-block:: sh

     $ kubectl get services

  The command returns a list of services similar to the following output.
  For each ``mongos`` instance in the cluster, the |k8s-op-short| creates an external service 
  named ``<pod-name>-<pod-idx>-svc-external``. This service is configured according to the values 
  and overrides you provide in the :ref:`external service specification 
  <spec-external-access-external-service>`.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     NAME                                              TYPE         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)           AGE
     <my-sharded-cluster>-mongos-0-svc-external    LoadBalancer   10.102.27.116  <lb-ip-or-fqdn>   27017:27017/TCP    8m30s
     <my-sharded-cluster>-mongos-1-svc-external    LoadBalancer   10.102.27.116  <lb-ip-or-fqdn>   27017:27017/TCP    8m30s
  
  Depending on your cluster configuration or cloud provider, the IP address of the 
  LoadBalancer service is an externally accessible IP address or |fqdn|. You can use 
  the IP address or |fqdn| to route traffic from your external domain. This example 
  has two ``mongos`` instances, therefore the |k8s-op-short| creates two external services.
