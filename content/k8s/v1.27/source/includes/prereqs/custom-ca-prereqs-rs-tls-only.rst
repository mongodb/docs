- Generate one |tls| certificate for each of the following components:

  - Your replica set. Ensure that you add |san-dns|\s for each |k8s| pod 
    that hosts a member of your replica set to the certificate. 

    In your |tls| certificate, the |san-dns| for each pod must use the 
    following format:

    .. include:: /includes/prereqs/san-format.rst

    .. important:: 
      
       .. include:: /includes/facts/fact-acme-provider-certs.rst
       
       To use an |acme| based certificate, you must configure 
       the certificate for your replica set resource. 
       To learn more, see the step about |acme| based |tls| 
       certificates in the :ref:`procedure <tls-for-replica-set>`.

  .. include:: /includes/prereqs/mdbagent-reqs.rst

- You must have the |certauth| certificate file and name it ``ca-pem``.
- You must have the key that you used to sign your |tls| certificates.

.. include:: /includes/prereqs/pem-format.rst
