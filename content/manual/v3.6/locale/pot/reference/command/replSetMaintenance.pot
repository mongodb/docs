msgid "When a node receives a ``replSetMaintenance: true`` request, it adds a maintenance mode task to a queue of tasks. If the queue of tasks was empty and now is not, the node will transition to ``RECOVERING`` state and begin to reject read requests. When a node receives a ``replSetMaintenance: false`` request, it removes a maintenance mode task from the queue (even if that task was initiated by a different client). If the request empties the maintenance mode task queue, the node will return to ``SECONDARY`` state."
