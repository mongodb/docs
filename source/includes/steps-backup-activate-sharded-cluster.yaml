content: |
  To select a storage engine or exclude namespaces is optional. If
  desired, you can select the following:

  :guilabel:`Storage Engine`: You can select a different storage engine
  for backing up the data than is used for storing the data.
  :guilabel:`MongoDB Memory Mapped` selects the MongoDB default ``MMAPV1``
  engine, and :guilabel:`WiredTiger` selects the 64-bit ``WiredTiger``
  engine available beginning with MongoDB 3.0. For more information on
  both, see :manual:`Storage </core/storage>` in the MongoDB manual.

  :guilabel:`Manage Excluded Namespaces`: Click :guilabel:`Manage Excluded
  Namespaces` and enter the databases and collections to exclude. For
  colletions, enter the full namespace: ``<database>.<collection>``. Click
  :guilabel:`Save`. You can later add or remove namespaces from the
  backup, as needed.
