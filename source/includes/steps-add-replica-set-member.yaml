ref: add-member
content: |
  Add the member by increasing the number of members in the
  :guilabel:`MongoDs Per Replica Set` field.

  You can configure the member as a normal replica set member, as a
  :manual:`hidden </core/replica-set-hidden-member>`, :manual:`delayed
  </core/replica-set-delayed-member>`, or :manual:`priority-0
  </core/replica-set-priority-0-member>` secondary, or as an
  :manual:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`.

  .. warning::

     If your replica set uses :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` (or
     :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`), you need to create and
     add the necessary :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` certificates
     to the new replica set member. Automation does not configure
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` for you. If you do not enable
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new member, you
     cannot add it to the existing :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets
     Layer)`-enabled replica set. To learn how to enable
     :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` on the new replica set member,
     see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.
