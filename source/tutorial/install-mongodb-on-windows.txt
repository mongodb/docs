Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB {+version+} |edition| Edition on
Windows using the default installation wizard.

MongoDB Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-install-past-mongodb.rst

Installation Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial installs MongoDB on Windows using the default MSI
installation wizard. You can also install MongoDB on Windows by these other 
methods:

- :ref:`Install MongoDB using msiexec.exe <install-mdb-community-windows-msiexec>`. 

- :ref:`Install MongoDB from the zip file <install-mdb-community-windows-zip>`


Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Shell, ``mongosh``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platform Support

Virtualization

Production Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-see-production-notes.rst

Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB logs diagnostic data to assist with troubleshooting. For
detailed information, see :ref:`Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture <ftdc-stub>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ftdc-windows-user-permissions.rst

Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install MongoDB |edition| Edition using the
MongoDB Installer wizard. The installation process installs both the
MongoDB binaries as well as the default :ref:`configuration file
<configuration-options>` :file:`<install
directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-windows-interactive.rst


Install ``mongosh``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.msi`` installer does not include :mongosh:`mongosh </>`. Follow
the :mongosh:`mongosh installation instructions </install>` to download
and install the shell separately.

If You Installed MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB service starts upon successful installation.

If you would like to customize the service, you must :ref:`stop the service 
<stop-mongodb-community-edition-windows-service>`. Customize the 
MongoDB instance by editing the configuration file at 
:file:`<install directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

For information about the available configuration options, refer to 
:ref:`configuration-options`.

After making changes, :ref:`start the service again 
<start-mongodb-community-edition-windows-service>`.

If You Did Not Install MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only installed the executables and did not install MongoDB as a
Windows service, you must manually start the MongoDB instance.

See :ref:`run-mongodb-from-cmd` for instructions to start a MongoDB
instance.

Run MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
--------------------------------------------------

You can install and configure MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` during 
installation. The MongoDB service starts upon successful installation. 
Configure the MongoDB instance with the configuration file
:file:`<install directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

If you have not already done so, follow the
:mongosh:`mongosh installation instructions </install>` to download and
install the MongoDB Shell (:mongosh:`mongosh </>`).

Be sure to add the path to your ``mongosh.exe`` binary to your
``PATH`` environment variable during installation.
  
Open a new :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` and enter ``mongosh.exe``
to connect to MongoDB.

For more information on connecting to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` using
:mongosh:`mongosh.exe </>`, such as connecting to a MongoDB instance
running on a different host and/or port, see
:mongosh:`Connect to a Deployment </connect>`.

For information on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
see:

- :ref:`write-op-insert`
- :ref:`read-operations-queries`
- :ref:`write-op-update`
- :ref:`write-op-delete`

.. _start-mongodb-community-edition-windows-service:

Start MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start/restart the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Start`.

.. _stop-mongodb-community-edition-windows-service:

Stop MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

Remove MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB

.. _run-mongodb-from-cmd:

Run MongoDB Community Edition from the Command Interpreter
----------------------------------------------------------

You can run MongoDB Community Edition from the Windows command 
prompt/interpreter (``cmd.exe``) instead of as a service.

Open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ 
(``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`.

.. important::

   You must open the command interpreter as an
   :guilabel:`Administrator`.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Localhost Binding by Default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-bind-ip-default-in-config.rst

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), the
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within its :ref:`release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 7.2.1 to 7.2.2).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 6.0 to 7.0) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your
System ``PATH`` you can omit the full path to the MongoDB Server
binaries. You should also add the path to :mongosh:`mongosh </>` if you
have not already done so.
