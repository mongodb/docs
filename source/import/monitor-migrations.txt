Monitor Migrations in Progress
------------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Migration Home` screen to review migrations in progress.
If there are migrations in progress or past migrations, they are listed at the top of the Migration Home page.

You can click on each migration process to see more information,
including a time estimate for the initial data copy and a detailed progress report.
To create, cutover, or cancel a migration, use the cluster card.

Cutover
-------

When a migration reaches the "Ready for Cutover" status,
click :guilabel:`Cutover on target cluster`
followed by the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover` on the cluster card to initiate the cutover process.
Once the cutover completes successfully, you may proceed to point your application to the new destination cluster.
