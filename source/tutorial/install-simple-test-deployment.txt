Install a Simple Test Ops Manager Installation
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

To evaluate |onprem|, you can quickly create a test installation by
installing the :ref:`mms-application-package` and
:ref:`mms-application-database` on a single server. This setup provides
all the functionality of |onprem| monitoring and automation but provides
**no** failover or high availability. This is **not** a production setup.

Unlike a production installation, the simple test installation uses only
one :program:`mongod` for the |application| database. In production, the
database requires a dedicated :term:`replica set`.

This procedure includes optional instructions to install |onprem| Backup,
in which case you would install the :ref:`backup-daemon` and :ref:`Backup
Blockstore database <mms-backup-blockstore-database>` on the same server
as the other |onprem| components. The Backup Blockstore database uses only
one :program:`mongod` and not a dedicated replica set, as it would in
production.

This procedure installs the test deployment on servers running either
**RHEL 6+** or **Amazon Linux**.
