  - ``/airbnb/listingsAndReviews/{bedrooms string}/{review_scores.review_scores_rating int}/``

    This path references the ``airbnb`` dataset, which contains the 
    vacation home listing details and customer reviews. To learn more 
    about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample AirBnB Listings Dataset 
    </sample-data/sample-airbnb>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``bedrooms`` field and ``review_scores.review_score_ratings`` 
    fields.

  - ``/analytics/accounts/{limit int}/``

    This path references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains data 
    for a typical finanacial services application. To learn more about 
    this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
    </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.accounts>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``limit`` field.

  - ``/analytics/customers/{birthdate isodate}/``

    This data references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains 
    collections for a typical finanacial services application. To learn 
    more about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
    </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.customers>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``birthdate`` field.

  - ``/analytics/transactions/{account_id int}/``

    This path references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains 
    data for a typical finanacial services application. To learn more 
    about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
    </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.transactions>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``account_id`` field.

  - ``/mflix/movies/{type string}/{year int}/``

    This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
    movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
    :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.movies>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``type`` and ``year`` fields.

  - ``/mflix/sessions.json``
  
    This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
    movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
    :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.sessions>`.

    This path does not contain any partition attributes and so, for 
    queries against data in the collection, {+dl+} searches all the 
    files in the collection.

  - ``/mflix/theaters/{theaterId string}/{location.address.zipcode string}/``

    This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
    movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
    :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.theaters>`.

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``theaterId`` and ``location.address.zipcode`` fields.

  - ``/mflix/users.json``

    This path references the ``mflix`` collection, which contains data 
    on movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
    :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset 
    </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.users>`.

    This path does not contain any partition attributes and so, for  
    queries against data in the collection, {+dl+} searches all the 
    files in the collection.

  - ``/nyc-yellow-cab-trips/{trip_start_isodate isodate}/{passenger_count int}/{fare_type string}/``

    The path references the ``nyc-yellow-cab-trips`` dataset, which 
    contains data on the trips, including trip date, fare, and number 
    of passengers. 

    For this path, {+dl+} utilizes partitions optimized for queries on 
    the ``trip_start_isodate``, ``passenger_count``, and ``fare_type`` 
    fields.
