Sharded Cluster Overview
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Sharding is MongoDB’s approach to scaling out. Sharding partitions a
collection and stores the different portions on different machines. When
a database's collections become too large for existing storage, you need only add a
new machine. Sharding automatically distributes collection data to
the new server.

Sharding automatically balances data and load across machines. Sharding
provides additional write capacity by distributing the write load over a
number of :program:`mongod` instances. Sharding allows users to increase
the potential amount of data in the :term:`working set`.

Sharding
--------

Sharding occurs within a :term:`sharded cluster`. A sharded cluster
consists of the following components:

- **Shards**. A shard is a container that holds a
  subset of a collection’s data. Each shard is either a single
  :program:`mongod` instance or a :term:`replica set`. In production,
  all shards should be replica sets.

  Applications do not access shards directly but instead access
  :ref:`mongos instances <sharding-mongos>`.

- **Config servers**. Each :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`
  is a :program:`mongod` instance that holds metadata about the cluster.
  The metadata maps :term:`chunks <chunk>` to shards.

- **mongos instances**. The :ref:`mongos instances <sharding-mongos>`
  route the reads and writes from applications to the shards.
  Applications do not access the shards directly.

Within a sharded cluster, you enable sharding on a per-database basis.
When you enable sharding on a database, MongoDB distributes the collections
across the shards. MongoDB does not yet distribute data within a collection.

After enabling sharding for a database, you choose which collections to
shard. For each sharded collection, you specify a :term:`shard key`.

To set up a sharded cluster, see :ref:`sharding-procedure-setup`.

Shard Keys
----------

The shard key determines the distribution of the collection's
:term:`documents <document>` among the cluster's :term:`shards <shard>`.
The shard key is a :term:`field` that exists in every document in the
collection. MongoDB distributes documents according to ranges of values
in the shard key. A given shard holds documents for which the shard key
falls within a specific range of values. Shard keys, like :term:`indexes
<index>`, can be either a single field or multiple fields.

Within a shard, MongoDB further partitions documents into :term:`chunks
<chunk>`. Each chunk represents a smaller range of values within the
shard's range. When a chunk grows beyond the :ref:`chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB :term:`splits <split>` the chunk into
smaller chunks, always based on ranges in the shard key.

To select a shard key, see :doc:`\tutorial\select-shard-key`.

Hashed Sharding
---------------

.. versionadded:: 2.4

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-shard-key-internals>` use a
:ref:`hashed index <index-hashed-index>` of a single field as the
:term:`shard key` to partition data across your sharded cluster.

The field you choose as your hashed shard key should have a good
cardinality, or large number of different values. Hashed keys work
well with fields that increase monotonically like :term:`ObjectId`
values or timestamps.

If you shard an empty collection using a hashed
shard key, MongoDB will automatically create and migrate chunks so
that each shard has two chunks.  You can control how many chunks
MongoDB will create with the ``numInitialChunks`` parameter to
:dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

To shard a collection using a hashed shark key, see
:doc:`\tutorial\select-hashed-shard-key`.

.. index:: balancing
.. _sharding-balancing:

Shard Balancing
---------------

Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to redistribute data within a
:term:`sharded cluster`. When a :term:`shard` has too many
:term:`chunks <chunk>` when compared to other shards, MongoDB
automatically balances the shards. MongoDB balances the shards without
intervention from the application layer.

The balancing process attempts to minimize the impact that balancing can
have on the cluster, by:

- Moving only one chunk at a time.

- Initiating a balancing round **only** when the difference in the number of
  chunks between the shard with the greatest number and the shard with the
  lowest exceeds the :ref:`migration threshold
  <sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

You may disable the balancer on a temporary basis for
maintenance and limit the window during which it runs to prevent the
balancing process from impacting production traffic.

To disable the balancer, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporally`.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer`.

.. note::

   The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
   is entirely transparent to the user and application layer. This
   documentation is only included for your edification and possible
   troubleshooting purposes.

When to Use Sharding
--------------------

While sharding is a powerful and compelling feature, it comes with
significant infrastructure requirements
and some limited complexity costs. As a result, use
sharding only as necessary and when indicated by actual operational
requirements.

You should consider deploying a :term:`sharded cluster` if:

- your data set approaches or exceeds the storage capacity of a single
  node in your system.

- the size of your system's active :term:`working set` *will soon*
  exceed the capacity of the *maximum* amount of RAM for your system.

- your system has a large amount of write activity, a single
  MongoDB instance cannot write data fast enough to meet demand, and
  all other approaches have not reduced contention.

If these attributes are not present in your system, sharding will only
add additional complexity to your system without providing much
benefit. When designing your data model, if you will eventually need a
sharded cluster, consider which collections you will want to shard and
the corresponding shard keys.

.. _sharding-capacity-planning:

.. warning::

   It takes time and resources to deploy sharding, and if your system
   has *already* reached or exceeded its capacity, you will have a
   difficult time deploying sharding without impacting your
   application.

   As a result, if you think you will need to partition your database
   in the future, **do not** wait until your system is overcapacity to
   enable sharding.
