==========================================================
Migrate an Existing Collection to a Time Series Collection
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In this tutorial, you can learn how to convert an existing MongoDB
collection to a **time series collection** using the {+mkc+}.

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements
over a period of time. Time series data consists of measurement data collected
over time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

You can configure the source connector to read your existing MongoDB
collection and the sink connector to write Kafka topic data into a MongoDB
time series collection.

To learn more about MongoDB time series collections, see the MongoDB
manual page on :manual:`Time Series Collections </core/timeseries-collections/>`.

Scenario
--------

Suppose you accumulated stock price data in a MongoDB collection and have
the following needs:

- More efficient storage of the price data
- Maintain the ability to analyze stock performance over time using
  aggregation operators

After reading about MongoDB time series collections, you decide to migrate
your existing collection into a time series one. Learn how to perform this
migration in the following sections.

Steps to Migrate to a Time Series Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To migrate an existing MongoDB collection to a time series collection, you
need to perform the following tasks:

1) :ref:`Identify the time field <time-series-identify-field>` in the existing
   stock price data document.
2) :ref:`Configure a source connector <time-series-source-config>` to copy
   the existing collection data to a Kafka topic.
3) :ref:`Configure a sink connector <time-series-sink-config>` to copy the
   Kafka topic data to the time series collection.
4) :ref:`Verify the connector migrated the data <time-series-verify-collection>` to the time
   series collection.

.. _time-series-identify-field:

Identify the Time Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you create a time series collection, you need to identify the
**time field**. The time field is the document field that MongoDB uses to
distinguish the time of the measurement. The value of this field can be
a string, integer, or ISO date. Make sure to set the
``timeseries.timefield.auto.convert`` setting to instruct the connector to
automatically convert the value to a date.

The following document shows the format of stock price data documents in
the existing MongoDB collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
  :copyable: false

   {
     tx_time: 2021-07-12T05:20:35Z,
     symbol: 'WSV',
     company_name: 'WORRIED SNAKEBITE VENTURES',
     price: 21.22,
     _id: ObjectId("...")
   }

For this scenario, assume you stored these documents in a collection named
``PriceData`` in the ``Stocks`` database.

You identify that the ``tx_time`` field distinguishes the time of the
measurements, and specify it as your time field in your sink connector
configuration.

Learn how to set your time field and field conversion in the
:ref:`time series configuration guide <time-series-sink-config>`.

.. _time-series-source-config:

Configure the Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To copy data from the ``PriceData`` MongoDB collection data and publish it
to the ``marketdata.Stocks.PriceData`` Kafka topic, create a source
connector with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "mongo-source-marketdata",
     "config": {
       "tasks.max":"1",
       "connector.class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
       "key.converter":"org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
       "value.converter":"org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
       "publish.full.document.only":"true",
       "connection.uri":"<your connection uri>",
       "topic.prefix":"marketdata",
       "database":"Stocks",
       "collection":"PriceData",
       "copy.existing":"true"
   }}

.. note::

   If you insert documents into a collection during the copying process,
   the connector inserts them after the process is complete.

After you start your source connector with the preceding configuration,
the connector starts the copying process. Once the process is complete,
you should see the following message in the log:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Finished copying existing data from the collection(s).

Your data from the ``PriceData`` MongoDB collection is now available in
the ``marketdata.Stocks.PriceData`` Kafka topic.

.. _time-series-sink-config:

Configure the Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To consume data from the ``marketdata.Stocks.PriceData`` Kafka topic and write
it to a time series collection named ``StockDataMigrate`` in a database
named ``Stocks``, you can create the following source connector configuration:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 12-14

   {
     "name": "mongo-sink-marketdata",
     "config": {
      "connector.class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector",
       "tasks.max":"1",
       "topics":"marketdata.Stocks.PriceData",
       "connection.uri":"<your connection uri>",
       "database":"Stocks",
       "collection":"StockDataMigrate",
       "key.converter":"org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
       "value.converter":"org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
       "timeseries.timefield":"tx_time",
       "timeseries.timefield.auto.convert":"true",
       "timeseries.timefield.auto.convert.date.format":"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"
    }}

.. tip::

   The sink connector configuration above uses the time field date
   format converter. Alternatively, you can use the ``TimestampConverter``
   Single Message Transform (SMT) to convert the ``tx_time`` field from a
   ``String`` to an ``ISODate``. When using the ``TimestampConverter`` SMT,
   you must define a schema for the data in the Kafka topic.

   For information on how to use the ``TimestampConverter`` SMT, see the
   `TimestampConverter <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/transforms/timestampconverter.html#timestampconverter>`__
   Confluent documentation.

After your sink connector finishes processing the topic data, the documents
in the ``StockDataMigrate`` time series collection contain the ``tx_time``
field with an ``ISODate`` type value.

.. _time-series-verify-collection:

Verify the Collection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By this step, your time series collection should contain all the market data
from your ``PriceData`` collection. The following shows the format of the
documents in the ``StockDataMigrate`` time series collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    tx_time: 2021-07-12T20:05:35.000Z,
    symbol: 'WSV',
    company_name: 'WORRIED SNAKEBITE VENTURES',
    price: 21.22,
    _id: ObjectId("...")
  }

To learn how to verify a collection is of type **timeseries**, see the
instructions on how to :manual:`Check if a Collection is of Type Time Series </core/timeseries-collections/#check-if-a-collection-is-of-type-time-series>`
in the MongoDB manual.
