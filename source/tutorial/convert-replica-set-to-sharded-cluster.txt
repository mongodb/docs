|mms| provides the ability to convert a :term:`replica set` to
a :term:`sharded cluster`.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-to-sharded-cluster.rst

Converting a replica set to a sharded cluster does not shard any of your
collections and databases. You need to shard the collection yourself.
See :ref:`convert-shard-collection` for instructions on how to shard any
collections on the converted sharded cluster.
   
If you need to add additional shards to support greater capacity, click
on the wrench menu for the sharded cluster to create additional shards.
