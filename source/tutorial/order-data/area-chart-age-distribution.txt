Purpose
-------

In the final chart of the dashboard, highlight some of
the customer analytic information available in the schema. By
visualizing the age range and distribution of store customers, you can
ensure that any advertising the store performs is directed where it
will be seen by the most potential buyers.

Wrapping Up
-----------

You now have an effective orders dashboard which provides easily
accessible insight into revenue data, sales details, and customer
analytics. However, with the information you have available in your
dataset, there are several ways in which you might be able to
add additional charts and extend the dashboard even further. You may
want to depict:

- Average customer satisfaction by store location

- The amount of money that customers in various age groups typically
  spend on a purchase

- Which items are most commonly bought in bulk, utilizing the
  ``items.quantity`` field

Try adding some of these additional charts to the dashboard and see
what other interesting correlations between variables you can discover.
