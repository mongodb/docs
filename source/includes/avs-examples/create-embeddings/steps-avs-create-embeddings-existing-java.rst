.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Define code to generate embeddings from an existing collection in |service|.

      Create a file named ``CreateEmbeddings.java`` and paste the following code.

      This code uses the ``getEmbeddings`` method and the MongoDB :driver:`Java Sync Driver </java/sync/>`
      to do the following:

      a. Connect to your |service| {+cluster+}.

      #. Get a subset of documents from the
         ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection that
         have a non-empty ``summary`` field.

      #. Generate embeddings from each document's ``summary`` field
         using the ``getEmbeddings`` method that you defined previously.

      #. Update each document with a new ``embeddings`` field
         that contains the embedding value.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs-examples/tutorial/CreateEmbeddingsExisting.java
         :language: java
         :caption: CreateEmbeddings.java

   .. step:: Generate the embeddings.

      Save and run the file. The output resembles:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs-examples/tutorial/output-create-embeddings-existing-java.sh
         :language: shell

      You can also view your vector embeddings in the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+}
      <atlas-ui-view-collections>` by navigating to the
      ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews``
      collection in your {+cluster+}.
