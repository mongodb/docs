Set expressions performs set operation on arrays, treating arrays as
sets. Set expressions ignores the duplicate entries in each input array
and the order of the elements.

If the set operation returns a set, the operation filters out
duplicates in the result to output an array that contains only unique
entries. The order of the elements in the output array is unspecified.
