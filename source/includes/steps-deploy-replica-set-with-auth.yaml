title: Copy the key file to each member of the replica set.
stepnum: 2
ref: copy-key-file
content: |
  Copy the ``mongodb-keyfile`` to all hosts where components of a
  MongoDB deployment run. Set the permissions of these files to
  ``600`` so that only the *owner* of the file can read or write this
  file to prevent other users on the system from accessing the shared
  secret.
---
title: Start each member of the replica set with the appropriate options.
stepnum: 3
ref: start-mongod
pre: |
  For each member, start a :program:`mongod` and specify the key file and
  the name of the replica set. Also specify other parameters as needed for
  your deployment. For replication-specific parameters, see
  :ref:`cli-mongod-replica-set` required by your deployment.

      The following example specifies parameters through the :option:`--keyFile`
      and :option:`--replSet` command-line options:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongod --keyFile /mysecretdirectory/keyfile --replSet "rs0"
  - pre: |
      The following example specifies parameters through a configuration file:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongod --config $HOME/.mongodb/config

  In production deployments, you can configure a :term:`control script` to
  manage this process. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

title: Connect to one of the replica set members.
stepnum: 4

  Connect to one of the instances using the :ref:`localhost exception
  <localhost-exception>`.

pre: |
  Add the user administrator with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role, and
  only that role.

  You must issue the following operation while connected to the
  :term:`primary` using the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`.

title: Create additional users to address operational requirements.
stepnum: 10
ref: create-records-db-owner
pre: |
  You can use :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` to create
  common types of database users, such as the :authrole:`dbOwner` role to
  create a database administrator, the :authrole:`readWrite` role to
  create a user who can update data, or the :authrole:`read` role to
  create user who can search data but no more. You also can define
  :ref:`custom roles <user-defined-roles>`.
action:
  pre: |
    For example, the following creates a database administrator for the
    ``products`` database:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use products
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "productsDBAdmin",
        pwd: "password",
        roles:
        [
          {
            role: "dbOwner",
            db: "products"
          }
        ]
      }
    )
