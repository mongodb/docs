.. dbcommand:: writeBacksQueued

   :dbcommand:`writeBacksQueued` is an internal command that returns
   a document reporting there are operations in the write back queue 
   for the given :program:`mongos` and information about the queues.

   .. data:: writeBacksQueued.hasOpsQueued

      Boolean.

      :data:`~writeBacksQueued.hasOpsQueued` is ``true`` if there are ``write Back``
      operations queued.

   .. data:: writeBacksQueued.totalOpsQueued

      Integer. 

      :data:`~writeBacksQueued.totalOpsQueued` reflects the number of operations queued.

   .. data:: writeBacksQueued.queues 

      Document. 

      :data:`~writeBacksQueued.queues` holds a sub-document where the fields are all
      write back queues. These field hold a document with two fields
      that reports on the state of the queue. The fields in these
      documents are: 

      .. data:: writeBacksQueued.queues.n
                
         :data:`~writeBacksQueued.queues.n` reflects the size, by number of items, in
         the queues.

      .. data:: writeBacksQueued.queues.minutesSinceLastCall

         The number of minutes since the last time the
         :program:`mongos` touched this queue. 

   The command document has the following prototype form: 
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      {writeBacksQueued: 1}

   To call :dbcommand:`writeBacksQueued` from the :program:`mongo`
   shell, use the following :method:`db.runCommand()` form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand({writeBacksQueued: 1})

   Consider the following example output: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
      	"hasOpsQueued" : true,
      	"totalOpsQueued" : 7,
      	"queues" : {
      		"50b4f09f6671b11ff1944089" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 1 },
      		"50b4f09fc332bf1c5aeaaf59" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 0 },
      		"50b4f09f6671b1d51df98cb6" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 0 },
      		"50b4f0c67ccf1e5c6effb72e" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 0 },
      		"50b4faf12319f193cfdec0d1" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 4 },
      		"50b4f013d2c1f8d62453017e" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 0 },
      		"50b4f0f12319f193cfdec0d1" : { "n" : 0, "minutesSinceLastCall" : 1 }
      	},
      	"ok" : 1
      }

.. The queue ids are BSON ObjectIds, they correspond to the
   mongos that has talked to this shard. This is derived from the
   "serverID" field of the setShardVersion command the mongos
   sends to the shard
