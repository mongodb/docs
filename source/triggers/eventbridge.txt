Send Trigger Events to AWS EventBridge
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB offers an `AWS Eventbridge
<https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/>`_ partner event source that lets
you send :doc:`trigger </triggers>` events to an event bus instead of
calling a function. You can configure any trigger to send events to
EventBridge.

All you need to send trigger events to EventBridge is an AWS account ID.
This guide walks through finding your account ID, configuring the
trigger, and associating the trigger event source with an event bus.
