Starting in v6.0, the MongoDB :pipeline:`$lookup` aggregation stage 
supports :pipeline:`$search` inside the :pipeline:`$lookup` 
``pipeline`` option. Using :pipeline:`$lookup`, you can join 
collections in the same database at query-time and run a 
:pipeline:`$search` query to further narrow down your search.

.. note:: 

   :pipeline:`$lookup` queries are not very performant because |fts| 
   does a full document lookup on the database for each document in the 
   collection.

This tutorial demonstrates how to run a :pipeline:`$lookup` query 
with :pipeline:`$search` against the ``accounts`` and ``customers`` 
collections in the ``sample_analytics`` database. It takes you through 
the following steps:

1. Set up an |fts| index with dynamic mapping for the ``accounts`` 
   collection in the ``sample_analytics`` database.
#. Run :pipeline:`$lookup` query with :pipeline:`$search` to find 
   customers from the ``customers`` collections whose accounts have 
   purchased both ``CurrencyService`` and ``InvestmentStock`` products 
   in the ``accounts`` collection.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| cluster meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`.

.. note:: 

   To run :pipeline:`$lookup` query with :pipeline:`$search`, your 
   cluster must run MongoDB v6.0 or higher.

Create the |fts| Index  
----------------------

In this section, you will create an |fts| index named ``default`` on 
all the fields in the ``sample_analytics.accounts`` collection.

Run ``$lookup`` with ``$search`` to Search the Collections 
----------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you will connect to your |service| cluster and run the 
sample query against the indexed collections in the 
``sample_analytics`` database.
