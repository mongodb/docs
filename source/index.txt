MongoDB Connector for BI
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

About the |bi|
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows users to
create queries with SQL and visualize, graph, and report on their
MongoDB Enterprise data using existing relational business intelligence
tools such as :doc:`Tableau </connect/tableau>`,
:doc:`MicroStrategy </connect/microstrategy>`, and
:doc:`Qlik </connect/qlik>`.

.. note::

   As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and the
   |bi-short|, you can use `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/charts>`__
   to create data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections.

The |bi| acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a
:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` or
:manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/>` instance and your
reporting tool. The |bi-short| stores no data, and purely serves to
bridge your MongoDB cluster with business intelligence tools.

System Components
-----------------

A complete BI system includes the following components:

- **MongoDB database:** Data storage.
- **BI Connector:** Provides a relational schema and translates SQL
  queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.
- **ODBC data source name (DSN):**
  Holds authentication and connection configuration data.
- **BI Tool:** Data visualization and analysis.

Most BI tools can import data from a :doc:`DSN
</tutorial/create-system-dsn>`. Setting up a DSN which
points to your |bi-short| instance allows you to use a wide range of
BI tools and SQL clients with a single data source configuration.

Your BI tool and your DSN always run on your local desktop, but your
database and your |bi-short| instance
may be local, on premises, or hosted. The following sections
describe possible configurations for a BI system.

Hosted Database and |bi-short|
------------------------------

.. note::

    If you don’t want to install and manage the |bi-short|, you can use MongoDB
    Atlas, our fully-managed database-as-a-service. Databases hosted on Atlas
    natively support the |bi| and make it easy to start analyzing your data
    with your preferred BI tools. `Create an Atlas cluster to get started
    <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/general?utm_source=bi-connector&utm_campaign=20-docs-in-20-days&utm_medium=docs>`_.

In this scenario, the database and |bi-short|
applications both run on Atlas, and you set up your
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>` with connection information
provided by Atlas.

Hosted Database and On Premises |bi-short|
------------------------------------------

If you have an Atlas deployment smaller than M10 (including the Atlas
`free tier <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/>`_), or if
your MongoDB instance is not hosted on Atlas, you can run |bi-short|
locally and specify a remote database address with the
:option:`--mongo-uri <mongosqld --mongo-uri>` option when you start
the BI Connector's
:doc:`mongosqld process </reference/mongosqld>`.

On Premises Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------------

Your organization may have installations of both MongoDB and |bi-short|
elsewhere on your network, in which case you can set up your
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>` to point to the |bi-short|
server address.

Local Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------

For testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run
MongoDB and |bi-short| on your desktop. This is the simplest
configuration, perfect for quickly looking over the possibilities
for data visualization with |bi-short|.

in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </local-quickstart>`.
