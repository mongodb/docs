"MongoDB can use any valid SSL certificate issued by a certificate "
"authority or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed "
"certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted, there"
" will be *no* validation of server identity. Although such a situation "
"will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you vulnerable to"
" a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by a trusted "
"certificate authority will permit MongoDB drivers to verify the server's "
"identity."
