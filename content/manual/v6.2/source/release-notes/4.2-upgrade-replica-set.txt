Read Concern Majority (3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB enables support for
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern by default.

You can disable read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` to prevent the
storage cache pressure from immobilizing a three-member replica set
with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded
cluster with a three-member PSA shards.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-majority-rc-rollbacks.rst

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-disable-rc-majority.rst
   
   When upgraded to 4.2 with read concern "majority" disabled, you can
   use change streams for your deployment.

For more information, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Change Stream Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 uses the version 1 (i.e. ``v1``) change streams
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`, introduced in
version 4.0.7.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.2-greater.rst

.. important:: When upgrading from MongoDB 4.0.6 or earlier to MongoDB |newversion|


   During the upgrade process, a client may try to resume change
   streams using the new ``v1`` resume token when connected to a member
   that has not been updated (i.e. only accepts ``v0`` token) and
   fail. In such cases, the client must wait for the |newversion|
   upgrade to complete before resuming change streams.

Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All replica set members must be running version |oldversion|. To
upgrade a replica set from an |olderseries| and earlier, *first*
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
4.0-series release </release-notes/4.0-upgrade-replica-set>`, and
then follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to
|newversion|.

MMAPv1 to WiredTiger Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 removes support for the deprecated MMAPv1 storage engine.

If your 4.0 deployment uses MMAPv1, you must change the 4.0 deployment
to :doc:`/core/wiredtiger` before upgrading to MongoDB 4.2. For details,
see :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`.

Increase Open Files ``ulimit`` Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |ulimit| replace:: :ref:`ulimit <ulimit>`

.. include:: /includes/4.2-changes/open-file-connection-increase.rst

Review Current Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With MongoDB 4.2, the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` and
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes will not start with
:ref:`4.2-mmapv1-conf-options`. Previous versions of MongoDB running
WiredTiger ignored MMAPv1 configurations options if they were specified.
With MongoDB 4.2, you must remove these from your configuration.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| replica set must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.0``.

To ensure that all members of the replica set have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.0``, connect to each
replica set member and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the primary. A majority of the data-bearing
members must be available:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
:replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a
"rolling" upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available.
