               indexing the collection data with the ``"analyzer":`` 
               setting. By default, |fts| uses the :ref:`standard 
               <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer 
               (``"lucene.standard"``).

               parsing data for the |fts| queries with the 
               ``"searchAnalyzer":`` setting. By default, |fts|

             - Specify dynamic or static mapping of fields. To disable 
               dynamic mapping, set ``"dynamic":`` to ``false``. 
               By default, dynamic mapping is enabled. If you disable 
               dynamic mapping, you must specify the fields to index. 
               To learn more about dynamic and static mappings, see

             - Required if dynamic mapping is disabled.
        
               To add the fields to index, you must specify the 
               following settings for each field:
        
               - Field name.
               - Static or dynamic mapping using the ``"dynamic":`` 
                 setting. If you set the value of ``"dynamic":`` 
                 to ``false``, none of the |bson| data in the field 
                 will be automatically indexed.
               - Field data type. Specify the ``"type":`` setting. To 
                 learn more about the available data types and their 
                 options, see :ref:`bson-data-chart` and

     Larger collections take longer to index. You will receive an email
     notification when your index is finished building.
