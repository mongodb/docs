======================================
Modify Chunk Size in a Sharded Cluster
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When the first :program:`mongos` connects to a set of :term:`config
servers <config database>`, it initializes the sharded cluster with a
default chunk size of 64 megabytes. This default chunk size works well
for most deployments; however, if you notice that automatic migrations
have more I/O than your hardware can handle, you may want to reduce the
chunk size. For automatic splits and migrations, a small chunk size
leads to more rapid and frequent migrations.

To modify the chunk size, use the following procedure:

#. Connect to any :program:`mongos` in the cluster using the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Issue the following :method:`~db.collection.save()` operation to
   store the global chunk size configuration value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.save( { _id:"chunksize", value: <sizeInMB> } )

.. note::

   The :setting:`chunkSize` and
   :option:`--chunkSize <mongos --chunkSize>`
   options, passed at runtime to the :program:`mongos`,
   **do not** affect the chunk size after you have initialized the
   cluster.

   To avoid confusion, *always* set the chunk size using the above
   procedure instead of the runtime options.

Modifying the chunk size has several limitations:

- Automatic splitting only occurs on insert or update.

- If you lower the chunk size, it may take time for all chunks to split to
  the new size.

- Splits cannot be undone.

- If you increase the chunk size, existing chunks grow only through
  insertion or updates until they reach the new size.
