The version of your existing |onprem| installation determines the
upgrade path you must take to upgrade to Ops Manager 4.2 or later.

.. important::

   - To ensure a successful upgrade, you *must*:

     - Follow the upgrade path for your existing version to perform
       necessary database migrations.

     - Upgrade versions in chronological order. Your new release
       :ref:`must have been released after <om-upgrade-con-release-date>`
       the version you are upgrading.

   - To protect your data, |onprem| refuses to start direct upgrades
     from versions 1.8.x and 2.0.x to version 3.4 or later.

   - To upgrade :doc:`high availability environments </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability>`,
     you must shut down every |onprem| application server before
     starting any |onprem| application servers upgraded to the new
     version.
