   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`Name`

        - A name for the blockstore

      * - :guilabel:`Datastore Type` drop-down menu

        - 
  
          - If you select :guilabel:`Standalone`, then type the hostname
            and port number of the MongoDB instance.
 
          - If you select :guilabel:`Replica Set`, then type a comma-separated
            list of :program:`mongod` instances in the ``<hostname:port>``
            format in :guilabel:`MongoDB Host List`. This can be a :ref:`seed
            list <replica-set-option>`, but you should try to include
            all `mongod` instances in the replica set. 

            .. note::
               Make sure you have a current list of replica set members for
               your replica sets.

          - If you select :guilabel:`Sharded Cluster`, then type a
            comma-separated list of :program:`mongos` instances in the
            ``<hostname:port>`` format in :guilabel:`MongoDB Host List`.

      * - :guilabel:`Username` (Optional)

        - If the database uses authentication, type the name of the user
          that can access the blockstore database.

      * - :guilabel:`Password` (Optional)

        - If the database uses authentication, type the password
          associated with the username that can access the blockstore
          database.

      * - :guilabel:`Connection Options` 

        - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options </reference/configuration-options>`
          for the MongoDB instance. This field supports unescaped values only.

          For proper syntax, see :manual:`Connection String URI
          Format </reference/connection-string>` in the MongoDB manual.

      * - :guilabel:`Use SSL` checkbox (Optional)

        - If the database uses SSL, select this checkbox.

      * - :guilabel:`New Assignment Enabled` (Optional)

        - If you want to enable the blockstore immediately after it has
          been created, select this checkbox. If you leave this cleared,
          the blockstore is created but no newly started backups can be
          assigned to it.
