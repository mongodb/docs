This page explains how to interpret diagrams created in the Relational
Migrator. Each diagram is comprised of two views, one for your
relational database and one for your MongoDB database. The views show
the relationships between entities in your databases.

Relational View
---------------

In the relational view, each box represents a table in your
relational database. The box title indicates the table name.

Each box lists the columns in the corresponding table. For each column,
the box indicates the column name and its data type.

Some columns have icons to indicate their role within the table:

- A key icon indicates the table's primary key.

- A link icon indicates a foreign key.

MongoDB View
------------

In the MongoDB view, each box represents a collection in your
MongoDB database. The box title indicates the collection name.

Each box lists the fields in the corresponding collection. For each
field, the box indicates the field name and its data type.

If a collection contains embedded documents or arrays, those fields are
shown in-line in the same collection.

Some fields have icons to indicate their role within the table:

- A key icon indicates the collection's ``_id`` field. When you use the
  ``wrapped`` key handling strategy, the ``_id`` field contains
  sub-fields. In this case, the box contains multiple key icons which
  apply to a single field.

- A link icon indicates that the field maps to a relational column used
  in a foreign key.

Choose View Mode
----------------

Relational Migrator provides different diagram view modes:
Horizontal Split, Vertical Split, Relational view, and MongoDB view.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - View Mode
     - Description

   * - Horizontal Split
     - Displays the relational view on top and the MongoDB view is on
       the bottom. When you create a new project, Horizontal Split is
       the default view mode.

   * - Vertical Split
     - Displays the relational view on the left and the MongoDB view on
       the right. 

   * - Relational View
     - Displays only your relational database diagram.

   * - MongoDB View
     - Displays only your MongoDB database diagram.

To switch view modes, click a view mode option in the left navigation
bar:

Color Coding
------------

Entities in the diagram are color-coded based on whether they represent
the relational or MongoDB database:

- Entities with pink highlights are relational tables.

- Entities with green highlights are MongoDB collections.

Entity Links
------------

The lines between boxes represent the relationships that connect
database entities. If two boxes are connected, the corresponding
entities are linked with a foreign key. The lines may show the following
features of relationships:

- A small bar across a relationship link indicates a one-to-one
  relationship between entities.

- A prong (or "crow's feet") indicates "many" in the relationship.

Undo or Redo Diagram Actions
----------------------------

Relational Migrator diagrams support undo and redo functions. To reverse 
or reapply the previous diagram action, use the undo or redo capability. 
You can use either the diagram toolbar or keyboard shortcuts to perform 
these actions.

Toolbar
~~~~~~~

You can use the :icon-lg:`Undo` and :icon-lg:`Redo` buttons on the 
diagram toolbar:

   :alt: Toolbar undo and redo buttons

Keyboard Shortcut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can use keyboard shortcuts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function 
     - Windows Shortcut
     - Mac Shortcut 

   * - Undo
     - :kbd:`Control` + :kbd:`Z` 
     - :kbd:`Command` + :kbd:`Z`

   * - Redo
     - :kbd:`Control` + :kbd:`Y` 
     - :kbd:`Command` + :kbd:`Y`

Relational and MongoDB View Links
---------------------------------

When you click a box in either the relational or MongoDB view, the
Relational Migrator highlights the corresponding entity in the opposite
view. This allows you to see how your relational tables and MongoDB
collections are mapped to one another.

Examples
--------

The following example shows a sample diagram for a database that
tracks orders at a store.

Relational View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This relational view shows the relationship of several tables within a
relational database:

.. image:: /img/diagrams/relational-diagram.png
   :alt: Relational Diagram Example


The view shows the following relationships:


- In the ``Order`` table, ``OrderID`` is the primary key. ``CustomerID`` and
  ``OrderStatusID`` are foreign keys. The ``Customer`` and ``OrderStatus``
  tables contain the references for these foreign keys, respectively.


  - ``Order`` to ``Customer`` and ``Order`` to ``OrderStatus`` are both
    many-to-one relationships:


    - A customer can have multiple orders, and each order only applies
      to a single customer. In this example, Order is the parent and
      Customer is the child.

    - An order status can apply to multiple orders, and each order only
      has a single order status. In this example, Order is the parent
      and OrderStatus is the child.

- In the ``OrderLine`` table, ``OrderLineID`` is the primary key. ``OrderID``
  and ``ProductID`` are foreign keys. The ``Order`` and ``Product`` tables
  contain the references for these foreign keys, respectively.


  - ``OrderLine`` to ``Order`` and ``OrderLine`` to ``Product`` are both
    many-to-one relationships:


    - An order line is an individual transaction within an order. An
      order can have multiple order lines, and each order line applies
      to a single order. In this example, OrderLine is the parent and
      Order is the child.

    - A product can apply to multiple order lines, and each order line
      contains a single product. In this example, OrderLine is the parent
      and Product is the child.

MongoDB View
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This MongoDB view corresponds to the previous Relational view:


.. image:: /img/diagrams/mongodb-diagram-2.png
   :alt: MongoDB Diagram Example


The collections and data types presented in the view reflect the
mapping rules specified for the project.

The link icons indicate fields which map to a relational column used in a
foreign key. For example, in the ``Order`` collection, the ``OrderStatusID``
field represents a foreign key that links the ``Order`` and ``OrderStatus``
tables.

New Mapping Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following new mapping rules have been created to better utilize
MongoDB's embedded data model:


- The ``Order`` collection contains a rule that maps ``OrderLines`` as
  an :ref:`Embedded array <rm-embedded-array>`. The
  ``OrderLine`` table from the relational schema is mapped as an array
  of objects inside the ``Order`` documents, using the foreign key
  relationship from the relational schema.

  .. image:: /img/diagrams/order-mapping-example.png
     :alt: Order Mapping Rule Example

- The ``Customer`` collection contains a rule which maps ``Orders`` as
  an :ref:`Embedded array <rm-embedded-array>`. The ``Order``
  table from the relational schema is mapped as an array of objects
  inside the ``Customer`` documents, using the foreign key relationship
  from the relational schema.

  .. image:: /img/diagrams/customer-mapping-example.png
     :alt: Customer Mapping Rule Example

Both of the preceding mapping rules remove the ID fields from the
mapping. Since the ``OrderLines`` and ``Orders`` fields are embedded in
their parent fields rather than being referenced with a foreign key, the
ID fields are not required to link the fields together.
