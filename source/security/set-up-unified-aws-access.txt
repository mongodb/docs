Overview
--------

Some |service| features, including :adl:`Data Lakes </>` and
:doc:`Encryption at Rest </security-aws-kms>`, use |aws| `IAM roles
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__
for authentication. When |service| accesses |aws| services, it does so
through an `assumed IAM role
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html>`__.

You can set up an assumed IAM role for your |service| account to use with
the |service| API or UI.

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| :doc:`account </index>`.

- The `AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`__.

      Begin the Setup Procedure for AWS IAM Access
      --------------------------------------------

      1. Expand the :guilabel:`Options` menu next to your project name
         in the |service| UI upper left corner. Select :guilabel:`Integrations`.
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button in the :guilabel:`AWS IAM
         Role Access` panel.

         Note: if you already have one or more roles configured, the button
         reads :guilabel:`Edit`.
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM Role` button.
      #. Read through the :guilabel:`Overview` instructions, then click
         :guilabel:`Next`.
      #. If you'd like to create a new AWS IAM role for use with |service|,
         use the :guilabel:`Create New Role with the AWS CLI` procedure.
         If you have an existing AWS IAM role you want to authorize for
         |service|, use the :guilabel:`Add Trust Relationships to an Existing
         Role` procedure.

      .. _create-new-role-aws-cli:

      Create New Role with the AWS CLI
      --------------------------------

      1. Click :guilabel:`Create New Role with the AWS CLI` to expand the next
         section.
      #. Copy the JSON text and save it to a file named ``role-trust-policy.json``.
      #. Enter a name for your new AWS IAM role in the text box.
      #. If you don't already have the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
         installed, see the `documentation
         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`__.
         If you do have the AWS CLI installed, proceed to the next step.
      #. Copy the CLI command and enter it at the command prompt.
      #. If successful, the CLI command returns a JSON document with information
         about the newly created AWS IAM role. Locate the field named :guilabel:`Arn`
         and copy it into the text box labelled :guilabel:`Enter the Role ARN`
         in the |service| modal window.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Validate and Finish`.

      .. _authorize-existing-aws-role:

      Add Trust Relationships to an Existing Role
      -------------------------------------------

      1. Click :guilabel:`Add Trust Relationships to an Existing Role` to
         expand the next section.
      #. Copy the JSON trust relationship text.
      #. In your AWS web console, navigate to the :guilabel:`Roles` section
         of the IAM dashboard.
      #. Click on the role you want to authorize.
      #. Select the :guilabel:`Trust relationships` tab.
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Edit trust relationship` button.
      #. Replace the existing text with the JSON text you copied in step 2.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Update Trust Policy`.
      #. Copy the Role ARN and paste it in the |service| modal window, in the
         text box labelled :guilabel:`Enter the Role ARN`.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Validate and Finish`.

Resume an Authorization Procedure
---------------------------------

If you cancel a procedure to authorize an AWS IAM role for use with |service|,
you can resume it where you left off.

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Options` menu next to your project name
   in the |service| UI upper left corner. Select :guilabel:`Integrations`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button in the :guilabel:`AWS IAM
   Role Access` panel.

   Note: if you already have one or more roles configured, the button
   reads :guilabel:`Edit`.

#. Any roles with an ongoing authorization procedure are listed with an
   ``in progress`` status. Click the :guilabel:`Resume` button to resume
   the authorization process.

To cancel an in-progress role authorization completely, click the
:guilabel:`Delete` icon next to the in-progress role.

Deauthorize an Assumed IAM Role
-------------------------------

You can deauthorize an existing |aws| IAM role from your |service| account
with the |service| API or the |service| UI.

.. note::

   Be sure to remove any associated |service| services from the IAM role
   before you deauthorize it.
