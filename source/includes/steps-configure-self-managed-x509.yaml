content: |

   You can provide a Certificate Authority (CA) by:
    
   - Clicking :guilabel:`Upload` and selecting a ``.pem`` file from
     your filesystem.

   - Copying the contents of a ``.pem`` file into the provided text
     area.

   You can concatenate multiple CAs in the same ``.pem`` file or in the
   text area. Users can authenticate with certificates generated by any
   of the provided CAs.

   When you upload a CA, a project-level alert is
   automatically created to send a notification 30 days before
   the CA expires, repeating every 24 hours. You can view and
   edit this alert from |service|'s :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page. For
   more information on configuring alerts, see 
   :doc:`Configure Alert Settings </configure-alerts>`.
