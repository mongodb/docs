The ideal shard key allows MongoDB to distribute documents evenly
throughout the cluster while facilitating common query patterns. A
suboptimal shard key can lead to performance or scaling issues due to
uneven data distribution. 

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can change the shard key for a collection to
change the distribution of your data across a cluster.

Starting in MongoDB 7.2, you can reshard a collection on the same shard key,
allowing you to redistribute data to include new shards or to different zones
without changing your shard key.

.. note::

   Before resharding your collection, read
   :ref:`shardkey-troubleshoot-shard-keys` for information on common
   performance and scaling issues and advice on how to fix them.

.. _reshard-requirements:

Requirements
------------

Before you reshard your collection, ensure that you meet the following
requirements:

- Your application can tolerate a period of **two seconds** where the
  collection that is being resharded blocks writes. During the time
  period where writes are blocked your application experiences an
  increase in latency. If your workload cannot tolerate this
  requirement, consider :ref:`refining your shard key
  <shard-key-refine>` instead.
- Your database meets these resource requirements:

  -  Available storage space: Ensure that your cluster has sufficient availible
     disk space for resharding. If documents in the resharded collection are equally 
     distributed across the cluster, each shard requires disk space of 
     approximately 1.2 times the collection size on disk divided by the number of shards. 

     .. note::

        Resharding requires additional disk space because the process creates a new
        collection with data distributed across shards according to the new shard key. 
        See :ref:`resharding_process` for more information. 
    

  -  I/O: Ensure that your I/O capacity is below 50%.
  -  CPU load: Ensure that your CPU load is below 80%.

  .. important::

     These requirements are not enforced by the database. A failure to
     allocate enough resources can result in:

     - the database running out of space and shutting down
     - decreased performance
     - the resharding operation taking longer than expected

     If your application has time periods with less traffic, reshard your
     collection during that time if possible.

- You must perform one of these tasks:

  - rewrite your application's queries to use **both** the current shard
    key and the new shard key

  - stop your application and then:
  
    - rewrite your application's queries to use the new shard key
    - wait until the resharding of the collection completes (to monitor
      the :ref:`resharding process <resharding_process>`, use a
      :pipeline:`$currentOp` pipeline stage)
    - deploy your rewritten application

  The following queries return an error if the query filter does not
  include **both** the current shard key or a unique field (like
  ``_id``):

  - :method:`~db.collection.deleteOne()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.findOneAndDelete()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.findOneAndReplace()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.replaceOne()`
  - :method:`~db.collection.updateOne()`

  For optimal performance, we recommend that you also rewrite other
  queries to include the new shard key.

  Once the resharding operation completes, you can remove the old shard
  key from the queries.

- No index builds are in progress. Use ``db.currentOp()`` to
  check for any running index builds:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     db.adminCommand(
        {
          currentOp: true,
          $or: [
            { op: "command", "command.createIndexes": { $exists: true }  },
            { op: "none", "msg" : /^Index Build/ }
          ]
        }
    )

  In the result document, if the ``inprog`` field value is an empty
  array, there are no index builds in progress:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     {
        inprog: [],
        ok: 1,
        '$clusterTime': { ... },
        operationTime: <timestamp>
     }

.. note::

    Resharding is a write-intensive process which can generate increased rates 
    of oplog. You may wish to:

    - set a fixed oplog size to prevent unbounded oplog growth.
    - increase the oplog size to minimize the chance that one or more
      secondary nodes becomes stale.
    
    See the :ref:`replica-set-oplog` documentation for more details.

.. _resharding-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

- Only one collection can be resharded at a time.
- :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` must be ``true``.
- To reshard a collection that has a :ref:`uniqueness
  <index-type-unique>` constraint, the new shard key must satisfy
  the :ref:`unique index requirements <sharding-shard-key-unique>` for 
  any existing unique indexes.
- The following commands and corresponding shell methods are not
  supported on the collection that is being resharded while the
  resharding operation is in progress:

  - :dbcommand:`collMod`
  - :dbcommand:`convertToCapped`
  - :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
  - :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
  - :dbcommand:`drop`
  - :method:`~db.collection.drop()`
  - :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
  - :method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()`
  - :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
  - :method:`~db.collection.renameCollection()`

- The following commands and methods are not supported on the cluster
  while the resharding operation is in progress:

  - :dbcommand:`addShard`
  - :dbcommand:`removeShard`
  - :method:`db.createCollection()`
  - :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`

  .. warning::

     Using any of the preceding commands during a resharding
     operation causes the resharding operation to fail.

- If the collection to be resharded uses :atlas:`Atlas Search
  </atlas-search>`, the search index will become unavailable when the
  resharding operation completes. You need to manually rebuild the
  search index once the resharding operation completes.

- You can't reshard a sharded :ref:`time series collection
  <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

.. _resharding_process:

Resharding Process
------------------

.. important::

   We strongly recommend that you check the
   :ref:`resharding-limitations` and read the :ref:`resharding_process`
   section in full before resharding your collection.

.. include:: /includes/reshard-collection-introduction.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/reshard-a-collection.rst

Behavior
--------

Minimum Duration of a Resharding Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum duration of a resharding operation is always 5 minutes.

Retryable Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Retryable writes <retryable-writes>` initiated before or during
resharding can be retried during and after the collection has been
resharded for up to 5 minutes. After 5 minutes you may be unable to find
the definitive result of the write and subsequent attempts to retry the
write fail with an ``IncompleteTransactionHistory`` error.

Error Case
----------

Duplicate ``_id`` Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resharding operation fails if ``_id`` values are not globally unique
to avoid corrupting collection data. Duplicate ``_id`` values can also
prevent successful chunk migration. If you have documents with duplicate
``_id`` values, copy the data from each into a new document, and then
delete the duplicate documents.
