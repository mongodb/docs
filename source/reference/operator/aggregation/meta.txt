.. expression:: $meta

   Returns the metadata associated with a document, e.g.
   ``"textScore"`` when performing text search.

   .. |meta-object| replace:: :expression:`$meta`
   .. |empty-value| replace:: null

   .. include:: /includes/fact-meta-syntax.rst

   .. important:: 

      The following ``$meta`` keywords are not supported in :ref:`Stable API 
      <stable-api>` V1: 

      - ``"textScore"``
      - ``"indexKey"``
      - ``"searchScore"``
      - ``"searchHighlights"``
      - ``"searchSequenceToken"``

Behavior

.. _project-meta-textscore-sort:

Text Score Metadata ``$meta: "textScore"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requires $text Search
`````````````````````

- The ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` expression must be used in
  conjunction with :query:`$text`. For example:

  - In aggregation, you must specify a :pipeline:`$match` stage
    with a ``$text`` query in the pipeline to use the ``{
    $meta: "textScore" }`` expression in later stage(s). If you
    do not specify the ``$text`` query in the
    :pipeline:`$match` stage, the operation fails.

  - In find, you must specify the ``$text`` operator in the
    query predicate to use ``{ $meta: "textScore" }``. If you do not specify 
    the ``$text`` operator in the query predicate, the operation fails.

  .. include:: /includes/text-search-legacy-atlas-section.rst
     
Availability
````````````

- In aggregation, the ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` expression can
  be included in various stages that accept aggregation
  expressions, such as :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$group`
  :pipeline:`$sort`, etc.

- In find, the ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` expression can be
  included in :ref:`projection <find-projection>` and in
  :method:`~cursor.sort()`.

Usage In Projection
```````````````````

- The ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` expression can be a part of the
  :term:`projection` document to include the text score metadata.

- The :expression:`$meta` expression can be present in either an
  inclusion or an exclusion projection.

- If you set the expression to a field name that already exists
  in the document, the projected metadata value overwrites the
  existing value.

Filter on Text Score
````````````````````

- In aggregation, following a stage that outputs a field with
  the text score value, you can specify a query condition or
  operate on the field in subsequent stages. For example, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/text-search-in-aggregation`.

- In find, you cannot specify a query condition on the text
  score. Use aggregation instead.

Usage In Sort
`````````````

- The ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` expression can be used as a
  part of a sort operation to sort by the text score metadata;
  i.e.,

  - In aggregation, :pipeline:`$sort` stage.

  - In find, :method:`~cursor.sort()` method.

- The ``"textScore"`` metadata sorts in descending order.

- To use in a sort operation, set the ``{ $meta: "textScore" }``
  expression to an arbitrary field name. The field name is
  disregarded by the query system.

Sort without Projection
```````````````````````

- In aggregation, you can sort the resulting documents by ``{
  $meta: "textScore" }`` without also having to project the
  ``textScore``.
  
- In find, you can sort the resulting documents by ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` 
  without also having to project the ``textScore``.

Sort with Projection
````````````````````

- In aggregation, if you include the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" }
  <$meta>` expression in both the projection and sort, the
  projection and sort can have different field names for the
  expression. The field name in the sort is disregarded by the query
  system.

- In find, if you include the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` 
  expression in both the projection and sort, the projection and sort can have
  different field names for the expression. The field name in the
  sort is disregarded by the query system.

Index Key Metadata $meta: "indexKey" (Aggregation and Find)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
`````

- The ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression is for debugging purposes
  only and not for application logic.

- The ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression is preferred over
  :method:`cursor.returnKey()`.

Availability
````````````

- **In aggregation**, the ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression can
  be included in various stages that accept aggregation
  expressions, such as :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$group`
  :pipeline:`$sortByCount`, etc., but not :pipeline:`$sort`.
  However, with an aggregation pipeline, you can first project
  the ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression (such as in a
  :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$addFields`, etc. ) and then,
  sort by that field in a subsequent :pipeline:`$sort` stage.

- **In find**, the ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression is only
  available as part of the :term:`projection` document.

Return Value
````````````

- The value returned depends on how the database decides to
  represent values in an index and may change across versions. The
  represented value may not be the actual value for the field. 

- The value returned depends on the execution plan chosen by the
  system. For example, if there are two possible indexes which can
  be used to answer the query, then the value of the "indexKey"
  metadata depends on which index is selected.

- If an index is :red:`not` used, the ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }``
  expression does not return a value and the field is not included
  as part of the output.

Examples
--------

.. TODO when $meta returns other data that requires documentation,
   subsection Examples section by keywords.

``$meta: "textScore"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an ``articles`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 1, "title" : "cakes and ale" },
      { "_id" : 2, "title" : "more cakes" },
      { "_id" : 3, "title" : "bread" },
      { "_id" : 4, "title" : "some cakes" },
      { "_id" : 5, "title" : "two cakes to go" },
      { "_id" : 6, "title" : "pie" }
   ])

Create a :ref:`text index <create-text-index>` on the ``title`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.createIndex( { title: "text"} )

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Aggregation
      :tabid: aggregation

      The following aggregation operation performs a text search and uses the
      :expression:`$meta` operator to group by the text search score:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.aggregate(
            [
              { $match: { $text: { $search: "cake" } } },
              { $group: { _id: { $meta: "textScore" }, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
            ]
         )

      The operation returns the following results:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : 0.75, "count" : 1 }
         { "_id" : 0.6666666666666666, "count" : 1 }
         { "_id" : 1, "count" : 2 }

      For more examples, see :doc:`/tutorial/text-search-in-aggregation`.

   .. tab:: Find and Project
      :tabid: find

      The following query performs a text search for the term ``cake`` and
      uses the :expression:`$meta` operator in the projection document to
      include the score assigned to each matching document:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.articles.find(
            { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
            { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
         )

      The operation returns the following documents with the text score:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : 4, "title" : "some cakes", "score" : 1 }
         { "_id" : 1, "title" : "cakes and ale", "score" : 0.75 }
         { "_id" : 5, "title" : "two cakes to go", "score" : 0.6666666666666666 }
         { "_id" : 2, "title" : "more cakes", "score" : 1 }

      For additional examples of ``"textScore"`` projections and sorts,
      see :ref:`ex-text-search-score`.

``$meta: "indexKey"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` expression is for debugging
   purposes only and not for application logic. MongoDB returns the
   value associated with the index chosen by the query system. The
   system can choose a different index upon subsequent execution.

   For the selected index, the value returned depends on how the
   database decides to represent values in an index and may change
   across versions. The represented value may not be the actual
   value for the field.


Create an ``orders`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany([
      { "item" : "abc", "price" : NumberDecimal("12"), "quantity" : 2, "type": "apparel" },
      { "item" : "jkl", "price" : NumberDecimal("20"), "quantity" : 1, "type": "electronics" },
      { "item" : "abc", "price" : NumberDecimal("10"), "quantity" : 5, "type": "apparel" }
   ])

Create the following compound index on the ``type`` and ``item`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.createIndex( { type: 1, item: 1 } )

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Aggregation
      :tabid: aggregation

      The following aggregation operation finds all documents with ``type``
      equal to ``apparel`` and uses the :expression:`$meta` operator to
      include the index key value for the matching document if an index was
      used:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate(
            [
              { $match: { type: "apparel" } },
              { $addFields: { idxKey: { $meta: "indexKey" } } }
            ]
         )

   .. tab:: Find and Project
      :tabid: find

      The following operation finds all documents with ``type``
      equal to ``apparel`` and uses the :expression:`$meta` operator to
      include the index key value for the matching document if an index was
      used:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.find( { type: "apparel" }, { idxKey: { $meta: "indexKey" } } )

The operation returns the matching documents with their
corresponding index key:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 7,15

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5e98a33ceaf5e9dcf2b8dcde"),
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("12"),
      "quantity" : 2,
      "type" : "apparel",        
      "idxKey" : { "type" : "apparel", "item" : "abc" }
   }
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5e98a33ceaf5e9dcf2b8dce0"),
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("10"),
      "quantity" : 5,
      "type" : "apparel",
      "idxKey" : { "type" : "apparel", "item" : "abc" }
   }


If :red:`no` index is used, the ``{ $meta: "indexKey" }`` does not
return anything. 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Aggregation
      :tabid: aggregation

      For example, the following operation does not use
      an index since no index exists on the ``price`` field to support the
      match condition:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate(
            [
              { $match: { price: { $gte: NumberDecimal("10") } } },
              { $addFields: { idxKey: { $meta: "indexKey" } } }
            ]
         )

   .. tab:: Find and Project
      :tabid: find

      For example, the following operation does not use an index
      since no index exists on the ``price`` field to support the
      match condition:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.find( 
            { price: { $gte: NumberDecimal("10") } }, 
            { idxKey: { $meta: "indexKey" } }
         )

The operation returns the matching documents without the ``idxKey``
field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5e98a33ceaf5e9dcf2b8dcde"),
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("12"),
      "quantity" : 2,
      "type" : "apparel"
   }
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5e98a33ceaf5e9dcf2b8dcdf"),
      "item" : "jkl",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("20"),
      "quantity" : 1,
      "type" : "electronics"
   }
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5e98a33ceaf5e9dcf2b8dce0"),
      "item" : "abc",
      "price" : NumberDecimal("10"),
      "quantity" : 5,
      "type" : "apparel"
   }
