|mms| is a service that lets you create, manage, monitor, and back up
MongoDB deployments. You can use |mms| to create new deployments and
manage existing ones. To manage existing deployments you download
|mms| agents to your deployment servers.

To use |mms| you create |a-mms| :doc:`group </tutorial/create-group>`,
which will provide access to a distinct set of MongoDB processes and
users. Choose a globally unique name for the group; this name must be unique
within the |mms| platform. For security and auditing reasons, you cannot use a
name used earlier, and once you name a group, the group's name cannot be
changed. You can create multiple groups.

You can get started with |mms| in minutes by going to
`https://mongodb.com/cloud <https://mongodb.com/cloud>`_ and starting a
free trial. |mms| walks you through registration and the setup of your
first deployment. The choices you make during setup do not limit your
choices for the future.
