When you design your schema, consider how your application needs to query and
return related data. How you map relationships between data entities affects
your application's performance and scalability.

The recommended way to handle related data is to embed it in a sub-document.
Embedding related data lets your application query the data it needs with a
single read operation and avoid slow :pipeline:`$lookup` operations.

For some use cases, you can use a reference to point to related data in a
separate collection. 

About this Task
---------------

To determine if you should embed related data or use references,
consider the relative importance of the following goals for your
application:

Improve queries on related data
  If your application frequently queries one entity to return data about
  another entity, embed the data to avoid the need for frequent
  ``$lookup`` operations.

Improve data returned from different entities
  If your application returns data from related entities together,
  embed the data in a single collection. 

Improve update performance
  If your application frequently updates related data, consider
  storing the data in its own collection and using a reference to access it.
  When you use a reference, you reduce your application's write workload by only
  needing to update the data in a single place.

To learn more about the benefits of embedded data and references, see
:ref:`data-modeling-decisions`.

Before you Begin
----------------

Mapping relationships is the second step of the :ref:`schema design
process <data-modeling-schema-design>`. Before you map relationships,
:ref:`identify your application's workload
<data-modeling-identify-workload>` to determine the data it needs.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify related data in your schema

      Identify the data that your application queries and how entities
      relate to each other.

      Consider the operations you identified from your application's
      workload in the first step of the schema design process. Note the
      information these operations write and return, and what
      information overlaps between multiple operations. 

   .. step:: Create a schema map for your related data

      Your schema map should show related data fields and the type of
      relationship between those fields (one-to-one, one-to-many,
      many-to-many).

      Your schema map can resemble an `entity-relationship model
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model>`__.

   .. step:: Choose whether to embed related data or use references

      The decision to embed data or use references depends on your
      application's common queries. Review the queries you identified in
      the :ref:`Identify Application Workload
      <data-modeling-identify-workload>` step and use the guidelines
      mentioned earlier on this page to design your schema to support
      frequent and critical queries.

      Configure your databases, collections, and application logic to
      match the approach you choose.

Examples
--------

Consider the following schema map for a blog application:

.. figure:: /images/data-modeling/blog-schema-map.png
   :alt: Schema map for a blog application

The following examples show how to optimize your schema for different
queries depending on the needs of your application.

Optimize Queries for Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application primarily queries articles for information such as title,
embed related information in the ``articles`` collection to return all data
needed by the application in a single operation.

The following document is optimized for queries on articles:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.insertOne(
      {
         title: "My Favorite Vacation",
         date: ISODate("2023-06-02"),
         text: "We spent seven days in Italy...",
         tags: [
            {
               name: "travel",
               url: "<blog-site>/tags/travel"
            },
            {
               name: "adventure",
               url: "<blog-site>/tags/adventure"
            }
         ],
         comments: [
            {
               name: "pedro123",
               text: "Great article!"
            }
         ],
         author: {
            name: "alice123",
            email: "alice@mycompany.com",
            avatar: "photo1.jpg"
         }
      }
   )

Optimize Queries for Articles and Authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application returns article information and author information
separately, consider storing articles and authors in separate
collections. This schema design reduces the work required to return
author information, and lets you return only author information without
including unneeded fields.

In the following schema, the ``articles`` collection contains an
``authorId`` field, which is a reference to the ``authors`` collection.

         text: "We spent seven days in Italy...",
         authorId: 987,

         comments: [
            {
               name: "pedro345",
               text: "Great article!"
            }
         ]
      }

         avatar: "photo1.jpg"
      }
   )

Next Steps
----------

After you map relationships for your application's data, the next step
in the schema design process is to apply design patterns to optimize
your schema. See :ref:`data-modeling-apply-patterns`.
