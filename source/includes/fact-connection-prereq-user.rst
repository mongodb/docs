MongoDB User
   To access a cluster, you must create a
   :manual:`MongoDB User </core/security-users/>` with access to the
   desired database(s) on your |service| cluster. MongoDB users are
   separate from |service| users. MongoDB users have access to MongoDB
   databases, while |service| users have access to the |service|
   application itself.

   You can create a MongoDB user to access to your |service| cluster
   in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the MongoDB user
   from the :ref:`Clusters view <mongodb-users>`.
