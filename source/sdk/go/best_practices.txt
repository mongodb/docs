Best Practices
==============

Follow these best practices when using the Atlas Go SDK.

Using Getters Instead of Direct Field Access
--------------------------------------------

When accessing responses, use the getter function instead of direct field access.

For example, use ``response.GetField()`` instead of ``response.Field``.

Using getter functions allows seamless pointer handling and can help prevent panic errors.
Additionally, the Atlas Go SDK provides ``Set``\ , ``IsSet`` and ``Unset`` methods for safe field modifications.

Check for Empty Strings for String Pointers
-------------------------------------------

When a model contains a pointer to a ``string``\ , the Atlas Go SDK sends that value to the server,
even if it is set to an empty string (\ ``""``\ ).

Instead of direct assignment:

.. code-block:: go

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   test := ""
   requestBody.StringPointerValue = test

Users should always check for empty strings before assigning them:

.. code-block:: go

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   if test != ""   
       requestBody.StringPointerValue = test

Working with Date Fields
------------------------

In the Atlas Go SDK, the ``*time.Time`` type represents date fields for handling time-related data. 
When you compare values based on ``time.Time``\ , either never compare pointers directly or do the following:


* 
  Avoid using direct comparison operators (e.g., ``myStruct.MyDateField == ""``\ ) to check for equality. Comparing pointers directly will check if they refer to the same memory address rather than comparing the actual date values. Since each ``time.Time`` instance is allocated in different memory locations, direct comparisons might yield unexpected results.

* 
  Use the ``Has`` function to check non-nil pointers:
  The SDK provides a dedicated ``HasFieldName`` or ``GetFieldName`` function for each model to check if a ``time.Time`` pointer is non-nil before accessing its value. Always use this function to ensure that the pointer is valid before you perform any operations.

* 
  Use ``time.Time`` methods to compare date values:
  When you have confirmed that the ``time.Time pointer`` is non-nil, you can safely use ``time.Time`` methods to compare the actual date values. Commonly used methods for comparison include ``Before``\ , ``After``\ , and ``Equal``\ :

.. code-block:: go

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   if !sdkModel.HasSomeDateField() {
      return;
   }
   datePtr1 := sdkModel.SomeDateField;
   if datePtr1.Before(*datePtr2) {
       // datePtr1 is before datePtr2.
   } else if datePtr1.After(*datePtr2) {
       // datePtr1 is after datePtr2.
   } else {
       // datePtr1 and datePtr2 are equal.
   }

Working with Objects
--------------------

The Atlas Go SDK represents free-form objects with the golang ``ìnterface{}`` type in models and parameters. Free-form objects include objects of any shape. 

The golang ``ìnterface{}`` type allows you to use the following types as input arguments:


* Basic types (integer, boolean)
* Your own structures
* any for free-form objects

NOTE: The Atlas Go SDK uses free-form objects only where models need to handle multiple conflicting values. For example, some of the existing Atlas Search APIs allow you to supply booleans or objects.

Working with Pointers
---------------------

The Atlas Go SDK utilizes SDK pointers to denote optional values in the Go programming language:

.. code-block:: golang

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   type Data struct {
       // Represents an optional name
       Name *string `json:"results,omitempty"`
   }

In the example above, the string value is optional, and it won't be sent to the server if you don't explicitly set it.

Working with Arrays
-------------------

The Atlas Go SDK represents all arrays as pointers:

.. code-block:: golang

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   type Data struct {
       Results *[]DataRole `json:"results,omitempty"`
   }

The following scenarios use pointers with arrays:


* Update a request containing an empty array (resetting the field values):

If you explicitly set a struct property to an empty array, the SDK will send an empty array request to the Atlas API.

.. code-block:: golang

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   data := Data{
       // Sending an empty array
       Results: &[]DataRole{}
   }


* Update a request without updating the array field:

When performing an update operation, we recommend that you don't set the struct property.

.. code-block:: golang

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   data := Data{
       // Sending an empty array by not setting field values (value is nil)
       // Results: &[]DataRole{}
   }

These practices ensure accurate handling of optional values and array updates in the SDK when you work with pointers in Golang.

Working with Binary Responses
-----------------------------

In the Atlas Go SDK, the ``io.ReadCloser`` type is used to return binary data using the APIs. 


* 
  Use ``io.Copy`` to store on a file or pass through another steam.

* 
  Use ``io.ReadAll`` to read all bytes in memory.

* 
  Call the ``.Close()`` function after reading the data

Note: see example in `examples/download/downloadLogs.go <https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/examples/download/downloadLogs.go>`__

Use Method for Creating Models
------------------------------

Use dedicated methods for creating new models.

For example, instead of using the following:

.. code-block:: go

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   GroupInvitationUpdateRequest{
       ...
   }

Use the following dedicated method:

.. code-block:: go

   // Surrounding code omitted for brevity

   admin.NewGroupInvitationUpdateRequest(...)

Use golangci-lint Validators
----------------------------

Use `golangci-lint <https://golangci-lint.run/>`__ to detect common errors when using the Atlas Go SDK. 
The Atlas Go SDK doesn't provide its own linter.

Linting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't recommend using the ``bodyclose`` rule as it reports an many false positives with Atlas GO SDK and other libraries.
