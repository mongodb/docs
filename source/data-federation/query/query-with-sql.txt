You can run SQL queries to search data on your {+fdi+}\s using the 
{+asql+} Interface. This capability allows you to visualize, graph, and 
report on your |service| data using relational business intelligence 
tools such as 
`Power BI <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/>`__ and 
`Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__.

.. note::

   {+asql+} Interface only supports read operations. You cannot write 
   data to your |service| {+cluster+} with the {+asql+} Interface.

The {+asql+} Interface is available by default when you create a 
{+fdi+}. {+adf+} automatically creates collection schemas for SQL query 
compilation and type inference. To learn more about the 
schema, see :ref:`Schema Management <sql-schema-management>`.

To use the {+aqsl+} Interface to run SQL queries, connect to your data 
using a MongoDB SQL Driver or one of the BI tool Named Connectors. To 
learn more about the different connection options, see 
:ref:`Connect <sql-connect>`.

Components
----------

The SQL interface includes the following components:

{+FDI+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains virtual 
databases and collections that map to data in your data stores. This 
also provides a SQL schema and translates SQL queries between 
your BI tool and your |service| data.

SQL Driver or Named Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SQL driver or a Named Connector provides a standard method to 
connect to a BI tool. If you are using a :abbr:`BI (Business Intelligence)` tool, check which 
connections it supports.

BI Tool
~~~~~~~
A visualization and reporting tool, such as Power BI or Tableau.

Get Started
-----------

To start querying your |service| data with SQL, 
:ref:`enable the {+asql+} Interface <enable-sql-interface>`
and :ref:`connect to your data <sql-connect>`
with a driver or BI tool of your choice.
