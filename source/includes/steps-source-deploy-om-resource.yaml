title: "Verify your new |tls| certificates."
content: |

  Verify that each member of the Replica Set has one |tls| certificate named with the following format:

  ``<resource-name>db<index>-pem``

  Where ``<index>`` is a 0-based index number to the total amount of
  members minus one. (``0`` to ``n-1``)

title: "Create a Secret with your new |tls| certificates."

  Create a new Secret from these files:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create secret generic appdb-certs \
             --from-file=om-appdb-0-pem \
             --from-file=om-appdb-1-pem \
             --from-file=om-appdb-2-pem

  ``kubectl`` creates one Secret containing the three certificates.

ref: create-om-appdb-configmap
title: "Create a ConfigMap containing the Certificate Authority."
content: |

  If you had the certificates signed with an internal authority (like
  ``cert-manager`` or Vault), you must create a |k8s-configmap|
  containing the |certauth|\'s Certificate file.

  If you saved the certificate as a file, name this file ``ca-pem``.
  This simplifies creating the |k8s-configmap|.

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create configmap appdb-ca --from-file=ca-pem

  This creates a |k8s-configmap| named ``appdb-ca``. This
  |k8s-configmap| contains one entry called ``ca-pem`` with the
  contents of the |certauth| file.
