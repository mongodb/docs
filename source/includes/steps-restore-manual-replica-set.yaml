  b. When the restore job completes, click :guilabel:`(get link)`
     for each :term:`replica set` appears.

  c. Click:

     - The copy button to the right of the link to copy the link to
       use it later, or

  .. admonition:: Extra step for point-in-time restores
     :class: important

     For point-in-time and oplog timestamp restores, additional
     instructions are shown. The final step shows the full command
     you must run using the :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore
     Utility)`. It includes all of the necessary options to ensure a
     full restore.

     Select and copy the ``mongodb-backup-restore-util`` command
     provided under :guilabel:`Run Binary with PIT Options`.

        If you closed the restore panel, click :guilabel:`Continuous Backup`, then

        Restore Utility`.

  #. Start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance without authentication
     enabled using the extracted snapshot directory as the data
     directory.

     .. example::

        .. code-block:: sh

     .. warning::
        The MongoDB Backup Restore Utility doesn't support
        authentication, so you can't start this temporary database with
        authentication.

  #. Run the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility on your destination host.
     Run it once for the replica set.
