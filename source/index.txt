.. default-domain:: mongodb

Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! MongoDB is an open-source,
document-oriented database designed for ease of development and
scaling.

The Manual introduces MongoDB and continues to describe the query
language, operational considerations and procedures, administration,
and application development patterns, and other aspects of MongoDB use
and administration. See the :doc:`/core/introduction` for an overview of
MongoDB's key features. The Manual also has a thorough reference
section of the MongoDB interface and tools.

This manual is under constant development. See the :doc:`/about` for
more information on the MongoDB Documentation project.
