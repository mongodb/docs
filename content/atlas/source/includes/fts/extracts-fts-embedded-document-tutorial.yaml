  The sample queries search the embedded documents in the ``schools``
  collection. The queries use the following pipeline stages:

  - :pipeline:`$search` to search the collection.
  - :pipeline:`$project` to include and exclude  fields from the
    collection, and add a field named ``score`` in the results. For
    queries that enable :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>`, the
    :pipeline:`$project` stage also adds a new field called
    ``highlights``, which contains the highlighting information.

  This query demonstrates a search against a field inside an array
  of documents. 
  
  It searches at the ``teachers`` path for teachers with the first name
  ``John`` and specifies a preference for teachers with the last name
  ``Smith``. It also enables :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>` on the
  ``last`` name field.

  This query demonstrates a compound query that searches fields inside the following arrays:
 
  - Array of documents.
  - Array of documents nested inside an array of documents.
  
  It searches for schools that have a teacher teaching ``12th`` grade
  ``science`` class at the ``teachers.classes`` path, preferring schools
  with teachers with last name ``Smith`` who teach that class. It also
  enables :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>` on the ``subject`` field 
  inside the ``classes`` array of the documents which is nested inside the
  ``teachers`` array of documents.

  This query demonstrates a search against a field inside an array of
  documents that is nested inside a document. 
  
  It searches for schools that have sports clubs that offer students an
  opportunity  to play either ``dodgeball`` or ``frisbee`` at the
  ``clubs.sports`` path.

ref: fts-embedded-document-basic-query-results
content: |
  The two documents in the results contain teachers with the first name 
  ``John``. The document with ``_id: 1`` ranks higher because it 
  contains a teacher with the first name ``John`` who also has the last 
  name ``Smith``.

---
ref: fts-embedded-document-advanced-query-results
content: |
  The two documents in the results contain teachers who teach ``12th`` 
  grade ``science``. The document with ``_id: 0`` contains a teacher with 
  last name ``Smith`` who teaches ``12th`` grade ``science``.

---
ref: fts-embedded-document-complex-query-results
content: |
  The two documents in the results show schools that offer clubs where
  students could play ``dodgeball`` or ``frisbee``.

---
ref: fts-embedded-document-facet-query-results
content: |
  The results show that ``3`` schools offer classes for ``12th`` and
  ``9th`` grades, ``2`` schools offer classes for ``10th`` grade, and
  ``1`` school offers classes for ``11th`` grade. When you facet by a
  field inside an embedded document, the query returns count for the
  top-level parent document, which is the ``teachers`` field for this
  query.
