You can specify ``mongosh`` settings in a global configuration file.
When you specify settings in a configuration file, those settings are
applied at startup. After you create a configuration file, the settings
in the file take effect the next time you start ``mongosh``.

Configuration File Format
-------------------------

The ``mongosh`` configuration file uses the YAML format. All options are
under the ``mongosh`` namespace.

Example Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration file sets:

- ``displayBatchSize`` to 50
- ``inspectDepth`` to 20
- ``redactHistory`` to ``remove-redact``

.. code-block:: yaml

   mongosh:
     displayBatchSize: 50
     inspectDepth: 20
     redactHistory: "remove-redact"

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The file location where ``mongosh`` looks for the configuration file
depends on your operating system:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Operating System
     - File Location

   * - Windows
     - ``mongosh.cfg``, in the same directory as the ``mongosh.exe``
       binary.
   * - macOS
     - ``mongosh`` looks for a configuration file in the following
       directories in the order they are listed:

       1. ``/usr/local/etc/mongosh.conf``
       #. ``/opt/homebrew/etc/mongosh.conf``
       #. ``/etc/mongosh.conf``

       Once ``mongosh`` reads a configuration file in one of these
       directories, any remaining directories in the list are not
       checked and configuration files in those directories are ignored.

   * - Linux
     - ``/etc/mongosh.conf``

Configurable Settings
---------------------

You can specify the following ``mongosh`` settings in your configuration
file:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-shell-properties.rst

Behavior with ``config`` API
----------------------------

Settings specified with the :ref:`config API <configure-settings-api>`:

- Override settings specified in the configuration file.

- Persist across restarts.

.. example::

   Consider the following configuration file that sets the
   ``inspectDepth`` setting to ``20``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      mongosh:
        inspectDepth: 20
       
   During your ``mongosh`` session you run the following command to set
   ``inspectDepth`` to ``10``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      config.set( "inspectDepth", 10 )

   The value of ``inspectDepth`` becomes ``10``, and will remain ``10``
   even when ``mongosh`` is restarted.
