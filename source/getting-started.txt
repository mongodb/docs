Introduction
------------

To get started with |service|, create your user account and create your first
group. Your group will host your MongoDB databases and have an associated
payment method. You can give other |service| users access to your group,
allowing them to log into the group and manage your MongoDB databases.

After you create the group, |service| takes you to the :guilabel:`Clusters`
view to create your first MongoDB :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`.

.. bg note: The above is a first attempt at a better intro. The earlier draft
   had equated a group with an "account" and had suggested that to access a
   database you had to be an Atlas user. Neither was true. Specifically:
   - In both Cloud & Atlas, an account = a registered user. An account != group.
   - Billing, however, is at the group level, not the account level.
   - You must log into Atlas to manage a group's databases but not necessarily
     to access them.

.. bg note:: I removed the billing section and the "gs-configure-billing" ref.
   In the onboarding flow, "billing" comes after "building."

.. .. kk note::
   .. Question: The wireframes made it look like I could enter in
   .. payment info as I create clusters. Like in amazon, can I enter in
   .. multiple billing info and choose which to use?
