   Enable or Disable Performance Advisor for a Project
   ---------------------------------------------------

   .. admonition:: Required Privileges
      :class: important

      To enable :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` for a project, you must
      have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project.

   ``Performance Advisor`` is enabled by default. To disable or enable ``Performance Advisor``:

   .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-performance-advisor.rst

Common Reasons for Slow Queries
-------------------------------

If a query is slow, common reasons include:

- The query is unsupported by your current indexes. 
- Some documents in your collection have large array fields that are 
  costly to search and index.
- One query retrieves information from multiple collections with 
  :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup>`.

Index Considerations
--------------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations-performance-advisor.rst

Access Performance Advisor
--------------------------

To access the :guilabel:`Performance Advisor`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/performance-advisor-view.rst

The :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` displays up to 20 query shapes
across all collections in the cluster and suggested indexes for those
shapes. The indexes are ranked according to their :guilabel:`Impact`
score, which estimates the improvement in total operational latency
across the cluster that creating the index would cause. For
more information on index ranking, see :ref:`pa-index-ranking`.

Index Suggestions
-----------------

The indexes suggested by the Performance Advisor are ordered by their
respective :guilabel:`Impact` scores. :guilabel:`Impact` indicates the
estimated performance improvement that the suggested index would bring.
For more information on how the Performance Advisor ranks indexes, see
:ref:`pa-index-ranking`.

The |pa| displays a warning icon next to any index with an
:guilabel:`Impact` score of 5% or greater, indicating indexes with the
most potential to improve cluster performance.

To learn how to create indexes suggested by the Performance
Advisor, see :ref:`pa-create-suggested-indexes`.

Index Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each index suggested by the |pa| contains the following
metrics. These metrics apply specifically to queries which would be
improved by the index:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which would be
       improved.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Current average execution time in milliseconds for affected
       queries.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read per document returned by
       affected queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

   * - :guilabel:`In Memory Sort`
     - Current number of affected queries per hour that needed to be
       sorted in memory.

Sample Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each suggested index, the Performance Advisor shows the most
commonly executed query shapes which would be improved by index. For
each query shape, the Performance Advisor displays the following
metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which match the query
       shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Average execution time in milliseconds for queries
       which match the query shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read for
       every document returned by matching queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

The Performance Advisor also shows individual sample queries executed
which match the query shape, with specific metrics for that query.

.. _query-targeting:
.. _query-inefficiency-score:

Query Targeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each index suggestion includes an :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
score indicating how many documents were read for every document
returned for the index's corresponding query shapes. A score of 1
represents very efficient query shapes because every document read
matched the query and was returned with the query results. All suggested
indexes represent an opportunity to improve query performance.

Filter Index Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Performance Advisor suggests indexes for all clusters
in the deployment. To only show suggested indexes from a specific
collection, use the :guilabel:`Collection` dropdown at the top of
the Performance Advisor.

You can also adjust the time range the Performance Advisor takes into
account when suggesting indexes by using the :guilabel:`Time Range`
dropdown at the top of the Performance Advisor.

Limitations of Index Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timestamp Format for Indexes
````````````````````````````

The Performance Advisor cannot suggest indexes for MongoDB databases
configured to use the :manual:`ctime timestamp format
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>`. As a
workaround, set the timestamp format for such databases to either
:manual:`iso8601-utc
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>` or
:manual:`iso8601-local
</reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-timestampformat>`.

Log Size
````````

The Performance Advisor analyzes up to 200,000 of your cluster's most recent log lines.

.. _pa-create-suggested-indexes:

Create Suggested Indexes
------------------------

You can create :manual:`indexes </core/indexes>` suggested by the
Performance Advisor directly within the Performance Advisor itself. When
you create indexes, keep the ratio of reads to writes on the target
collection in mind. Indexes come with a performance cost, but are more
than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data sets. To
learn more about indexing strategies, see
:manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>`.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

- You can only create one index at a time through the Performance
  Advisor. If you want to create more simultaneously, you can do so
  using :ref:`Data Explorer <data-explorer-indexes>` or the
  :doc:`shell </tutorial/connect-to-mongodb>`

- Indexes created in the Performance Advisor are always created at
  the top level of the deployment. If you create an index while viewing
  the Performance Advisor for a single shard in a sharded cluster,
  |mms| creates that index for the whole sharded cluster.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To create a suggested index:

.. include:: /includes/steps/pa-create-index.rst

.. toctree::
