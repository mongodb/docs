.. note:: Apps created after May 28, 2024

    App Services Apps created *after* May 28, 2024 can store collections
    (arrays and dictionaries) of mixed data within a mixed data property.
    You can nest collections within other collections, which lets you store
    complex data structures such as JSON or MongoDB documents without having to
    define a strict data model.

    To use this feature with Atlas Device SDK, you must use one of the
    following minimum SDK versions:

    - C++ SDK: version TBD
    - Flutter SDK: v2.0.0 or later
    - Kotlin SDK: v2.0.0 or later

    - Node.js SDK: v12.9.0 or later
    - React Native SDK: v12.9.0 or later
    - Swift SDK: v10.51.0 or later

    This feature is *not* supported in the Java SDK.

    You can contact Support to learn more about enabling this feature in an
    existing app using a supported SDK.
