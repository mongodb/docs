Solution Overview 
-----------------

A major challenge for many insurance companies is inefficient
call centers where agents find it difficult to quickly locate
and deliver accurate information to customers. Studies have
shown that companies with superior customer experiences
outperform their peers. For instance, satisfied customers are
`80% more likely
<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-growth-engine-superior-customer-experience-in-insurance>`_
to renew their policies, directly contributing to growth.

This solution shows how MongoDB can transform call center
operations. It leverages AI and analytics to convert
unstructured audio files into searchable vectors. This allows
businesses to quickly access relevant information, identify
successful resolution strategies and frequently asked questions,
and improve the overall customer service experience.

Figure 1 shows how to transform raw audio recordings into
vectors. The pipeline works as follows:

#. **Store raw audio files:** Store past call recordings in their original audio format.

#. **Process audio files:** Use AI and analytic services, such as speech-to-text
   conversion, content summarization, and vectorization.

#. **Store vectors and metadata**: Store the generated vectors and their
   metadata, such as call timestamps and agent
   information,  in an operational data store.

Once the data is stored in vector format within the operational
data store, it becomes accessible for real-time applications.
Now, Vector Search can consume this data, or it can be
integrated into a `Retrieval-Augmented Generation
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/retrieval-augmented-generation>`__
(RAG) architecture. This approach combines `Large Language
Models
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/large-language-models>`__
(LLMs) with external knowledge sources to generate more accurate
and informative outputs.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

The system architecture, shown in Figure 2, contains the following modules and
functions:

- `Amazon Transcribe <https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/>`__
  receives the audio coming from the customerâ€™s phone and
  converts it into text.

- Cohere_ provides an embedding model through
  `Amazon Bedrock`_, which converts the text from
  Transcribe into vectors.

- `Atlas Vector Search`_ receives the query vector and returns a
  document that contains the most semantically similar FAQ in
  the database.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **Transform call centers with AI Services:** Integrate AI
  services, such as speech-to-text, vector embedding, and vector
  search, with MongoDB Atlas to transform traditional call
  centers with actionable voice data.
  
- **Integrate a RAG-based Architecture:** Combine a RAG
  architecture with Vector Search to generate faster agent
  responses, chatbots and automated workflows.

- **Implement real-time agent assistance:** Integrate agent
  assistance to boost business outcomes, such as higher customer
  satisfaction, stronger loyalty, and improved financial
  performance.

This solution serves as a foundation for advanced applications
that require complex interactions, such as agentic workflows,
and multi-step processes with LLMs and :ref:`hybrid search
<avs-reciprocal-rank-fusion>`.It also enhances chatbots and
voice bots capabilities, allowing them to deliver more relevant
and personalized responses to customers.
