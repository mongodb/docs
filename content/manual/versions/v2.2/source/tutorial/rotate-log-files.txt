Overview
--------

Log rotation archives the current log file and starts a new one.
Specifically, log rotation renames the current log file by appending
the filename with a timestamp, [#timestamp-format]_ opens a new log
file, and finally closes the old log. MongoDB will only rotate logs,
when you use the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command, or issue the process
a ``SIGUSR1`` signal as described in this procedure.

   :ref:`monitoring-standard-loggging` section.

Procedure
---------

The following steps create and rotate a log file:

1. Start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` with verbose logging, with appending
   enabled, and with the following log file:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log --logappend

#. In a separate terminal, list the matching files:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*

   For results, you get:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      server1.log

#. Rotate the log file using *one* of the following methods.

   - From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, issue the :dbcommand:`logRotate`
     command from the ``admin`` database:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        use admin
        db.runCommand( { logRotate : 1 } )

     This is the only available method to rotate log files on
     Windows systems.

   - From the UNIX shell, rotate logs for a single process by issuing
     the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        kill -SIGUSR1 <mongod process id>

   - From the UNIX shell, rotate logs for all :binary:`~bin.mongod`
     processes on a machine by issuing the following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        killall -SIGUSR1 mongod

#. List the matching files again:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*

   For results you get something similar to the following. The
   timestamps will be different.

   .. code-block:: none

      server1.log  server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00

   The example results indicate a log rotation performed at exactly
   ``11:30 pm`` on ``November 24th, 2011 UTC``, which is the local time
   offset by the local time zone. The original log file is the one with
   the timestamp. The new log is ``server1.log`` file.

   If you issue a second :dbcommand:`logRotate` command an hour later,
   then an additional file would appear when listing matching files,
   as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: none

      server1.log  server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00  server1.log.2011-11-25T00-30-00

   This operation does not modify the
   ``server1.log.2011-11-24T23-30-00`` file created earlier, while
   ``server1.log.2011-11-25T00-30-00`` is the previous ``server1.log``
   file, renamed. ``server1.log`` is a new, empty file that receives
   all new log output.

.. [#timestamp-format] MongoDB renders this timestamp in UTC (GMT) and
   formatted as :term:`ISODate`.
