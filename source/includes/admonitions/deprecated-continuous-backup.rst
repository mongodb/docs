.. admonition:: {+Old-Backup+} Deprecated
   :class: important

   MongoDB deprecated the {+Old-Backup+} feature. Clusters that use
   {+Old-Backup+} can continue to use it. MongoDB recommends using
   :doc:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s </backup/cloud-backup/overview>`.
   Effective 23 March 2020, all net new clusters can *only* use {+Cloud-Backup+}s.
