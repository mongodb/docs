This is a human-readable summary of some of the key terms of the full
agreement. It has *no legal value*. You should carefully review all
terms of the
:doc:`actual license </reference/legal/cloud-manager-backup-license>`
before agreeing.

Who Needs this License?
-----------------------

This :doc:`new license </reference/legal/cloud-manager-backup-license>`
is available only to customers who:

1. Are currently paying for a Cloud Manager Backup subscription but do
   not have a MongoDB Enterprise Server subscription, and

2. Want to upgrade to MongoDB 4.2 or later.

What Does this License Allow?
-----------------------------

The agreement grants you a
:doc:`license </reference/legal/cloud-manager-backup-license>` to
install and use the backup features of the MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise
Server *only during the term of your Cloud Manager Backup
subscription*.

The license allows you to use the Enterprise backup features. It does
not grant you rights to use any other features of the MongoDB
Enterprise Server.

If you would like to access and use all of the features of the MongoDB
Enterprise Server, please download the
:website:`MongoDB Enterprise Advanced Datasheet </collateral/value-mongodb-subscriptions-datasheet>`
for more information or :contact:`contact us </>` for
pricing details.

How Can I Use MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise for Backups?
-------------------------------------------------

If you are paying for Cloud Manager Backup, you can:

1. Upgrade to MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise or later; and
2. Review and accept the terms of the new license in the Cloud Manager
   console.

Why Is MongoDB Offering this License?
-------------------------------------

MongoDB is offering this upgrade path and license to customers who use
Cloud Manager Backup because:

- MongoDB enhanced the backup process of the core server.
- These enhancements are unavailable in the MongoDB Community Server.

When Do I Need to Upgrade to MongoDB Enterprise?
------------------------------------------------

If you want to use MongoDB 4.2 for your clusters, you *must* follow
this :doc:`new upgrade path </tutorial/change-mongodb-version>`.
You cannot back up MongoDB 4.2 databases using Cloud Manager Backup
with MongoDB 4.2 Community Server.
