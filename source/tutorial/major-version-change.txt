|service| enables you to upgrade the major version of an |service|
cluster at any time by 
:ref:`modifying the cluster <scale-cluster-version>`.

This procedure guides you through creating a staging cluster for
the purpose of testing your applications against the new 
MongoDB version. While optional, we strongly recommend
using this procedure to ensure your production application experiences
the smoothest possible transition to the new MongoDB version.

Considerations
--------------

There are a few things to be aware of before starting the upgrade
procedure:

- Your cluster must be in a healthy state before upgrading.

- You can only upgrade your |service| cluster one major version at a
  time. You cannot skip any major versions when upgrading your
  cluster.

- Each major version contains some features which may not be
  backward-compatible with previous versions. When upgrading to a new
  major version, check the :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes>` for
  changes which may affect your applications.

- After upgrading the MongoDB major version, you will not be able to 
  downgrade to previous versions.
