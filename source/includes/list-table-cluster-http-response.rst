          Sharded clusters running MongoDB 4.2 and new |aws| clusters
          of any type don't support this parameter. These clusters must
          use :doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`:
          ``providerBackupEnabled``

          If you created a new |aws| cluster and set

          This change doesn't affect existing |aws| clusters that use
          continuous backups.

       If set to ``true``, |service| enabled

       The ``mongodb+srv`` protocol tells the driver to look up the

       |service| synchronizes this list with the nodes in a cluster. If
       the connection string uses this |uri| format, you don't need to:

       - Append the seed list or
       - Change the |uri| if the nodes change.

       Use this |uri| format if your driver supports it. If it doesn't,
       use ``connectionStrings.standard``.

   * - ``diskSizeGB``
     - number
     - Capacity, in gigabytes, of the host's root volume. Increase this
       number to add capacity, up to a maximum possible value of
       ``4096`` (i.e., 4 TB). This value must be a positive integer.

       .. admonition:: When should you use ``diskSizeGB``?
          :class: note

          This setting:

          - Cannot be used with |nvme-clusters|
          - Cannot be used with Azure clusters
          - Must be used when ``replicationSpecs`` is set

       The minimum disk size for dedicated clusters is 10GB for |aws|
       and |gcp|, and 32GB for Azure. If you specify ``diskSizeGB``
       with a lower disk size, Atlas defaults to the minimum disk size
       value.

       .. important::

          |service| calculates storage charges differently
          depending on whether you choose the default value or a

   * - ``mongoURI``
     - string
     - Base
       :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>` for

       |service| only displays this field after the cluster is
       operational, not while it builds the cluster.

   * - ``mongoURIUpdated``
     - string

       the connection string with values appropriate for the cluster.

       To review the connection string format, see the

       To add database users to a |service| project, see

   * - ``name``
     - string
     - Name of the cluster as it appears in |service|.

   * - ``numShards``
     - number
     - Positive integer that specifies the number of shards for a
       sharded cluster.

       If this is set to ``1``, the cluster is a replica set.

       If this is set to ``2`` or higher, the cluster is a sharded
       cluster with the number of shards specified.

       For details on how this setting affects costs, see
       :ref:`server-number-costs`.

       The possible values are ``1`` through ``12``.

   * - ``paused``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates whether the cluster is paused or not.

   * - ``pitEnabled``
     - boolean
     - Flag that indicates if the cluster uses :ref:`Point-in-Time

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-only-m10-clusters.rst

       Flag that indicates if the cluster uses

       If ``true``, the cluster uses :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` for
       backups. If ``providerBackupEnabled`` *and* ``backupEnabled``
       are ``false``, the cluster does not use |service| backups.

     - boolean
     - *AWS only*. If enabled, the Amazon EBS encryption feature
       encrypts the server's root volume for both data at rest within
       the volume and for data moving between the volume and the
       cluster.

   * - ``replicationFactor``
     - number
     - Number of :term:`replica set` members. Each member keeps a
       copy of your databases, providing high availability and data
       redundancy.

       For multi-region clusters, add the total number of
       ``replicationSpec.<region>.electableNodes`` to calculate the
       replication factor of the cluster.

       If your cluster is a sharded cluster, each shard is a replica
       set with the specified replication factor.

       For information on how the replication factor affects costs, see
       :ref:`server-number-costs`. For more information on MongoDB
       replica sets, see :manual:`Replication </replication>` in the
       MongoDB manual.

       The possible values are ``3``, ``5``, or ``7``.

   * - ``replicationSpec``

       your cluster.

   * - | ``replicationSpec``
       | ``.<region>``
     - object
     - Physical location of the region. The ``<region>`` string
       corresponds to a region where |service| deploys your cluster.

       Each ``<region>`` object describes the region's priority in
       elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes |service|
       deploys to the region.

   * - | ``replicationSpec``
       | ``.<region>``
       | ``.analyticsNodes``
     - number
     - Number of :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`
       in the region. Analytics nodes are useful for handling analytic
       data such as reporting queries from |bic|. Analytics nodes are
       read-only, and can never become the :term:`primary`.

   * - | ``replicationSpec``
       | ``.<region>``
       | ``.electableNodes``
     - number
     - Number of electable nodes in the region. Electable nodes

   * - | ``replicationSpec``
       | ``.<region>``
       | ``.priority``
     - number
     - Election priority of the region. The highest possible priority
       is ``7``, which identifies the **Preferred Region** of the
       cluster. |service| places the :term:`primary` node in the
       **Preferred Region**. The lowest possible priority is ``0``,
       which identifies a read-only region.

       You can have any number of priority ``0`` read only regions.
       Priorities ``1`` through ``7`` are exclusive: only one region
       per cluster can be assigned a given priority.

   * - | ``replicationSpec``
       | ``.<region>``
       | ``.readOnlyNodes``
     - number
     - Number of read-only nodes in the region. Read-only nodes can

       local reads.

   * - ``replicationSpecs``
     - array
     - Configuration for each zone in a
       :doc:`Global Cluster </global-clusters>`. Each object in this

       Global Cluster.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``
       | ``.id``
     - string
     - Unique identifier of the replication object.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``
       | ``.regionsConfig``
     - object
     - Physical location of the region. Each ``regionsConfig`` object
       describes the region's priority in elections and the number and
       type of MongoDB nodes that |service| deploys to the region.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``

       Electable nodes can become the :term:`primary` and can
       facilitate local reads.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``
       | ``.regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>``
       | ``.readOnlyNodes``

       Read-only nodes can never become the :term:`primary`, but can
       facilitate local-reads.

       Specify ``0`` if you do not want any read-only nodes in the
       region.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``
       | ``.regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>``
       | ``.priority``
     - number
     - Election priority of the region. If you have regions with only
       read-only nodes, set this value to ``0``.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n]``
       | ``.zoneName``
     - string
     - Name for the zone in a |global-write-cluster|. Do not provide
       this value if ``clusterType`` is not ``GEOSHARDED``.

   * - ``srvAddress``
     - string
     - :manual:`Connection string </reference/connection-string>` for
       connecting to the |service| cluster. The ``+srv`` modifier
       forces the connection to use |tls|. The ``mongoURI`` parameter
       lists additional options.
