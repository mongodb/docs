On contemporary Linux systems, the ``iptables`` program provides
methods for managing the Linux Kernel's ``netfilter`` or network
packet filtering capabilities. These firewall rules make it possible
for administrators to control what hosts can connect to the system,
and limit risk exposure by limiting the hosts that can connect to a
system.

This document outlines basic firewall configurations for ``iptables``
firewalls on Linux. Use these approaches as a starting point for your
larger networking organization. For a detailed overview of security
practices and risk management for MongoDB, see :doc:`/security`.

Overview
--------

Rules in ``iptables`` configurations fall into chains, which describe
the process for filtering and processing specific streams of
traffic. Chains have an order, and packets must pass through earlier
rules in a chain to reach later rules. This document addresses only the
following two chains:

``INPUT``
   Controls all incoming traffic.

``OUTPUT``
   Controls all outgoing traffic.

Given the :doc:`default ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>` of all
MongoDB processes, you must configure networking rules that permit *only*
required communication between your application and the appropriate
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Be aware that, by default, the default policy of ``iptables`` is to
allow all connections and traffic unless explicitly disabled. The
configuration changes outlined in this document will create rules that
explicitly allow traffic from specific addresses and on specific
ports, using a default policy that drops all traffic that is not
explicitly allowed. When you have properly configured your
``iptables`` rules to allow only the traffic that you want to permit,
you can :ref:`iptables-change-default-policy-to-drop`.

Patterns
--------

This section contains a number of patterns and examples for
configuring ``iptables`` for use with MongoDB deployments. If you have
configured different ports using the :setting:`~net.port` configuration
setting, you will need to modify the rules accordingly.

.. _iptables-basic-rule-set:

Traffic to and from ``mongod`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pattern is applicable to all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running
as standalone instances or as part of a :term:`replica set`.

The goal of this pattern is to explicitly allow traffic to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance from the application server. In the
following examples, replace ``<ip-address>`` with the IP address of
the application server:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -A INPUT -s <ip-address> -p tcp --destination-port 27017 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ip-address> -p tcp --source-port 27017 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

The first rule allows all incoming traffic from ``<ip-address>`` on
port ``27017``, which allows the application server to connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. The second rule, allows outgoing traffic
from the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to reach the application server.

.. note:: Optional

   If you have only one application server, you can replace
   ``<ip-address>`` with either the IP address itself, such as:
   ``198.51.100.55``. You can also express this using CIDR notation as
   ``198.51.100.55/32``. If you want to permit a larger block of
   possible IP addresses you can allow traffic from a ``/24`` using
   one of the following specifications for the ``<ip-address>``, as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      10.10.10.10/24
      10.10.10.10/255.255.255.0

Traffic to and from ``mongos`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances provide query routing for :term:`sharded
clusters <sharded cluster>`. Clients connect to :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, which
behave from the client's perspective as :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances. In turn, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` connects to all
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances that are components of the sharded
cluster.

Use the same ``iptables`` command to allow traffic to and from these
instances as you would from the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances that are
members of the replica set. Take the configuration outlined in the
:ref:`iptables-basic-rule-set` section as an example.

Traffic to and from a MongoDB Config Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Config servers host the :term:`config database` that stores metadata
for sharded clusters. Config servers listen for connections on port
``27019``. As a result, add the following ``iptables`` rules to the
config server to allow incoming and outgoing connection on port
``27019``, for connection to the other config servers.

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -A INPUT -s <ip-address> -p tcp --destination-port 27019 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ip-address> -p tcp --source-port 27019 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Replace ``<ip-address>`` with the address or address space of *all*
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` that provide config servers.

Additionally, config servers need to allow incoming connections from
all of the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the cluster *and* all
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in the cluster. Add rules that
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -A INPUT -s <ip-address> -p tcp --destination-port 27019 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Replace ``<ip-address>`` with the address of the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and the shard :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances.

Traffic to and from a MongoDB Shard Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Shard servers <sharding-background>` default to port number
``27018``. You must configure the following ``iptables`` rules to allow
traffic to and from each shard:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -A INPUT -s <ip-address> -p tcp --destination-port 27018 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ip-address> -p tcp --source-port 27018 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Replace the ``<ip-address>`` specification with the IP address of all
:binary:`~bin.mongod`. This allows you to permit incoming and outgoing
traffic between all shards including constituent replica set members,
to:

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in the shard's replica sets.

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in other shards. [#migrations]_

Furthermore, shards need to be able make outgoing connections to:

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in the config servers.

Create a rule that resembles the following, and replace the
``<ip-address>`` with the address of the config servers and the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ip-address> -p tcp --source-port 27018 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

.. [#migrations] All shards in a cluster need to be able to
   communicate with all other shards to facilitate :term:`chunk` and
   balancing operations.

Provide Access For Monitoring Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongostat` diagnostic tool, when running with the
:option:`--discover <mongostat.--discover>` needs to be able to reach
all components of a cluster, including the config servers, the shard
servers, and the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

.. _iptables-change-default-policy-to-drop:

Change Default Policy to ``DROP``
---------------------------------

The default policy for ``iptables`` chains is to allow all
traffic. After completing all ``iptables`` configuration changes, you
*must* change the default policy to ``DROP`` so that all traffic that
isn't explicitly allowed as above will not be able to reach components
of the MongoDB deployment. Issue the following commands to change this
policy:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -P INPUT DROP

   iptables -P OUTPUT DROP

Manage and Maintain ``iptables`` Configuration
----------------------------------------------

This section contains a number of basic operations for managing and
using ``iptables``. There are various front end tools that automate
some aspects of ``iptables`` configuration, but at the core all
``iptables`` front ends provide the same basic functionality:

.. _iptables-make-all-rules-persistent:

Make all ``iptables`` Rules Persistent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default all ``iptables`` rules are only stored in memory. When
your system restarts, your firewall rules will revert to their
defaults. When you have tested a rule set and have guaranteed that it
effectively controls traffic you can use the following operations to
you should make the rule set persistent.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Linux, and related distributions
you can issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   service iptables save

On Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions, you can use the
following command to dump the ``iptables`` rules to the
``/etc/iptables.conf`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables-save > /etc/iptables.conf

Run the following operation to restore the network rules:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf

Place this command in your ``rc.local`` file, or in the
``/etc/network/if-up.d/iptables`` file with other similar operations.

List all ``iptables`` Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To list all of currently applied ``iptables`` rules, use the following
operation at the system shell.

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -L

Flush all ``iptables`` Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make a configuration mistake when entering ``iptables`` rules
or simply need to revert to the default rule set, you can use the
following operation at the system shell to flush all rules:

.. code-block:: bash

   iptables -F

If you've already made your ``iptables`` rules persistent, you will
need to repeat the appropriate procedure in the
:ref:`iptables-make-all-rules-persistent` section.
