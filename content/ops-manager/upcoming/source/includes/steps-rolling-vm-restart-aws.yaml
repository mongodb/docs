  a. Add a new instance to the replica set using its EC2 hostname. To
     learn more, see

  #. Wait for the initial sync to complete. To learn how to get the
     status of an initial sync, see the
     :manual:`MongoDB manual </reference/command/replSetGetStatus/>`.

  #. Remove one old replica set member with a ``mongodbdns.com``
     hostname. To learn more, see
     :manual:`Remove Members from Replica Set </tutorial/remove-replica-set-member>`.

  a. Add the last new instance to the replica set using its EC2
     hostname. To learn more, see
     :manual:`Add Members to a Replica Set </tutorial/expand-replica-set>`.

  #. Wait for the initial sync to complete. To learn how to get the
     status of an initial sync, see the
     :manual:`MongoDB manual </reference/command/replSetGetStatus/>`.

  #. Connect to the primary and step it down. To learn more, see
     :method:`rs.stepDown() <rs.stepDown>`.

     .. note::

        Stepping down the primary triggers at least one election for a
        new primary. To learn more about elections, see
        :ref:`replica-set-elections`.

  #. Remove the old primary with the ``mongodbdns.com`` hostname from
     the replica set. To learn more, see
     :manual:`Remove Members from Replica Set </tutorial/remove-replica-set-member>`.
