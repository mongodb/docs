The following limitations apply to {+atlas-sp+}:

- {+atlas-sp+} is currently only available on {+aws+}, in the 
  ``US-EAST-1`` region. This only applies to {+spi+}s themselves;
  your stream processors can still read from and write to {+clusters+}
  hosted on different cloud providers, or in different regions provided
  they are in the same project as the {+spi+}.

- A {+spi+} can use only {+clusters+} in the same project as sources or
  sinks.

- Only users with the :authrole:`Project Owner` or 
  :atlasrole:`Atlas admin` roles can use {+atlas-sp+}.

- {+atlas-sp+} currently supports only the following connection types:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Connection Type
     - Usage

   * - {+kafka+}
     - Source or Sink

   * - {+service+} Database
     - Source or Sink

   * - Sample Connection
     - Source Only

- {+atlas-sp+} currently supports only JSON-formatted data. It does not
  currently support alternative serializations such as Avro or Protocol 
  Buffers.

- For {+kafka+} connections, {+atlas-sp+} currently supports only the
  following security protocols:

  - ``PLAINTEXT``
  - ``SASL_PLAINTEXT``
  - ``SASL_SSL``

  {+atlas-sp+} currently doesn't support custom SSL certificates. 
  
  For ``SASL``, {+atlas-sp+} supports the following mechanisms:

  - ``PLAIN``
  - ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
  - ``SCRAM-SHA-512``

- {+atlas-sp+} currently doesn't support VPC peering for connections to
  {+kafka+}. After adding a connection to a {+kafka+} cluster to your 
  connection registry, you must add {+service+} IP addresses to an 
  access list for that cluster. For more information, 
  see :ref:`atlas-add-inbound-ips`.

- {+atlas-sp+} doesn't support 
  :manual:`$function </reference/operator/aggregation/function/>`
  JavaScript :abbr:`UDFs (user-defined functions)`.
