To complete this part of the tutorial, you will need to have completed 
the following:

- **Part 1:** :ref:`gst-deploy-adf`
- **Part 2:** :ref:`config-connection`

Procedure
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-federation.rst

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button for the {+fdi+} that you want to connect to. 

   .. step:: Choose the type of connection. 

      You can choose one of the following: 

      - :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` if you already configured endpoints
        and want to use the connection string for your endpoint.

        .. note:: 

           If you don't have a configured private endpoint to select in
           the :guilabel:`Connect` modal dropdown, the dropdown displays
           the standard connection string.

      - :guilabel:`Standard Connection` if you want to use your
        deployment's standard connection string.

   .. step:: For :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` connection type, select the configured endpoint to connect to from the dropdown.

   .. step:: Add a connection IP address and create a database user if you haven't already done so and click :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. step:: Choose your connection method. 

      You can connect using any of the following: 

      - :driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>`
      - {+Compass+}
      - {+mongosh+}
      - `VS Code <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/>`__
      - `{+asql+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/query/query-with-sql/>`__
      
      .. note:: 

         To :doc:`run the sample queries
         </data-federation/tutorial/run-queries>`, choose {+mongosh+}.

   .. step:: Connect to your {+fdi+}.

      To learn more about connecting to your {+fdi+} using your selected
