The MongoDB release team digitally signs all software packages to
certify that a particular MongoDB package is a valid and unaltered
MongoDB release. Before installing MongoDB, you should validate the 
package using either the provided PGP signature or SHA-256 checksum.

PGP signatures provide the strongest guarantees by checking both the
authenticity and integrity of a file to prevent tampering.

Cryptographic checksums only validate file integrity to prevent network
transmission errors.

Verify Linux/macOS Packages
---------------------------

Use PGP/GPG
~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB signs each release branch with a different PGP key. The public 
key files for each release branch since MongoDB 2.2 are available for
download from the `key server <https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/>`_ 
in both textual ``.asc`` and binary ``.pub`` formats.

Verify Windows Packages
-----------------------

This verifies the MongoDB binary against its SHA256 key.
