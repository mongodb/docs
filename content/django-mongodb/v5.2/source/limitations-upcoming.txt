Overview
--------

On this page, you can find information about supported and unsupported
features in {+django-odm+}. You can also find features
currently planned for future releases. We will prioritize these upcoming features
based on user demand, and you can request support
for a feature by :ref:`creating a JIRA issue <django-issues-and-help>`.

Performance Limitations
-----------------------

{+django-odm+} supports the following operations, but they might be less performant:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Operation
     - Performance Notes

   * - ``$expr`` operations
     - | Queries that use the ``$expr`` operator might run slowly, since 
         this operator often cannot predict which index to use and performs
         a collection scan. Some ``QuerySet`` operations, such as queries that
         specify an ``in`` lookup, use ``$expr`` to evaluate the query results and
         experience degraded performance.
       | We plan to address this performance issue in a
         post-GA release.

   * - ``$lookup`` operations
     - | Queries that use the ``$lookup`` operator might run slowly.
         To improve performance, we recommend that you use :ref:`embedded
         models <django-models-embedded>` instead of the ``$lookup`` operator when possible.
         To learn more about how to reduce ``$lookup`` operations, see the :atlas:`Reduce $lookup Operations
         </schema-suggestions/reduce-lookup-operations/>` guide in the MongoDB Atlas
         documentation.


MongoDB Features
----------------

This section indicates whether {+django-odm+} supports various
MongoDB features.

Index Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - MongoDB Feature
     - Current Support

   * - Search indexes
     - *Partially Supported.* The following advanced :ref:`index definition fields <index-definition-syntax>`
       are unsupported:

       - ``numPartitions``
       - ``analyzers``
       - ``storedSource``
       - ``synonyms``
       - ``typeSets``

       MongoDB does not support Search indexes on some data types. To
       view a list of unsupported types, see :ref:`Data Type Limitations <bson-data-types>`
       in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

   * - Vector Search indexes
     - *Partially Supported.* You can use {+django-odm+} to create basic Vector Search indexes
       that specify an index name, the fields to index, and a similarity function.
       All other :ref:`index definition fields <avs-index-definition>` are unsupported.

   * - Compound indexes
     - ✓

   * - Embedded document indexes
     - ✓

Data Type Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} currently supports all MongoDB data types not included
in the following table. To view a full list of supported types, see the

         limitations apply:
         - Foreign key fields are not supported.
         - Arbitrary or untyped embedded model fields are not supported. You must
           derive all fields from an ``EmbeddedModel`` class.

     - *Unsupported*. However, we plan to support this type
       in a post-GA release.

         following limitations:
         - ``QuerySet.union()`` is not supported within a transaction.
         - Savepoints, or nested atomic blocks, are not supported. The outermost atomic block starts
           a transaction, and any subsequent atomic blocks have no effect.
         - Your MongoDB deployment must be a replica set or sharded cluster.

Django Features
---------------

This section indicates whether the {+django-odm+} supports various
{+framework+} features.

Field Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} currently supports all {+framework+} fields not included in
the following table. To view a full list of supported fields, see the :ref:`django-models-django-fields`
section of the Create Models guide.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - {+framework+} Field Type
     - Current Support

   * - ``AutoField``
     - *Unsupported*. The ``BigAutoField`` and ``SmallAutoField`` types are also
       not supported. Instead, use ``ObjectIdField``.

   * - ``CompositePrimaryKey``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``DateTimeField``
     - | ✓
       | Microsecond granularity for ``DateTimeField`` values is not supported.

   * - ``DurationField``
     - | ✓
       | ``DurationField`` stores milliseconds rather than microseconds.

   * - ``ForeignKey``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - When possible, you should use an ``EmbeddedModelField`` instead of a
         ``ForeignKey`` field to avoid using ``$lookup`` operations. An
         ``EmbeddedModelField`` emulates a MongoDB embedded document and performs
         better than a ``ForeignKey`` field. To learn more about how to reduce
         ``$lookup`` operations, see the :atlas:`Reduce $lookup Operations
         </schema-suggestions/reduce-lookup-operations/>` guide in the Atlas
         documentation.
       - Performance of `CASCADE deletes <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CASCADE>`__
         on a ``ForeignKey`` field is not as performant as using an
         ``EmbeddedModelField``.

   * - ``GeneratedField``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``JSONField``
     - *Partially Supported*. You can use this field type with the
       following limitations:

       - {+django-odm+} cannot distinguish between a JSON and a SQL ``null`` value.
         Queries that use ``Value(None, JSONField())`` or the ``isnull`` lookup
         return both JSON and SQL ``null`` values.
       - Some queries with ``Q`` objects, such as ``Q(value__foo="bar")``, might
         not work as expected.
       - Filtering for ``None`` values incorrectly returns objects in which a field
         does not exist.

Query Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} currently supports all {+framework+} ``QuerySet`` methods not
included in the following table. To view the supported methods, see `QuerySet API

documentation.

   * - {+framework+} ``QuerySet`` Feature
     - Current Support

   * - ``delete()``
     - | ✓
       | You cannot use this method to perform
         queries that span multiple collections.

   * - ``difference()``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``extra()``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``intersection()``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - Pattern-matching lookups
     - | ✓
       | You can only use these lookups to query string fields.
       | The pattern-matching lookups are ``iexact``, ``startswith``, ``istartswith``,
         ``endswith``, ``iendswith``, ``contains``, ``icontains``, ``regex``, and
         ``iregex``

   * - ``prefetch_related()``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``raw()``
     - *Unsupported*. However, you can use the ``raw_aggregate()`` method
       to run queries that use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline syntax.

   * - ``select_for_update()``
     - *Unsupported*.

   * - ``update()``
     - | ✓
       | You cannot use this method to perform
         queries that span multiple collections.

Database Function Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+django-odm+} currently supports all database functions not included in
the following table. To view a full list of functions, see `Database Functions
