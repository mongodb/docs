If you need to rename a group created within your account, confirm the group
name appears in the :guilabel:`Group` drop down list at the top left of the MMS
interface. Then select the :guilabel:`Users` page and click the :guilabel:`Edit
Group Name` button at the top of the page. Type the new name for your current
group in the Edit Group Name interface and click the :guilabel:`Submit` button.

For security and auditing reasons, you cannot use a group name used earlier.

If you continue to have problems, `contact MMS Support
