The multi-cluster sharded cluster deployment topology is currently in public preview. 
Multi-cluster sharded cluster deployments are not recommended for 
use in production environments, as there may be breaking changes in the 
functionality before this features becomes generally available and supported 
for production use. Moreover, during the public preview we are unable to provide 
support for this specific deployment topology without prior commitment from the 
product and engineering teams responsible for this feature.

.. important:: 
   
   The multi-cluster sharded cluster functionality makes it possible to deploy
   MongoDB resources across multiple |k8s| clusters in multiple geographic regions; 
   however, doing so will likely increase latency for replication operations.

If you are interested in discussing the public preview of multi-cluster 
sharded cluster deployments, or have any feedback on the feature, please contact 
your MongoDB account team.

The scope of the public preview release of the multi-cluster sharded 
cluster feature includes the following:

- Implement multi-cluster sharded cluster deployment capabilities by defining 
  a ``MongoDB`` custom resource as having a ``spec.topology`` value of 
  ``MultiCluster``, and a ``spec.type`` value of ``ShardedCluster``.

- Introduce the ability to override any settings for a particular shard 
  via the new ``spec.shard.shardOverrides`` field.

- Ensure backwards compatibility for existing :ref:`single-cluster MongoDB sharded 
  cluster deployments <deploy-sharded-cluster>`.

To learn more about the specific configuration options for the multi-cluster 
sharded cluster topology, please see the :ref:`sharded cluster reference documentation <sharded-cluster-settings>`.
