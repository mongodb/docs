   - If the collection is empty, {{op}} creates the unique index on the
     shard key if such an index does not already exist.

   - If the collection is not empty, you must create the index first
     before using {{op}}.

   Although you can have a unique :term:`compound index` where the shard
   key is a :ref:`prefix <compound-index-prefix>`, if using ``unique``
   parameter, the collection must have a unique index that is on the shard
   key.
