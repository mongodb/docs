This tutorial describes how to perform an |ann| search on a vector in
the ``plot_embeddings`` field in the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
collection on your |service| {+cluster+}. To demonstrate this, it takes
you through the following steps:

1. Create an {+avs+} index on the numeric field named
   ``plot_embeddings`` in the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
   collection. 
#. Run {+avs+} queries against the ``plot_embeddings`` field in the
   ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection.

Prerequisites 
-------------

To complete this tutorials, you must have the following: 

- An |service| {+cluster+} with MongoDB version 6.0.11, or v7.0.2 or later
  (including :abbr:`RCs (Release Candidates)`).

- The :doc:`sample data </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  {+cluster+}.
  
- One of the following applications to run queries on your |service|
  {+cluster+}:

  - {+mongosh+}
  - :driver:`C# </csharp/current/>` 

  You can also use {+avs+} with local |service| deployments that you 
  create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see :atlascli:`Create a
  Local Atlas Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

Create the {+avs+} Index 
------------------------------------

This section demonstrates how to create an {+avs+} index on the
``plot_embeddings`` field in the  ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` 
collection for running vector queries against the field.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an {+avs+} index, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access 
Admin` or higher access to the project.

Overview 
~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how to query the indexed vector data in
the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection using the
the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. These sample queries also demonstrate 
the various :manual:`comparison query
</reference/operator/query-comparison/>` and :manual:`aggregation 
pipeline </reference/operator/aggregation/>` operators that we can use
in the query to pre-filter the data that we perform the semantic
search on.
