About {+adl+}
---------------------

MongoDB {+adl+} is now an analytic-optimized object storage service for 
extracted data. {+adl+} provides an analytic storage service optimized 
for flat or nested data with low latency query performance.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+adl+} requires an ``M10`` or higher backup-enabled |service| cluster 
with cloud backup jobs running on a specified cadence. To learn more 
about cloud backups, see :atlas:`Back Up Your Database Deployment 
</backup/cloud-backup/overview/>`.

Supported Types of Data Source 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+adl+} supports collection snapshots from |service| clusters as a data 
source for extracted data. {+adl+} automatically extracts data from the 
snapshots, and partitions and stores data in an analytics-optimized 
format.

Sample Uses 
-----------

You can use {+adl+} to: 

- Isolate analytical workloads from your operational cluster.
- Provide a consistent view of cluster data from a snapshot for long 
  running aggregations using ``$out``.
- Query and compare across versions of your cluster data at different 
  points in time.

{+adl+} Regions 
-----------------------

{+adl+} provides optimized storage in the following |aws| regions:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-supported-aws-regions.rst

{+adl+} automatically selects the region closest to your |service| 
cluster for storing extracted data. 

Billing 
-------

You incur {+adl+} charges per GB per month based on the |aws| region 
where the extracted data is stored. You incur {+adl+} costs for the 
following items:

- Extraction of data from your data source
- Storage on the cloud object storage

Extraction Costs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+adl+} charges you for the resources utilized to extract, upload, and 
transfer data. {+adl+} charges for the :atlas:`snapshot export 
</backup/cloud-backup/export/>` operations is based on the following: 

- Cost per GB for snapshot extraction 
- Cost per hour on the |aws| server for snapshot export download 
- Cost per GB per hour for snapshot export restore storage
- Cost per |iops| per hour for snapshot export storage |iops|

Storage Costs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+adl+} charges for storing and accessing stored data is based on the 
following:

- Cost per GB per day 
- Cost for every one thousand storage access requests, where each 
  access request is a dataset partition being processed
