Initial Syncs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the upgrade, ensure that no initial sync is in
progress. Performing the upgrade while an initial sync is in
progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure includes the command-line option
:option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>` or the configuration option
:setting:`net.bindIp` when restarting the replica set.

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, the options must be specified when the replica
set members are run on different hosts or if remote clients connect to
the deployment. Omit if all members are run on the same host and all
clients are local to the host.

.. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

Read Concern Majority (3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB enables support for
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern by default.

Starting in 3.6.1 and MongoDB 4.0.3, you can disable read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"` to prevent the storage cache pressure from
immobilizing a deployment with a three-member replica set with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded cluster with
a three-member PSA shards.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-disable-rc-majority.rst

For more information, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Change Streams Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.0 introduces new hex-encoded string change stream
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.0.rst

.. admonition:: When upgrading from MongoDB 3.6 to MongoDB 4.0.7 or greater
   :class: important

   When upgrading from MongoDB 3.6 to MongoDB 4.0.7 or later, a client
   may try to resume change streams using the new ``v1`` resume token
   when connected to a member that has not been updated (i.e. only
   accepts BinData resume tokens) and fail. In such cases, the client
   must wait for the upgrade to complete before resuming change streams.

   After upgrading, if you later decide to downgrade to MongoDB 3.6, to
   resume a change stream, clients can use a pre-upgrade resume token
   (if available) on the 3.6 deployment. Otherwise, clients will need
   to start a new change stream.

Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All replica set members must be running version |oldversion|. To
upgrade a replica set from an |olderseries| and earlier, *first*
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
3.6-series release </release-notes/3.6-upgrade-replica-set>`, and
then follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to
|newversion|.


Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-mongodb-cr.rst

.. seealso:: |compatibility|


Remove ``pv0`` for Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-pv0.rst

Remove Master-Slave Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-master-slave.rst

Remove Support for ``$isolated``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-upgrade-prereq-isolated.rst

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| replica set must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.6``.

To ensure that all members of the replica set have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.6``, connect to each
replica set member and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the primary. A majority of the data-bearing
members must be available:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
:replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a
"rolling" upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available.

.. include:: /includes/steps/4.0-upgrade-replica-set.rst

Additional Upgrade Procedures
-----------------------------

- To upgrade a standalone, see :ref:`4.0-upgrade-standalone`.
- To upgrade a sharded cluster, see :ref:`4.0-upgrade-sharded-cluster`.
