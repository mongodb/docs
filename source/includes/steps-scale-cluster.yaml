  For an existing cluster, you can modify the fields
  listed in the table below. As you make changes, |service| displays
  the updated costs.

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 35 65
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Option

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Instance Size`

       - You can change the memory, storage, and IOPS (speed)
         specification.

     * - :guilabel:`Replication Factor`

       - You can change the number of members in your cluster's
         :term:`replica set`.

         If your deployment is a sharded cluster, each shard is a
         replica set, and the replica factor determines the number of
         members in each shard replica set.

         See :manual:`Replication </replication>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want a sharded cluster?`

       - If your cluster is a replica set, you can change the
         deployment to a sharded cluster. :term:`Sharded clusters
         <sharded cluster>` support horizontal scaling.

         Each shard in the sharded cluster is a replica set, consisting
         of the number of members specified by the replication factor.

         |service| runs the :ref:`config servers
         <sharding-config-server>` as a three-member replica set.

         For more information on sharded clusters, see
         :manual:`Sharding </sharding>` in the MongoDB manual.

         .. important::

            Changing to a sharded cluster requires a new
            :doc:`connection string </connect-to-cluster>` for
            accessing MongoDB. For the new connection string,
            see :doc:`connect-to-cluster` after the changes are
            deployed. You must update your applications to use the new
            string.

     * - :guilabel:`Number of Shards`

       - This field appears only if the value for :guilabel:`Do you
         want a sharded cluster?` is ``Yes``. You can increase or
         decrease the number of shards. You cannot have fewer than two
         shards.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want to enable backup?`

       - If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at regular
         intervals and retains them according to your group's :ref:`retention
         policy <retention-policy>`. You can restore a backup to the same
         cluster or any cluster in your group that has the same topology.
