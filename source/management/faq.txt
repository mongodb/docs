Passwords for the `MongoDB Jira`_ instance and MMS are the same,
although the length and character requirements are different for Jira
and MMS.

How do I add a user to my company/group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user already has a `MongoDB Jira`_ or MMS account, you can add
their username to your group on the admin page.

If the user does not have a Jira account then they can `create a new
account <https://mms.mongodb.com/user/register/user>`_. After they have
created an account, you can add their username to the company/group on
the admin page.

What is "Exposed DB Host Check," and why did MMS send me an "MMS Found Exposed Databases!!!" Email?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo: is that the email subject going forward?

If enabled on the `settings page`_, the |monitoring| application servers will
attempt to connect to your MongoDB instances to help ensure
that your firewall is properly configured. This is a weak security
validation that should not replace other auditing or intrusion
detection system procedures.

This test runs once per day and attempts to connect using both the IP
address and the non-canonical host identifier that you see in the
:guilabel:`Name` field of the Hosts page.

.. _`settings page`: https://mms.mongodb.com/settings

How do I modify my alert settings?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable, disable, or modify alerts on the settings tab of the
*Activity* page.

How frequently can alerts be set?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts are processed on a 5 minute interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency
for an alert is 5 minutes.

Do Web or Database Hosting Companies Offer MongoDB Management Service?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web hosting companies can offer the ability to use MMS with their hosted
MongoDB databases, for example, to set up software agents to monitor and backup
databases hosted on their servers. MongoDB has confirmed compatability with
MongoHQ, MongoLab, and Heroku. Implementation details depend on each
hosting company.
   
`MongoHQ`_ offers MMS upon request as part of their Database as a Service
(DaaS) business. They offer `a scaling checklist`_ for using MongoDB in their
environment.

`MongoLab`_ offers MMS as part of their Database as a Service (DaaS) business.
MongoLab offers the service on their dedicated plans and shared replica set
plan. They also provide `instructions to tune MongoDB performance`_ with MMS on
their servers.

MongoHQ and MongoLab are MongoDB Advanced Partners.

`Heroku`_ offers web hosting with a `MongoHQ add-on`_ and `MongoLab add-on`_ to
use MongoDB databases from these database hosting companies. Heroku also offers
MMS monitoring of those databases with `detailed setup instructions`_.
