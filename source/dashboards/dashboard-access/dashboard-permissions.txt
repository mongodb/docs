Dashboard permissions dictate which |charts| users have access to the
dashboard and the actions they can perform on the dashboard. The
following dashboard permissions are available:

.. _dashboard-roles:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - Viewer
     - Can perform the following actions:
       
       - Open a dashboard and view charts that are backed by a data 
         source the user has permission to view. If the user doesn't 
         have the appropriate :atlas:`project role 
         </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` on a chart's 
         backing data source, the dashboard doesn't render the chart.

         ``Viewers`` cannot make any modifications to the dashboard.

       - Open a dashboard and view charts that have been shared with 
         the user's |service| organization. To learn more about sharing 
         dashboards with an entire organization, see 
         :ref:`dashboard-access-org`.

       - Filter dashboards based on available fields.

       - Configure refresh settings and manually refresh dashboard
         data.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-refresh-persistence.rst

   * - Author
     - Has all privileges of ``Viewer`` and can also:
     
       - Add, modify, and delete charts,
       - :ref:`Add <add-dashboard-filters>`, 
         :ref:`edit <edit-dashboard-filters>`, 
         and :ref:`delete <delete-dashboard-filters>` dashboard filters,
       - Specify which fields can be used for
         :ref:`Unauthenticated embedded chart filters
         <specify-filter-fields>`,
       - Change dashboard layout,
       - Rename the dashboard.

   * - Owner
     - Has all privileges of ``Author`` and can also:

       - :ref:`Manage permissions <dashboard-permissions>` on the
         dashboard
       - :ref:`Delete the dashboard <dashboard-delete>`.

       The creator of the dashboard automatically has the
       ``Owner`` permission. The creator cannot be removed from the
       list of dashboard users and their ``Owner`` permission cannot be
       modified.

To view a chart on a dashboard, the user must have both:

- A :atlas:`project role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`
  that grants access to the data source. To learn more about granting
  access, see :ref:`permission-model`.
- Any role on the dashboard, or access to an |service| organization's 
  dashboard through 
  :ref:`organization-wide sharing <dashboard-access-org>`.

.. note:: Default Dashboard Permissions

   You can have no permissions on a dashboard. That dashboard won't
   appear on your :ref:`dashboards page <dashboards-tab>`. Newly-created
   dashboards aren't shared by default. Only the dashboard ``Owner``
   can view the dashboard until they grant access to more users.

View Dashboard Permissions
--------------------------

To view permissions for a specific dashboard, hover over the icon
next to the dashboard's :guilabel:`Share` button. A tooltip appears
describing what permission you have on the dashboard, who the owner
of the dashboard is, and who else has access to the dashboard.

The following table lists the possible icons and their associated
permissions:

.. _dashboard-permission-icons:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Icon
     - Description

   * - :icon-fa5:`eye`  Eye Icon
     - You have ``Viewer`` permission.

   * - :icon-fa5:`user-friends`  Group Icon
     - You have either ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`additional users <dashboard-specific-access>` or
       :ref:`Everyone in this project <dashboard-access-everyone>`
       have some level of access to the dashboard.

   * - :icon-fa5:`building`  Office Icon
     - You have either ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and :ref:`Everyone in this organization <dashboard-access-org>`
       has ``Viewer`` permission. 

   * - :icon-fa5:`globe`  Globe Icon
     - :ref:`Everyone with the link  <dashboard-access-link>` has ``Viewer`` permission. 
  
   * - :icon-fa5:`lock`  Lock Icon
     - You have ``Owner`` permission and no other user has access.

.. note::

   If :ref:`Anyone with this link can view <dashboard-access-link>` 
   sharing is enabled and you have ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission, 
   the icon doesn't change.

.. _modify-dashboard-permissions:

Modify Dashboard Permissions
----------------------------

.. important::

   To modify a dashboard's :ref:`permissions <dashboard-roles>`, you
   must have the ``Owner`` role on that dashboard.

To modify dashboard permissions, either click the click the
:ref:`permission icon <dashboard-permission-icons>` at the top-right of
the dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-permission-icon.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard permission icon

Or click the :guilabel:`Share` button at the top-right of the
dashboard within the specific dashboard view:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-share-button.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard access button

With the :guilabel:`Share Dashboard` dialog open, read the
following sections to learn how to grant permissions to a dashboard to:

- :ref:`A specific user <dashboard-specific-access>`
- :ref:`All users in your project <dashboard-access-project>`
- :ref:`All users in your organization <dashboard-access-org>`
- :ref:`Any user with your link <dashboard-access-link>`

.. _dashboard-specific-access:

Specific User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To give specific users permissions on the dashboard:

1. Select the :guilabel:`Project` tab.

#. Search for the desired user using the search bar. You can search for 
   users by their username or email address.

#. Click the desired user to add them to the permissions list.

#. Use the dropdown to the right of the user's name to assign the
   appropriate :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>`.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when the desired user can't
      access one or more data sources used on the dashboard. The user
      can't see any charts that use that data source.

      A :authrole:`Project Owner` can assign the user
      a :atlas:`project role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` 
      with the access you want the user to have. To learn more about 
      granting access, see :ref:`permission-model`.

#. Repeat these steps for each user you would like to provide dashboard
   permissions for.

#. Click :guilabel:`Close`. |charts| saves your changes automatically.

To remove permissions for a user, click the trash can icon to the right
of the user's name.

.. _dashboard-access-project:
.. _dashboard-access-everyone:

Access for All Users in a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow access to the dashboard for all users in your |service|
project:

1. Select the :guilabel:`Project` tab.

#. Toggle the switch to the right of the :guilabel:`<Project name>` user to :icon-fa5:`toggle-on` ``On``.

#. Select the :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>` to apply to all
   |charts| users.

   A user's own permissions override others that could come from the
   :guilabel:`Everyone in this project` setting.

   .. example::

      If :guilabel:`Everyone in this project` has the :guilabel:`Author` permission and
      **Alice** has the :guilabel:`Viewer` permission, **Alice**'s
      effective permission is :guilabel:`Viewer`.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when
      :guilabel:`Everyone in <Project Name>` can't access one or more
      data sources used on the dashboard. A user might not see a chart
      that uses a data source to which the user wasn't granted
      access.

      A :authrole:`Project Owner` can assign the user
      a :atlas:`project role </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` 
      with the access you want the user to have. To learn more about 
      granting access, see :ref:`permission-model`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Close`. |charts| saves your changes automatically.

.. _dashboard-access-org:

Access for All Users in an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow access to the dashboard for all users in your |service|
organization:

1. Select the :guilabel:`Organization` tab.

#. Toggle the :guilabel:`Can view this dashboard` switch to the right the :guilabel:`<Organization name>` user to :icon-fa5:`toggle-on` ``On``.

   |charts| provides a link with which users in your organization can 
   view the dashboard.

#. Click :guilabel:`Close`. |charts| saves your changes automatically.

.. note::

   If your organization uses a :abbr:`SSO (Single Sign-On)` provider,
   MongoDB Cloud prompts users in your organization sign to in through your 
   provider to view the dashboard. Users who authenticate through your 
   organization's SSO provider don't need an |service| account.

Access Dashboards Shared with Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view all dashboards shared with your organization on the 
:guilabel:`Dashboards` page for your organization.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-charts.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-organization-dashboards.rst

.. _dashboard-access-link:

Access for Users with a Link to the Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to view a dashboard using a public link, enable
:ref:`Unauthenticated External Data Access <data-source-embedding>`
on each data source in the charts in the dashboard.

To allow access to the dashboard for users on your |charts|
deployment who have a direct link:

1. Select the :guilabel:`Public` tab.

#. Toggle the :guilabel:`Can view this dashboard` switch to the right of the :guilabel:`Public` user to :icon-fa5:`toggle-on` ``On``.

   |charts| generates a public link with which anyone can 
   view the dashboard. A user's permissions don't affect their ability 
   to view a chart using a public link.

   .. important::

      |charts| displays a warning banner when a 
      :authrole:`Project Owner` hasn't enabled
      :ref:`Unauthenticated External Data Access <data-source-embedding>`.
      Users with the link won't be able to see the charts with the
      specified data source.

      A :authrole:`Project Owner` can change the settings to allow
      viewers of all :atlas:`project roles 
      </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` to access the data. To
      learn more about granting access, see :ref:`permission-model`.

#. (Optional) Click :guilabel:`Protect this link with a passcode`.

   |charts| generates a passcode to protect your dashboard. When users
   try to view your public link, they must enter this passcode to view
   your dashboard.

   If you don't like the passcode that |charts| generates, or need to
   change your passcode, click :guilabel:`Generate` for a new passcode.

   If you uncheck :guilabel:`Protect this link with a passcode` and
   click it again, |charts| generates a new passcode.

   .. note::

      After a user enters the passcode, the dashboard displays for five days unless they manually refresh the browser session.
      After five days, users must sign in with the passcode again.

#. Click :guilabel:`Close`. |charts| saves your changes automatically.

.. warning:: Link Sharing with Sensitive Data

   Don't share links to dashboards that display sensitive data. You
   can't verify who has access to the link.
