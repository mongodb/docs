msgid ""
"For the MMAPv1 storage engine, if an update operation causes a document to "
"exceed the currently allocated :term:`record size`, MongoDB relocates the "
"document on disk with enough contiguous space to hold the document. Updates "
"that require relocations take longer than updates that do not, particularly "
"if the collection has indexes. If a collection has indexes, MongoDB must "
"update all index entries. Thus, for a collection with many indexes, the move"
" will impact the write throughput."

"By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` to add :ref:`padding "
"automatically <record-allocation-strategies>` for the MMAPv1 storage engine."
" The :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` ensures that MongoDB allocates document "
"space in sizes that are powers of 2, which helps ensure that MongoDB can "
