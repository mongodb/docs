title: Disable the balancer.
stepnum: 1
ref: disable-balancer
pre: |
  To disable the :ref:`balancer <sharding-internals-balancing>`,
  connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run
  :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` in the ``config`` database.
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use config
    sh.stopBalancer()
post: |
  For more information, see the
  :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

title: "If necessary, lock one secondary member of each replica set."
stepnum: 2
ref: lock
pre: |
  If your secondary does not have journaling enabled *or* its
  journal and data files are on different volumes, you **must** lock
  the secondary's :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance before capturing a backup.

  If your secondary has journaling enabled and its journal and data
  files are on the same volume, you may skip this step.
 
  .. important::

     If your deployment requires this step, you must perform it on one
     secondary of each shard and, if your sharded cluster uses a
     replica set for the config servers, one secondary of the
     :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS) <replset-config-servers>`.

  Ensure that the :term:`oplog` has sufficient capacity to allow these
  secondaries to catch up to the state of the primaries after finishing
  the backup procedure. See :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` for more
  information.
   
action:
  - heading: Lock shard replica set secondary.
    pre: |
      For each shard replica set in the sharded cluster, connect a
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the secondary member's
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and run :method:`db.fsyncLock()`. 
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.fsyncLock()
    post: |
      When calling :method:`db.fsyncLock()`, ensure that the connection
      is kept open to allow a subsequent call to
      :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.
  - heading: Lock config server replica set secondary.
    pre: |
      If locking a secondary of the CSRS, confirm that the member has
      replicated data up to some control point. To verify, first connect a
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the CSRS primary and perform a write
      operation with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern on a
      control collection:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      use config
      db.BackupControl.findAndModify(
         {
           query: { _id: 'BackupControlDocument' },
           update: { $inc: { counter : 1 } },
           new: true,
           upsert: true,
           writeConcern: { w: 'majority', wtimeout: 15000 } }
         }
      );
  - pre: |
      The operation should return the modified (or inserted) control
      document:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       { "_id" : "BackupControlDocument", "counter" : 1 }
  - pre: |
      Query the CSRS secondary member for the returned control
      document. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the CSRS secondary
      to lock and use :method:`db.collection.find()` to query for the
      control document:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.getMongo().setReadPref('secondary');
      use config;

      db.BackupControl.find(
         { "_id" : "BackupControlDocument", "counter" : 1 }
      ).readConcern('majority');
  - post: |
         If the secondary member contains the latest control document, it
         is safe to lock the member. Otherwise, wait until the member
         contains the document or select a different secondary member
         that contains the latest control document.
  - pre: |
       To lock the secondary member, run :method:`db.fsyncLock()` on
       the member:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       db.fsyncLock()
    post: |
      When calling :method:`db.fsyncLock()`, ensure that the connection is
      kept open to allow a subsequent call to :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.

title: Back up one of the config servers.
stepnum: 3
ref: backup-config-server
content: |
  
  .. note::

     Backing up a :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` backs
     up the sharded cluster's metadata. You only need to back up one
     config server, as they all hold the same data. If you are using
     CSRS config servers, perform this step against the locked config
     server.
  
  To create a file-system snapshot of the config server, follow the
  procedure in :ref:`lvm-backup-operation`.
---
title: Back up a replica set member for each shard.
stepnum: 4
ref: backup-locked-shards
content: |
  If you locked a member of the replica set shards, perform this step
  against the locked secondary.
  
  You may back up the shards in parallel. For each shard, create a
  snapshot, using the procedure in
  :doc:`/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots`.
---
title: Unlock all locked replica set members.
stepnum: 5
ref: unlock
pre: |
  If you locked any :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances to capture the backup,
  unlock them.

  To unlock the replica set members, use :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
  method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. For each locked member, use the
  same :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell used to lock the instance.
action: 
  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.fsyncUnlock()
---
title: Enable the balancer.
stepnum: 6
ref: enable-balancer
pre: |
  To re-enable to balancer, connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run
  :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`.
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    sh.setBalancerState(true)
...
