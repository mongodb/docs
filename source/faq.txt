What is an Operator?
--------------------

An operator is a standard mechanism that extends the control plane of
|k8s| to managing custom |k8s| resources. Because each operator is
built for its own Custom Resources (CRs), it can contain logic that
addresses the type of service that the operator is built for. For the
|k8s-op-short|, the operator includes the logic for the deployment of
MongoDB Server and Ops Manager instances.

Each CR used by the |k8s-op-short| represents an element of a MongoDB 
Server deployment in |k8s|, and has options for customizing that part
of the deployment. Once you configure these objects in the |k8s| 
deployment, the operator builds native |k8s| objects, such as Stateful 
Sets that are necessary to create Pods according to your specified 
requirements for MongoDB Servers. The |k8s-op-short| also facilitates
configuration of MongoDB Server features, such as database backups, 
through interaction with |cloud| or |onprem|.

Why should I run MongoDB Server and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s|?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you deploy MongoDB Server or MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s| 
through the |k8s-op-full|, your deployments can benefit from the 
resilience and simple orchestration that |k8s| provides.

The only supported way to deploy MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s| is
through the |k8s-op-full|. The |k8s-op-full| simplifies your daily workflows
and makes it easier for MongoDB technical support staff to assist you when needed.

Which |k8s| platforms are supported for MongoDB Server deployments?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB Server supports any platform that builds upon native |k8s| without
changing the default logic or behavior. In practice, this means that
MongoDB Server supports any |k8s| platform
`certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation <https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/>`__.
To learn more, see :ref:`MongoDB Kubernetes Operator Compatibility <k8s-compatibility>`.

How many deployments can |k8s-op-full| support?
-----------------------------------------------

|k8s-op-short| can support up to 50 deployments. However, changes made to
large numbers of deployments at the same time result in long reconciliation times.
To avoid prolonged reconciliation times, limit a given |k8s-op-short| instance
to 20 deployments. To learn more, see the :ref:`production notes <deploy_recommended-number-sets>`.

Should I run MongoDB Server in |k8s| in the same cluster as the application using it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To help minimize latency, consider colocating your database and applications on
the same |k8s| cluster if your deployment architecture allows this.

Can I deploy MongoDB Server across multiple |k8s| clusters?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes. To learn more, see :ref:`Deploy MongoDB Resources on Multiple Kubernetes Clusters <multi-cluster>`.
