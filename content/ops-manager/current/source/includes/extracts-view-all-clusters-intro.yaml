   .. note::

      For an |onprem| administrator, the view displays all |clusters|
      to which the administrator has access, not just those to which
      the administrator belongs. To change this behavior, see the
      :setting:`mms.allclusters.onlyMembership` setting.

   .. |clusters| replace:: deployments

   .. |cluster| replace:: deployment

   .. |Cluster| replace:: Deployment
