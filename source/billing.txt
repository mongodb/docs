   |service| does not accept prepaid cards as a method of payment.

|service| charges by the hour for your MongoDB clusters. |service| tabulates
costs daily and displays your current monthly costs in the upper right corner.
To view line-item charges, click |service| :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`, and then the :guilabel:`Usage Details` link.

As you create or modify a cluster, you can compare the costs of different
options before applying them. |service| displays the costs, except for data
transfer, in a :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box.

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box does not display :ref:`data transfer
   costs <data-transfer-costs>`.

.. _instance-size-costs:

Instance Size
-------------

|service| provides different instance sizes. Each has a default RAM
size, storage capacity, and maximum storage speed, which is included in the
instance's per-hour charge. The instance size you select is used for all the
data-bearing [#data-bearing]_ servers in your cluster.

|service| provides default amounts of data storage as part of the base
per-hour cost of your instance. If you add capacity or speed, you incur
additional costs on top of the base cost. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
shows your overall charges.

.. _storage-capacity:

Storage Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for storage capacity differently depending on whether you
use the instance default or a custom size. If you use the default, storage is
included in the instance's per-hour cost. If you customize, |service| charges
for the entire amount of storage, not the difference from the default size.

For example, if the instance default is 80 GB and if you increase storage to
100 GB, the change in cost is the charge for 100 GB. If you then increase
storage to 120 GB, the change in cost is the charge for 20 GB.

.. note::

   Increasing storage capacity can change the max IOPS available
   with each :guilabel:`Custom Storage Speed`.

.. _storage-speed:

Custom Storage Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| measures storage speed as maximum IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per
Second). Each |service| :ref:`instance type <instance-size-costs>` offers a
:guilabel:`Standard` storage speed that is included in the instance's per-hour
cost. The maximum IOPS of the standard speed depend on the instance type.

For most instance types, you can increase storage speed from
:guilabel:`Standard` to :guilabel:`Fast` or :guilabel:`Fastest`, which affects
costs. Selecting a custom speed changes both IOPS and the type of storage
used. The storage type changes from a general-purpose SSD to a provisioned-IOPS
SSD. For more information on storage types, see
`<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`_.

.. _data-transfer-costs:

Data Transfer
-------------

|service| charges for data transfer between the |service| server and another
server. Data transfer charges include traffic between cluster nodes, including
an out-bound transfer from the source node and an in-bound transfer to the
destination node within the same region. Charges for data transfer
increase as follows, from lowest to highest:

- Data transfer between the originating MongoDB |service| server and a server
  in the same region.

- Data transfer between the originating MongoDB |service| server and a server
  in a different region.

- Data transfer between the originating MongoDB |service| server and a server
  not in an region.

|service| tabulates data transfer costs daily.

.. _region-costs:

Region
------

Instance and storage costs vary by region. In addition, the region
affects data transfer charges, as described in the
:ref:`data-transfer-costs` section.

.. _server-number-costs:

Number of Servers
-----------------

|service| charges the instance cost and data storage cost for each
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in your cluster. For a replica set, the
number of data-bearing servers equals the replication factor. For a sharded
cluster, the number of data-bearing servers equals the replication factor
multiplied by the number of shards.

If you enable sharding, |service| will also run three :ref:`config servers
<sharding-config-server>` in addition to your data-bearing servers. Your
selections for instance size and data storage do not affect the costs of the
config servers. Config servers are charged at a separate rate. Their cost is
reflected in the cost of the cluster.

Backup
------

For each replica set in a cluster, |service| charges US$2.50 / GB / month to
store backup data. The first 1GB of backup data is free.

|service| discounts the cost of backup data storage if the frequency of
snapshots is reduced. To modify the backup schedule for a cluster, see
:ref:`modify-backup-schedule`.

.. note::

   Backup data consists of your logical data and indexes on that data.

.. example::

   For a three-member replica set with 30GB of data, |service| charges
   US$72.50 each month.

   ``(30GB - 1GB) x US$2.50 = US$72.50``

For sharded clusters, |service| sums the cost of backup data  for each
shard replica set *and* the config server replica set.

.. example::
   
   A sharded cluster with 3 shards contains 90GB of data, with each shard
   containing 30GB of data each. The config server replica set
   contains 5GB of data.
   
   For this sharded cluster, |service| charges US$227.50 per month.

   ``((30GB - 1GB) x US$2.50) x 3) + ((5GB - 1GB) x US$2.50) = US$227.50``

Billing Information
-------------------

Each |service| group has its own account, plan, and billing method. To access
billing information, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`.

.. note::

   :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions` allow you to set an optional
   :guilabel:`Invoice Address` that is separate from the :guilabel:`Payment
   Method` billing address.

   If you set an Invoice Address, you can optionally use this address for the
   Payment Method by selecting :guilabel:`same as Invoice Address` when
   entering the Payment Method.

View an Estimate of Monthly Charges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click :guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`, and then
:guilabel:`Understanding Your Bill`. Scroll to :guilabel:`Monthly Estimates`.

Retry a Failed Payment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you receive notification of a failed payment, click :guilabel:`Settings`,
then :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`, and check that your :guilabel:`Payment
Method` is correct.

To retry the payment, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Payment
History`. On the line for the failed payment, click :guilabel:`Retry`.
