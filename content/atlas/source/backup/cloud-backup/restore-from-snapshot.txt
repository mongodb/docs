|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled or on-demand 
{+Cloud-Backup+}, including snapshots from different projects 
or organizations. The following sections describe restoring from a 
snapshot *without* {+encrypt-at-rest+}. To restore from a snapshot 
using {+encrypt-at-rest+}, see :ref:`restore-from-ear`.

.. note::

   You can only perform cross-organization restores through the |service| UI.

Restore Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`prerequisites <restore-prereq>`, consider the
following requirements and limitations when restoring from a scheduled
or on-demand {+Cloud-Backup+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-reqs.rst

- This feature is not available for ``M0`` {+clusters+}.

- .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-indexes-backup-restore.rst
 
  .. note::
     
     When you restore the data from the snapshot, the |fts| index 
     definitions from the snapshot replace any existing |fts| index 
     definitions.

Sharded {+Clusters+}
````````````````````

- If you are restoring from a sharded {+cluster+}, the source and 
  target {+clusters+} must have the same number of shards.

- The source and target {+clusters+} must use the same type of 
  :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`. Config servers can
  be either :ref:`config shards <sharded-cluster-config-server-config-shards>`
  or dedicated config servers.

- |service| can't restore a sharded {+cluster+} snapshot to a replica set.

{+Flex-Clusters+}
`````````````````

- |service| can't restore snapshots from {+Flex-clusters+}, dedicated {+cluster+}s,
  or Cloud Manager to a {+Flex-cluster+}.

- A {+Flex-cluster+} allows you to have only two snapshots. If you require
  having more snapshots, upgrade your cluster to a {+dedicated-cluster+}.

Recommendations to Optimize Restore Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/restore-optimization-considerations.rst

.. _cps-fallback-snapshots:

Fallback Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a scheduled snapshot fails for any reason, |service| attempts to
repeat the snapshot process. If necessary, you may use the resulting
fallback snapshot to restore the {+cluster+}. This isn't recommended:
fallback snapshots use a different process from regular snapshots. They
may contain inconsistent data.

Fallback snapshots are marked in the UI with a warning icon, and a
warning message appears in the restore modal window if the restore uses
a fallback snapshot.

.. warning::

   Restoring your {+cluster+} from a fallback snapshot may result in
   inconsistent data across your {+cluster+}, and should be considered an
   option of last resort.

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides different endpoints for restoring
      ``M10+`` {+clusters+} and {+Flex-clusters+}.
