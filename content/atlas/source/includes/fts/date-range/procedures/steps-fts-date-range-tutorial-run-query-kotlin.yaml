title: "Run an |fts| ``compound`` query with two clauses on the
  ``movies`` collection."

  a. Create a file named ``DateRange.kt``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``DateRange.kt`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection:

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-clauses.rst

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-stages.rst

     - Prints the documents that match the query from the ``AggregateFlow`` instance.

  #. .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the ``DateRange.kt`` file.

     When you run the ``DateRange.kt`` program in your IDE, it prints
