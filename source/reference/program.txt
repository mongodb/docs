Core Processes
--------------

The core components in the MongoDB package are: :program:`mongod`,
the core database process; :program:`mongos` the controller and query
router for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`; and
:program:`mongo` the interactive MongoDB Shell.

   /reference/program/mongod
   /reference/program/mongos
   /reference/program/mongo

Windows Services
----------------

The :program:`mongod.exe` and :program:`mongos.exe` describe the
options available for configuring MongoDB when running as a Windows
Service. The :program:`mongod.exe` and :program:`mongos.exe` binaries
provide a superset of the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
options.

   /reference/program/mongod.exe
   /reference/program/mongos.exe

Binary Import and Export Tools
------------------------------

:program:`mongodump` provides a method for creating :term:`BSON`
dump files from the :program:`mongod` instances, while
:program:`mongorestore` makes it possible to restore these
dumps. :program:`bsondump` converts BSON dump files into
:term:`JSON`. 

.. deprecated:: 3.2 

   :program:`mongooplog`


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   /reference/program/mongodump
   /reference/program/mongorestore
   /reference/program/bsondump
   /reference/program/mongooplog

Data Import and Export Tools
----------------------------

:program:`mongoimport` provides a method for taking data in :term:`JSON`,
:term:`CSV`, or :term:`TSV` and importing it into a :program:`mongod`
instance. :program:`mongoexport` provides a method to export data from
a :program:`mongod` instance into JSON, CSV, or TSV.

.. note::

   The conversion between BSON and other formats lacks full
   type fidelity. Therefore you cannot use :program:`mongoimport` and
   :program:`mongoexport` for round-trip import and export operations.

.. toctree::

   /reference/program/mongoimport
   /reference/program/mongoexport

Diagnostic Tools
----------------

:program:`mongostat` and :program:`mongotop`
provide diagnostic information related to the current operation of a
:program:`mongod` instance.

:program:`mongoreplay` is a traffic capture and replay tool for MongoDB
that you can use to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB
instance, and then replay those commands back onto another host at a
later time.

MongoDB 3.4 provides :program:`mongoldap` for testing native operating system
LDAP configuration options against a running LDAP server or set of servers.

   /reference/program/mongotop
   /reference/program/mongoperf
   /reference/program/mongoreplay
   /reference/program/mongoldap

GridFS
------

:program:`mongofiles` provides a command-line interact to a MongoDB
:term:`GridFS` storage system.
