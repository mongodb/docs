  a. In the :guilabel:`Choose a connection method` step, select
     :guilabel:`Connect with MongoDB Compass`.

  #. If you do not already have MongoDB Compass installed, the
     :guilabel:`Connect` dialog provides links to download and install the
     latest version of MongoDB Compass.

  #. Under :guilabel:`Copy the URI Connection String`, click either:

     - :guilabel:`I am using Compass 1.12 or later`

     - :guilabel:`I am using Compass 1.11 or earlier`

     and copy the MongoDB :manual:`connection string
     </reference/connection-string>`.

  #. Open the Compass application. Compass automatically detects the URI
     connection string in the system clipboard and prompts you to allow it to
     auto-fill the connection details. Click :guilabel:`Yes`.

  #. To authenticate to the cluster, the URI connection string includes a
     MongoDB user set up for the project. Compass autofills the
     :guilabel:`Username` field with that user. Fill in the
     :guilabel:`Password` field with the password for the user.

     To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the :guilabel:`Username`
     and :guilabel:`Password` fields with the username and password of a
     different MongoDB user.

  #. You can optionally fill in the :guilabel:`Favorite Name` field with a
     name for the connection. When you use Compass in the future, previous
     connections appear in the left pane of the Compass :guilabel:`Connect`
     window under :guilabel:`Favorites`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Connect` to connect Compass to your cluster.
