regions:

Google Cloud
------------

Assured Workloads is a |gcp| product that allows customers to configure sensitive workloads to support compliance and security requirements.

You can deploy an |cloudgov-short| cluster in GCP with Assured Workloads in all standard US regions.
For an updated list of supported regions, see `Assured Workloads locations <https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/locations#us_regions>`__.

.. note:: 

   When passing a |gcp| region name to the |service| API, as you would with 
   Terraform for example, you must include the suffix ``_AW`` with the region name. 

   For example, to pass the |gcp| region ``us-east-1`` to the |service| API, you 
   need to pass it as ``US_EAST_1_AW``.
