      :setting:`spec.security.tls.enabled` is deprecated starting in |k8s-op-short| version 1.19.

   - MongoDB hosts in a replica set or sharded cluster configuration
   - Clients (|mongo| shell, drivers, |compass|, and others)
     and the MongoDB deployment
   
   By default, ``net.ssl.mode`` is set to ``requireSSL``. To change the
   |tls| mode used for client and database connections, see
