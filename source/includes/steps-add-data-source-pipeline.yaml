  Your pipeline must be an array in square brackets. Specify each
  stage of your pipeline as an object within the array.

  |charts| validates your pipeline before you save. |charts-short|
  reports any errors in your pipeline below the editor.

  .. tip::

     For help creating your pipeline, you can utilize the
     :atlas:`Aggregation Pipeline Builder
     </data-explorer/cloud-agg-pipeline/>` in the |service| Data
     Explorer.

     You can create your pipeline using the |service| pipeline builder
     and paste it into the |charts| pipeline editor.
