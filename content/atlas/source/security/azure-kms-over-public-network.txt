You can use a customer-managed key (CMK) from Azure Key Vault (AKV)
to further encrypt your data at rest in |service|. This page describes
how to configure customer key management using |akv| on your |service|
project and on the {+clusters+} in that project. 

.. _azure-kms-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |akv| for a MongoDB project, you
must: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-azure-kms-prereqs.rst

- To help users easily create or change a {+cluster+}, you 
  can allow public access to the key. To narrow the scope of the 
  key and mitigate risks, use controls such as |tls| and authentication.

- For restricted access to defined IP ranges, :azure:`allow access 
  </key-vault/general/network-security>` from :ref:`Atlas IP addresses
  <atlas-add-inbound-ips>` and the public IP addresses of your
  {+cluster+} nodes. 

  - Ensure |service| can communicate with your |akv|. To avoid
    connectivity interruptions, update your configuration whenever node
    IP addresses :ref:`change <faq-public-ip-changes>`. For example, you
    might need to update your :ref:`inbound access rules
    <atlas-add-inbound-ips>`. 

  - If you restrict access to the |akv|, you create more complexity when
    IP addresses change. For example, when you create or update a
    {+cluster+}, you must grant access in the |akv| to any new IP
    addresses. 

- Add the outgoing IP addresses of the |service| control plane. To learn 
  how to retrieve your outgoing IP addresses by using the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see 
  :ref:`Fetch {+service+} Control Plane IP Addresses <atlas-fetch-control-plane-ips>`.

- If your :guilabel:`App registrations` use `conditional access 
  policies <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/workload-identity>`__,
  which is uncommon, you must :ref:`allow requests from Atlas 
  Control Plane IP addresses <atlas-add-inbound-ips>` and :oas-atlas-op:`the public 
  IP addresses of your cluster nodes </returnAllIpAddresses>` for app registration. This is used 
  only for app registration and not used for key vault access. 

.. _azure-kms-configure-project:

Enable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
------------------------------------------

You must enable |cmk| for a project before you can enable it on a
{+cluster+} in that project. You can enable |cmk| for a project from the
{+atlas-ui+} and {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-api.rst  

.. _azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
-------------------------------------------------------

After you :ref:`azure-kms-configure-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| cluster that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for clusters in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the :ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>` setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you
create the cluster.  

For existing clusters:

.. include:: /includes/steps-cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Disable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
-------------------------------------------

You must disable customer key management on each cluster in a project
before you can disable the feature for the project.

.. warning::

   Do *not* disable or delete any |akv| keys that any cluster in your
   |service| project uses before you have disabled customer key
   management within the |service| project. If |service| cannot access
   an |akv| key, any data that key encrypted becomes inaccessible.

Revoke Access to an Encryption Key
----------------------------------

You can revoke |service|'s access to an encryption key from within |akv|.
|service| automatically pauses your {+clusters+} when you revoke access to the
encryption key unless your |akv| IP access list restricts the |service| control plane.

To allow automatic pausing of your {+cluster+}, you must either:

- Disable the IP access list for your |akv|
- Allow access to your |akv| from the :ref:`Atlas control plane <atlas-add-inbound-ips>`.  
  
.. note::
    
   MongoDB adds new |service| control plane IP addresses over time. You must keep
   the IP access list updated to allow automatic {+cluster+} pausing while using an
   IP access list for your |akv|.

If the IP access list for your |akv| restricts access from the |service| control plane when
you revoke access to an encryption key, you must pause
your {+clusters+} manually to revoke |service|'s access.

Rotate your Azure Key Identifier
--------------------------------

.. meta::
   :keywords: encryption

.. include:: /includes/unavailable-flex-serverless-m0-m2-m5-clusters.rst

Before you begin, learn :ref:`azure-kms-rotate-key`.

You must create a new key in the |akv| associated to the
|service| project.  The following procedure documents how to rotate your
|service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new key identifier in
|service|. 

.. include:: /includes/steps-rotate-azure-encryption-key.rst
