|service| Online Archive is a feature designed to help organizations optimize
their data storage and query costs by archiving infrequently accessed data 
from their MongoDB |service| cluster to a cloud object storage. 
With Online Archive, you gain the ability to manage the lifecycle of your data, 
maintain a unified query experience across live and archived datasets, 
and reduce operational complexity while ensuring data remains accessible when needed.

Key Considerations for Using Online Archive
-------------------------------------------

Consider the following requirements, expectations and limitations when using 
|service| {+Online-Archive+}.

.. _online-archive-cluster-reqs:

Cluster Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Online-Archive+} in |service| is available only on ``M10`` and
greater clusters.

.. _online-archive-permissions:

Required Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create or delete an {+Online-Archive+}, you must have one of these
roles:

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` role
- :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role
- :authrole:`Project Owner` role

.. _adf-oa-performance-expectations:

Performance Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following performance expectations when working with {+Online-Archive+}: 

- Archival Jobs: MongoDB runs archival jobs periodically to move data from your 
  cluster to cloud storage. These jobs operate asynchronously and are designed to 
  minimize performance impact on your cluster.
- Cluster Capacity: Archiving jobs consume cluster resources. Ensure your Atlas cluster
  has sufficient capacity to support both active workloads and archiving tasks to 
  avoid resource constraints.
- Query Performance: Archived data resides in read-optimized cloud object storage, 
  which might have slower query performance compared to querying live data on your Atlas cluster.


.. _adf-oa-limitations:

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Online-Archive+} doesn't support the following:

- Writing to the {+Online-Archive+}.
- :ref:`Configuring <config-adf>` or
  :ref:`administering <adf-cli>` the {+Online-Archive+} {+fdi+} through
  the |service| console, {+adf+} :ref:`CLI <adf-cli>`, or {+adf+} API.
- Archiving a capped collection.
- Archiving data below the size of 5 MiB after 7 days. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`Limitations <config-online-archive-limitations>`.
- :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`.
- Deleting individual documents.


Online Archive & Atlas Data Federation
--------------------------------------

When you configure an {+Online-Archive+} for a collection, 
|service| uses {+adf+} to create a read-only :ref:`Federated Database Instance <atlas-data-federation>`. 
This enables unified queries across both your live {+cluster+} and your archived data, 
using the same collection and database names.

You define archiving rules based on time fields or custom filters. Atlas evaluates these 
rules continuously and automatically transfers matching documents to a 
cloud object storage managed by Atlas (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob).

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS 
      :tabid: aws

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-aws-regions.rst

      .. important::

         |service| encrypts your archived data using :aws:`Amazon's
         server-side encryption S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`
         for archived data. |service| can't use any encryption-at-rest
         encryption keys that you used on your {+cluster+} data.

   .. tab:: Azure 
      :tabid: azure

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-azure-regions.rst

      .. important:: 

         |service| encrypts your archived data using :azure:`Azure Storage
         service-side encryption </storage/common/storage-service-encryption#about-azure-storage-service-side-encryption)>`.
         |service| can't use any encryption-at-rest encryption keys that you
         used on your {+cluster+} data. 

   .. tab:: GCP 
      :tabid: gcp

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-gcp-regions.rst

      .. important:: 

         |service| encrypts your archived data using :gcp:`Google Cloud Storage
         service-side encryption </storage/docs/encryption>`.
         |service| can't use any encryption-at-rest encryption keys that you
         used on your {+cluster+} data. 

|service| archives data based on the criteria you specify in an
archiving rule. The criteria vary based on the type of collection 
you want to archive:  

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Standard Collection
      :tabid: standard

      For standard collections, the criteria can be one of the 
      following:

      - A combination of a date field to archive data and number of 
        days to keep data on the |service| cluster. When the current 
        date exceeds the value of the specified date field, |service| 
        subtracts the number of days from the current time and then 
        archives data after the time.
      - A custom query. |service| runs the query specified in the 
        archiving rule to select the documents to archive.

   .. tab:: Time Series Collection 
      :tabid: timeseries 

      For :manual:`time series </core/timeseries-collections/>` 
      collections, the criteria is a combination of a time field and 
      number of days to keep data on the |service| cluster. When the 
      current time exceeds the value of the specified time field, 
      |service| subtracts the number of days from the current time and 
      then archives data after that many days, hours, and minutes.

When you configure an {+Online-Archive+} on your {+cluster+}, |service|
creates two {+fdi+}\s: 

- {+FDI+} for your archive that allows you to query data on your
  archive only. 
- {+FDI+} for your {+cluster+} and archive that allows you to query both
  your {+cluster+} and archived data.


Use Cases
---------

You can use {+Online-Archive+} to reduce storage costs and manage cold data while preserving access 
through queries. Typical use cases include:

- :guilabel:`Large-scale historical datasets`: Your cluster stores high volumes of data, 
  such as logs, metrics, or transaction records, and you need to reduce operational 
  storage costs without deleting data. {+Online-Archive+} helps by relocating cold data to 
  a cheaper cloud object storage while keeping it accessible via queries.

- :guilabel:`Time series archiving`: Your application ingests high-frequency time series data 
  from sources like IoT devices, industrial sensors, or financial systems. {+Online-Archive+} allows 
  you to retain this data for compliance, auditing, or analytics while minimizing impact on your 
  cluster’s performance.

- :guilabel:`Cold operational data`: You manage application data (e.g., order histories, completed 
  service requests, old invoices) that is rarely accessed after a certain age but 
  must be retained for reference or regulatory requirements.

- :guilabel:`Long-term customer records`: Your system retains archived customer profiles, 
  subscription history, or user activity logs for legal retention periods or post-analysis, 
  but these documents no longer require frequent access.

- :guilabel:`Compliance and audit`: Your organization must retain data for regulatory or audit 
  purposes (e.g., financial transactions, medical logs, access logs). Archiving enables 
  cost-effective long-term storage without modifying your query interface.

- :guilabel:`Archiving for analytics`: You archive data that’s not required for day-to-day 
  operations but is occasionally analyzed for trends, reports, or forecasting—without 
  adding overhead to your primary cluster.

{+Online-Archive+} helps isolate cold data from hot workloads while maintaining a 
unified interface to both. This enables operational efficiency, cost savings, and 
retention compliance—all without application changes.
