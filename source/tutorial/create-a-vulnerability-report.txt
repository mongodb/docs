Create a Vulnerability Report
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in MongoDB or a
related product or have experienced a security incident related to
MongoDB, please report the issue so that `10gen <http://www.10gen.com/>`_ can respond
appropriately and work to prevent additional issues in the
future.

To report an issue, use either `jira.mongodb.org
<https://jira.mongodb.org>`_ (preferred) or email. 10gen responds to
vulnerability notifications within 48 hours.

Information to Provide
----------------------

All vulnerability reports should contain as much information
as possible so 10gen can move quickly to resolve the issue.
In particular, please include the following:

- The name of the product.

- *Common Vulnerability* information, if applicable, including:

  - CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Score.

  - CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposures) Identifier.

- Contact information, including an email address and/or phone number,
  if applicable.

Create the Report in Jira
-------------------------

10gen prefers `jira.mongodb.org <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_ for all
communication regarding MongoDB and related products.

Submit a ticket in the :issue:`Core Server Security <SECURITY>`
project at:
`https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SECURITY/ <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SECURITY/>`_.
The ticket
number will become the reference identification for the issue for the
lifetime of the issue. You can use this identifier for tracking
purposes.

Send the Report via Email
-------------------------

While Jira is preferred, you may also report
vulnerabilities via email to `security@10gen.com <security@10gen.com>`_.

You may encrypt email using the 10gen public key at
`http://docs.mongodb.org/10gen-gpg-key.asc <http://docs.mongodb.org/10gen-gpg-key.asc>`_.

10gen responds to vulnerability reports sent via
email with a response email that contains a reference number for a Jira ticket
posted to the :issue:`SECURITY` project.

Evaluation of a Vulnerability Report
------------------------------------

10gen validates all submitted vulnerabilities and uses Jira
to track all communications regarding a vulnerability,
including requests for clarification or additional information. If
needed, 10gen representatives set up a conference call to exchange
information regarding the vulnerability.

Disclosure
----------

10gen requests that you do *not* publicly disclose any information
regarding the vulnerability or exploit the issue until 10gen has had the
opportunity to analyze the vulnerability, to respond to the notification,
and to notify key users, customers, and partners.

The amount of time required to validate a reported vulnerability
depends on the complexity and severity of the issue. 10gen takes all
required vulnerabilities very seriously and will always ensure that
there is a clear and open channel of communication with the reporter.

After validating an issue, 10gen coordinates public disclosure of
the issue with the reporter in a mutually agreed timeframe and
format. If required or requested, the reporter of a vulnerability will
receive credit in the published security bulletin.
