.. pipeline:: $match

   Filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the
   specified condition(s) to the next pipeline stage.

   The :pipeline:`$match` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $match: { <query> } }

   :pipeline:`$match` takes a document that specifies the query
   conditions. The query syntax is identical to the :ref:`read
   operation query <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.

Behavior
--------

Pipeline Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Place the :pipeline:`$match` as early in the aggregation
  :term:`pipeline` as possible. Because :pipeline:`$match` limits
  the total number of documents in the aggregation pipeline,
  earlier :pipeline:`$match` operations minimize the amount of
  processing down the pipe.

- If you place a :pipeline:`$match` at the very beginning of a
  pipeline, the query can take advantage of :term:`indexes
  <index>` like any other :method:`db.collection.find()`
  or :method:`db.collection.findOne()`.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You cannot use :query:`$where` in :pipeline:`$match` queries as part
  of the aggregation pipeline. As an alternative, use :query:`$eval`
  operator instead.

- You cannot use :query:`$near` or :query:`$nearSphere` in
  :pipeline:`$match` queries as part of the aggregation pipeline. As an
  alternative, you can either:

  - Use :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage instead of the :pipeline:`$match` stage.

  - Use :query:`$geoWithin` query operator with :query:`$center` or
    :query:`$centerSphere` in the :pipeline:`$match` stage.

- To use :query:`$text` in the :pipeline:`$match` stage, the
  :pipeline:`$match` stage has to be the first stage of the pipeline.

Examples
--------

The examples use a collection named ``articles`` with the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("512bc95fe835e68f199c8686"), "author" : "dave", "score" : 80, "views" : 100 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("512bc962e835e68f199c8687"), "author" : "dave", "score" : 85, "views" : 521 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("55f5a192d4bede9ac365b257"), "author" : "ahn", "score" : 60, "views" : 1000 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("55f5a192d4bede9ac365b258"), "author" : "li", "score" : 55, "views" : 5000 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b259"), "author" : "annT", "score" : 60, "views" : 50 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b25a"), "author" : "li", "score" : 94, "views" : 999 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b25b"), "author" : "ty", "score" : 95, "views" : 1000 }

Equality Match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation uses :pipeline:`$match` to perform a
simple equality match:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.aggregate(
       [ { $match : { author : "dave" } } ]
   );

The :pipeline:`$match` selects the documents where the ``author``
field equals ``dave``, and the aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("512bc95fe835e68f199c8686"), "author" : "dave", "score" : 80, "views" : 100 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("512bc962e835e68f199c8687"), "author" : "dave", "score" : 85, "views" : 521 }

.. _match-perform-a-count:

Perform a Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example selects documents to process using the
:pipeline:`$match` pipeline operator and then pipes the results
to the :pipeline:`$group` pipeline operator to compute a count of
the documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.articles.aggregate( [
    { $match: { $or: [ { score: { $gt: 70, $lt: 90 } }, { views: { $gte: 1000 } } ] } },
    { $group: { _id: null, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
  ] );

In the aggregation pipeline, :pipeline:`$match` selects the documents
where either the ``score`` is greater than ``70`` and less than ``90``
or the ``views`` is greater than or equal to ``1000``. These documents
are then piped to the :pipeline:`$group` to perform a count. The
aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : null, "count" : 5 }
