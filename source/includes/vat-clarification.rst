If your company's billing address is in a country other than 
the United States (USA), |service| typically charges |vat| if you do 
not enter a valid ``VAT ID Number`` on your 
:ref:`billing profile <atlas-billing-profile>`.

:gold:`IMPORTANT:` If your billing address is in Ireland or certain
Canadian provinces, |service| always charges |vat|, even with a valid
``VAT ID Number``.

To learn more about |vat| by region, see
