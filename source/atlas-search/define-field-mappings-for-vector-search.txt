When you create an |fts| index, you can explicitly specify the fields 
to index using static mappings. For the fields in the collection that 
you want to index, you must include a ``type`` field that describes the 
:ref:`data type <bson-data-chart>` of the field in the field 
definition. You can specify an array of field definitions for a field, 
one for each data type.

.. code-block:: json  
   :caption: Syntax 
   :emphasize-lines: 3-12
   :linenos:

   "mappings": { 
     "dynamic": <boolean>, 
     "fields": { 
       "<field-name>": [
         {
           "type": "<field-type>",
           ...
         },
         ...
       ],
       ...  
     }
   }

Alternatively, you can configure |fts| to automatically index all the 
supported field types in the collection using dynamic mappings.

.. include:: /includes/fact-fts-index-field-order.rst 

Static and Dynamic Mappings 
---------------------------

For **Static mappings**, set ``mappings.dynamic`` to ``false`` and 
specify the fields to index using ``mappings.fields``. |fts| only 
indexes the specified fields with specific options. 

Use static mappings to configure index options for fields that
shouldn't be indexed dynamically, or to configure a single field 
independently from others in an index.

.. note:: 

   You must specify static mappings when ``mappings.dynamic`` is 
   ``false``.

For **Dynamic mappings**, set ``mappings.dynamic`` to ``true``. |fts| 
automatically indexes the fields of :ref:`supported types 
<bson-data-chart>` in each document. 

Use dynamic mappings if your schema changes regularly or is unknown, or 
when experimenting with |fts|. You can configure an entire index to use 
dynamic mappings, or specify individual fields, such as fields of type 
``document``, to be dynamically mapped.

.. note::

   Dynamically mapped indexes occupy more disk space than statically 
   mapped indexes and may be less performant.

BSON Data Types
---------------

|fts| doesn't support the following :manual:`BSON data types 
</reference/bson-types/>`\:

- Binary Data
- Decimal128
- JavaScript code with scope
- Max key
- Min key
- Null
- Regular Expression
- Timestamp

The following table lists the supported :manual:`BSON data types
</reference/bson-types/>` and the |fts| field type for the 
:manual:`BSON data types </reference/bson-types/>`. The table also  
indicates whether the field type is automatically indexed when you 
enable :ref:`dynamic mappings <static-dynamic-mappings>`.

.. note:: 

   You can store fields of all supported :ref:`bson-data-chart` on 
   |fts| using the ``storedSource`` :ref:`option 
   <index-definition-options>`.

|fts| Field Types
-----------------

.. _bson-data-types-knn-vector:

knnVector
~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``knnVector`` type to index vector embeddings. The vector 
field should be represented as an array of :ref:`numbers 
<bson-data-types-number>` (|bson| ``int32``, ``int64``, or ``double`` 
data types only).

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-vector-search-ea.rst

The ``knnVector`` type has the following options:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 15 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type 
     - Necessity
     - Purpose

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - Required
     - Human-readable label that identifies this field type. Value must 
       be ``knnVector``.

   * - ``dimensions``
     - int
     - Required
     - Number of vector dimensions, which |fts| enforces at index- and 
       query-time. This value can't be greater than ``1024``. 

   * - ``similarity``
     - string
     - Required
     - Vector similarity function to use to search for top K-nearest 
       neighbors. Value can be one of the following:

       - ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. 
         This allows you to measure similarity based on varying 
         dimensions. To learn more, see :wikipedia:`Euclidean 
         <Euclidean_distance>`.
       - ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between 
         vectors. This allows you to measure similarity that isn't 
         scaled by magnitude. You can't use zero magnitude vectors with 
         ``cosine``. To measure cosine similarity, we recommend that 
         you normalize your vectors and use ``dotProduct`` instead. To 
         learn more, see :wikipedia:`Cosine <Cosine_similarity>`.
       - ``dotProduct`` - measures similar to ``cosine``, but takes 
         into account the magnitude of the vector. This allows you to 
         efficiently measure similarity based on both angle and 
         magnitude. To use ``dotProduct``, you must normalize the 
         vector to unit length at index- and query-time. To learn more, 
         see :wikipedia:`Dot Product <Dot_product>`.

       .. note:: 

          If you normalize the magnitude, ``cosine`` and 
          ``dotProduct`` are almost identical in measuring similarity.

.. example:: 

   Consider a collection named ``cheese_varieties`` with the following 
   documents:

   .. code-block:: json 
      
      {
        "_id": 1,
        "name": "mozzarella",
        "description": "Italian cheese typically made from buffalo's milk.",
        "countryOfOrigin": "Italy",
        "egVector": [-0.09950768947601318,-0.02402166835963726,-0.046839360147714615,0.06274440884590149,-0.0920015424489975],
        "aging": "none",
        "yearProduced": 2022,
        "brined": false
      }

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "_id": 2,
        "name": "parmesan",
        "description": "Italian hard, granular cheese produced from cow's milk.",
        "countryOfOrigin": "Italy",
        "egVector": [-0.04228218272328377,-0.024080513045191765,-0.029374264180660248,-0.04369240626692772,-0.01295427419245243],
        "aging": "at least 1 year",
        "yearProduced": 2021,
        "brined": false
      }

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "_id": 3,
        "name": "feta",
        "description": "Greek brined white cheese made from sheep's milk or from a mixture of sheep and goat's milk.",
        "countryOfOrigin": "Greece",
        "egVector": [-0.015739429742097855,0.04937680810689926,-0.1067470908164978,0.1293928325176239,-0.03162907809019089],
        "aging": "about 3 months",
        "yearProduced": 2021,
        "brined": true
      }

   The following index definition for the ``cheese_varieties`` 
   collection dynamically indexes all the dynamically indexable fields 
   in the collection and statically indexes ``egVector`` as 
   a ``knnVector`` type. The index definition also specifies ``5`` vector 
   dimensions and measures similarity using ``euclidean``.

   .. code-block:: json 
      :linenos:

      {
        "mappings": {
          "dynamic": true,
          "fields": {
            "egVector": {
              "type": "knnVector",
              "dimensions": 5,
              "similarity": "euclidean"
            }
          }
        }
      }

   If you add the ``cheese_varieties`` collection to a database on your 
   cluster and create the preceding |fts| index for this collection, 
   you can run :ref:`knn-beta-ref` queries against this collection. To 
   learn more about the sample queries that you can run, see 
   :ref:`knn-beta-egs`.
