Overview
--------

On this page, you can learn how to upgrade your driver to a new version. This page also
includes the changes you must make to your application to upgrade your driver without
losing functionality, if applicable.

Deprecation
-----------

Before we remove a feature in a major release, PyMongo's maintainers make an
effort to release at least one minor version that *deprecates* it. We add
"**DEPRECATED**" to the feature's documentation, and update the code to raise a
``DeprecationWarning``. You can ensure your code is future-proof by running
your code with the latest PyMongo release and looking for ``DeprecationWarning``
messages.

The interpreter silences ``DeprecationWarning`` messages by default. For example, the
following code uses the deprecated ``insert`` method but does not raise any
warning:

.. code-block:: python

   # "insert.py" (with PyMongo 3.X)
   from pymongo import MongoClient

   client = MongoClient()
   client.test.test.insert({})

To print deprecation warnings to ``stderr``, run python with the ``-Wd`` options:

.. code-block:: python

   $ python3 -Wd insert.py
   insert.py:4: DeprecationWarning: insert is deprecated. Use insert_one or insert_many instead.
     client.test.test.insert({})

You can turn warnings into exceptions by using ``python -We``:

.. code-block:: python

   $ python3 -We insert.py
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "insert.py", line 4, in <module>
       client.test.test.insert({})
     File "/home/durin/work/mongo-python-driver/pymongo/collection.py", line 2906, in insert
       "instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
   DeprecationWarning: insert is deprecated. Use insert_one or insert_many instead.

If your code's test suite passes when you use ``python -We`` to run it, then it uses no
deprecated PyMongo features.

.. note::
  
   For more information, see the Python documentation about
   `the warnings module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html>`__
   and `the -W command line option <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W>`__.


Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification of a convention or a behavior starting in a specific
version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from working
properly if not addressed before upgrading the driver.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that introduced
them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking changes between the current
and upgrade versions. For example, if you're upgrading {+driver-short+} from v4.0 to v4.7,
address all breaking changes from the version after v4.0, including any listed under v4.7.

.. _version-4.7-breaking-changes:

Version 4.7 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All occurrences of the ``SON`` collection type on all internal classes and
  commands have been changed to ``dict``.
- The ``options.pool_options.metadata`` property is now of type ``dict``, not
  ``SON``. The following code example shows the differences in how these formats
  store data:
  
.. code-block:: python

    # Before
    >>> from pymongo import MongoClient
    >>> client = MongoClient()
    >>> client.options.pool_options.metadata
    SON([('driver', SON([('name', 'PyMongo'), ('version', '4.7.0.dev0')])), ('os', SON([('type', 'Darwin'), ('name', 'Darwin'), ('architecture', 'arm64'), ('version', '14.3')])), ('platform', 'CPython 3.11.6.final.0')])

    # After
    >>> client.options.pool_options.metadata
    {'driver': {'name': 'PyMongo', 'version': '4.7.0.dev0'}, 'os': {'type': 'Darwin', 'name': 'Darwin', 'architecture': 'arm64', 'version': '14.3'}, 'platform': 'CPython 3.11.6.final.0'}

To convert a single-layer ``dict`` object to a ``SON`` object, pass the ``dict`` object to
the ``SON`` constructor, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> data_as_dict = client.options.pool_options.metadata
   >>> SON(data_as_dict)
   SON([('driver', {'name': 'PyMongo', 'version': '4.7.0.dev0'}), ('os', {'type': 'Darwin', 'name': 'Darwin', 'architecture': 'arm64', 'version': '14.3'}), ('platform', 'CPython 3.11.6.final.0')])

If the ``dict`` object has multiple layers, you must convert the values one at a time,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> def dict_to_SON(data_as_dict: dict[Any, Any]):
   ...     data_as_SON = SON()
   ...     for key, value in data_as_dict.items():
   ...         data_as_SON[key] = dict_to_SON(value) if isinstance(value, dict) else value
   ...     return data_as_SON
   >>>
   >>> dict_to_SON(data_as_dict)
   SON([('driver', SON([('name', 'PyMongo'), ('version', '4.7.0.dev0')])), ('os', SON([('type', 'Darwin'), ('name', 'Darwin'), ('architecture', 'arm64'), ('version', '14.3')])), ('platform', 'CPython 3.11.6.final.0')])

.. _pymongo4-migration-guide:

PyMongo 4 Migration Guide
-------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient, ReadPreference

   client = MongoClient()
   database = client.my_database
   collection = database.my_collection

PyMongo 4.0 brings a number of improvements as well as some breaking
changes. This guide provides a roadmap for migrating an existing application
from PyMongo 3.x to 4.x or writing libraries that will work with both
PyMongo 3.x and 4.x.

PyMongo 3
~~~~~~~~~

The first step in any successful migration involves upgrading to, or
requiring, at least the latest version of PyMongo 3.x. If your project has a
``requirements.txt`` file, add the line ``pymongo >= 3.12, < 4.0`` until you have
completely migrated to PyMongo 4. Most of the new methods and options from
PyMongo 4.0 are backported to PyMongo 3.12, making migration much easier.

.. note::
  
   Users of PyMongo 2.X who wish to upgrade to 4.x must first upgrade
   to PyMongo 3.x by following the `PyMongo 3 Migration Guide
   <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/3.12.1/migrate-to-pymongo3.html>`__.

Python 3.6+
~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMongo 4.0 drops support for Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5. Users who wish to
upgrade to 4.x must first upgrade to Python 3.6.2+. Users upgrading from
Python 2 should consult the Python Upgrade page.

Enable Deprecation Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DeprecationWarning`` is raised by most methods removed in PyMongo 4.0.
Make sure you enable runtime warnings to see where deprecated functions and
methods are being used in your application:

.. code-block:: python

   python -Wd <your application>

Warnings can also be changed to errors:

.. code-block:: python

   python -Wd -Werror <your application>

.. note::
  
   Not all deprecated features raise ``DeprecationWarning`` when
   used. See the :ref:`pymongo-removed-features` section.

MongoReplicaSetClient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient``.
Since PyMongo 3.0, ``MongoReplicaSetClient`` has been identical to
``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient``. Applications can simply replace
``MongoReplicaSetClient`` with ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` and
get the same behavior.

MongoClient
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _pymongo4-migration-direct-connection:

directConnection Defaults to False
``````````````````````````````````

The ``directConnection`` URI option and keyword argument to ``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient``
defaults to ``False`` instead of ``None``,
allowing for the automatic discovery of replica sets. This means that if you
want a direct connection to a single server, you must pass
``directConnection=True`` as a URI option or keyword argument.

If you see any ``~pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError``'s after upgrading from
PyMongo 3 to 4.x, you likely
need to add ``directConnection=True`` when creating the client.
Here are some example errors:

.. code-block:: python

   pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError: mongo_node2: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname
    provided, or not known,mongo_node1:27017

.. code-block:: python

   ServerSelectionTimeoutError: No servers match selector "Primary()", Timeout: 30s,
    Topology Description: ...

Additionally, the ``isWritablePrimary`` attribute of a ``hello`` command sent back by the
server will always be ``True`` if ``directConnection=False``:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> client.admin.command('hello')['isWritablePrimary']
   True

The waitQueueMultiple Parameter Is Removed
``````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``waitQueueMultiple`` keyword argument to
``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` and removed
``pymongo.errors.ExceededMaxWaiters``. Instead of using
``waitQueueMultiple`` to bound queuing, limit the size of the thread
pool in your application.

The socketKeepAlive Parameter Is Removed
````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``socketKeepAlive`` keyword argument to
``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient``. PyMongo now always enables TCP
keepalive. For more information, see the
`keepalive documentation <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/faq/diagnostics/#does-tcp-keepalive-time-affect-mongodb-deployments->`__.

Renamed URI Options
```````````````````

Several deprecated URI options have been renamed to the standardized
option names defined in the
`URI options specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/uri-options/uri-options.rst>`__.
The old option names and their renamed equivalents are summarized in the table
below. Some renamed options have different semantics from the option being
replaced, as noted in the Migration Notes column.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 20

   * - Old URI Option
     - Renamed URI Option
     - Migration Notes
   * - ``ssl_pem_passphrase``
     - ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword``
     - N/A
   * - ``ssl_ca_certs``
     - ``tlsCAFile``
     - N/A 
   * - ``ssl_crlfile``
     - ``tlsCRLFile``
     - N/A 
   * - ``ssl_match_hostname``
     - ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``
     - ``ssl_match_hostname=True`` is equivalent to ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=False`` and vice-versa.
   * - ``ssl_cert_reqs``
     - ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``
     - Instead of ``ssl.CERT_NONE``, ``ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL``, or ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``, the
       | new option expects a boolean value: ``True`` is equivalent to ``ssl.CERT_NONE``
       | and ``False`` is equivalent to ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``.                                 
   * - ``ssl_certfile`` and ``ssl_keyfile``
     - ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``
     - Instead of using ``ssl_certfile`` and ``ssl_keyfile`` to specify the certificate and
       | private key files respectively,  use ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` to pass a single file
       | containing both the client certificate and the private key.
   * - ``j``
     - ``journal`` 
     - N/A
   * - ``wtimeout``
     - ``wTimeoutMS`` 
     - N/A

MongoClient.fsync Is Removed
````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.fsync`` method.
Use the ``~pymongo.database.Database.command`` method to execute the
`fsync command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/fsync/>`__
command instead. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   client.admin.command('fsync', lock=True)

MongoClient.unlock Is Removed
`````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.unlock`` method. Use the
``~pymongo.database.Database.command`` method to execute the `fsyncUnlock command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/fsyncUnlock/>`__
instead. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   client.admin.command('fsyncUnlock')

MongoClient.is_locked Is Removed
````````````````````````````````

Removed ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.is_locked``. Use the
```~pymongo.database.Database.command`` method to execute the `currentOp command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/currentOp/>`__
instead. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   is_locked = client.admin.command('currentOp').get('fsyncLock')

MongoClient.database_names Is Removed
`````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.database_names`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.list_database_names`` method instead,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   names = client.list_database_names()

MongoClient.max_bson_size/max_message_size/max_write_batch_size Are Removed
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.max_bson_size``,
``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.max_message_size``, and
``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.max_write_batch_size``. These helpers
were incorrect when in ``loadBalanced=true`` mode, and ambiguous in clusters
with mixed versions. Use the `hello command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/hello/>`__
to get the authoritative value from the remote server instead, as shown in the following
example:

.. code-block:: python

   doc = client.admin.command('hello')
   max_bson_size = doc['maxBsonObjectSize']
   max_message_size = doc['maxMessageSizeBytes']
   max_write_batch_size = doc['maxWriteBatchSize']

MongoClient.event_listeners and Other Configuration Option Helpers Are Removed
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following client configuration option helpers are removed:

- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.event_listeners``. Use ``client.options.event_listeners``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.max_pool_size``. Use ``client.options.pool_options.max_pool_size``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.min_pool_size``. Use ``client.options.pool_options.min_pool_size``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.max_idle_time_ms``. Use ``client.options.pool_options.max_idle_time_seconds``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.local_threshold_ms``. Use ``client.options.local_threshold_ms``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.server_selection_timeout``. Use ``client.options.server_selection_timeout``
  instead.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.retry_writes``.
- ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.retry_reads``.

.. _tz_aware_default_change:

``tz_aware`` Defaults to ``False``
``````````````````````````````````

The ``tz_aware`` argument to ``~bson.json_util.JSONOptions``
now defaults to ``False`` instead of ``True``. The ``bson.json_util.loads`` method
now decodes ``datetime`` as naive by default:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from bson import json_util
   >>> s = '{"dt": {"$date": "2022-05-09T17:54:00Z"}}'
   >>> json_util.loads(s)
    {'dt': datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 9, 17, 54)}

To retain the PyMongo 3 behavior, set ``tz_aware=True``, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from bson import json_util
   >>> opts = json_util.JSONOptions(tz_aware=True)
   >>> s = '{"dt": {"$date": "2022-05-09T17:54:00Z"}}'
   >>> json_util.loads(s, json_options=opts)
    {'dt': datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 9, 17, 54, tzinfo=<bson.tz_util.FixedOffset object at 0x7fd1ebc1add0>)}

This change was made to match the default behavior of
``~bson.codec_options.CodecOptions`` and ``bson.decode``.

MongoClient Cannot Execute Operations After ``close()``
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` cannot execute any operations
after being closed. The previous behavior would simply reconnect. However,
now you must create a new instance.

MongoClient Raises Exception When Given More Than One URI
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` now raises a ``~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError``
when more than one URI is passed into the ``hosts`` argument.

MongoClient Raises Exception When Given Unescaped Percent Sign in Login Info
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` now raises an
``~pymongo.errors.InvalidURI`` exception
when it encounters unescaped percent signs in username and password.

Database
~~~~~~~~

Database.authenticate and Database.logout Are Removed
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.authenticate`` method and
the ``pymongo.database.Database.logout`` method. Authenticating multiple users
on the same client conflicts with support for logical sessions in MongoDB 3.6+.
To authenticate as multiple users, create multiple instances of
``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient``, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   client1 = MongoClient(username='user1', password='pass1')
   client2 = MongoClient(username='user2', password='pass2')

Alternatively, create a single user that contains all the authentication privileges
required by your application.

Database.collection_names Is Removed
````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.collection_names`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.database.Database.list_collection_names`` method instead, as shown in
the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   names = client.list_collection_names()
   non_system_names = client.list_collection_names(filter={"name": {"$regex": r"^(?!system\\.)"}})

Database.current_op Is Removed
``````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.current_op`` method. Instead, use 
the ``~pymongo.database.Database.aggregate`` method and the
`$currentOp aggregation pipeline stage <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/currentOp/>`__,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   ops = list(client.admin.aggregate([{'$currentOp': {}}]))

Database.add_user Is Removed
````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.add_user`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.6. Use the `createUser command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/createUser/>`__
or the `updateUser command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/updateUser/>`__
instead.

To create a user:

.. code-block:: python

   db.command("createUser", "admin", pwd="password", roles=["dbAdmin"])

To create a read-only user:

.. code-block:: python

   db.command("createUser", "user", pwd="password", roles=["read"])

To change a password:

.. code-block:: python

   db.command("updateUser", "user", pwd="newpassword")

Or change roles:

.. code-block:: python

   db.command("updateUser", "user", roles=["readWrite"])

Database.remove_user Is Removed
```````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.remove_user`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.6. Use the `dropUser command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/dropUser/>`__
instead:

.. code-block:: python

   db.command("dropUser", "user")

Database.profiling_level Is Removed
```````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.profiling_level`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.12. Use the `profile command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/profile/>`__
instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   profile = db.command('profile', -1)
   level = profile['was']

Database.set_profiling_level Is Removed
```````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.set_profiling_level`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.12. Use the `profile command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/profile/>`__
instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   res = db.command('profile', 2, filter={'op': 'query'})

Database.profiling_info Is Removed
``````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.profiling_info`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.12. Query the `system.profile collection <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/database-profiler/>`__
instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   profiling_info = list(db['system.profile'].find())

Database.__bool__ Raises NotImplementedError
````````````````````````````````````````````

``~pymongo.database.Database`` now raises an error upon evaluating as a
Boolean. You must now explicitly compare the database object with ``None``, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   if database is not None:

Collection
~~~~~~~~~~

The useCursor Option for Collection.aggregate Is Removed
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``useCursor`` option for
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate`` method, which was deprecated in
PyMongo 3.6. The option was only necessary when upgrading from MongoDB 2.4
to MongoDB 2.6.

Collection.insert Is Removed
````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.insert`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one`` method or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many`` method instead, as shown in the
following example:

.. code-block:: python

  collection.insert_one({'my': 'document'})
  collection.insert_many([{'doc': 2}, {'doc': 3}])

Collection.save Is Removed
``````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.save`` method. Applications will
get better performance by using the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one`` method
to insert a new document and the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.update_one`` method
to update an existing document, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

  result = collection.update_one({"_id": "some id"}, {"$set": {"some field": <some value>}})

If performance is not a concern and refactoring is untenable, you can implement the
``save`` method as shown in the following code block:

.. code-block:: python

   def save(doc):
       if '_id' in doc:
           collection.replace_one({'_id': doc['_id']}, doc, upsert=True)
           return doc['_id']
       else:
           res = collection.insert_one(doc)
           return res.inserted_id

Collection.update Is Removed
````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.update`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.update_one`` method
to update a single document or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.update_many`` method to update multiple
documents, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   collection.update_one({}, {'$set': {'a': 1}})
   collection.update_many({}, {'$set': {'b': 1}})

Collection.remove Is Removed
````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.remove`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_one`` method
to delete a single document or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_many`` method to delete multiple
documents, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   collection.delete_one({'a': 1})
   collection.delete_many({'b': 1})

Collection.find_and_modify Is Removed
`````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.find_and_modify`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_update`` method,
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_replace`` method, or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_delete`` method instead, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   updated_doc = collection.find_one_and_update({'a': 1}, {'$set': {'b': 1}})
   replaced_doc = collection.find_one_and_replace({'b': 1}, {'c': 1})
   deleted_doc = collection.find_one_and_delete({'c': 1})

Collection.count and Cursor.count Are Removed
`````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.count`` method and
the ``pymongo.cursor.Cursor.count`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.count_documents`` method or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.estimated_document_count`` method instead, as
shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   ntotal = collection.estimated_document_count()
   nmatched = collection.count_documents({'price': {'$gte': 10}})

.. note::
   
   When migrating from the ``count`` method to the ``count_documents`` method,
   the following query operators must be replaced:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 10 10
      
      * - Operator
        - Replacement
      
      * - ``$where``
        - `$expr <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/expr/>`__
        
      * - ``$near``
        - `$geoWithin <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/>`__ with `$center <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/>`__
          | For example: ``{'$geoWithin': {'$center': [[<x>,<y>], <radius>]}}``
        
      * - ``$nearSphere``
        - `$geoWithin <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/>`__ with `$centerSphere <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/>`__
          | For example: ``{'$geoWithin': {'$centerSphere': [[<x>,<y>], <radius>]}}`` |

Collection.initialize_ordered_bulk_op and initialize_unordered_bulk_op Are Removed
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.initialize_ordered_bulk_op`` method
and ``pymongo.bulk.BulkOperationBuilder``. Use
the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.bulk_write`` method instead, as shown in the following
example:

.. code-block:: python

   coll.bulk_write([
       InsertOne({'a': 1}),
       UpdateOne({'a': 1}, {'$set': {'b': 1}}),
       ReplaceOne({'a': 2}, {'b': 2}, upsert=True),
       DeleteOne({'a': 3}),
   ])

Collection.initialize_unordered_bulk_op Is Removed
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.initialize_unordered_bulk_op`` method.
Use the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.bulk_write`` method instead, as shown in the
following example:

.. code-block:: python

   coll.bulk_write([
       InsertOne({'a': 1}),
       UpdateOne({'a': 1}, {'$set': {'b': 1}}),
       ReplaceOne({'a': 2}, {'b': 2}, upsert=True),
       DeleteOne({'a': 3}),
   ], ordered=False)

Collection.group Is Removed
```````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.group`` method. This method was
deprecated in PyMongo 3.5. MongoDB 4.2 removed the `group command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/group/>`__
Use the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate`` method with the ``$group`` stage
instead.

Collection.map_reduce and Collection.inline_map_reduce Are Removed
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce`` method and
the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.inline_map_reduce`` method.
Migrate to the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate`` method or run the
`mapReduce command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/mapReduce/>`__ directly
with the ``~pymongo.database.Database.command`` method instead.

For more guidance on this migration, see the following documentation:

- :manual:`</reference/map-reduce-to-aggregation-pipeline/>`
- :manual:`</reference/aggregation-commands-comparison/>`

Collection.ensure_index Is Removed
``````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index`` method. Use
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index`` method or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_indexes`` method instead.

Note that ``ensure_index`` maintained an in-memory cache of recently created indexes,
whereas the newer methods do not. Applications should avoid frequent calls
to the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index`` method or
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_indexes`` method. The following code
example shows how to check whether an index exists before creating a new one:

.. code-block:: python

   def persist(self, document):
       if not self.created_index:
           collection.create_index('a', unique=True)
           self.created_index = True
       collection.insert_one(document)

Collection.reindex Is Removed
`````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.collection.Collection.reindex`` method. Run the
`reIndex command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/reindex/>`__
directly instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> result = database.command('reIndex', 'my_collection')

.. note::

   The ``reIndex`` command is deprecated as of MongoDB v6.0.

The modifiers Parameter Is Removed
``````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``modifiers`` parameter from
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`` method,
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`` method,
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_raw_batches`` method, and
the ``~pymongo.cursor.Cursor`` method. Pass the options directly to the method
instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   cursor = coll.find(
       {},
       comment="comment",
       hint={"_id": 1},
       min={"_id": 0},
       max={"_id": 6},
       max_time_ms=6000,
       return_key=False,
       show_record_id=False,
   )

The hint Parameter Is Required with min/max
```````````````````````````````````````````

The ``hint`` option is now required when using ``min`` or ``max`` queries
with the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`` method to ensure that the query utilizes
the correct index. The following example shows how to use the ``hint`` option:

.. code-block:: python

   cursor = coll.find({}, min={'x', min_value}, hint=[('x', ASCENDING)])

Collection.__bool__ raises NotImplementedError
``````````````````````````````````````````````
``~pymongo.collection.Collection`` now raises an error upon evaluating as a
Boolean. You must now explicitly compare the collection object with ``None``, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   if collection is not None:

Collection.find Returns Entire Document with Empty Projection
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Empty projections--for example, ``{}`` or ``[]``--for the
``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`` and ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one``
methods
are now passed to the server as-is. Previously, the driver
substituted in a projection of ``{"_id": 1}``. This means that an empty
projection will now return the entire document, not just the ``"_id"`` field.

To ensure that behavior remains consistent, pass ``"_id":1`` explicitly, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   coll.find({}, projection={"_id":1})

SONManipulator Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``pymongo.son_manipulator``,
``pymongo.son_manipulator.SONManipulator``,
``pymongo.son_manipulator.ObjectIdInjector``,
``pymongo.son_manipulator.ObjectIdShuffler``,
``pymongo.son_manipulator.AutoReference``,
``pymongo.son_manipulator.NamespaceInjector``,
the ``pymongo.database.Database.add_son_manipulator`` method,
``pymongo.database.Database.outgoing_copying_manipulators``,
``pymongo.database.Database.outgoing_manipulators``,
``pymongo.database.Database.incoming_copying_manipulators``, and
``pymongo.database.Database.incoming_manipulators``.

Removed the ``manipulate`` parameter from
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`` method,
the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`` method, and
the ``~pymongo.cursor.Cursor`` method.

The ``pymongo.son_manipulator.SONManipulator`` API has limitations as a
technique for transforming your data and was deprecated in PyMongo 3.0.
Instead, it is more flexible and straightforward to transform outgoing
documents in your own code before passing them to PyMongo, and transform
incoming documents after receiving them from PyMongo.

Alternatively, if your application uses the ``SONManipulator`` API to convert
custom types to BSON, the ``~bson.codec_options.TypeCodec`` and
``~bson.codec_options.TypeRegistry`` APIs may be a suitable alternative.

``SON().items()`` Now Returns ``dict_items`` Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``~bson.son.SON.items`` method now returns a ``dict_items`` object rather than
a list.

``SON().iteritems()`` Is  Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SON.iteritems()`` is now removed. Instead, use the ``SON.items()`` method, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   for k, v in son.items():

IsMaster Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``pymongo.ismaster.IsMaster``.
Use ``pymongo.hello.Hello`` instead.

NotMasterError Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``~pymongo.errors.NotMasterError``.
Use ``~pymongo.errors.NotPrimaryError`` instead.

CertificateError Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``~pymongo.errors.CertificateError``. Since PyMongo 3.0, this error
is handled internally and is never raised to the application.

pymongo.GEOHAYSTACK Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``pymongo.GEOHAYSTACK``. Replace with "geoHaystack" or create a
2d index and use ``$geoNear`` or ``$geoWithin`` instead.

UUIDLegacy Is Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed ``bson.binary.UUIDLegacy``. Use
the ``bson.binary.Binary.from_uuid`` method instead, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   uu = uuid.uuid4()
   uuid_legacy = Binary.from_uuid(uu, PYTHON_LEGACY)

Default JSONMode Changed from LEGACY to RELAXED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed the default JSON encoding representation from ``LEGACY`` to ``RELAXED``.
The ``json_mode`` parameter for ``bson.json_util.dumps`` now defaults to
``~bson.json_util.RELAXED_JSON_OPTIONS``.

GridFS
~~~~~~

.. _removed-gridfs-checksum:

disable_md5 Parameter Is Removed
````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``disable_md5`` option for ``~gridfs.GridFSBucket`` and
``~gridfs.GridFS``. GridFS no longer generates checksums.
Applications that desire a file digest should implement it outside GridFS
and store it with other file metadata. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  import hashlib
  my_db = MongoClient().test
  fs = GridFSBucket(my_db)
  with fs.open_upload_stream("test_file") as grid_in:
      file_data = b'...'
      sha356 = hashlib.sha256(file_data).hexdigest()
      grid_in.write(file_data)
      grid_in.sha356 = sha356  # Set the custom 'sha356' field

Note that for large files, the checksum may need to be computed in chunks
to avoid the excessive memory needed to load the entire file at once.

.. _pymongo-removed-features:

Removed Features with No Migration Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cursor_manager support Is Removed
`````````````````````````````````

Removed ``pymongo.cursor_manager.CursorManager``,
``pymongo.cursor_manager``, and
the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.set_cursor_manager`` method.

MongoClient.close_cursor Is Removed
```````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.close_cursor`` method and
the ``pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.kill_cursors`` method. Instead, close cursors
by using the ``pymongo.cursor.Cursor.close`` method or
the ``pymongo.command_cursor.CommandCursor.close`` method.

Database.eval, Database.system_js, and SystemJS Are Removed
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``~pymongo.database.Database.eval`` method,
``~pymongo.database.Database.system_js``, and
``~pymongo.database.SystemJS``. The ``eval`` command was deprecated in
MongoDB 3.0 and removed in MongoDB 4.2.

There is no replacement for ``eval`` in MongoDB 4.2+. However, on MongoDB <= 4.0, you can
call the ``eval`` command as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from bson.code import Code
   >>> result = database.command('eval', Code('function (x) {return x;}'), args=[3]).get('retval')

Database.error, Database.last_status, Database.previous_error, and Database.reset_error_history Are Removed
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.database.Database.error`` method,
the ``pymongo.database.Database.last_status`` method,
the ``pymongo.database.Database.previous_error`` method, and
the ``pymongo.database.Database.reset_error_history`` method.
These methods were deprecated in PyMongo 2.8 and are now obsolete.
All MongoDB write operations use an acknowledged
write concern and report their errors by default. 

Collection.parallel_scan Is Removed
```````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``~pymongo.collection.Collection.parallel_scan`` method. MongoDB 4.2
removed the `parallelCollectionScan command <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/parallelCollectionScan/>`__.
There is no replacement.

pymongo.message Helpers Are Removed
```````````````````````````````````

Removed the ``pymongo.message.delete`` method, the ``pymongo.message.get_more`` method,
the ``pymongo.message.insert`` method, the ``pymongo.message.kill_cursors`` method,
the ``pymongo.message.query`` method, and the ``pymongo.message.update`` method.

Name Is a Required Argument for pymongo.driver_info.DriverInfo
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``name`` is now a required argument for the ``pymongo.driver_info.DriverInfo`` class.

DBRef BSON/JSON Decoding Behavior
`````````````````````````````````

PyMongo now decodes a subdocument into a
``~bson.dbref.DBRef`` if and only if it contains both ``$ref`` and
``$id`` fields and the ``$ref``, ``$id``, and ``$db`` fields are of the
correct type. Otherwise, the document is returned as normal. Previously, any
subdocument containing a ``$ref`` field would be decoded as a
``~bson.dbref.DBRef``.


Encoding a UUID Raises an Error by Default
``````````````````````````````````````````

The default ``uuid_representation`` for ``~bson.codec_options.CodecOptions``,
``~bson.json_util.JSONOptions``, and
``~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`` has been changed from
``bson.binary.UuidRepresentation.PYTHON_LEGACY`` to
``bson.binary.UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED``. Attempting to encode a
``uuid.UUID`` instance to BSON or JSON now produces an error by default.

If you were using UUIDs previously, you will need to set your ``uuid_representation`` to
``bson.binary.UuidRepresentation.PYTHON_LEGACY`` to avoid data corruption.
If you do not have UUIDs, set ``bson.binary.UuidRepresentation.STANDARD``.
If you do not explicitly set a value, you will receive an error like the following when
attempting to encode a ``uuid.UUID``:

.. code-block:: python

    ValueError: cannot encode native uuid.UUID with UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED. UUIDs can be manually converted...

Additional BSON Classes Implement __slots__
````````````````````````````````````````````

``~bson.int64.Int64``, ``~bson.min_key.MinKey``,
``~bson.max_key.MaxKey``, ``~bson.timestamp.Timestamp``,
``~bson.regex.Regex``, and ``~bson.dbref.DBRef`` now implement
``__slots__`` to reduce memory usage. This means that their attributes are fixed, and new
attributes cannot be added to the object at runtime.
