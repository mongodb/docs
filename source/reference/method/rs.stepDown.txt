rs.stepDown()
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

.. method:: rs.stepDown(seconds)

   Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a
   :term:`secondary`, triggering an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`. The method steps down the primary
   for a specified number of seconds; during this period, the stepdown
   member is ineligible from becoming primary.

   The method only steps down the primary if an :data:`electable
   <~replSetGetConfig.members[n].priority>` secondary is up-to-date
   with the primary, waiting up to 10 seconds for a secondary to catch
   up.

   The method is only valid against the primary and will error if run
   on a non-primary member.
   
   The :method:`rs.stepDown()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-rs.stepDown-param.rst

   :method:`rs.stepDown()` provides a wrapper around the
   command :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`.

Behavior
--------

.. versionadded:: 3.0

Before stepping down, :method:`rs.stepDown()` will attempt to
terminate long running user operations that would block the primary
from stepping down, such as an index build, a write operation or a
map-reduce job.

To avoid rollbacks, :method:`rs.stepDown()` only steps down the primary
if an electable secondary is completely caught up with the primary. The
method will wait up to the ``10`` seconds for a secondary to catch up.

If no electable secondary meets this criterion by the waiting period,
the primary does not step down and the method throws an exception.

If the :method:`rs.stepDown()` completes successfully, the method
forces all clients currently connected to the database to disconnect.
This helps ensure that the clients maintain an accurate view of the
replica set. The :program:`mongo` shell will display an error related
to the disconnect.

.. note::

   :method:`rs.stepDown()` blocks all writes to the primary while it
   runs.
