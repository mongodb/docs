Overview
--------

OData (Open Data Protocol) is a standardized protocol for building and consuming
RESTful APIs that allows for the querying and manipulation of data by using
HTTP requests. It provides a uniform way to expose and interact
with data from multiple sources. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate OData with your MongoDB application.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :ref:`<csharp-quickstart>`.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Create a new ASP.Net application named
      ``ODataExample`` and install the {+driver-short+}. You can install the
      driver by using the NuGet package manager in your IDE, or by running the
      following command in the .NET CLI:

      .. code-block:: shell
    
         dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver
      
      Then, install the ``MongoDB.AspNetCore.OData`` NuGet
      package through the NuGet Package Manager or through the .NET CLI by running the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         dotnet add package MongoDB.AspNetCore.OData

   .. step:: Define your Models

      Create a new folder in your solution called ``Models`` and copy the
      following ``Restaurant.cs``, ``Address.cs``, and ``GradeEntry.cs`` files into the
      folder:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/RestaurantOdata.cs
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/Address.cs
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/GradeEntry.cs
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      .. include:: /includes/convention-pack-note.rst

   .. step:: Create an OData Controller

      Create a new folder in your solution called ``Controllers`` and add a new
      controller file called ``RestaurantsController.cs``. Copy the following code
      into the file:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/OData.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: // start-controller
         :end-before: // end-controller

      This code performs the following actions:

      - Creates a constructor that connects to MongoDB, and gets the
        ``restaurants`` collection.
      - Creates a ``Get`` endpoint that returns all restaurants in the collection.
      - Specifies the ``MongoEnableQuery`` attribute to enable querying on the
        ``Get`` endpoint.
      - Specifies the ``PageSize`` attribute on ``MongoEnableQuery`` to limit the
        number of documents returned to ``5``.

   .. step:: Configure the OData Service

      Paste the following code into your ``Program.cs`` file to configure the OData
      service and map your controller endpoints.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/connection/OData.cs
         :language: csharp
         :start-after: // start-configure
         :end-before: // end-configure

      .. note::

         Replace the ``<"Your connection URI">`` placeholder with your MongoDB connection string.
      
      This code performs the following actions:

      - Instantiates a new ``MongoClient`` and registers it as a singleton in
        the dependency injection container.
      - Defines the Entity Data Model (EDM) and registers ``Restaurants`` as an
        entity set with the key ``Id``.
      - Adds the OData service and enables the ``Select()`` query operation.
      - Registers the route by using the ``AddRouteComponents()`` method.
      - Calls the ``UseRouting()`` and ``MapControllers()`` methods to match
        incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate endpoint.
      
      .. note::

         The {+driver-short+} does not support OData-Aggregation with the
         ``$apply`` query operation.

   .. step:: Run the Application

      Run the application by using your IDE, or by running the following command
      in your shell at the root directory of your project:

      .. code-block:: shell

         dotnet run ODataExample.csproj

      After running the application, your terminal displays output similar
      to the following:

      .. code-block:: none

         info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
               Now listening on: http://localhost:5183
         info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
               Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
         info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
               Hosting environment: Development
         info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
               Content root path: <Path to your project>

      .. tip::

         After running your application, your IDE might automatically open a
         browser window to the URL where the application is running, which
         displays a ``"page can't be found"`` error. This is expected because the
         application only has a single ``Get`` endpoint configured.
      
   .. step:: Query the Data

      To query the data, navigate to the ``Get`` endpoint specified in the
      application. To do so, open a browser and navigate to the ``localhost``
      URL specified in the terminal output from the preceding step. Then, append
      the route for the ``Get`` endpoint: ``/odata/Restaurants``. For example, if an
      application is running at ``localhost:5183``, navigate to
      ``http://localhost:5183/odata/Restaurants``.

      If successful, the browser displays 5 restaurants in the
      collection, in JSON format. The output is similar to the
      following:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "@odata.context": "http://localhost:5183/odata/$metadata#Restaurants",
           "value": [
             {
               "Name": "Glorious Food",
               "RestaurantId": "40361521",
               "Cuisine": "American",
               "Borough": "Manhattan",
               "Id": "...",
               "Address": {
                 "Building": "522",
                 "Coordinates": [-73.95171, 40.767461],
                 "Street": "East   74 Street",
                 "ZipCode": "10021"
               },
               "Grades": [
                 ...
               ]
             },

             ...

             ]
         }
