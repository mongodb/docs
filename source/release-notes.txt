.. !!!!! NOTE TO FOLKS UPDATING THIS !!!!!
.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.
.. (DOCS-9670 for context)

EXPLAIN Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can use EXPLAIN to return details of aggregation pipeline used to generate query results.

Common Table Expression Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BI Connector now supports queries that include Common Table Expressions.

.. _bi-2-5-0:

|bi| 2.5.0
----------

*Released May 23, 2018*

- Improved memory management for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.
- New SSPI support for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` on Windows.
- The :option:`--sampleNamespaces  <mongosqld --sampleNamespaces>`
  option now supports :ref:`exclusion <sampling-exclusion>`.
- ``NULL`` valued types are now cast to varchar during sampling.
- Optimized ``COUNT(*)`` query performance.
- ``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` are now pushed down.

New SSPI Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows Clients may now use kerberos to authenticate against the
|bi-short|.

``NULL`` Valued Types Are Now Cast to Varchar During Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resolves the issue where queries would fail due to ``NULL`` values
being ignored during sampling. Now, ``NULL`` values will be cast as SQL
type ``VARCHAR``.

``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` Are Now Pushed Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|bi-short| will now push down ``SIN``, ``COS``, and ``TAN`` SQL
functions. This will improve performance for queries using these
functions.

  the :setting:`mongodb.net.auth.username` and :setting:`mongodb.net.auth.password`
