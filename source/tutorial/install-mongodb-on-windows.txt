Install MongoDB on Windows
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This tutorial provides a method for installing and running the
MongoDB server (i.e. ":program:`mongod.exe`") on the Microsoft Windows
platform through the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` and outlines the process
for setting up MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service`.

Operating MongoDB with Windows is similar to MongoDB on other
platforms. Most components share the same operational patterns.

Procedure
---------

Download MongoDB for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the latest production release of MongoDB from the `MongoDB
downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_.

There are three builds of MongoDB for Windows:

- MongoDB for Windows Server 2008 R2 edition (*2008R2+) only runs on Windows
  Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 64-bit, and newer versions of Windows. This
  build takes advantage of recent enhancements to the Windows Platform
  and cannot operate on older versions of Windows.

- MongoDB for Windows 64-bit runs on any 64-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP, including Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows
  7 64-bit.

- MongoDB for Windows 32-bit runs on any 32-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP. 32-bit versions of MongoDB are only intended
  for older systems and for use in testing and development systems.

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   MongoDB does not support Windows XP. Please use a more recent
   version of Windows to use more recent releases of MongoDB.

.. note::

   Always download the correct version of MongoDB for your
   Windows system. The 64-bit versions of MongoDB will not
   work with 32-bit Windows.

   32-bit versions of MongoDB are suitable only for testing and evaluation
   purposes and only support databases smaller than 2GB.

   You can find the architecture of your version of Windows
   platform using the following command in the :guilabel:`Command
   Prompt`

   .. code-block:: powershell

      wmic os get osarchitecture

In Windows Explorer, find the MongoDB download file, typically in the
default Downloads directory. Extract the archive to ``C:\`` by right
clicking on the archive and selecting :guilabel:`Extract All` and
browsing to ``C:\``.

.. note::

   The folder name will be either:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb-win32-i386-[version]

   Or:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb-win32-x86_64-[version]

   In both examples, replace ``[version]`` with the version of MongoDB
   downloaded.

Set up the Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` by selecting the :guilabel:`Start
Menu`, then :guilabel:`All Programs`, then :guilabel:`Accessories`,
then right click :guilabel:`Command Prompt`, and select :guilabel:`Run
as Administrator` from the popup menu. In the :guilabel:`Command
Prompt`, issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd \
   move C:\mongodb-win32-* C:\mongodb

.. note::

   MongoDB is self-contained and does not have any other system
   dependencies. You can run MongoDB from any folder you choose. You
   may install MongoDB in any directory (e.g. ``D:\test\mongodb``)

MongoDB requires a :term:`data folder <dbpath>` to store its files. The default
location for the MongoDB data directory is ``C:\data\db``. Create this
folder using the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`. Issue the following
command sequence:

.. code-block:: powershell

   md data
   md data\db

.. note::

   You may specify an alternate path for ``\data\db`` with the
   :setting:`dbpath` setting for :program:`mongod.exe`, as in the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath d:\test\mongodb\data

   If your path includes spaces, enclose the entire path in double
   quotations, for example:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath "d:\test\mongo db data"


Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start MongoDB, execute from the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe

This will start the main MongoDB database process. The ``waiting for connections`` message in the console output
indicates that the mongod.exe process is running successfully.

.. note::

   Depending on the security level of your system, Windows will issue
   a :guilabel:`Security Alert` dialog box about blocking "some
   features" of ``C:\\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe`` from communicating on
   networks. All users should select ``Private Networks, such as my
   home or work network`` and click ``Allow access``. For additional
   information on security and MongoDB, please read the 
   :doc:`/administration/security` page.

.. warning::

   Do not allow :program:`mongod.exe` to be accessible to public
   networks without running in "Secure Mode" (i.e. :setting:`auth`.)
   MongoDB is designed to be run in "trusted environments" and the
   database does not enable authentication or "Secure Mode" by
   default.

Connect to MongoDB using the :program:`mongo.exe` shell. Open another
:guilabel:`Command Prompt` and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe

.. note::

   Executing the command ``start C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe`` will
   automatically start the :program:`mongo.exe` shell in a separate
   :guilabel:`Command Prompt` window.

The :program:`mongo.exe` shell will connect to :program:`mongod.exe` running on
the localhost interface and port ``27017`` by default. At the
:program:`mongo.exe` prompt, issue the following two commands to
insert a record in the ``test`` :term:`collection` of the default
``test`` database and then retrieve that record:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   > db.test.find()

.. seealso:: ":program:`mongo`" and ":doc:`/reference/javascript`." If
   you want to develop applications using .NET, see the documentation
   of :ecosystem:`C# and MongoDB </drivers/csharp>` for more
   information.

.. _tutorial-mongod-as-windows-service:

MongoDB as a Windows Service
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

Setup MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service`, so that the database
will start automatically following each reboot cycle.

.. note::

   :program:`mongod.exe` added support for running as a Windows
   service in version 2.0, and :program:`mongos.exe` added support for
   running as a Windows Service in version 2.1.1.

Configure the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should specify two options when running MongoDB as a Windows
Service: a path for the log output (i.e. :setting:`logpath`) and a
:doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`.

#. Create a specific directory for MongoDB log files:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      md C:\mongodb\log

#. Create a configuration file for the :setting:`logpath` option for
   MongoDB in the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` by issuing this command:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      echo logpath=C:\mongodb\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg

While these optional steps are optional, creating a specific location
for log files and using the configuration file are good practice.

.. note::

   Consider setting the :setting:`logappend` option. If you do not,
   :program:`mongod.exe` will delete the contents of the existing log
   file when starting.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      The default :setting:`logpath` and :setting:`logappend` behavior
      changed in the 2.2 release.

Install and Run the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run all of the following commands in :guilabel:`Command Prompt` with
"Administrative Privileges:"

#. To install the MongoDB service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg --install

   Modify the path to the ``mongod.cfg`` file as needed. For the
   :option:`--install <mongod.exe --install>` option to succeed, you *must* specify a
   :setting:`logpath` setting or the :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`
   run-time option.

#. To run the MongoDB service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      net start MongoDB

.. note::

   If you wish to use an alternate path for your :setting:`dbpath`
   specify it in the config file (e.g. ``C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg``) on
   that you specified in the :option:`--install <mongod.exe --install>`
   operation. You may also specify :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
   on the command line; however, always prefer the configuration file.

   If the :setting:`dbpath` directory does not exist,
   :program:`mongod.exe` will not be able to start. The default value
   for :setting:`dbpath` is ``\data\db``.

Stop or Remove the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To stop the MongoDB service:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     net stop MongoDB

- To remove the MongoDB service:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --remove
