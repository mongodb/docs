       from the cache if the data is less than one hour old. If the 
       data from the cache is more than one hour old, |charts-short| 
       queries the data source for the latest data, refreshes the 
       cache, and renders the chart or dashboard using this data.

       the cache is older than the ``maxDataAge`` value, in seconds, 
       |charts-short| queries the data source for the latest data, 
       refreshes the cache, and renders the chart or dashboard using

       seconds, |charts-short| queries the data source for the latest 
       data, refreshes the cache, and renders the chart or dashboard
