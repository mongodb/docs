Create the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses a ``persons`` collection, which contains documents
describing each person's name, date of birth, vocation, and other
details. The aggregation selects documents based on whether
their field values match specified criteria.

First, create Go structs to model the data in the ``persons``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/models.snippet.person-address.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

To create the ``persons`` collection and insert the sample data, add the
following code to your application:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/load-data.snippet.example.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add a match stage for people who are engineers.

      First, add a :pipeline:`$match` stage that finds documents in which
      the value of the ``vocation`` field is ``"ENGINEER"``:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/run-pipeline.snippet.match.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a sort stage to sort from youngest to oldest.

      Next, add a :pipeline:`$sort` stage that sorts the
      documents in descending order by the ``dateofbirth`` field to
      list the youngest people first:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/run-pipeline.snippet.sort.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a limit stage to see only three results.

      Next, add a :pipeline:`$limit`
      stage to the pipeline to output only the first three documents in
      the results.

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/run-pipeline.snippet.limit.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add an unset stage to remove unneeded fields.

      Finally, add an :pipeline:`$unset` stage. The
      ``$unset`` stage removes unnecessary fields from the result documents:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/run-pipeline.snippet.unset.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

      .. tip::

         Use the ``$unset`` operator instead of ``$project`` to avoid
         modifying the aggregation pipeline if documents with
         different fields are added to the collection.

   .. step:: Run the aggregation pipeline.

      Add the following code to the end of your application to perform
      the aggregation on the ``persons`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/run-pipeline.snippet.run-agg.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

      Finally, run the application and inspect the results.

   .. step:: Interpret the aggregation results.

      The aggregated result contains three documents. The documents
      represent the three youngest people with the vocation of ``"ENGINEER"``,
      ordered from youngest to oldest. The results omit the ``_id`` and ``address``
      fields.

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/filter/output.txt
         :language: text
         :copyable: false
         :category: example return object
