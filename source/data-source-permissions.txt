Data Source Permissions
=======================

Data source permissions dictate which users in your |service|
project have access to the data source and the actions they can perform
on the data source. The following data source permissions are
available:

.. _data-source-roles:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - Reader
     - Can access the data source by viewing existing charts or
       creating new charts which use the data source.

   * - Manager
     - Has all privileges of ``Reader`` and can also
       :ref:`modify the alias <mod-data-source-alias>` and
       :ref:`modify the connection URI <mod-data-source-uri>` of a data
       source.

   * - Owner
     - Has all privileges of ``Manager`` and can also
       :ref:`manage permissions <mod-data-source-permissions>` on the
       data source and :ref:`remove the data source
       <charts-remove-data-source>`.

       The creator of the data source automatically has the
       ``Owner`` role. The creator cannot be removed from the list of
       data source users and thier ``Owner`` role cannot be modified.

View Data Source Permissions
----------------------------

To view permissions for a specific data source, navigate to the
:doc:`Data Sources tab </data-sources>` and hover over the
data source's :guilabel:`Access` button. A tooltip describing the data
source permissions will appear. The tooltip displays your permissions,
the owner of the data source, and all other users who have access.

The following table lists the possible icons and their associated
permissions:

.. _data-source-permission-icons:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Icon
     - Description

   * - :icon:`eye` Eye Icon
     - You have ``Reader`` permission.

   * - :icon:`globe` Globe Icon
     - You have either ``Manager`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`Everyone <data-source-access-everyone>` in your |service|
       `project <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/>`__
       has some level of access to the data source.

   * - :icon:`users` Group Icon
     - You have either ``Manager`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`additional users <data-source-specific-access>` have
       some level of access to the data source.

   * - :icon:`lock` Lock Icon
     - You have ``Owner`` permission and no other user has
       access.

.. _data-source-set-permissions:

Set Data Source Permissions
---------------------------

You can set data source permissions when you first
:ref:`add a data source <add-data-source>`, or you can
:ref:`modify permissions <mod-data-source-permissions>` on a data
source which has already been created.

Refer to the following sections for instructions on granting
:ref:`specific users <data-source-specific-access>` permissions on a
data source and granting
:ref:`all users in your Atlas project
<dashboard-access-everyone>` permissions on a data source:

.. _data-source-specific-access:

Specific User Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To grant specific users from your |service| project permissions on
your data source:

1. Search for the desired user using the search bar directly above
   where the data source users are listed. You can search for users
   by their username or email address.

   .. note::

      You can only share data sources with users who are members of
      the |service| project associated with your |charts-short|
      instance.

#. Click the desired user to add them to the permissions list.

#. Use the dropdown to the right of the user's name to assign the
   appropriate :ref:`role <data-source-roles>`.

#. Repeat steps 1-3 for each user you wish to grant data source access.

   :figwidth: 721px

To remove access for a user you have added, click the trash can icon
to the right of the user's name.

.. _data-source-access-everyone:

Access for All Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   When you create a data source, |service| assigns the
   :ref:`Reader <data-source-roles>` permission to every user in your
   |service| project by default.

To grant all users in your |service| project permissions on your data
source:

1. Toggle the switch on the right-side of the :guilabel:`Everyone in
   <Project Name>` user to ``On``.

#. Select the :ref:`role <data-source-roles>` to apply to all
   users in your |service| project.

   .. note::

      If permissions are assigned to both :guilabel:`Everyone` in your
      project and a specific user, the user's specific permissions
      take precedence over the permissions set to :guilabel:`Everyone`.

      For example, if :guilabel:`Everyone` has the ``Manager``
      permission on a data source and a specific user Alice has the
      ``Reader`` permission, Alice's effective permission level is
      ``Reader``.
