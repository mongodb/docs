Shut Down a Deployment
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can shut down an entire :term:`sharded cluster`, entire :term:`replica
set`, or a single :term:`standalone instance <standalone>`. The procedure
terminates all the deployment's :program:`mongod` and, if a cluster,
:program:`mongos` instances.

The procedure does **not** remove the servers from |mms|. |mms| continues to
monitor the servers and display their statuses. To remove a deployment from
|mms| monitoring, see :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
