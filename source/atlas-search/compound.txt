   :description: Use the compound operator to combine multiple operators in a single query and get results with a match score.

Definition
----------

.. expression:: compound

   The ``compound`` operator combines two or more operators into a
   single query. Each element of a ``compound`` query is called a
   clause, and each clause consists of one or more sub-queries.

.. _compound-syntax:

Syntax
------

``compound`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
       "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
       "compound": {
         <must | mustNot | should | filter>: [ { <clauses> } ],
         "score": <options>
       }
     }
   }

Each ``must``, ``mustNot``, ``should``, and ``filter`` clause contains 
an array of subclauses. Use array syntax even if the array contains 
only one subclause. See the :ref:`examples <compound-examples>` on 
this page.

.. _compound-options:

Options
-------

``compound`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - .. data:: must
     - Clauses that must match to for a document to be included in the
       results. The returned score is the sum of the scores of all the 
       subqueries in the clause.

       Maps to the ``AND`` boolean operator.

   * - .. data:: mustNot
     - Clauses that must not match for a document to be included in
       the results. ``mustNot`` clauses don't contribute to a returned 
       document's score.

       Maps to the ``AND NOT`` boolean operator.

   * - .. data:: should
     - Clauses that you prefer to match in documents that are included
       in the results. Documents that contain a match for a ``should`` 
       clause have higher scores than documents that don't contain a
       ``should`` clause. The returned score is the sum of the scores 
       of all the subqueries in the clause.

       If you use more than one ``should`` clause, you can use the
       ``minimumShouldMatch`` option to specify a minimum number of
       ``should`` clauses that must match to include a document in the 
       results. If omitted, the ``minimumShouldMatch`` option defaults
       to ``0``.

       See an :ref:`example <min-example>`.

       Maps to the ``OR`` boolean operator.

       If you use only the ``should`` clause inside a compound query,
       the ``compound`` operator treats the array of the ``should`` clause
       queries as a logical ``OR``. |fts| must find a match for
       at least one ``should`` criteria to return any results. When
       you specify multiple ``should`` clause criteria with the
       ``minimumShouldMatch`` option set to ``0``, |fts| treats 
       ``minimumShouldMatch`` as set to ``1`` and must match at least
       one criteria to return any results.

   * - .. data:: filter
     - Clauses that must all match for a document to be
       included in the results. ``filter`` clauses do not contribute
       to a returned document's score.

       .. example:: 

          For example, you can replace the :pipeline:`$match` stage 
          with the ``compound`` operator ``filter`` condition in the 
          ``$search`` stage: 

          .. code-block:: json 
             :copyable: false 

             {
               "$match": {
                 "role": { "$in": [ "CLIENT", "PROFESSIONAL" ] }
               }
             }

          You can use the ``filter`` option instead: 

          .. code-block:: json 
             :copyable: false 

             $search: {
               "compound": {
                 "filter": [{
                   "queryString": { 
                     "defaultPath": "role",
                     "query": "CLIENT OR PROFESSIONAL"                     
                   }
                 }]
               }
             }

       See another :ref:`filter example <filter-example>`.

   * - ``score``
     - Modify the :ref:`score <scoring-ref>` of the entire ``compound`` 
       clause. You can use ``score`` to boost, replace, or otherwise 
       alter the score. If you don't specify ``score``, the returned 
       score is the sum of the scores of all the subqueries in the 
       ``must`` and ``should`` clauses that generated a match. To learn
       more, see :ref:`compound-score`.

.. _compound-usage:

Usage 
-----

You can use any of the clauses with any top-level operator, such as 
:ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>`, :ref:`text <text-ref>`, or 
:ref:`span <span-ref>`, to specify query criteria. 

.. _compound-score:

Scoring Behavior
----------------

|fts| scores documents in the result set by summing the score that the
document received for each individual clause that generated a match on
the document. Only ``must`` and ``should`` clauses participate in
scoring. The result set is ordered by score, highest to lowest. 

You can boost or replace the score of the entire compound query using
the ``score`` option. For an example of replacing the entire compound
score, see :ref:`Compound Score Example <must-should-example>` below.
You can use :ref:`score <scoring-ref>` to also boost or alter the score
for each subquery in each clause. For some examples of altered scores in
``compound`` operator clauses, see :ref:`scoring-options`. 

.. _compound-examples:

Examples
--------

The examples on this page use a collection called ``fruit``, which 
contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp.",
     "category" : "nonorganic",
     "in_stock" : false
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six.",
     "category" : "nonorganic",
     "in_stock" : true
   },
   {
     "_id" : 3,
     "type" : "pear",
     "description" : "Bosc and Bartlett are the most common varieties of pears.",
     "category" : "organic",
     "in_stock" : true
   }

The ``fruit`` collection has an |fts| index on the ``description``
field which uses the :ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer.
The ``standard`` analyzer lower-cases all words and disregards common
stop words (``"the", "a", "and",`` etc).

.. _must-must-not-example-ref:

``must`` and ``mustNot`` Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses a combination of ``must`` and ``mustNot``
clauses to contruct a query. The ``must`` clause uses the 
:ref:`text <text-ref>` operator to search for the term ``varieties`` 
in the ``description`` field. For a document to match, it must fulfill 
the ``must`` clause. The ``mustNot`` clause performs a search operation 
for the term ``apples`` in the ``description`` field. For a document to
match, it must *not* fulfill the ``mustNot`` clause.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "compound": {
           "must": [{
             "text": {
               "query": "varieties",
               "path": "description"
             }
           }],
           "mustNot": [{
             "text": {
               "query": "apples",
               "path": "description"
             }
           }]
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the document with ``_id: 3`` because its
``description`` field contains the word ``varieties`` and does not
contain ``apples``.

.. _must-should-example:

``must`` and ``should`` Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following queries use ``must`` to specify search conditions
that must be met and ``should`` to specify preference for documents
that contain the word ``Fuji``. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Basic Example
      :tabid: basic

      For this query, the ``$project`` pipeline stage excludes all 
      document fields except ``_id`` and adds a ``score`` field, which
      displays the document's relevance score.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :linenos:

         db.fruit.aggregate([
           {
             "$search": {
               "compound": {
                 "must": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "varieties",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "should": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "Fuji",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }]
               }
             }
           },
           {
             "$project": {
               "score": { "$meta": "searchScore" }
             }
           }
         ])

      The above query returns the following results:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : 1, "score" : 0.6425117254257202 }
         { "_id" : 3, "score" : 0.21649497747421265 }

      The document with ``_id: 1`` has a higher score because its
      ``description`` field contains the word ``Fuji``, satisfying the
      ``should`` clause.

   .. tab:: Compound Score Example
      :tabid: compoundscore 

      The following query also specifies a :ref:`scoring-constant` 
      score of ``3`` for all the documents in the results. For this 
      query, the ``$project`` pipeline stage excludes all document 
      fields except ``_id`` and adds a ``score`` field.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :linenos:

         db.fruit.aggregate([
           {
             "$search": {
               "compound": {
                 "must": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "varieties",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "should": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "Fuji",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "score": { "constant": { "value": 3 } }
               }
             }
           },
           {
             "$project": {
               "score": { "$meta": "searchScore" }
             }
           }
         ])

      The above query returns the following results:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         [ { _id: 1, score: 3 }, { _id: 3, score: 3 } ]

      Both the documents receive the same score because the 
      ``constant`` option in the query replaces the score of each 
      document in the result with the number ``3``. 

.. _min-example:

minimumShouldMatch Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a query with multiple ``should`` clauses, you can use the
``miniumumShouldMatch`` option to specify a minimum number of clauses
which must match to return a result.

The following query has one ``must`` clause and two ``should`` clauses,
with a ``minimumShouldMatch`` value of ``1``. A document must include
the term ``varieties`` in the ``description`` field and must include
either ``Fuji`` or ``Golden Delicious`` in the description field to be
included in the result set.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "compound": {
           "must": [{
             "text": {
                "query": "varieties",
                "path": "description"
             }
           }],
           "should": [
             {
               "text": {
                 "query": "Fuji",
                 "path": "description"
               }
             },
             {
               "text": {
                 "query": "Golden Delicious",
                 "path": "description"
               }
             }],
             "minimumShouldMatch": 1
           }
         }
       }
   ])

The above query returns the following result:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp.",
     "category" : "nonorganic",
     "in_stock" : false
   }

The document with ``_id: 1`` matches the ``must`` clause and the first
of the two ``should`` clauses.

.. _filter-example:

``filter`` Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``filter`` behaves the same as ``must``, except that the ``filter`` 
clause is not considered in a returned document's score, and therefore 
does not affect the order of the returned documents.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Basic Example 
      :tabid: basic

      The following query uses the following clauses: 
      
      - ``must`` and ``filter`` to specify search conditions which must 
        be met.
      - ``should`` to specify preference for documents containing the 
        word  ``banana``. The ``should`` clause doesn't include the 
        ``minimumShouldMatch`` option. When you omit 
        ``minimumShouldMatch``, it defaults to ``0``.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :linenos:

         db.fruit.aggregate([
           {
             "$search": {
               "compound": {
                 "must": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "varieties",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "should": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "banana",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "filter": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "granny",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }]
               }
             }
           }
         ])

      The query returns the following result:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
           "_id" : 1,
           "type" : "apple",
           "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp.",
           "category" : "nonorganic",
           "in_stock" : false
         }

      The returned document fulfills all the requirements for inclusion:

      - Both the ``must`` clause and the ``filter`` clause match.
      - The ``minimumShouldMatch`` value is not specified, so it 
        defaults to ``0``. As a result, the ``should`` clause fails 
        and still returns a document.

   .. tab:: $match Replacement Example 
      :tabid: match

      You can replace the :pipeline:`$match` with :query:`$in` in your 
      queries against data on your |service| cluster with the 
      ``filter`` clause. The following query demonstrates how to use 
      ``filter`` in the :pipeline:`$search` stage to specify the search 
      terms that must match. The query also uses ``should`` to specify 
      preference for documents containing the term ``varieties``. The 
      query includes the ``$project`` pipeline stage to do the 
      following:
      
      - Exclude all fields except ``_id`` and ``description``. 
      - Add a ``score`` field, which displays the document's relevance 
        score.

      .. code-block:: json 

         db.fruit.aggregate([
           {
             "$search": {
               "compound": {
                 "filter": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": ["apples", "bananas"],
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }],
                 "should": [{
                   "text": {
                     "query": "varieties",
                     "path": "description"
                   }
                 }]
               }
             }
           },
           {
             "$project": {
               "description": 1,
               "score": { "$meta": "searchScore" }
             }
           }
         ])

      The query returns the following documents:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         [
           {
             _id: 1,
             description: 'Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp. The most popular varieties are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith.',
             score: 0.36074575781822205
           },
           {
             _id: 2,
             description: 'Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six.',
             score: 0
           }
         ]

      The documents in the result fulfill all the requirements for 
      inclusion:

      - Both documents contain the term ``apples`` or ``bananas`` that 
        was specified in the ``filter`` clause of the query.
      - Document with ``_id: 1`` scores higher than document with 
        ``_id: 2`` because it contains the term ``varieties`` specified 
        in the ``should`` clause of the query.

Nested Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses nested ``compound`` clauses to construct a 
query. For this example, the ``fruit`` collection has an index on the 
``type``, ``category``, and ``in_stock`` fields, whose text fields use the 
:ref:`default <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer. The query requires 
documents to only satisfy one of the following  ``should`` clauses: 

- Contain the word ``apple`` in the ``type`` field.
- Contain the term ``organic`` in the ``category`` field and have the 
  value ``true`` in the ``in_stock`` field.
