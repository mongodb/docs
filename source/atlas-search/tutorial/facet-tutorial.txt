This tutorial describes how to create an index with a :ref:`facet 
definition <fts-facet-definition>` on string, date, and numeric fields 
in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. It shows how to run an |fts| 
query against those fields for results grouped by values for the string 
field and by ranges for the date and numeric fields, including the 
count for each of those groups. It takes you through the following 
steps: 

1. Set up an |fts| index with facet definition on the ``genres``, 
   ``released``, and ``year`` fields in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` 
   collection.
#. Run |fts| query against the ``released`` field in the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for results grouped by values for 
   the ``genres`` field and by ranges for the ``year`` field.

Prerequisites 
-------------

To complete these tutorials, in addition to the prerequisites listed in
the :ref:`fts-tutorials` page, you must have an |service| cluster 
running one of the following versions:

- MongoDB 4.4.11 or later
- MongoDB 5.0.4 or later
- MongoDB 6.0

Create the |fts| Index for Facet 
--------------------------------

In this section, you will create an |fts| index on the ``genres``, 
``year``, and ``released`` fields in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` 
collection.

Search the Collection

You can use :ref:`fts-facet-ref` in queries that use the 
:pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stages. In this 
section, connect to your |service| cluster and the run the sample query 
against the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection using the 
:pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage. MongoDB recommends using the 
:pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage to retrieve metadata results only.

The results show metadata results for two types of facet search. The 
``genresFacet`` document shows the number of movies in each genre and 
the ``yearFacet`` document shows a count of the number of movies 
within the boundaries: 

- ``1910``, inclusive lower bound the ``1910`` bucket
- ``1920``, exclusive upper bound for the ``1910`` bucket and inclusive 
  lower bound for the ``1920`` bucket
- ``1930``, exclusive upper bound for the ``1920`` bucket and inclusive 
  lower bound for the ``1930`` bucket

Continue Learning 
-----------------

To learn more about using facets in |fts|, take `Unit 9 of the Intro To
MongoDB Course on MongoDB University 
<https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/mongodb-atlas-search>`__. The 1.5
hour unit includes an overview of |fts| and lessons on creating |fts|
indexes, running :pipeline:`$search` queries using compound operators,
and grouping results using ``facet``.
