SQL to Aggregation Framework
----------------------------

With its :doc:`aggregation framework </applications/aggregation>`,
MongoDB provides analogous functionality to common SQL aggregation
functions.

The following table presents a quick reference of the various SQL
aggregation terms, functions, and concepts and the corresponding
MongoDB :ref:`aggregation operators
<aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The following table presents a quick reference of SQL aggregation
statements and the corresponding MongoDB statements. The examples in
the table assume the following conditions:

- The SQL examples assume *two* tables, ``orders`` and
  ``order_lineitem`` that join by the ``order_lineitem.order_id`` and
  the ``orders.id`` columns.

- The MongoDB examples assume *one* collection ``orders`` that contain
  documents of the following prototype:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       cust_id: "abc123",
       ord_date: ISODate("2012-11-02T17:04:11.102Z"),
       status: 'A',
       price: 50,
       items: [ { sku: "xxx", qty: 25, price: 1 },
                { sku: "yyy", qty: 25, price: 1 } ]
     }

- In the MongoDB statements, the fields of the :term:`documents
  <document>` in the collection ``orders`` are prefixed with ``$`` when
  they appear as operands to the aggregation operators.
