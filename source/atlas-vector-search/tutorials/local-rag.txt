This tutorial demonstrates how to implement
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
locally, without the need for |api| keys or credits. 
To learn more about |rag|, see :ref:`ai-key-concepts`. 

Specifically, you perform the following actions:

#. Create a local |service| {+deployment+} or deploy a {+cluster+} on the cloud.
#. Set up the environment.
#. Use a local embedding model to generate vector embeddings.
#. Create an {+avs+} index on your data.
#. Use a local |llm| to answer questions on your data.

Background
----------

To complete this tutorial, you can either create a local |service| 
{+deployment+} by using the :ref:`{+atlas-cli+} 
<atlas-programmatic-access-cli-overview>` or :ref:`deploy a 
{+cluster+} <create-new-cluster>` on the cloud. The {+atlas-cli+} 
is the command-line interface for |service-fullname|, and you can use 
the {+atlas-cli+} to interact with |service| from the terminal for 
various tasks, including creating local |service| {+deployments+}. 
To learn more, see 
:atlascli:`Manage Local and Cloud Deployments from the Atlas CLI </atlas-cli-local-cloud>`.

.. note::
   
   Local |service| {+deployments+} are intended for testing only. 
   For production environments, :ref:`deploy a {+cluster+} <create-new-cluster>`.

Create a Local {+Deployment+} or |service| {+Cluster+}
------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial requires a local or cloud |service| {+deployment+} loaded with
the :ref:`sample AirBnB listings <sample-airbnb>` dataset to use as a vector
database.

If you have an existing |service| {+cluster+} running MongoDB version 6.0.11,
7.0.2, or later with the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` sample data
loaded, you can skip this step.

You can create a local |service| {+deployment+} using the {+atlas-cli+} or
deploy a {+cluster+} on the cloud.

   .. tab:: Cloud {+Deployment+}

      You can create and deploy a new {+cluster+} using the {+atlas-cli+} or
      {+atlas-ui+}. Ensure that you preload the new {+cluster+} with the
      :ref:`sample data <sample-data>`.

Generate Embeddings with a Local Model
--------------------------------------

In this section, you load an embedding model locally and 
generate vector embeddings by using data from the 
:ref:`sample_airbnb <sample-airbnb>` database, 
which contains a single collection called ``listingsAndReviews``.

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: csharp

      .. include:: /includes/avs-local-rag-generate-embeddings-with-local-model-csharp.rst

      .. include:: /includes/avs-local-rag-generate-embeddings-python.rst

.. tabs::
   :hidden: true

   .. tab:: Local {+Deployment+}
      :tabid: local

      This code might take several minutes to run. After it's finished, you can
      view your vector embeddings by connecting to your local {+deployment+}
      from {+mongosh+} or your application using your {+deployment+}\'s
      connection string. Then you can run :manual:`read operations
      </crud/#read-operations>` on the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews``
      collection.
      
   .. tab:: Cloud {+Deployment+}
      :tabid: cloud

      .. include:: /includes/fact-view-embeddings-atlas-ui-airbnb.rst

.. tip::

   You can convert the embeddings in the sample data to |bson| vectors for
   efficient storage and ingestion of vectors in |service|. To learn
   more, see :ref:`how to convert native embeddings to BSON vectors
   <avs-bindata-vector-subtype>`. 

Create the {+avs+} Index
------------------------------------

To enable vector search on the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` 
collection, create an {+avs+} index.

This tutorial walks you through how to create an {+avs+}
index programmatically with a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>` or
using the {+atlas-cli+}. For information on other ways to create an
{+avs+} index, see :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`.

.. note::

   To create an {+avs+} index, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` or higher access to the |service| project.
