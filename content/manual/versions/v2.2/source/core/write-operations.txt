All operations that create or modify data in the MongoDB instance are
write operations. MongoDB represents data as :term:`BSON documents
<document>` stored in :term:`collections <collection>`. Write
operations target one collection and are atomic on the level of a
single document: no single write operation can atomically affect more
than one document or more than one collection.

This document introduces the write operators available in MongoDB as
well as presents strategies to increase the efficiency of writes in
applications.

Write Concern
-------------

.. note:: The :doc:`driver write concern </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   change created a new connection class in all of the MongoDB
   drivers, called ``MongoClient`` with a different default write
   concern. See the :doc:`release notes </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   for this change, and the release notes for the driver you're using
   for more information about your driver's release.

.. _write-concern-considerations:

Operational Considerations and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients issue write operations with some level of :term:`write
concern`, which describes the level of concern or
guarantee the server will provide in its response to a write operation.
Consider the following levels of conceptual write concern:

.. _write-concern-errors-ignored:

- *errors ignored*: Write operations are not acknowledged by MongoDB, and may
  not succeed in the case of connection errors that the client is not yet aware of, or
  if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` produces an exception (e.g. a duplicate key
  exception for :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>`.) While this
  operation is efficient because it does not require the database to
  respond to every write operation, it also incurs a significant risk
  with regards to the persistence and durability of the data.

  .. warning::

     Do not use this option in normal operation.

.. _write-concern-unacknowledged:

- *unacknowledged*: MongoDB does not acknowledge the receipt of write
  operation as with a write concern level of *ignore*; however, the
  driver will receive and handle network errors, as possible given
  system networking configuration.

  Before the releases outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`,
  this was the default write concern.

.. _write-concern-acknowledged:

- receipt *acknowledged*: The :binary:`~bin.mongod` will confirm the
  receipt of the write operation, allowing the client to catch
  network, duplicate key, and other exceptions. After the releases
  outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`, this is the default
  write concern. [#default-write-concern]_

.. _write-concern-replica-journaled:

- *journaled*: The :binary:`~bin.mongod` will confirm the write
  operation only after it has written the operation to the
  :term:`journal`. This confirms that the write operation can survive a
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` shutdown and ensures that the write operation is
  durable.

  While receipt *acknowledged* without *journaled* provides the
  fundamental basis for write concern, there is a window between
  journal commits where the write operation is not fully durable. See
  :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more information on this
  window. Require *journaled* as part of the write concern to provide
  this durability guarantee.

.. _write-concern-replica-acknowledged:

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` present an additional layer of
consideration for write concern. Basic write concern levels affect the
write operation on only one :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. The ``w``
argument to :dbcommand:`getLastError` provides a *replica
acknowledged* level of write concern. With *replica acknowledged* you
can guarantee that the write operation has propagated to the members
of a replica set. See the :ref:`Write Concern for Replica Sets
<replica-set-write-concern>` document for more information.

.. note::

   Requiring *journaled* write concern in a replica set only requires
   a journal commit of the write operation to the :term:`primary` of the
   set regardless of the level of *replica acknowledged* write
   concern.

.. [#default-write-concern] The default write concern is to call
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` with no arguments. For replica sets, you
   can define the default write concern settings in the
   :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults`
   If :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults` does
   not define a default write concern setting,
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` defaults to basic receipt acknowledgment.

.. _write-concern-operation:
.. _write-concern-internals:

Internal Operation of Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide write concern, :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` issue
the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command after a write operation and
receive a document with information about the last operation. This
document's ``err`` field contains either:

- ``null``, which indicates the write operations have completed
  successfully, or

- a description of the last error encountered.

The definition of a "successful write" depends on the arguments
specified to :dbcommand:`getLastError`, or in replica sets, the
configuration of
:data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults`.
When deciding the level of write
concern for your application, become familiar with the
:ref:`write-concern-considerations`.

The :dbcommand:`getLastError` command has the following options to configure write
concern requirements:

- ``j`` or "journal" option

  This option confirms that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has written
  the data to the on-disk journal and ensures data is not lost if the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance shuts down unexpectedly. Set to ``true`` to
  enable, as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, j: "true" } )

  If you set :data:`journal` to true, and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` does
  not have journaling enabled, as with :setting:`nojournal`, then
  :dbcommand:`getLastError` will provide basic receipt acknowledgment,
  and will include a ``jnote`` field in its return document.

- ``w`` option

  This option provides the ability to disable write concern entirely *as
  well as* specifies the write concern operations for :term:`replica sets
  <replica set>`. See :ref:`write-concern-considerations` for an
  introduction to the fundamental concepts of write concern. By
  default, the ``w`` option is set to ``1``, which provides basic
  receipt acknowledgment on a single :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance or on the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

  The ``w`` option takes the following values:

  - ``-1``:

    Disables all acknowledgment of write operations, and suppresses
    all including network and socket errors.

  - ``0``:

    Disables basic acknowledgment of write operations, but returns
    information about socket excepts and networking errors to the
    application.

    .. note::

       If you disable basic write operation acknowledgment but require
       journal commit acknowledgment, the journal commit prevails, and
       the driver will require that :binary:`~bin.mongod`  will
       acknowledge the replica set.

  - ``1``:

    Provides acknowledgment of write operations on a standalone
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` or the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

  - *A number greater than 1*:

    Guarantees that write operations have propagated successfully to
    the specified number of replica set members including the primary.
    If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the number of set
    members that hold data, MongoDB waits for the non-existent members
    to become available, which means MongoDB blocks indefinitely.

  - ``majority``:

    Confirms that write operations have propagated to the majority of
    configured replica set: nodes must acknowledge the write operation
    before it succeeds. This ensures that write operation will *never*
    be subject to a rollback in the course of normal operation, and
    furthermore allows you to prevent hard coding assumptions about the
    size of your replica set into your application.

  - *A tag set*:

    By specifying a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`
    you can have fine-grained control over which replica
    set members must acknowledge a write operation to satisfy the required
    level of write concern.

:dbcommand:`getLastError` also supports a ``wtimeout`` setting which
allows clients to specify a timeout for the write concern: if you
don't specify ``wtimeout`` and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` cannot fulfill
the write concern the :dbcommand:`getLastError` will block,
potentially forever.

For more information on write concern and replica sets, see :ref:`Write
Concern for Replica Sets <replica-set-write-concern>` for more information..

In sharded clusters, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances will pass write
concern on to the shard :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

.. _write-operations-bulk-insert:

Bulk Inserts
------------

In some situations you may need to insert or ingest a large amount of
data into a MongoDB database. These *bulk inserts* have some
special considerations that are different from other write
operations.

The :method:`insert() <db.collection.insert()>` method, when passed an
array of documents, will perform a bulk insert, and inserts each
document atomically. :doc:`Drivers </applications/drivers>`
provide their own interface for this kind of operation.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
   :method:`insert() <db.collection.insert()>` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
   shell gained support for bulk inserts in version 2.2.

Bulk insert can significantly increase performance by amortizing
:ref:`write concern <write-operations-write-concern>` costs. In the
drivers, you can configure write concern for batches rather than on a
per-document level.

Drivers also have a ``ContinueOnError`` option in their insert
operation, so that the bulk operation will continue to insert
remaining documents in a batch even if an insert fails.

.. note::

   .. versionadded::  2.0
      Support for ``ContinueOnError`` depends on version 2.0 of the
      core :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` components.

If the bulk insert process generates more than one error in a batch
job, the client will only receive the most recent error. All bulk
operations to a :term:`sharded collection <sharded cluster>` run with
``ContinueOnError``, which applications cannot disable. See
:ref:`sharding-bulk-inserts` section for more information on
consideration for bulk inserts in sharded clusters.

For more information see your :doc:`driver documentation
</applications/drivers>` for details on performing bulk inserts in
your application. Also consider the following resources:
:ref:`write-operations-sharded-clusters`,
:ref:`sharding-bulk-inserts`, and
:doc:`/administration/import-export`.

.. _write-operations-indexing:

Indexing
--------

After every insert, update, or delete operation, MongoDB must update
*every* index associated with the collection in addition to the data
itself. Therefore, every index on a collection adds some amount of
overhead for the performance of write operations. [#exceptions]_

In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read
operations* are worth the insertion penalty; however, when optimizing
write performance, be careful when creating new indexes and always
evaluate the indexes on the collection and ensure that your queries are
actually using these indexes.

For more information on indexes in MongoDB consider :doc:`/indexes`
and :doc:`/applications/indexes`.

.. [#exceptions] The overhead for :ref:`sparse indexes
   <index-type-sparse>` inserts and updates to un-indexed fields
   is less than for non-sparse indexes. Also for non-sparse indexes,
   updates that don't change the record size have less indexing
   overhead.

.. _write-operations-isolation:

Isolation
---------

When a single write operation modifies multiple documents, the
operation as a whole is not atomic, and other operations may
interleave. The modification of a single document, or record, is always
atomic, even if the write operation modifies multiple sub-document
*within* the single record.

No other operations are atomic; however, you can attempt to isolate a
write operation that affects multiple documents using the
:doc:`isolation operator </reference/operator/update/isolated>`.

To isolate a sequence of write operations from other read and write
operations, see :doc:`/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits`.

Updates
-------

Each document in a MongoDB collection has allocated *record* space
which includes the entire document *and* a small amount of
padding. This padding makes it possible for update operations to
increase the size of a document slightly without causing the document
to outgrow the allocated record size.

Documents in MongoDB can grow up to the full maximum :limit:`BSON
document size <BSON Document Size>`. However, when documents outgrow
their allocated record size MongoDB must allocate a new record and
move the document to the new record. Update operations that do not
cause a document to grow, (i.e. *in-place* updates,) are significantly
more efficient than those updates that cause document growth. Use
:doc:`data models </core/data-modeling>` that minimize the need for
document growth when possible.

For complete examples of update operations, see
:doc:`/applications/update`.

.. _write-operations-padding-factor:

Padding Factor
--------------

If an update operation does not cause the document to increase in
size, MongoDB can apply the update in-place. Some updates
change the size of the document, for example using the
:update:`$push` operator to append a sub-document to an array can
cause the top level document to grow beyond its allocated space.

When documents grow, MongoDB relocates the document on disk with
enough contiguous space to hold the document. These relocations
take longer than in-place updates, particularly if the collection has
indexes that MongoDB must update all index entries. If
collection has many indexes, the move will impact write throughput.

To minimize document movements, MongoDB employs padding. MongoDB
adaptively learns if documents in a collection tend to grow, and if
they do, adds a :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` so that the documents have room
to grow on subsequent writes. The :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` indicates the
padding for new inserts and moves.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
   You can use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command
   with the :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag so that MongoDB
   allocates document space in sizes that are powers of 2. This helps
   ensure that MongoDB can efficiently reuse the space freed as a
   result of deletions or document relocations. As with all padding,
   using document space allocations with power of 2 sizes minimizes,
   but does not eliminate, document movements.

To check the current :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` on a collection, you can
run the :method:`db.collection.stats()` operation in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.myCollection.stats()

Since MongoDB writes each document at a different point in time, the
padding for each document will not be the same. You can calculate the
padding size by subtracting 1 from the :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor`, for
example:

.. code-block:: none

   padding size = (paddingFactor - 1) * <document size>.

For example, a :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` of ``1.0`` specifies no padding
whereas a paddingFactor of ``1.5`` specifies a padding size of ``0.5`` or 50
percent (50%) of the document size.

Because the :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` is relative to the size of each
document, you cannot calculate the exact amount of padding for a
collection based on the average document size and padding factor.

If an update operation causes the document to *decrease* in size, for
instance if you perform an :update:`$unset` or a :update:`$pop`
update, the document remains in place and effectively has more
padding. If the document remains this size, the space is not reclaimed
until you perform a :dbcommand:`compact` or a
:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` operation.

.. note::

   The following operations remove padding:

   - :dbcommand:`compact`,
   - :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and
   - initial replica sync operations.

   However, with the :dbcommand:`compact` command, you can run the
   command with a ``paddingFactor`` or a ``paddingBytes`` parameter.

   Padding is also removed if you use :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` from a
   collection. If you use :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` into a new
   collection, :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` will not add padding.  If you
   use :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` with an existing collection with
   padding, :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` will not affect the existing
   padding.

   When a database operation removes padding, subsequent update that
   require changes in record sizes will have reduced throughput until
   the collection's padding factor grows. Padding does not affect
   in-place, and after :dbcommand:`compact`,
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and replica set initial sync
   the collection will require less storage.

.. COMMENT -- not sure if we really need this manual padding info or if
   it belongs here, but ...

Architecture
------------

.. _write-operations-replica-sets:

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, all write operations go to the
set's :term:`primary`, which applies the write operation then records
the operations on the primary's operation log or :term:`oplog`. The
oplog is a reproducible sequence of operations to the data
set. :term:`Secondary` members of the set are continuously replicating the
oplog and applying the operations to themselves in an asynchronous
process.

Large volumes of write operations, particularly bulk operations, may
create situations where the secondary members have difficulty applying
the replicating operations from the primary at a sufficient rate: this
can cause the secondary's state to fall behind that of the primary. Secondaries
that are significantly behind the primary present problems for normal
operation of the replica set, particularly :ref:`failover
<replica-set-failover-administration>` in the form of :ref:`rollbacks
<replica-set-rollback>` as well as general :ref:`read consistency
<replica-set-consistency>`.

To help avoid this issue, you can customize the :ref:`write concern
<write-operations-write-concern>` to return confirmation of the write
operation to another member [#write-concern-throttling]_ of the replica
set every 100 or 1,000 operations. This provides an opportunity for
secondaries to catch up with the primary. Write concern can slow the
overall progress of write operations but ensure that the secondaries
can maintain a largely current state with respect to the primary.

For more information on replica sets and write operations, see
:ref:`replica-set-write-concern`, :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`,
:ref:`replica-set-oplog`, and :ref:`replica-set-procedure-change-oplog-size`.

.. [#write-concern-throttling] Calling :dbcommand:`getLastError`
   intermittently with a ``w`` value of ``2`` or ``majority`` will
   slow the throughput of write traffic; however, this practice will
   allow the secondaries to remain current with the state of the
   primary.

.. _write-operations-sharded-clusters:

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a :term:`sharded cluster`, MongoDB directs a given write operation to
a :term:`shard` and then performs the write on a particular
:term:`chunk` on that shard. Shards and chunks are range-based.
:term:`Shard keys <shard key>` affect how MongoDB distributes documents
among shards. Choosing the correct shard key can have a great impact on
the performance, capability, and functioning of your database and
cluster.

For more information, see :doc:`/administration/sharded-clusters` and
:ref:`write-operations-bulk-insert`.
