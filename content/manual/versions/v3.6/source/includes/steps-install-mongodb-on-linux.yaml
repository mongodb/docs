stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: ensure-binaries-in-path

  The MongoDB binaries are in the ``bin/`` directory of the tarball.
  You can either:

  - Copy the binaries into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
    variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
    ``/path/to/the/mongodb-directory/`` with your installation
    directory as appropriate)

    .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp /path/to/the/mongodb-directory/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

  - Create symbolic links to the binaries from a directory listed in
    your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
    ``/path/to/the/mongodb-directory/`` with your installation
    directory as appropriate):

    .. code-block:: sh

       sudo ln -s  /path/to/the/mongodb-directory/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
