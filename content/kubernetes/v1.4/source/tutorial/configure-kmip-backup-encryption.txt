Configure KMIP Backup Encryption for Ops Manager
================================================

.. meta::
   :description: Configure KMIP backup encryption for Ops Manager using Kubernetes Operator, including setting up certificates and client configurations.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| can encrypt backup jobs. You can use the |k8s-op-short| to 
configure |kmip| backup encryption for |mms|. To learn more, see 
:opsmgr:`Encrypted Backup Snapshots </tutorial/encrypt-snapshots/>`.

.. _kmip-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

For deployments where the same |k8s-op-short| instance is not managing both the
:ref:`MongoDBOpsManager <k8s-om-specification>` and 
:ref:`MongoDB <k8s-specification>` custom resources, 
you must manually configure |kmip| 
backup encryption client settings in the 
:ref:`MongoDBOpsManager <k8s-om-specification>` custom resource.
This requirement involves including client certificates for each MongoDB database, 
which you can achieve by overriding the |onprem| Pod's StatefulSet to mount 
the certificates. To learn more, see :ref:`kmip-manual-procedure`.
