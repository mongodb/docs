Underprovisioned EBS Volume Causes Long IOPS Wait Times
-------------------------------------------------------

If you used `kops <https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/>`__ to provision a |k8s| cluster in |aws| and
are experiencing poor performance and high |iops| wait times, your Elastic Block Store
(EBS) volume may be underprovisioned. 

To improve performance, increase the storage-to-IOPS ratio for your EBS volume. For
example, if your database is 500 GB, increase IOPS to 1500, a 3:1 ratio per GB. To learn 
more about increasing IOPS, see the
:aws:`AWS documentation </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/requesting-ebs-volume-modifications.html>`.

.. _hardcoded_configmap_multi-clusters:

ConfigMap Name ``mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list`` is Hard-Coded
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you run the |kubectl-mongodb|, such as during the
:ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster quick start procedure <multi-cluster-quick-start-ref>`,
the plugin creates a default ConfigMap named ``mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list``.
This ConfigMap contains all the members of the |multi-cluster|. You can't change
the ConfigMap's name. To learn more about plugin's flags and actions,
see :ref:`kubectl-plugin-ref`.

.. _disable_auth_pods_never_reconcile:

``mongos`` Instances Fail to Reach Ready State After Disabling Authentication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   This issue applies only to :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`
   that meet the following criteria: 

   - Deployed using the |k8s-op-short| 1.13.0
   - Use X.509 authentication 
   - Use :k8sdocs:`kubernetes.io/tls
     </concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets>` secrets for |tls|
     certificates for the MongoDB Agent

If you disable authentication by setting 
``spec.security.auth.enabled`` to  ``false``, the |mongos| Pods 
never reach a ``ready`` state.

As a workaround, delete each |mongos| Pod in your deployment. 

Run the following command to list all of your Pods:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl get pods

For each Pod with a name that contains ``mongos``, delete it with the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete pod <podname>

When you delete a Pod, Kubernetes recreates it. Each Pod that Kubernetes
recreates receives the updated configuration and can reach a ``READY`` 
state. To confirm that all of your |mongos| Pods are ``READY``, run the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl get pods -n <metadata.namespace>

A response like the following indicates that all of your |mongos| Pods
are ``READY``:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

.. _k8s-private-cluster-on-gke:

Update Google Firewall Rules to Fix WebHook Issues
--------------------------------------------------

When you deploy |k8s-op-short| to |gke| private clusters, the
|k8s-mdbrscs| or MongoDBOpsManager resource creation could time out.
The following message might appear in the logs: ``Error setting state
to reconciling: Timeout: request did not complete within requested
timeout 30s``.

Google configures its firewalls to restrict access to your |k8s|
|k8s-pods|. To use the webhook service,
:gcp:`add a new firewall rule </kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules>`
to grant |gke| control plane access to your webhook service.

The |k8s-op-short| webhook service runs on port 443.

Configure Persistent Storage Correctly
--------------------------------------

If there are no
:k8sdocs:`persistent volumes </concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/>`
available when you create a resource, the resulting |k8s-pod| stays in
transient state and the Operator fails  (after 20 retries) with the
following error:

.. code-block:: sh

   Failed to update Ops Manager automation config: Some agents failed to register

To prevent this error, either:

- Provide |k8s-pvs| or
- Set ``persistent : false`` for the resource

For testing only, you may also set ``persistent : false``. This
*must not be used in production*, as data is not preserved between
restarts.

.. _remove-rsrcs-before-removing-k8s:

Remove Resources before Removing |k8s|
--------------------------------------

Sometimes |onprem| can diverge from |k8s|. This mostly occurs when
|k8s| resources are removed manually. |onprem| can keep displaying an
Automation Agent which has been shut down.

If you want to remove deployments of MongoDB on |k8s|, use the
resource specification to delete resources first so no dead Automation
Agents remain.

To troubleshoot any issues that might occur, see:

- :ref:`remove-k8s-resource`
- :ref:`k8s-disable-feature-controls`
- :ref:`k8s-delete-om`


Create Separate Namespaces for |k8s-op-short| and MongoDB Resources
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The best strategy is to create |k8s-op-short| and its resources in
different namespaces so that the following operations would work
correctly:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete pods --all

or

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete namespace mongodb

If the |k8s-op-short| and resources sit in the same ``mongodb``
|k8s-ns|, then operator would also be removed in the same operation.
This would mean that it could not clean the configurations, which
would have to be done in the |application|.

.. _https-enablement-issues:

HTTPS Enabled After Deployment
------------------------------

We recommend that you enable |https| *before* deploying your |onprem| resources.
However, if you enable |https| after deployment,
your managed resources can no longer communicate with |onprem| and 
the |k8s-op-short| reports your resources' status as ``Failed``.

To resolve this issue, you must delete your |k8s-pods| by
running the following command for each Pod:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete pod <replicaset-pod-name>
      
After deletion, |k8s| automatically restarts the deleted Pods. 
During this period, the resource is unreachable and incurs 
downtime.

.. _unable-to-upgrade-appdb-agent-in-om:

Unable to Update the {+mdbagent+} on Application Database Pods
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can't use |onprem| to upgrade the {+mdbagent+}\s that run on the
Application Database Pods. The {+mdbagent+} version that runs on these
Pods is embedded in the Application Database Docker image.

You can use the |k8s-op-short| to upgrade the {+mdbagent+} version on
Application Database Pods as MongoDB publishes new images.

   - :ref:`registry-appdb-version`

.. _pull_op_images_ibm:

Unable to Pull Enterprise Kubernetes Operator Images from IBM Cloud Paks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you pull the |k8s-op-short| images from a container registry hosted in 
`IBM Cloud Paks <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/paks>`__, the IBM Cloud Paks
changes the names of the images by adding a digest SHA to the official image 
names. This action results in error messages from the |k8s-op-short| similar 
to the following:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Failed to apply default image tag "cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/ibm-cpd-mongodb-agent@
   sha256:10.14.24.6505-1": couldn't parse image reference "cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/
   ibm-cpd-mongodb-agent@sha256:10.14.24.6505-1": invalid reference format

As a workaround, update the Ops Manager Application Database resource definition 
in ``spec.applicationDatabase.podSpec.``:setting:`~spec.podSpec.podTemplate` to 
specify the new names for the |k8s-op-short| images that contain the digest SHAs, 
similar to the following example.

.. code-block:: sh

   applicationDatabase:
     # The version specified must match the one in the image provided in the `mongod` field
     version: 4.4.11-ubi8
     members: 3
     podSpec:
       podTemplate:
         spec:
           containers:
             - name: mongodb-agent
               image: 'cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/ibm-cpd-mongodb-agent@sha256:689df23cc35a435f5147d9cd8a697474f8451ad67a1e8a8c803d95f12fea0b59'

Machine Memory vs. Container Memory
-----------------------------------

The Automation Agent in |cloud-short| and |onprem| reports
host memory (RAM) usage instead of the |k8s| container memory usage.
