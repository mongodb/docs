Prerequisites
-------------

To create a Full Text Search index, you must have an Atlas cluster with:

- ``M30`` or larger size
- MongoDB version ``4.2`` or higher
- At least one collection

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-fts-index.rst

.. _node-status-ref:

Node Status
-----------

The |fts| tab in the right-side panel of the |service| UI displays
information about |fts| indexes for the selected namespace. The
:guilabel:`Status` column shows the current state of the index
on all the nodes of the cluster.

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Active
     - The index is ready to use.

   * - Build in Progress
     - The index is building or re-building after an edit. If one node
       finishes building the index before the other cluster nodes, a
       message may appear that the nodes are in different states.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.
