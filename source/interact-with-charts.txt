Click to Emphasize Series
-------------------------

Chart viewers can interact with a chart to highlight one or more series 
in a multi-series chart. This behavior applies to any chart type that 
displays a discrete color legend, except for geospatial charts. The 
following chart types support emphasizing specific series: 

- :ref:`Grouped and Stacked Bar/Column charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line/Area charts <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Scatter charts <scatter-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Donut charts <donut-chart-ref>`


Emphasize a Single Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you click a label in the chart legend at the top right, 
|charts-short| emphasizes the selected data series by reducing the 
opacity of all the other data series.

Emphasize Multiple Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To emphasize multiple data series at once, **shift-click** as many 
labels in the legend as you would like. Charts adjusts the opacity of
the selected data series from de-emphasized to emphasized.

Emphasize all Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore the opacity of all data series to the default emphasized 
state, click the chart background.

Zoom and Pan a Scatter Chart
----------------------------

Chart viewers can zoom and pan a non-geospatial :ref:`scatter chart 
<scatter-chart-ref>`. 

Zoom
~~~~

To zoom in or out of the chart, scroll up or down. |charts-short| 
automatically adjusts the axis bounds to change the viewport, while 
keeping the plotted points the same size.

The resulting view after zooming and panning is only visible to you and 
does not persist page reloads. To revert back to the original axis 
bounds, reload the chart page. 

Pan
~~~

To pan the chart, click and drag over the chart surface. 

View the Percentage of the Whole
--------------------------------

Chart viewers can hover on each data point to view the value as a 
percentage of the whole. The part to whole relationship appears in the 
tooltip for the data point. This behavior applies to any chart type 
that displays a part of the whole relationship, specifically:

- :ref:`100% Stacked Bar Charts <one-hundred-stacked-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Column Charts <stacked-ref-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Area Charts <one-hundred-stacked-area>`
- :ref:`Donut Charts <donut-chart-ref>`

For stacked charts, the whole value is the total value of the 
current category. For donut charts, the whole value is the total
value of the entire chart.

Show Data for an Item
---------------------
Chart viewers with Author or Owner :ref:`data source permissions 
<permission-model>` can view the original data that contributed to a 
chart element.

Chart viewers can show data for the following chart elements:

- Bar or mark on a chart plot area
- Chart legend entry
- Category axis label
- Table row
- Choropleth shape

.. note::

   Some charts (:ref:`geospatial-scatter-type`, :ref:`gauge-chart-ref`, and :ref:`top-item-ref`) do not support this functionality.

To view the original data that contributed to a chart element, 
right-click on the chart element and select 
:guilabel:`Show data for this item` from the context menu. You can 
switch between the :guilabel:`Table` view and :guilabel:`JSON` view.

Copy and Save a Chart as an Image
---------------------------------

Chart viewers can copy and save a chart as an image. The image file 
includes the chart contents, including the title of the chart.

Copy
~~~~

To copy a chart to your clipboard as an image, right-click on the chart 
and select :guilabel:`Copy chart as image` from the context menu. You 
can copy any chart type except data tables.

.. note:: 

   The copy feature is not available on Firefox. 

Save 
~~~~

To save a chart as a |png| file, right-click on the chart and select 
:guilabel:`Save chart as image` from the context menu.
