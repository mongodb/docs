You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>` or
:term:`replica set` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.

            All Changes are Clusterwide
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Changes cannot be made to individual members of a replica
            set or sharded cluster, only to the whole set or cluster.

            Kubernetes Operator Overrides Some Ops Manager Settings
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Some settings that you configure using |k8s-op-short|
            cannot be overridden in the |application|. If you change
            one of these settings, the |k8s-op-short| reverts the
            settings each time you apply the resource specification.
            Settings that the |k8s-op-short| does not manage are
            accepted.

            The following list of settings are exclusive to |k8s|. This
            list may change at a later date.

            These settings can be found on the :doc:`Automation
            Configuration </reference/api/automation-config>` page.

            - ``processes.args2_6.net.port``
            - ``processes.args2_6.replication.replSetName``
            - ``processes.args2_6.storage.dbPath``
            - ``processes.args2_6.systemLog.path``
            - ``processes.authSchemaVersion``
            - ``processes.cluster`` (mongos processes)
            - ``processes.featureCompatibilityVersion``
            - ``processes.hostname``
            - ``processes.name``
            - ``processes.version``
            - ``replicaSets._id``
            - ``replicaSets.members._id``
            - ``replicaSets.members.host``
            - ``replicaSets.members``
            - ``replicaSets.version``
            - ``sharding.clusterRole`` (config server)
            - ``sharding.configServerReplica``
            - ``sharding.name``
            - ``sharding.shards._id``
            - ``sharding.shards.rs``

            .. example::

               - |k8s-op-short| creates a replica set of 3 members.
               - You changed
                 :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB`
                 to ``40``.
               - You then scale the replica set to 5 members.
               - The :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB` on the new members should be ``40``.

            Changes not available in Kubernetes
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            If a setting is not available for a MongoDB Kubernetes
            resource, then the change must be made in the
            |application|.

            To update a MongoDB Kubernetes object, you need
            to meet the prerequisites for, and complete the procedures
            on, the
            :k8s:`Install Kubernetes Operator </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`

            1. Edit the |k8s| resource specification file.

            2. Modify or add any settings you need added or changed.

            3. Save your specification file.

            4. Invoke the following |k8s| command to update your resource.

               .. code-block:: sh

                  kubectl apply -f <standalone-conf>.yaml
