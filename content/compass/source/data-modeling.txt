The data modeling experience in |compass-short| allows you to create an 
|erd| that visualizes collections, their fields, data 
types, and their relationships within a single database. With this, you can 
better understand how your data is structured and connected, making it easier to 
develop applications, collaborate with team members, and maintain evolving data 
models. 

Use Cases 
---------

The data modeling experience in |compass-short| can be useful in the following 
scenarios: 

- **Data visualization**: Generate an |erd| of your current data model. 
  Visualizing your data model can help you identify impacts of potential schema 
  changes across related collections.

- **Data model planning**: Track and plan changes to your data structure as your 
  application grows. Visualizing your data model can help you identify potential 
  impacts of schema changes across related collections. 

- **Cross-team collaboration**: Share visual representations of your data model 
  with data engineers, product managers, and other stakeholders to ensure 
  everyone understands the current state of your database structure. You can 
  share your data model as an image, JSON file, or ``.mdm`` file that can be 
  opened directly in |compass-short|.

- **Application development**: Identify inconsistencies, missing relationships, 
  or optimization opportunities in your data model during the development 
  process.

- **Team member onboarding**: Quickly understand existing data models when 
  onboarding onto a new project or working with collections created by other 
  teams.

Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add comments to your diagram's collections, fields, and relationships 
to document definitions or data modeling decision. 

Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define relationships between fields in different collections in your 
|erd|. When you 
:ref:`create an entity-relationship diagram <compass-create-data-model-diagram>`, 
you can opt for |compass-short| to automatically infer relationships. You can 
also :ref:`manually add relationships <compass-data-modeling-relationships>`.

Sharing Diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can :ref:`export <compass-data-modeling-export>` your |compass-short| 
|erd|. By sharing your diagram, you can collaborate with 
various teams, receive feedback, and align on final schema design decisions.

You can export your diagram as a: 

- ``.mdm`` :guilabel:`Diagram File`.
- :guilabel:`PNG` image.
- :guilabel:`JSON` file. 

You can also :ref:`import <compass-data-modeling-import>` |compass-short| an
|erd| that was exported as a ``.mdm`` file. By importing an
|erd|, you can view or edit a diagram shared by a collaborator.
