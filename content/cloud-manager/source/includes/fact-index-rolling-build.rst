   Rolling index builds succeed only when they meet certain conditions. 
   To ensure your index build succeeds, avoid the following design 
   patterns that commonly trigger a restart loop:

   - Index key exceeds the :manual:`index key limit 
     </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Index-Key-Limit>`
   - :manual:`Index name </indexes/#index-names>` already exists
   - Index on :manual:`more than one array field 
     </core/index-multikey/#compound-multikey-indexes>`
   - Index on collection that has the 
     :manual:`maximum number of text indexes 
     </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Number-of-Indexes-per-Collection>`
   - Text index on collection that has the
     :manual:`maximum number of text indexes 
     </core/index-text/#one-text-index-per-collection>`

   Building an index in a rolling fashion reduces the resiliency of your cluster and
   increases index build times. We only recommend using rolling index builds when regular
   index builds do not meet your needs.

.. note::

   Data Explorer doesn't support building indexes in a rolling fashion
   for standalone deployments.

Building indexes in a rolling fashion reduces the performance impact of
building indexes on :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and
:manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. To maintain cluster
availability, |mms| removes one node from the cluster at a time
starting with a :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>`.

After you build an index in a rolling fashion, if your MongoDB database
runs with an :manual:`FCV 
</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
less than ``4.2``, :doc:`resync the head database 
</tutorial/resync-backup>` to ensure that the head database takes the 
new index into account.

|mms| automatically cancels rolling index builds 
that don't succeed on all nodes. When a rolling index build completes 
on some nodes, but fails on others, |mms| cancels the build
and removes the index from any nodes that it was successfully built on. 

In the event of a rolling index build cancellation, |mms| generates an 
activity feed event and sends a notification email to the project owner 
with the following information:

- Name of the cluster on which the rolling index build failed
- Namespace on which the rolling index build failed
- Project that contains the cluster and namespace
- Organization that contains the project
- Link to the activity feed event

To learn more about rebuilding indexes, see :manual:`Build Indexes on
Replica Sets </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets>`.

.. note::

   The following :manual:`index options 
   </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options>` are 
   incompatible with building indexes in a rolling fashion:

   - :manual:`unique
     </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options-for-all-index-types>`

   - :manual:`storageEngine
     </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options-for-all-index-types>`

   - :manual:`textIndexVersion
     </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options-for-text-indexes>`

   - :manual:`2dsphereIndexVersion
     </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options-for-2d-indexes>`

   |mms| ignores these options if you specify them in the
   :guilabel:`Options` pane.
