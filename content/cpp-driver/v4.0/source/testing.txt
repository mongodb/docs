Tests for the C++11 driver use
`Catch <https://github.com/philsquared/Catch>`__, a testing framework for C++.

Each class in the driver has a corresponding file in ``src/mongocxx/test``.
Because the new driver wraps
`libmongoc <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver>`__, we prefer to mock
and test the behavior of individual classes rather than test end-to-end
behavior of operations against a running mongod.  In other words, these are
unit tests rather than integration tests.

We also have integration tests for this driver in ``test/collection.cpp``.

Running the Existing Tests
--------------------------

Build the tests with:

.. code-block:: bash

   make

This will generate test binaries.  You can either run all the tests with:

.. code-block:: bash

   make test

or, for more detailed output with Catch, run the generated binary:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build/src/mongocxx/test/test_driver

or you can run the ctest command and make use of ctest's various flags. 
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ctest -V

can be used to run the tests with verbose output, or 

.. code-block:: bash

   ctest -R bson

could be used to run only the bson tests.

Running Integration Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the tests require a running mongod instance.  For this, first download
the `Mongodb server <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`__.

Then deploy a mongod on the default port with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --setParameter enableTestCommands=1

if it is installed, otherwise navigate to the directory holding the mongod
executable, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./mongod --setParameter enableTestCommands=1

following either command with any flags you wish to use, excluding
``--port``.  While the mongod is running, run the tests as normal.

Writing New Tests
-----------------

If you'd like to add a feature to the driver, please write a test for it as
well.  Additions to existing classes should have new sections added to the
existing test cases:

.. code-block:: bash

   TEST_CASE("existing_class", "[existing_class]") {
      SECTION("Can do some new thing") {
         ...
         REQUIRE(new_thing_works);
      }
   }

If you are adding a new class, please add a new test file for it to the
``test`` directory.  The test file's name should match the new class's file's
name.  You will need to add your file as a source for the driver's test
target, in ``src/mongocxx/test/CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code-block:: bash

   set(mongocxx_test_sources
      ...
      some_new_class.cpp
      ...
   )
