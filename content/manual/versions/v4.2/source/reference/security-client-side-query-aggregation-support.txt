This page documents the specific commands, query operators, update
operators, aggregation stages, and aggregation expressions supported by
4.2+ compatible drivers configured for automatic client-side field level
encryption.

MongoDB stores client-side field level encrypted fields as a
:bsontype:`BinData <data_binary>` blob. Read and write operations issued
against the encrypted ``BinData`` value may have unexpected or incorrect
behavior as compared to issuing that same operation against the 
decrypted value. Certain operations have strict BSON type support
where issuing them against a ``BinData`` value returns an error.

- Official 4.2+ compatible drivers using automatic client-side field
  level encryption parse read/write operations for operators or 
  expressions that do not support ``BinData`` values *or* that have
  abnormal behavior when issued against ``BinData`` values.

- Applications using explicit (manual) client-side
  field level encryption *may* use this page as guidance for issuing
  read/write operations against encrypted fields.

.. _csfle-commands-supported-automatic-encryption:

Supported Read and Write Commands
---------------------------------

Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers support
:ref:`automatic client-side field level encryption
<field-level-encryption-json-schema>` with the following commands:

- :dbcommand:`aggregate`
- :dbcommand:`count`
- :dbcommand:`delete`
- :dbcommand:`distinct`
- :dbcommand:`explain`
- :dbcommand:`find`
- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
- :dbcommand:`insert`
- :dbcommand:`update`

For any supported command, 4.2+ compatible drivers return an error
if the command uses an unsupported operator, aggregation stage, or
aggregation expression:

- :ref:`Supported Query Operators <csfle-supported-query-operators>`
- :ref:`Supported Update Operators <csfle-supported-update-operators>`
- :ref:`Supported Aggregation Expressions <csfle-supported-aggregation-expressions>`
- :ref:`Supported Aggregation Stages <csfle-supported-aggregation-stages>`

The following commands do not require automatic encryption. Official
MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for automatic client-side
field level encryption pass these commands directly to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`:

- :dbcommand:`getMore` [#]_
- :dbcommand:`authenticate`
- :dbcommand:`getnonce`
- :dbcommand:`hello`
- :dbcommand:`logout`
- :dbcommand:`isMaster` (deprecated)
- :dbcommand:`abortTransaction`
- :dbcommand:`commitTransaction`
- :dbcommand:`endSessions`
- :dbcommand:`startSession`
- :dbcommand:`create`
- :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`drop`
- :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`
- :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`killCursors`
- :dbcommand:`listCollections`
- :dbcommand:`listDatabases`
- :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
- :dbcommand:`ping`

Issuing any other :ref:`command <database-commands>` through a
4.2+ compatible driver configured for automatic client-side field level
encryption returns an error.

.. [#]

   While automatic client-side field level encryption does not encrypt
   the :dbcommand:`getMore` command, the response to the command may
   contain encrypted field values. Applications configured with the
   correct client-side field level encryption options
   :ref:`automatically decrypt
   <field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption>` those values.
   Applications without the correct encryption options only see the
   encrypted values.

.. _csfle-supported-query-operators:

Supported Query Operators
-------------------------

Official 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for automatic client-side
field level encryption allow the following query operators when issued
against :ref:`deterministically <field-level-encryption-deterministic>`
encrypted fields:

- :query:`$eq` 
- :query:`$ne` 
- :query:`$in` 
- :query:`$nin`
- :query:`$and`
- :query:`$or`
- :query:`$not`
- :query:`$nor`

Queries that compare an encrypted field to ``null`` *or* a regular
expression always throw an error *even if* using a supported query
operator. Queries issuing these operators against a :ref:`randomly
<field-level-encryption-random>` encrypted field throw an error.

The :query:`$exists` operator has normal behavior when issued
against both deterministically and
:ref:`randomly <field-level-encryption-random>` encrypted fields.

Queries specifying any other query operator against an encrypted field
return an error.

The following query operators throw an error *even if* not issued
against an encrypted field:

- :query:`$text`
- :query:`$where`
- :query:`$jsonSchema`

.. _csfle-supported-update-operators:

Supported Update Operators
--------------------------

Official 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for automatic client-side
field level encryption allow the following update operators when
issued against :ref:`deterministically
<field-level-encryption-deterministic>` encrypted fields:

- :update:`$set`
- :update:`$unset`
- :update:`$rename`

For update operations using the :update:`$rename` operator on encrypted
fields, ensure that  the automatic JSON schema specifies the same
encryption metadata for the source and target field names.

Updates specifying any other update operator against an encrypted field
return an error.

Update operations with the following behavior throw an error
*even if* using a supported operator:

- The update operation produces an array inside of an encrypted path. 

- The update operation uses :ref:`aggregation expression syntax 
  <4.2-update-using-aggregation>`.

For update operations specifying a :ref:`query filter
<update-command-q>` on :ref:`deterministically
<field-level-encryption-deterministic>` encrypted fields, the query
filter must use only :ref:`supported operators
<csfle-supported-query-operators>` on those fields.

.. _csfle-supported-insert-operation:

Unsupported Insert Operations
-----------------------------

Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for :ref:`automatic
client-side field level encryption <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`
do *not* support insert commands with the following behavior: 

- Inserting a document with ``Timestamp(0,0)`` associated to an
  encrypted field. The ``(0,0)`` value indicates that the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` should generate the Timestamp. Since the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` cannot generated encrypted fields, the
  resulting timestamp would be unencrypted.

- Inserting a document without an encrypted ``_id`` *if* the configured 
  automatic schema specifies an encrypted ``_id`` field. Since
  the :binary:`~bin.mongod` autogenerates an unencrypted 
  :ref:`ObjectId <objectid>`, omitting ``_id`` from documents results 
  in documents that do not conform to the automatic encryption rules.

- Inserting a document with an array associated to a 
  :ref:`deterministically <field-level-encryption-deterministic>`
  encrypted field. Automatic client-side field level encryption does not
  support deterministically encrypting arrays.

.. _csfle-supported-aggregation-stages:

Supported Aggregation Stages
----------------------------

Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for 
:ref:`automatic client-side field level encryption 
<field-level-encryption-json-schema>` support the following
aggregation pipeline stages:

- :pipeline:`$limit`
- :pipeline:`$match`
- :pipeline:`$group` (*see*  :ref:`csfle-group-behavior` *for usage
  requirements*.)
- :pipeline:`$sample`
- :pipeline:`$skip`
- :pipeline:`$sort`
- :pipeline:`$project`
- :pipeline:`$addFields`
- :pipeline:`$geoNear`
- :pipeline:`$collStats`
- :pipeline:`$indexStats`
- :pipeline:`$bucket`
- :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`
- :pipeline:`$unwind`
- :pipeline:`$sortByCount`
- :pipeline:`$count`
- :pipeline:`$replaceRoot`
- :pipeline:`$redact`
- :pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` (*See* 
  :ref:`csfle-lookup-graphlookup-behavior` *for usage requirements*)

Aggregation pipelines operating on collections configured for automatic
encryption that specify any other stage return an error.

For each supported pipeline stage, MongoDB tracks fields that
*must* be encrypted as they pass through the supported pipelines and
marks them for encryption. 

Each supported stage must specify only supported
:ref:`query operators <csfle-supported-query-operators>` and
:ref:`aggregation expressions
<csfle-supported-aggregation-expressions>`.

.. _csfle-group-behavior:

``$group`` Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$group` has the following behaviors specific to client-side 
field level encryption:

- Supports grouping on deterministically encrypted fields.
- Does *not* support arithmetic accumulators on encrypted fields.
- Supports :group:`$addToSet` and :group:`$push` accumulators on
  encrypted fields. Does *not* support matching on the resulting array.

.. _csfle-lookup-graphLookup-behavior:

``$lookup`` and ``$graphLookup`` Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic client-side field level encryption supports the
:pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` *only if* the
``from`` collection matches the collection on which the aggregation
runs against (i.e. self-lookup operations).

:pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages that
reference a different ``from`` collection return an error.

.. _csfle-supported-aggregation-expressions:

Supported Aggregation Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Official 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for automatic client-side
field level encryption allow aggregation stages using the following
expressions against :ref:`deterministically
<field-level-encryption-deterministic>` encrypted fields:

- :expression:`$eq`
- :expression:`$ne`
- :expression:`$in`
- :expression:`$switch`
- :expression:`$cond`
- :expression:`$ifNull`
- :expression:`$let`
- :expression:`$literal`

All other aggregation expressions return an error if issued against
encrypted fields.

Aggregation stages with the following behavior throw an error
*even if* using a supported aggregation expression:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 50 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Expressions
     - Rejected Behavior
     - Example

   * - :expression:`$cond`
       
       :expression:`$switch`
     - The expression specifies a field whose encryption properties
       cannot be known until runtime *and* a subsequent aggregation
       stage includes an expression referencing that field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          $addFields : {
            "valueWithUnknownEncryption" : {
              $cond : {
                if : { "$encryptedField" : "value" },
                then : "$encryptedField",
                else: "unencryptedValue"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            $match : {
              "valueWithUnknownEncryption" : "someNewValue"
            }
          }

   * - :expression:`$eq`

       :expression:`$ne`
     - The expression creates a new field that references an
       encrypted field *and* operates on that new field in the same
       expression.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          {
            $eq : [
              {"newField" : "$encryptedField"},
              {"newField" : "value"
            ]
          }

   * - :expression:`$eq`
       
       :expression:`$ne`
     - The expression references the prefix of an encrypted field
       within the comparison expression.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          { $eq : [ "$prefixOfEncryptedField" , "value"] }

   * - :expression:`$eq`
       
       :expression:`$ne`
     - The result of the expression is compared an encrypted field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          { 
            $eq : [ 
                "$encryptedField" , 
                { $ne : [ "field", "value" ] } 
            ] 
          }

   * - :expression:`$let`
     - The expression binds a variable to an encrypted 
       field *or* attempts to rebind :variable:`$$CURRENT <CURRENT>`.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          { 
            $let: {
              "vars" : {
                "newVariable" : "$encryptedField"
              }
            }
          }

   * - :expression:`$in`
     - The first argument to the expression *is* an encrypted field, 
       *and*
       
       - The second argument to the expression is *not* an array literal
      
         *-OR-* 

       - The second argument to the expression is an encrypted field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          { 
            $in : [ 
              "$encryptedField" , 
              "$otherEncryptedField" 
            ] 
          }

Unsupported Field Types
-----------------------

Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers configured for 
:ref:`automatic client-side field level encryption
<field-level-encryption-json-schema>` do *not* support any read or write 
operation that requires encrypting the following value types:

- :bsontype:`MaxKey`
- :bsontype:`MinKey`
- ``null``
- ``undefined``

Encryption does not adequately hide the type information for these
values.

Automatic field level encryption *also* does not support read or write
operations on a :ref:`deterministically
<field-level-encryption-deterministic>` field where the operation
compares the encrypted field to the following value types:

- ``double``
- ``decimal128``
- ``bool``
- ``object``
- ``array``
- ``javascriptWithScope``
