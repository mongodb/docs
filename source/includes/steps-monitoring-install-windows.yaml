title: Install PyMongo
ref: monitoring-windows-pymongo
pre: |
    Use the Windows installer to install `PyMongo from PyPi
    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.
    
    If PyMongo was previously installed without C extensions, :doc:`install PyMongo
    C extensions </monitoring/tutorial/install-pymongo>`.
    
    If you are installing PyMongo and the Monitoring Agent on systems that do not
    have C compilers, :doc:`build PyMongo packages with PyMongo C extensions
    </monitoring/tutorial/building-pymongo-packages-with-c>`.

title: Enable Script Execution in PowerShell
ref: monitoring-enable-powershell
action:
  - pre: |
      Right click the PowerShell icon in the "Start Menu," and run PowerShell as
      administrator. Issue the following command:
    language: powershell
    code: |
      Get-ExecutionPolicy
  - pre: |
      This returns the current execution policy. Save this value for future use in
      Step 4 below. If the policy is "``Unrestricted``" you can proceed to the next
      step. If the policy is not "``Unrestricted``" issue the following command:
    language: powershell
    code: |
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  - pre: |
      If this command returns an error denying access to a ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``
      registry key, this command sets the execution policy scope to the current 
      local user (e.g. ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``), not globally for the local machine:
    language: powershell
    code: |
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
post: |
  Confirm the policy change when prompted.

    following URL:
  language: none

  post: |
    Replace ``<original value>`` with the value that you recorded above in Step 2.
