However, the most significant bits of data in this value represent a time stamp, which means that they increment in a regular and predictable pattern. Even though this value has :ref:`high cardinality <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>`, when using this, *any date, or other monotonically increasing number* as the shard key, all insert operations will be storing data into a single chunk, and therefore, a single shard.
