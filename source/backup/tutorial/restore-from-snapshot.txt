Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. start-content

With the MongoDB Backup Service, you can restore from a stored snapshot or
build a :doc:`custom snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>` reflecting a
different point in the last 24 hours. For all backups, restoring from
a stored snapshot is faster than restoring a custom snapshot in the
last 24 hours.

MongoDB Backup Service takes and stores a snapshot every 6 hours. These
snapshots are available for restores following the snapshot
retention policy. [#snapshot-retention]_
