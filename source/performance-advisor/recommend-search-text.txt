If your queries rely heavily on the :query:`$text` aggregation pipeline 
stage, you can modify these queries to use :pipeline:`$search` instead 
to improve both the flexibility and performance of these queries.

.. _search-text-features:

|fts| Feature Advantages
------------------------

The :pipeline:`$search` aggregation stage provides the following 
features which are either not available through the :query:`$text` 
operator, available but less performant, or available only with 
significant implementation work by the user:

- :ref:`Language awareness <ref-language-analyzers>`
- Case-insensitive and :ref:`diacritic-insensitive <diacritic-insensitive-tutorial>` search
- Result text :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>`
- :ref:`Geospatial-aware <run-geo-search-tutorial>` queries
- Character and word autocompletion with different 
  :ref:`tokenization <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` strategies
- :ref:`Fuzzy matching <text-ref-fuzzy-eg>`
- Filtering on 10 or more strings with the :ref:`compound-ref` operator
- Customizable :ref:`relevance scoring <scoring-ref>` and 
  :ref:`sorting <sort-tutorial>`
- Single compound indexes on arrays
- :ref:`Synonym <synonyms-ref>` search
- Bucketing for :ref:`faceted navigation <fts-facet-ref>`
- :ref:`Custom analyzers <custom-analyzers>`
- :ref:`Partial matching <partial-match-tutorial>`
- :ref:`Phrase <phrase-ref>` queries

Examples
--------
Create the Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in the following sections use queries against the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection in the 
:doc:`sample data </sample-data>` to illustrate the improvements to 
flexibility and performance that |fts| offers over :query:`$text`. You 
can run the queries from both examples using the following indexes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Text Index
     - |fts| Index
   
   * - .. code-block:: javascript

          db.movies.createIndex(
            { 
              genres: "text",
              plot: "text", 
              year: -1 
            }
          )

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          {
            "mappings": {
              "dynamic": false,
              "fields": {
                "genres": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "plot": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "year": {
                  "type": "number"
                }
              }
            }
          }

Either index definition will index the ``genres`` and ``plot`` fields
as text, and the ``year`` field as numeric. For instructions on 
creating :query:`$text` indexes, see 
:manual:`Create Text Index <create-text-index>`. For instructions on
creating |fts| indexes, see 
:ref:`Create an Atlas Search Index <ref-create-index>`.

.. _search-text-flexibility:

Improve Flexibility of Full-Text Queries with |fts|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update your :query:`$text`-based queries to use ``$search`` for 
greater flexibility and convenience. In this example, you will query 
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection in the 
:doc:`sample data </sample-data>` to retrieve entries with the word
'poet' in the ``plot`` field, sorted in ascending order by year.

The index definitions laid out in the previous section illustrate one
of the flexibility enhancements of ``$search``: in order to create the
``$text`` index on ``sample_mflix.movies``, you must first 
:manual:`delete any existing text index <text-index-storage-requirements>` on the 
sample data, as MongoDB supports only a single text index per 
collection.

In contrast, you can create multiple
:ref:`Atlas Search indexes <ref-create-index>` for a single 
collection, allowing your applications to leverage distinct full text 
queries in parallel.

The following queries return the five most recent movies with 'poet' in 
the ``plot`` field, showing their titles, genres, plots, and years of 
release.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Regex Index
     - |fts| Index
   
   * - .. code-block:: javascript

          db.movies.find(
             { 
               $text: { $search: "poet" }
             },
             {
               _id: 0,
               title: 1,
               genres: 1,
               plot: 1,
               year: 1
             }
          ).limit(5)

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          db.movies.aggregate([
             {
               "$search": {
                 "text": {
                   "path": "plot",
                   "query": "poet"
                 }
               }
             },
             {
               "$limit": 5
             },
             {
               "$project": {
                 "_id": 0,
                 "title": 1,
                 "genres": 1,
                 "plot": 1,
                 "year": 1,
               }
             }
          ])

Both of these queries return the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    plot: `It's the story of the murder of a poet, a man, a great film director: Pier Paolo Pasolini. The story begin with the arrest of "Pelosi", a young man then accused of the murder of the poet. ...`,
    genres: [ 'Crime', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'Who Killed Pasolini?',
    year: 1995
   },
   {
    plot: 'Friendship and betrayal between two poets during the French Revolution.',
    genres: [ 'Biography', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'Pandaemonium',
    year: 2000
   },
   {
    year: 2003,
    plot: 'Story of the relationship between the poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath.',
    genres: [ 'Biography', 'Drama', 'Romance' ],
    title: 'Sylvia'
   },
   {
    year: 2003,
    plot: 'Story of the relationship between the poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath.',
    genres: [ 'Biography', 'Drama', 'Romance' ],
    title: 'Sylvia'
   },
   {
    plot: 'A love-struck Italian poet is stuck in Iraq at the onset of an American invasion.',
    genres: [ 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance' ],
    title: 'The Tiger and the Snow',
    year: 2005
   }

Unique to |fts|, you can add :ref:`highlights <highlight-ref>` to the 
results, displaying matches in the contexts in which they were found.
To do so, replace the |fts| query above with the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 8-10, 23
      
   db.movies.aggregate([
     {
       "$search": {
         "text": {
           "path": "plot",
           "query": "poet"
         },
         "highlight": {
           "path": "plot"
         }
       }
     },
     {
       "$limit": 1
     },
     {
       "$project": {
         "_id": 0,
         "title": 1,
         "genres": 1,
         "plot": 1,
         "year": 1,
         "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
       }
     }
   ])

The results of the above query include the ``highlights`` field, which 
contains both the context in which all matches occurred, and relevance 
scores for each. For example, the following shows the ``highlights`` 
field for the first document in the ``$search`` results.

.. code-block:: javascript

     {
       plot: `It's the story of the murder of a poet, a man, a great film director: Pier Paolo Pasolini. The story begin with the arrest of "Pelosi", a young man then accused of the murder of the poet. ...`,
       genres: [ 'Crime', 'Drama' ],
       title: 'Who Killed Pasolini?',
       year: 1995,
       highlights: [
         {
           score: 1.0902210474014282,
           path: 'plot',
           texts: [
             { value: "It's the story of the murder of a ", type: 'text' },
             { value: 'poet', type: 'hit' },
             {
               value: ', a man, a great film director: Pier Paolo Pasolini. ',
               type: 'text'
             }
           ]
         },
         {
           score: 1.0202842950820923,
           path: 'plot',
           texts: [
             {
               value: 'The story begin with the arrest of "Pelosi", a young man then accused of the murder of the ',
               type: 'text'
             },
             { value: 'poet', type: 'hit' },
             { value: '. ...', type: 'text' }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }

Improve Performance of Queries using |fts|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to greater flexibility and convenience, |fts| provides
significant performance advantages over analogous :query:`$text` queries.
Consider a query against the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection to 
retrieve movies released between 2000 and 2010, in the comedy genre, 
with 'poet' in the ``plot`` field.

Run the following queries:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Text Index
     - |fts| Index
   
   * - .. code-block:: json

          db.movies.aggregate([
            {
              $match: {
                year: {$gte: 2000, $lte: 2010},
                $text: { $search: "poet" },
                genres : { $eq: "Comedy" }
              } 
            },
            { "$sort": { "year": 1 } },
            {
              "$limit": 3
            },
            {
              "$project": {
                "_id": 0,
                "title": 1,
                "genres": 1,
                "plot": 1,
                "year": 1
              },
              
            }
          ])

     - .. code-block:: json
      
          db.movies.aggregate([
            {
              "$search": {
                "compound": {
                  "filter": [{
                    "range": {
                      "gte": 2000,
                      "lte": 2010,
                      "path": "year"
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "text": {
                      "path": "plot",
                      "query": "poet"
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "text": {
                      "path": "genres",
                      "query": "comedy"
                    }
                  }]
                }
              }
            },
            { "$sort": { "year": 1 } },
            {
              "$limit": 3
            },
            {
              "$project": {
                "_id": 0,
                "title": 1,
                "genres": 1,
                "plot": 1,
                "year": 1
              }
            }
          ])

Both of these queries will return the following three documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

     {
    year: 2000,
    plot: 'A film poem inspired by the Peruvian poet Cèsar Vallejo. A story about our need for love, our confusion, greatness and smallness and, most of all, our vulnerability. It is a story with many...',
    genres: [ 'Comedy', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'Songs from the Second Floor'
  },
  {
    plot: 'When his mother, who has sheltered him his entire 40 years, dies, Elling, a sensitive, would-be poet, is sent to live in a state institution. There he meets Kjell Bjarne, a gentle giant and...',
    genres: [ 'Comedy', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'Elling',
    year: 2001
  },
  {
    plot: 'Heart-broken after several affairs, a woman finds herself torn between a Poet and a TV Host.',
    genres: [ 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'Easy',
    year: 2003
  }

Although :query:`$text` is adequate for simple, narrow searches such as 
this, as the size of the datasets and breadth of your queries 
increases, the performance advantages of ``$search`` will significantly 
improve the responsiveness of your applications. We recommend that you 
use an :ref:`Atlas Search query <searching-ref>` through the 
:ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline stage.
