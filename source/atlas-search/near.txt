.. expression:: near

   The ``near`` operator supports querying and scoring numeric, date, 
   and GeoJSON point values. This operator can be used to perform a 
   search over:

   - Number fields of BSON ``int32``, ``int64``, and ``double`` data
     types. 
   - Date fields of BSON ``date`` type in :term:`ISODate` format.
   - Geographic location fields defined using latitude and longitude
     coordinates.

   You can use the ``near`` operator to find results that are near a
   number or a date. The ``near`` operator scores the |fts| results by
   proximity to the number or date.

.. _near-syntax:

Syntax
------

``near`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $search: {
         "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
         "near": {
            "path": "<field-to-search>",
            "origin": <date-or-number>,
            "pivot": <pivot-distance>,
            "score": <score-options>
         }
      }
   }

.. _near-options:

Options
-------

``near`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 60 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``origin``
     - date, number, or geo
     - Number, date, or geographic
       :ref:`point <geojson-point>` to search near. This is the origin
       from which the proximity of the results is measured.

       - For number fields, the value must be of BSON ``int32``,
         ``int64``, or ``double`` data types.
       - For date fields, the value must be an
         :term:`ISODate`
         formatted date.
       - For :ref:`geo <bson-data-types-geo>` fields. the value must be
         a :ref:`GeoJSON point <geojson-point>`.

     - yes

   * - ``path``
     - string or array of strings
     - Indexed field or fields to search. See :ref:`Path Construction
       <ref-path>`.
     - yes

   * - ``pivot``
     - number
     - Value to use to calculate scores of |fts| result documents.
       Score is calculated using the following formula:

       .. code-block:: text
          :copyable: false

                        pivot
          score = ------------------
                   pivot + distance

       where ``distance`` is the difference between ``origin`` and the
       indexed field value.

       Results have a score equal to ``1/2`` (or ``0.5``) when their
       indexed field value is ``pivot`` units away from ``origin``.
       The value of ``pivot`` must be greater than (i.e. ``>``) ``0``.

       If ``origin`` is a:

       - Number, ``pivot`` can be specified as an integer or floating
         point number.
       - Date, ``pivot`` must be specified in milliseconds and can be
         specified as a 32 or 64 bit integer. For example: 
         
         - 1 minute is equal to ``60,000 ms``
         - 1 hour is equal to ``3,600,000 ms``
         - 1 day is equal to ``86,400,000 ms``
         - 1 month (or 30 days) is equal to ``2,592,000,000 ms``

       - GeoJSON point, ``pivot`` is measured in meters and must be
         specified as an integer or floating point number.

     - yes

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - Score to assign to matching search results. You can modify
       the default score using the following options:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.
       - ``function``: replace the result score with the given expression.

       For information on using ``score`` in your query, see
       :ref:`scoring-ref`.

       To learn more, see :ref:`near-query-score`.

     - no

.. _near-query-score:

Scoring Behavior 
----------------

|fts| ``score`` is a measure of the proximity of the |fts| results to
``origin``. The ``score`` is scaled between ``0`` and ``1`` with ``1``
being an exact match and ``0`` being a distant match. Score is equal to
``0.5`` when the distance of the |fts| result from ``origin`` is equal
to the distance away from origin as calculated using ``pivot``.

Score is calculated using the following formula:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

                  pivot
   score = ------------------
            pivot + distance

where, ``distance`` is the difference between ``origin`` and the indexed
field value. 

You can modify the default score using  ``score`` option in your query.
To learn more about the options, :ref:`scoring-options`.

Limitation
----------

You can't use the ``near`` operator to query numeric or date values
stored in an array, even if you have an |fts| index. You can use the 
:ref:`range-ref` operator only to query indexed numeric or date values
inside arrays. 

.. _near-ref-egs:

Examples
--------

The :ref:`number <near-number-eg>` and :ref:`date <near-date-eg>`
examples use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database. The :ref:`GeoJSON point <near-geo-point-eg>` example uses the
``listingsAndReviews`` collection in the ``sample_airbnb`` database. 

If you :ref:`load the sample data <sample-data>` on your |service| cluster,
you can create the static indexes using the index definitions in the examples
below or the dynamic index and run the example queries on your cluster.

Number Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``near`` operator to query a number field.

.. example::

   The following index definition named ``runtimes`` indexes the
   ``runtime`` field values in the ``movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      {
         "mappings": {
            "dynamic": false,
            "fields": {
               "runtime": {
                  "type": "number"
               }
            }
         }
      }

   The following query searches for documents in the ``movies``
   collection with a ``runtime`` field value that is near 279. It
   includes a :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 7 results
   and a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``runtime``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` is calculated using ``pivot``.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $search: {
               "index": "runtimes",
               "near": {
                  "path": "runtime",
                  "origin": 279,
                  "pivot": 2
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $limit: 7
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "runtime": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:
      :copyable: false

      { "runtime" : 279, "title" : "The Kingdom", "score" : 1 }
      { "runtime" : 279, "title" : "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst", "score" : 1 }
      { "runtime" : 280, "title" : "Shoah", "score" : 0.6666666865348816 }
      { "runtime" : 281, "title" : "Les Misèrables", "score" : 0.5 }
      { "runtime" : 277, "title" : "Tokyo Trial", "score" : 0.5 }
      { "runtime" : 276, "title" : "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale", "score" : 0.4000000059604645 }
      { "runtime" : 283, "title" : "Scenes from a Marriage", "score" : 0.3333333432674408 }

   In the above |fts| results, the movies ``The Kingdom`` and ``The
   Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst`` receive a score of
   ``1.0`` because their ``runtime`` field value of ``279`` is an exact
   match. The movies ``Les Misèrables`` and ``Tokyo Trial`` receive a
   score of ``0.5`` because their ``runtime`` field value is ``2``
   units away from ``279``.

.. _near-date-eg:

Date Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``near`` operator to query a date field.

.. example::

   The following index definition named ``releaseddate`` indexes the
   ``released`` field values in the ``movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      {
         "mappings": {
            "dynamic": false,
            "fields": {
               "released": {
                  "type": "date"
               }
            }
         }
      }

   The following query searches for movies released near September 13,
   1.    It includes a :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to
   ``3`` results and a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``released``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` of results is calculated using ``pivot``.

   .. note::

      ``pivot`` is measured here in milliseconds, and
      ``7,776,000,000 ms`` is equal to approximately three months.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $search: {
               "index": "releaseddate",
               "near": {
                  "path": "released",
                  "origin": ISODate("1915-09-13T00:00:00.000+00:00"),
                  "pivot": 7776000000
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $limit: 3
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "released": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following search results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      { "title" : "Regeneration", "released" : ISODate("1915-09-13T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 1 }
      { "title" : "The Cheat", "released" : ISODate("1915-12-13T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 0.49723756313323975 }
      { "title" : "Hell's Hinges", "released" : ISODate("1916-03-05T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 0.34090909361839294 }

   In the above |fts| results, the movie ``Regeneration`` receives a
   score of ``1`` because the ``released`` field value of
   ``1915-09-13`` is an exact match. The movie ``The Cheat``, which was
   released on ``1915-12-13``, receives a score of approximately
   ``0.5`` because the ``released`` field value distance from
   ``origin`` is approximately ``7,776,000,000`` milliseconds from
   ``1915-09-13``.

GeoJSON Point Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples use the ``near`` operator to query a GeoJSON 
point object in the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection. 
The following index definition indexes the ``address.location`` and 
``property_type`` fields in the ``listingsAndReviews`` collection.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      {
        "mappings": {
          "fields": {
            "address": {
              "fields": {
                "location": {
                  "type": "geo"
                }
              },
              "type": "document"
            },
            "property_type": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      } 

Basic Example 
`````````````

The following examples use the ``near`` operator to query the 
``address.location`` field in the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` 
collection.

.. example::

   The following query searches for properties in Portugal. It includes
   a :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``3`` results and a
   :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``name`` and ``address``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` of results is calculated using ``pivot``. Note that
   ``pivot`` is measured here in meters and 1000 meters is equal to 1
   kilometer.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
        {
          "$search": {
            "near": {
              "origin": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-8.61308, 41.1413]
              },
              "pivot": 1000,
              "path": "address.location"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          $limit: 3
        },
        {
          $project: {
            "_id": 0,
            "name": 1,
            "address": 1,
            score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
          }
        }
      ])

   The above query returns the following search results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:
      :copyable: false

      {
        "name" : "Ribeira Charming Duplex",
        "address" : {
          "street" : "Porto, Porto, Portugal",
          "suburb" : "",
          "government_area" : "Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória",
          "market" : "Porto",

            "is_location_exact" : false
          }
        },
        "score" : 1
      }
      {
        "name" : "DB RIBEIRA - Grey Apartment",
        "address" : {
          "street" : "Porto, Porto, Portugal",
          "suburb" : "",
          "government_area" : "Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória",
          "market" : "Porto",
          "country" : "Portugal",
          "country_code" : "PT",
          "location" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [ -8.61294, 41.14126 ],
            "is_location_exact" : true
          }
        },
        "score" : 0.9876177310943604
      }
      {
        "name" : "Ribeira 24 (4)",
        "address" : {
          "street" : "Porto, Porto, Portugal",
          "suburb" : "",
          "government_area" : "Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória",
          "market" : "Porto",
          "country" : "Portugal",
          "country_code" : "PT",
          "location" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [ -8.61318, 41.14107 ],
            "is_location_exact" : false
          }
        },
        "score" : 0.973789632320404
      }

   The results show that properties that are farther away from the
   specified coordinates have a lower score.

Compound Example 
````````````````

The following example uses the ``compound`` operator to query the 
``property_type`` and ``address.location`` fields in the 
``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection.

.. example::

   The following query searches for apartments in Hong Kong near a 
   specified GeoJSON point. The query uses **must** to specify the search 
   condition, which must be met, and **should** to specify preference for 
   location. It includes a :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 3 
   results and a :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
   stage to:

   - Exclude all fields except ``property_type`` and ``address``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` is calculated using the ``pivot`` field. Note that
   ``pivot`` is measured here in meters and 1000 meters is equal to 1
   kilometer.

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :linenos:

                  },
                  "pivot": 1000,
                  "path": "address.location"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          $limit: 3
        },
