This page guides you through the steps for connecting to the federated 
database instance to query your {+dl+} dataset.

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, you must have the following: 

- An IP address added to the access list of the project that contains 
  the cluster. To learn more, see :ref:`Add Your Connection IP 
  Address to Your IP Access List <gswa-access-list>`.
- A database user for your cluster in the project that contains the 
  {+fdi+} that you want to connect to. To learn 
  more, see :ref:`Create a Database User for Your Cluster <gswa-user>`.
- A {+fdi+} on the |service| cluster mapped to your 
  {+adl+} dataset. To learn more, see :ref:`adl-create-federated-db`.

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

   .. include:: /includes/atlas-nav/steps-data-federation.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Connect` for the {+fdi+} that you wish to connect to.

      .. example:: 
         
         If you are connecting to the {+fdi+} for 
         querying the {+adl+} dataset that you created using the 
         examples, click :guilabel:`Connect` for :guilabel:`DataLake0`.

   .. step:: Get the connection string for your preferred method of connecting.

      You can connect using |mongosh|, a :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`, 
      and :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>`. To learn how to get the 
      connection string for your client, click the tab below for your 
      connection method. 

      If you are following the examples in the steps for deploying an 
      {+adl+} for the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and setting up 
      a {+fdi+} for this {+dl+} dataset, click the 
      MongoDB Shell tab below to connect using |mongosh|. 

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: MongoDB Shell 
            :tabid: mongosh 

            a. Click :guilabel:`Connect with the MongoDB Shell`.
            #. Based on whether or not you have |mongosh| installed, 
               do the following:

               - If you already have |mongosh|, select your installed 
                 |mongosh| version and copy the provided connection 
                 string to your clipboard.

               - If you don't have |mongosh|, install |mongosh| and 
                 copy the provided connection string to your clipboard.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

         .. tab:: MongoDB Driver 
            :tabid: driver 

            a. Click :guilabel:`Connect your application`.
            #. Select your driver and the driver version.
            #. Copy the provided connection string to your clipboard.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

         .. tab:: MongoDB Compass 
            :tabid: compass 

            a. Click :guilabel:`Connect using MongoDB Compass`.
            #. Based on whether you have |compass| installed, do the 
               following: 
               
               - If you already have |compass|, select your |compass| 
                 version and copy the provided connection string to 
                 your clipboard.
               - If you don't have |compass|, :compass:`install 
                 </install/>` |compass| and follow the steps above to 
                 connect with |compass|. 

            #. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

   .. step:: Connect your client to your {+fdi+} using the connection string.

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: MongoDB Shell 
            :tabid: mongosh 

            a. Paste and run the connection string in a terminal. 
            #. When prompted, enter your database user's password.

            <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/connect/>`__.

         .. tab:: MongoDB Driver 
            :tabid: driver 

            To learn more, see *Driver Examples* in the |service| 
            :ref:`Connect via Your Application <connect-via-driver>` 
            page.

         .. tab:: MongoDB Compass 
            :tabid: compass 

            a. Open |compass| and paste the connection string into the 
               :guilabel:`URI` field.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.
