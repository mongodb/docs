title: Select a {+database-deployment+} type.
stepnum: 0
level: 4
content: |

  Use the tabs at the top of the screen to select your 
  {+database-deployment+} type. You can deploy the following 
  {+database-deployments+}:
 
  {+Serverless-Instances+}
    {+Serverless-instances+} require minimal configuration and are best for
    applications that aren't critical and experience low or variable traffic. To learn
    more about {+Serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Choose a
    {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.
 
  {+Shared-Clusters+}
    {+Shared-clusters+} include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
    These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
    learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
    You can begin your project with a {+Shared-cluster+} and upgrade to a
    production-ready tier at a future time.

  {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
    Dedicated clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
    ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
    and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
    datasets and high-traffic applications. Dedicated clusters can be
    deployed into a single geographical region or multiple geographical regions.

  Select :guilabel:`Serverless`, then proceed to the next step to customize the
  configuration prior to deployment.
  
  To create a {+Shared-cluster+} or a {+dedicated-cluster+}, see
  :doc:`Create a New Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` for next steps.
