Users with the viewer and author :ref:`roles <dashboard-roles>`
on tables can sort and resize table columns. You
can sort and resize columns either in the
:doc:`dashboard </dashboards>` or the :doc:`Chart Builder
</build-charts>`.

Behavior
--------

When a viewer or author sorts or resizes columns from the
:doc:`dashboard </dashboards>` view, the changes do not persist as
part of the chart definition. In this case, the chart returns to its
original state once the chart or corresponding dashboard is
refreshed.

To save the changes as part of the chart definition, an author must
make the changes in the Chart Builder. All |charts-short| users will
see the new column sorting and sizing.

Procedure
---------

Sort Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sort a table column, click on its header. With each click, |charts| cycles between sorting the column in
ascending order, descending order, and the default chart sorting order.

To sort by multiple columns, Shift + Click on the additional columns
by which you wish to sort. |charts-short| applies the sort order in
the same order you select additional columns. |charts-short| displays
numbers in the column headers indicating the order in which the
sorting is applied.

Resize Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To resize a column, click the column divider and drag until the
column reaches the desired width.

To return a column to its default width, double-click on the column
divider.
