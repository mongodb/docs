Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor the
outcome of commands that the driver sends to your MongoDB deployment.

You might use information about command events in your
application to understand changes in query performance or resolve bottlenecks.

Subscribe to Events
-------------------

You can access details about command events by subscribing to them
in your application. The following example demonstrates how to subscribe
to the ``CommandStartedEvent`` event by instantiating a
``CommandMonitor`` and connecting to a deployment:

.. code-block:: go

   var eventArray []*event.CommandStartedEvent
   cmdMonitor := &event.CommandMonitor{
       Started: func(ctx context.Context, e *event.CommandStartedEvent) {
           eventArray = append(eventArray, e)
       },
   }
   clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetMonitor(cmdMonitor)
   client, err := mongo.Connect(clientOpts)

Event Descriptions
------------------

You can subscribe to one or more of the following command monitoring
events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - ``CommandStartedEvent``
     - Created when a command starts.

   * - ``CommandSucceededEvent``
     - Created when a command succeeds.

   * - ``CommandFailedEvent``
     - Created when a command does not succeed.

Example Event Documents
-----------------------

The following sections show sample output for each type of command monitoring event.

       "ServerConnectionID": ...,
       "ServiceID": "..."
   }
