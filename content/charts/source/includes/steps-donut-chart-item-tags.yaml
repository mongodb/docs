  a. In the :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown, select
     :guilabel:`Circular`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Donut` below the dropdown.

  .. example:: Donut Chart

     A donut chart is a good choice for this chart because donut charts
     show the relationship of parts to a whole. Using this chart type you
     can easily get an idea of which tags make up the greatest portion of
     total sales.

title: Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels.
ref: donut-chart-add-fields
level: 4
content: |

   a. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``items`` field to
      expand the ``items`` object and view its properties.

   #. Drag the ``items.tags`` field to the :guilabel:`Label`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Label` encoding channel
      dictates which field to use when dividing the sections of the
      chart.

   #. In the :guilabel:`array reduction` dropdown for the
      ``items`` array select :guilabel:`Unwind array`.

   #. In the :guilabel:`array reduction` dropdowns for the
      ``tags`` select :guilabel:`Array element by index`. Using this
      option you can specify which element of the ``tags`` array to
      visualize.

   #. Enter ``0`` for the :guilabel:`Index` input to only visualize the
      first element of the ``tags`` array. The first item tag is the
      most relevant tag to the item, so it should be the main concern
      in the visualiztion. This is the *primary* item tag.

      .. note::

         Selecting an array element by index also ensures the chart
         does not get overcrowded with less important tags as it would
         had you chosen to unwind the ``tags`` array rather than select
         a specific element.

   #. Drag the ``id`` field to the :guilabel:`Arc`
      encoding channel.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Aggregate` dropdown, select :guilabel:`count`.
      This option counts the occurrences of the first tag of each item
      and adds them to the chart.

   Your chart should now look something like this:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/tutorial-donut-in-progress-2.png
      :figwidth: 750px
      :alt: Donut Chart Builder

title: Copy the following filter into the :guilabel:`Query` input
       above the main chart display.
ref: copy-filter
level: 4
content: |

   .. code-block:: json

      { storeLocation: { $in: [ "Denver", "New York" ] }, 'items.price': {$gte: 1200} }

   This :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` specifies that
   |charts-short| only visualizes item tags from items sold from either
   the ``Denver`` or ``New York`` store location where there was an
   item in the sale costing ``$1200`` or more.

title: Click :guilabel:`Apply` to the right of the filter.

   Your chart should now look something like this:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/order-tutorial-edit-add-filter-2.png
      :figwidth: 750px
      :alt: Edit Chart Add Filter

   Notice how the ``electronics`` tag now takes a larger slice of the
   distribution compared to when not using the filter. Based on this
   chart, notice that ``office`` and ``school`` are the two most common
   primary item tags from sales matching the filter.
