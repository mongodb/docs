   :description: View and manage host mappings in Cloud Manager, including preferred hostnames and aliases, based on monitoring data.

Host mappings are based on the data that the {+magent+}
retrieves on a regular interval. |mms| regenerates the entries on the
:guilabel:`Host Mappings` page after each retrieval.

Host mappings are displayed in three-column rows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Content
   * - :guilabel:`Host`
     - The preferred hostname and port for the deployment.
   * - :guilabel:`Alias`
     - One alternative hostname or address and port for the 
       deployment. 
   * - :guilabel:`Last Updated`
     - The timestamp when the host mapping was updated.

If a host has multiple aliases, each mapping of host to alias is 
listed in its own row.

Preferred Hostnames
-------------------

The preferred hostname also appears in the :guilabel:`Name` column of
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. This hostname can be a hostname, an
|fqdn|, an |ipv4| address, or an |ipv6| address. If you want a
different preferred hostname than what |mms| chose, regenerate the list
of mappings in one of the following ways:

* Specify constraints on how |mms| picks a preferred hostname. For
  more information, see :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` in
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`.

* Reset the mapping list. For more information, see
  :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates` in
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`.

.. important::

   Resetting duplicates and setting constraints on the selection of a
   preferred hostname cause |mms| to lose the monitoring history for
   affected hosts. Chart data based on this history is also lost.
  
Aliases
-------

Depending on what |mms| obtains from a monitored host, the alias may be
in any one of the following forms:

* Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)

* Internal hostname

* External |ipv4| or |ipv6| address

* Internal |ipv4| or |ipv6| address

.. important::

   To prevent naming conflicts, |mms| does not use ``localhost`` or
   similiar local designations for new or remapped hosts unless no
   other hostname option is possible.
