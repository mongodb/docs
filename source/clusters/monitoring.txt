Monitoring
----------

You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role to 
configure a third-party monitoring integration.

.. tip::

   |cloudgov-short| user roles are the same as 
   :atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Integrate with Third-Party Monitoring Services </tutorial/third-party-service-integrations/>`

Logging
-------

In addition to the standard Atlas logging, 
|cloudgov-short| logs the username and IP address associated with all 
failed login attempts, temporary lockouts and failed |api| digest 
authentications.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`View and Download MongoDB Logs </mongodb-logs/>`

Alerts and Communications
-------------------------

You receive emails from a different MongoDB account depending on the 
region to which your resources are deployed and the type of 
communication.

:atlas:`Configure and Resolve Alerts </alerts/>`
