   *Syntax*: ``{$rename: { <old name1>: <new name1>, <old name2>: <new name2>, ... } }``

   The :update:`$rename` operator updates the name of a field. The new
   field name must differ from the existing field name.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'nickname': 'alias', 'cell': 'mobile' } } )

   This operation renames the field ``nickname`` to ``alias``, and the
   field ``cell`` to ``mobile``.

Behavior
--------

The :update:`$rename` operator logically performs an :update:`$unset`
of both the old name and the new name, and then performs a
:update:`$set` operation with the new name. As such, the operation may
not preserve the order of the fields in the document; i.e. the renamed
field may move within the document.

If the document already has a field with the *new* field name, the
:update:`$rename` operator removes that field and renames the
field with the *old* field name to the *new* field name.

For fields in embedded documents, the :update:`$rename` operator can
rename these fields as well as move the fields in and out of embedded
documents. :update:`$rename` does not work if these fields are in array
elements.

Examples
--------

A collection ``students`` the the following document where a field
``nmae`` appears misspelled, i.e. should be ``name``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 1,
     "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
     "mobile": "555-555-5555",
     "nmae": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
   }

Rename a Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename a field, call the :update:`$rename` operator with the current
name of the field and the new name:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "nmae": "name" } } )

This operation renames the field ``nmae`` to ``name``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
     "mobile": "555-555-5555",
     "name": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
   }

Rename a Field in an Embedded Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename a field in an embedded document, call the :update:`$rename`
operator using the :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>` to refer
to the field. If the field is to remain in the same embedded document,
also use the dot notation in the new name, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.first": "name.fname" } } )

This operation renames the embedded field ``first`` to ``fname``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
     "mobile" : "555-555-5555",
     "name" : { "fname" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
   }

Rename a Field That Does Not Exist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When renaming a field and the existing field name refers to a field
that does not exist, the :update:`$rename` operator does nothing, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse' } } )

This operation does nothing because there is no field named
``wife``.
