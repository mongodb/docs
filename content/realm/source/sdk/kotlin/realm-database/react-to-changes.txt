Any modern app should be able to react when data changes,
regardless of where that change originated. When a user adds a new item to a list,
you may want to update the UI, show a notification, or log a message.
When someone updates that item, you may want to change its visual state
or fire off a network request.
Finally, when someone deletes the item, you probably want to remove it from the UI.
Realm's notification system allows you to watch for and react to changes in your data,
independent of the writes that caused the changes.

The frozen architecture of the Kotlin SDK makes notifications even more
important. Because the Kotlin SDK doesn't have live objects that update
automatically, you'll use notifications to keep your UI and data layer
in sync.

You can subscribe to changes on the following events:

- :ref:`Query on collection <kotlin-query-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Realm object <kotlin-realm-object-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Realm collections (e.g. list) <kotlin-realm-list-change-listener>`

The SDK only provides notifications for objects nested up to four layers deep. 
If you need to react to changes in more deeply-nested objects, register a
key path change listener. For more information, refer to 
**Register a Key Path Change Listener** on this page.

You can also react to changes in user authentication state. For more information,
refer to :ref:`kotlin-authentication-change-listener`.

.. example:: About the Examples on This Page

   The examples in this page use two Realm object types, ``Character`` and
   ``Fellowship``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.sample-data-models.kt
      :language: kotlin

   The examples have this sample data:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.sample-data-seed.kt
      :language: kotlin


.. _kotlin-query-change-listener:

Register a Query Change Listener
--------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on any query within a Realm.
First, create a Kotlin Flow from the query with `asFlow()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-element-query/as-flow.html>`__.
Next, use the ``collect()`` method to handle events on that Flow. Events
of type ``UpdatedResults`` record all changes to the objects matching the
query using the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 20 30

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``insertions``
     - *IntArray*
     - Indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``insertionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``changes``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes of the objects in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``changeRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``deletions``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``deletionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``list``
     - *RealmResults<T as RealmObject>*
     - Results collection being monitored for changes.

.. _kotlin-realm-object-change-listener:

Register a RealmObject Change Listener
--------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object within a realm.
Realm notifies your handler when any of the object's properties change.
To register a change listener on a single object, obtain a `RealmSingleQuery <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-single-query/index.html>`__
with ``realm.query.first()``. Generate a Flow from that query with `asFlow()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-element-query/as-flow.html>`__.
The handler receives a ``SingleQueryChange`` object that communicates
object changes using the following subtypes:

.. list-table::

   * - Subtype
     - Properties
     - Notes

   * - ``UpdatedObject``
     - *changedFields*, *obj*
     - Pass a field name to ``isFieldChanged()`` to check if that field changed.

   * - ``DeletedObject``
     - *obj*
     - Since *obj* always reflects the latest version of the object, it always returns a null value in this subtype.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.realm-object-change-listener.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-realm-list-change-listener:

Register a Collection Change Listener
-------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a ``RealmList``, ``RealmSet``,
or ``RealmMap``.
Realm notifies your handler when any of the collection items change.
First, create a Kotlin Flow from the collection with ``asFlow()``.
Next, use the ``collect()`` method to handle events on that Flow. Events
of type ``ListChange``, ``SetChange``, or ``MapChange`` record all 
changes to the collection.

.. _kotlin-key-path-notifications:

Register a Key Path Change Listener
-----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.13.0

When you register a notification handler, you can pass an optional list of 
string property names to specify the key path or key paths to watch.

When you specify key paths, only changes to those key paths trigger 
notification blocks. Any other changes do not trigger notification blocks.

In the following example, we register a key path change listener for the ``age`` 
property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.realm-object-keypath-listener.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. include:: /includes/note-key-path-notification-execution.rst

Observe Nested Key Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use dot notation to observe nested key paths. By default, the SDK
only reports notifications for objects nested up to four layers deep. Observe
a specific key path if you need to observe changes on more deeply nested 
objects.

In the following example, we watch for updates to the nested property 
``members.age``. Note that the SDK reports the change to the top-level 
``members`` property, even though we're watching for changes to a nested 
property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.nested-keypath-listener.kt
   :language: kotlin

Observe Key Paths with Wildcards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use wildcards (``*``) to observe changes to all key paths at the 
level of the wildcard.

In the following example, we use the wildcard watch for changes to any nested 
properties one level deep within the ``members`` property. Based on the model
used in this example, this change listener would report changes to any member's
``age``, ``species``, or ``name`` properties. Note that the SDK reports the 
change to the top-level ``members`` property, even though we're watching for 
changes to a nested property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/NotificationsTest.snippet.wildcard-keypath-listener.kt
   :language: kotlin

Unsubscribe a Change Listener
-----------------------------

Unsubscribe from your change listener when you no longer want to receive notifications on updates to the data it's watching. To unsubscribe a change listener, `cancel the enclosing coroutine <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/cancellation-and-timeouts.html>`__.
