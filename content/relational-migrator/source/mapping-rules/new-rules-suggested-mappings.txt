{+rel-mig+} can automatically suggest mapping rules based upon 
your relational schema. Using suggested mappings can help you develop 
your MongoDB data model faster.

About this Task
---------------

In the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, you have the option to either apply all the suggested 
mapping rules, choose specific suggestions individually, or ignore all of the 
suggested mapping rules. The :guilabel:`Suggested mappings` button remains visible, 
allowing you to modify your selection at a later point.

Before you Begin
----------------

- You need to enable :guilabel:`Suggested mappings` from the :guilabel:`Project Settings`. 
  If you created a project with a recommended schema, the suggested mappings 
  feature is disabled by default.

- In order for {+rel-mig+} to generate suggested mappings for a specific 
  table, you need to create a :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>` 
  mapping rule that maps the table to a collection. You can then select that 
  collection to see the suggested mapping rules.

Steps
-----

1. On the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click one of the following:

   - A MongoDB collection on the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane.

   - A collection on the MongoDB side of the project diagram.

#. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane on the right-hand side of the screen, click 
   the :guilabel:`Suggested mappings` button.
   
   The suggested mapping rules are generated from your relational schema.

   .. note::

      The suggested mapping rules display with a blue rectangle in the MongoDB diagram. 
      These mapping rules are not added to your project until you click the 
      :guilabel:`Apply` button.

#. Deselect the suggested mapping rules you do not want applied to your MongoDB schema.

   If you do not want to use any of the suggested mapping rules, click the 
   :guilabel:`Ignore` button to at the bottom :guilabel:`Mappings` pane. 

#. Click the green :guilabel:`Apply` button at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Mappings` 
   pane.

   The suggested mapping rules are added to your project.
