Behavior
--------

A role's privileges apply to the database where the role is created. The
role can inherit privileges from other roles in its database. A role
created on the ``admin`` database can include privileges that apply to all
databases or to the :ref:`cluster <resource-cluster>` and can inherit
privileges from roles in other databases.

Required Access
---------------

.. include:: /includes/access-create-role.rst

Example
-------

The following :dbcommand:`createRole` command creates the
``myClusterwideAdmin`` role on the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ createRole: "myClusterwideAdmin",
     privileges: [
       { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "addShard" ] },
       { resource: { db: "config", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "update", "insert", "remove" ] },
       { resource: { db: "users", collection: "usersCollection" }, actions: [ "update", "insert", "remove" ] },
       { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find" ] }
     ],
     roles: [
       { role: "read", db: "admin" }
     ],
     writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
   })
