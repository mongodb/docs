title: Stop a secondary.
stepnum: 1
ref: stop-a-secondary
pre: |
  In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: db.shutdownServer()

title: Restart the secondary as a standalone on a different port.
stepnum: 2
ref: restart-diff-port
pre: |
  At the operating system shell prompt restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  as a standalone instance, making
  the following modifications to the configuration file.

  - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.
  - For :term:`shard` or :term:`config server` replica sets, comment out
    the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option.
  - Change the :setting:`net.port` to a different port. Make a note
    of the original port setting as a comment.

  If using command line options, modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` 
  and remove the :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`, 
  :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>`, and
  :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` options.

  Always start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the same user, even when
  restarting a replica set member as a standalone instance.

title: Perform maintenance operations on the secondary.
stepnum: 3

pre: |
  While the member is a standalone, use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
  perform maintenance:
action:
  language: sh
  code: mongo --port 37017

title: Restart ``mongod`` as a member of the replica set.
stepnum: 4
ref: restart
pre: |
  After performing all maintenance tasks, use the following procedure
  to restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a member of the replica set
  on its usual port.
action:
  - pre: |
      From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, shut down the standalone
      server after completing the maintenance:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       use admin
       db.shutdownServer()
  - pre: |
      Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a member of
      the replica set using its normal configuration file or 
      command-line arguments.

      When it has started, connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
      restarted instance.

  - pre: |
      The secondary takes time to :doc:`catch up to the primary
      </core/replica-set-sync>`. From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the
      following command to verify that the member has caught up from the
      :replstate:`RECOVERING` state to the :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.
    language: javascript
    code: rs.status()

title: Perform maintenance on the primary last.
stepnum: 5
ref: maintenance-on-primary
pre: |
  To perform maintenance on the primary after completing maintenance
  tasks on all secondaries, use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to step down the primary and allow one of
  the secondaries to be elected the new primary. Specify a 300 second
  waiting period to prevent the member from being elected primary again
  for five minutes:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: rs.stepDown(300)
post: |
  After the primary steps down, the replica set will elect a new
  primary. See :ref:`replica-set-elections` for more
  information about replica set elections.

  Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a standalone instance, making
  the following modifications to the configuration file.

  - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.
  - For :term:`shard` or :term:`config server` replica sets, comment out
    the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole`.

  If using command line options, modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` 
  and remove the :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`, 
  :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>`, and
  :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` options.

  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a member of the replica set
  using its normal command-line arguments or configuration file.
