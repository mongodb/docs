  To change when the Balancer runs:

  a. Click the :icon:`pencil` to the right of
     :guilabel:`Schedule the Balancer`.
  #. In the :guilabel:`Start` box, type the time when the window
     should begin using 
     `24-hour time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock?oldid=856643144>`__.
  #. In the :guilabel:`Stop` box, type the time when the window should
     end using `24-hour time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock?oldid=856643144>`__.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  .. note::

     Values for :guilabel:`Start` and :guilabel:`Stop` can be between
     ``00:00`` and ``23:59``, but :guilabel:`Stop` can be a value that
     is earlier than :guilabel:`Start`. If :guilabel:`Stop` is earlier
     than :guilabel:`Start`, then :guilabel:`Stop` is treated as being
     on the next day.

     .. example::

        If you want your migration window to be between 11:00 pm and
        2:00 am, you would set :guilabel:`Start` to ``23:00`` and
        :guilabel:`Stop` to ``02:00`` the next day.
