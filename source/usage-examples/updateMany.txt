You can update multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``update()`` method
on a query builder.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method to retrieve documents that meet a
set of criteria. Then, update the matching documents by passing your intended
document changes to the ``update()`` method.

.. tip::

   To learn more about updating data with the {+odm-short+}, see the :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-modify-documents`
   section of the Write Operations guide.

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database 
      - Updates documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of updated documents
      
      The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``imdb.rating`` nested field is greater than ``9.0``
      - ``update()``: Updates the matching documents by adding an
        ``acclaimed`` field and setting its value to ``true``, then
        returns the number of updated documents
      
      .. io-code-block::

         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/UpdateManyTest.php
            :start-after: begin-eloquent-update-many
            :end-before: end-eloquent-update-many
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Updated documents: 20

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Updates documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of updated documents

      The example calls the following query builder methods:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``imdb.rating`` nested field is greater than ``9.0``
      - ``update()``: Updates the matching documents by adding an
        ``acclaimed`` field and setting its value to ``true``, then
        returns the number of updated documents
      
      .. io-code-block::
      
         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/UpdateManyTest.php
            :start-after: begin-qb-update-many
            :end-before: end-qb-update-many
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false

            Updated documents: 20
