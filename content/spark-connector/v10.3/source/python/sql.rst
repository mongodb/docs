Before you can run SQL queries against your DataFrame, you need to
register a temporary table.

The following example registers a temporary table called ``temp``,
then uses SQL to query for records in which the ``type`` field
contains the letter ``e``:

.. code-block:: python

   df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp")
   some_fruit = spark.sql("SELECT type, qty FROM temp WHERE type LIKE '%e%'")
   some_fruit.show()

In the ``pyspark`` shell, the operation prints the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   +------+----+
   |  type| qty|
   +------+----+
   | apple| 5.0|
   |orange|10.0|
   +------+----+
