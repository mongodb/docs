  After performing all maintenance tasks, use the following procedure
  to restart the :program:`mongod` as a member of the replica set
  on its usual port.

      From the :program:`mongo` shell, shut down the standalone server:
    language: javascript
    code: db.shutdownServer()

      Restart the :program:`mongod` instance as a member of
      the replica set using its normal command-line arguments or
      configuration file.

      The secondary takes time to :doc:`catch up to the primary
      </core/replica-set-sync>`. From the :program:`mongo` shell, use the
      following command to verify that the member has caught up from the
      :replstate:`RECOVERING` state to the :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.
    language: javascript
    code: rs.status()

  To perform maintenance on the primary after completing maintenance
  tasks on all secondaries, use :method:`rs.stepDown` in the
  :program:`mongo` shell to step down the primary and allow one of
  the secondaries to be elected the new primary. Specify a 300 second
  waiting period to prevent the member from being elected primary again
  for five minutes:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: rs.stepDown(300)
post: |
  Once the primary steps down, the replica set elects a new primary,
  as described in :doc:`/core/replica-set-elections`.

  Repeat these steps, starting with :ref:`stop-a-secondary`, to perform
  maintenance on the new secondary.
