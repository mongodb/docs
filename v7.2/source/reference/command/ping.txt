.. dbcommand:: ping

   The :dbcommand:`ping` command is a no-op used to test whether a
   server is responding to commands. This command will return
   immediately even if the server is write-locked:

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        ping: 1 
      }
   )

The value (e.g. ``1`` above) does not impact the behavior of the
command.
