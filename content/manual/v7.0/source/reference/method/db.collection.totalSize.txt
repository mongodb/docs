.. method:: db.collection.totalSize()

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :data:`~collStats.totalSize` field returned by the
      :dbcommand:`collStats` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt

   :returns: The total size in bytes of the data in the collection plus
             the size of every index on the collection.
             
             If collection data is compressed (which is the
             :option:`default for WiredTiger <mongod
             --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor>`), the returned
             size reflects the compressed size of the collection data.

             If an index uses prefix compression (which is the
             :option:`default for WiredTiger <mongod
             --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the returned size
             reflects the compressed size of the index.

   The value returned is the sum of
   :method:`db.collection.storageSize()` and
   :method:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` in bytes.
