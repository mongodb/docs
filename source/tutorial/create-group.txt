============
Create Group
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You associate specific users, servers, and agents to a given group.
When you create a new group, you are automatically added as a user to
the new group.

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and
cannot monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a
new group. Having a second group makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second group and agent to monitor a different set
of MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate
the hosts within the MMS console. A user can only view data from the
hosts monitored in a single group at once.

After adding a second group, the MMS interface will have a drop down list
that will allow you to change groups. Selecting a new group will
refresh the current page with the data available from the servers in
this group.
