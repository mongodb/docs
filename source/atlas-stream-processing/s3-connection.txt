   S3 sink connections are available as a Private Preview feature. The
   feature and the corresponding documentation might change at any
   time during the Private Preview period. To learn more, see `Preview
   Features <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/preview-features/>`__. 

{+atlas-sp+} supports only sink connections to {+aws+} |s3| buckets.

Add an {+aws+} S3 Connection
--------------------------------------------------------------

To add an S3 connection to your {+spi+}'s connection registry:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up Unified AWS Access.

      Follow the procedure described in :ref:`Set Up Unified AWS
      Access <set-up-unified-aws-access>`.

      Ensure that you grant your IAM role ``ListAllMyBuckets`` and
      ``PutObject`` permissions.

      Note the ARN value in ``Statement.Principal.AWS`` for later in this
      procedure.

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-access-manager

   .. step:: Create an API key.

      The :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Connection
      </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>` API endpoint
      requires digest authorization when creating an S3 Connection. To
      support this, you must create an API Key.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Project Access Manager`, select the
         :guilabel:`Applications` tab, then click :guilabel:`API Keys`.

      b. Click :guilabel:`Create API Key`. Provide a short description
         for the key.

      c. In the :guilabel:`Project Permissions` dropdown menu,
         select both the :guilabel:`Project Stream Processing Owner` and
         :guilabel:`Project Owner` roles. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

      d. Save both the public and private keys for later in this procedure.

   .. step:: Create the S3 Connection.

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint to
      :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Connection
      </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>`. You must send this
      request using digest authorization.

      In your HTTP request interface, enable digest authorization. For
      the ``username``, provide the public key you generated
      previously. For the ``password``, provide the private key you
      generated previously.

      For an {+aws+} |s3| connection, set the following key-value pairs:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 35 65
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Value

         * - ``type``
	   - ``"S3"``

         * - ``aws.roleArn``
	   - Value of the ARN noted in an earlier step.

Supported Aggregation Behavior
------------------------------

{+aws+} |s3| sink connections support only the ``$emit`` stage, not
the ``$merge`` stage. For more information, see :ref:`$emit
<atlas-sp-agg-emit>`.
