Configure a Highly Available MMS Application Server
===================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The On-Prem MMS Application Server provides high availability through
horizontal scaling and through use of a :term:`replica sets <replica set>`
for the :doc:`backing MongoDB instance
</tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` that hosts the :ref:`MMS
Application Database <mms-application-database>`.

Horizontal Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MMS Application Servers are stateless between requests. Any server can
handle requests as long as all the servers read from the same backing
MongoDB instance. If one Application Server becomes unavailable, another
fills requests.

To take advantage of this for high availability, configure a load balancer
to balance between the pool of MMS Application Servers. Use the load
balancer of your choice. Configure each Application Serverâ€™s
``conf-mms.properties`` file to point its ``mms.centralUrl`` property to
the load balancer. The ``mms.remoteIp.header`` property, also in the
``conf-mms.properties`` file, should be configured to HTTP header set by the load
balacer that contains the orginal client's IP address (i.e. X-Forwarded-For).
The load balancer then  manages the :ref:`MMS HTTP Service <mms-http-service>`
and :ref:`Backup HTTP Service <backup-http-service>` that runs on each
Application Server.

Replica Set for the Backing Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy a :term:`replica set` rather than a standalone as the :doc:`backing
MongoDB instance </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` for
monitoring. Replica sets have automatic :manual:`failover
</core/replica-set-high-availability>` if the :term:`primary` becomes
unavailable.

When deploying a replica set with members in multiple facilities, ensure
that a single facility has enough votes to elect a :term:`primary` if
needed. Choose the facility that hosts the core application systems. Place
a majority of voting members and all the members that can become primary
in this facility. Otherwise, network partitions could prevent the set from
being able to form a majority. For details on how replica sets elect
primaries, see :manual:`Replica Set Elections
</core/replica-set-elections>`.

You can create backups the replica set using :manual:`file system
snapshots </tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots>`. File system
snapshots use system-level tools to create copies of the device that holds
replica set's data files.

Prerequisites
-------------

Deploy a replica set for the :doc:`backing instance
</tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` for the :ref:`MMS
Application Database <mms-application-database>`. To deploy a replica set,
see :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`.
