You must create a database user to access your cluster. For
security purposes, |govcloud-short| requires clients to authenticate as 
MongoDB database users to access clusters.

Database users are separate from |govcloud-short| users:

- Database users can access databases hosted in |govcloud-short|.

- |govcloud-short| users can log in to |govcloud| but do not have 
  access to MongoDB databases.

Cloud for Government Considerations
-----------------------------------

- Database users who authenticate with 
  :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` must use ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

Procedure
---------

To add a database user to your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-mongodb-user.rst

.. seealso:: |service| documentation

   To learn more about configuring additional database users on your
   cluster, see :atlas:`Configure Database Users </security-add-mongodb-users/>`.

Next steps
----------

Now that you have a database user for your cluster, proceed to 
:ref:`Connect to Your Cluster <connect-to-cluster>`.
