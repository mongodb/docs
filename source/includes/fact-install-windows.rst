In Windows Explorer, locate the downloaded MongoDB ``.msi`` file, which
typically is located in the default ``Downloads`` folder. Double-click
the ``.msi`` file. A set of screens will appear to guide you through the
installation process.

You may specify an installation directory if you choose the "Custom"
installation option.

.. note::

   These instructions assume that you have installed MongoDB
   to ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\``.

During the installation process you will be given the option to install
:ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>` in addition to MongoDB Server.

MongoDB is self-contained and does not have any other system
dependencies. You can run MongoDB from any folder you choose. You may
install MongoDB in any folder (e.g. ``D:\test\mongodb``).
