title: Fork the Community Repository.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: snip-step-fork-the-repo
content: |

   If you plan to contribute to the community repository, fork the
   snippets `project repository 
   <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets>`__. 
   
   You do not have to fork the community repository if you want to
   create a private repo, but you should manually recreate a
   similar directory structure as you work through the following
   steps.
---

title: Create a Package Directory.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: snip-step-create-directory
content: |

   Create a directory for your snippet package under the ``snippets``
   directory in the forked repository. This directory will
   contain the code for your script and several metadata files. 

   This example shows directories for two snippet packages,
   ``decrypt-cards`` and ``update-auth``. The contents of the
   `community snippets
   <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/tree/main/snippets>`__
   directories are omitted for clarity.

title: Create ``README.md``.
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: snip-step-readme
content: |

   Create a ``README.md``. The ``README.md`` describes how to use your
   code. This file is displayed when a user enters ``snippet help`` for
   your snippet.
---

title: Create ``LICENSE``.
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: snip-step-license
content: |

   Create a ``LICENSE`` file. You will need to enter a license
   identifier string later, so try to chose a license from the
   `SPDX license list <https://www.npmjs.com/package/spdx>`__.
---

title: Create ``index.js``.
stepnum: 5
level: 4
ref: snip-step-index.js
content: |

   Create an ``index.js`` file. 

   - This file contains the entry point to your code that is exposed in
     the :binary:`~bin.mongosh` console.
   - The script is written in JavaScript and defines your new functions.
   - The script can be in a single file or multiple files.
   - The script can call other files and local or remote npm modules.
     To ``require()`` a remote npm module use the construction: 

     .. code-block:: javascript

        const localRequire = require('module').createRequire(__filename);)

     For an example, see
     `index.js <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/blob/main/snippets/resumetoken/index.js>`__
     in the ``resumetoken`` snippet.
   - ``index.js`` is referenced in :ref:`package.json <snip-prep-package.json>`. 
   - The MongoDB repository has `example code
     <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets>`__.

   .. tip::

      If you have an existing script, either rename it ``index.js`` or
      create an ``index.js`` file to load it. For an example of an
      ``index.js`` file that loads other scripts, see `this one
      <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/blob/main/snippets/mongocompat/index.js>`__
      in the `community repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets>`__.
