.. note::

   The {+stable-api+} feature requires {+mdb-server+} 5.0 or later.

   You should use the {+stable-api+} feature only if all of the MongoDB
   servers you're connecting to support this feature.

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify **{+stable-api+}** compatibility when 
connecting to a MongoDB instance or replica set.

The {+stable-api+} feature forces the server to run operations with behaviors compatible 
with the API version you specify. When you update either your driver or server, 
the API version changes, which can change the way these operations behave.
Using the {+stable-api+} ensures consistent responses from the server and 
provides long-term API stability for your application.

The following sections describe how you can enable and customize {+stable-api+} for
your MongoDB client. For more information about the {+stable-api+}, including a list of 
the commands it covers, see the :manual:`MongoDB reference page. </reference/stable-api/>`

Enable the {+stable-api+} on a MongoDB Client
---------------------------------------------

To enable the {+stable-api+}, you must specify an API version in the settings
of your MongoDB client. Once you instantiate a ``MongoClient`` instance with
a specified API version, all commands you run with the client use that
version of the {+stable-api+}.

.. tip::

   Once you've created a ``MongoClient``, you can't change its {+stable-api+} version.  
   If you need to run commands using more than one version of the 
   {+stable-api+}, instantiate a separate client with that version.

   If you need to run commands not covered by the {+stable-api+}, make sure the
   "strict" option is disabled. See the section on
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} Options <stable-api-options>` for more information.

The following example shows how you can instantiate a ``MongoClient`` with a {+stable-api+} version and connect to a server through the following operations:

1. Construct a ``ServerApi`` instance and specify a {+stable-api+} version.
#. Construct a ``MongoClientSettings`` object and set the ``ServerApi`` property.
#.  Create a ``MongoClient`` with the ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

.. warning::

   If you specify an API version and connect to a MongoDB server that does
   not support the {+stable-api+}, your code might raise an exception when
   executing a command on your MongoDB server. If you use a ``MongoClient``
   that specifies the API version to query a server that doesn't support that version,
   your query could fail with an exception message that includes the
   following text:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      Unrecognized field 'apiVersion' on server...

{+stable-api+} Options
--------------------------

You can use the options in the following table to customize the behavior of the 
{+stable-api+}.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 25,75

   * - Option Name
     - Description

   * - Strict
     - | **Optional**. When ``true``, if you call a command that is not part of 
         the declared API version, the driver raises an exception.
       |
       | Default: **false**

   * -  DeprecationErrors
     - | **Optional**. When ``true``, if you call a command that is deprecated in the 
         declared API version, the driver raises an exception.
       |
       | Default: **false**

The following example shows how you can set these options when constructing a 
``ServerApi`` object:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/StableApi.cs
   :start-after: start-stable-api-options
   :end-before: end-stable-api-options
