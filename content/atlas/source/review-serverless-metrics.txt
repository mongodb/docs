To view the metrics for a specific |service| 
:ref:`{+Serverless-instance+} <ref-deployment-types>`:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: View metrics.

      Do one of the following steps:
        
      - Click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for the 
        {+Serverless-instance+}. 
        
      - Click the name of the {+Serverless-instance+} to open 
        the overview, then click :guilabel:`Monitoring` and the 
        :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

Chart Controls
--------------
       
|service| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Metric` 
view. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under 
the :guilabel:`Metrics` view:
       
.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1
       
   * - Control
     - Function
        
   * - :guilabel:`Granularity`

     - Modifies the granularity of metrics displayed for each chart.
       Select a granularity, usually between 1 minute and 1 day (24 
       hours). Select ``Auto`` to automatically adjust the granularity 
       based on the selected :guilabel:`Zoom` or 
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date controls. ``Auto`` granularity 
       selects the highest fidelity granularity available for the time 
       range.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-10-second-granularity.rst
        
   * - :guilabel:`Zoom`

     - Modifies the date range of metrics displayed for each chart. 
       Select a zoom range between 1 hour and 5 years. Adjusting
       the :guilabel:`Zoom` automatically adjusts the
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date range. 
        
   * - :guilabel:`Filter by time range`

     - Modifies the start and end date-time range of metrics displayed 
       for each chart. Modifying the start and end date sets the 
       value of :guilabel:`Zoom` to ``custom`` and overrides the
       previously selected zoom level.

   * - :guilabel:`Add Chart`

     - Select one or more charts to display or hide.
  
   * - :guilabel:`Group Opcounters metrics`

     - Directs |service| to group the individual components of the 
       :guilabel:`Opcounters` chart.
       
Chart Display
-------------
      
When viewing charts, you can do the following:
      
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65
   
   * - Task
     - Action

   * - View a detailed description of a chart.

     - Hover your mouse over the chart to display the context menu.

       Click :icon-fa4:`info` next to the chart name to open the
       :guilabel:`Chart Info` modal. This modal includes a breakdown
       of the chart's data series, the annotations available for
       that chart, and the operations the chart supports.

   * - Zoom in on a period of time.

     - Click and drag the mouse pointer over a portion of the chart.

       To reset to the originally selected range (zoom out), 
       double-click the chart.

       When you zoom in on one period of time, the
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date range in the chart control
       section automatically updates to reflect the selected period.

   * - View statistics at a particular time.

     - Hover the mouse pointer over a point on the chart.

   * - Move a chart.

       tile view.
