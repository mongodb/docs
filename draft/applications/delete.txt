Delete operation removes documents from a :term:`collection`. MongoDB
provides the :ref:`remove() <crud-delete-remove>` method to perform
delete operations.

Remove
------

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method is the method to
delete documents from a collection. The :method:`remove()
<db.collection.remove()>` method does not delete indexes.

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method has the
following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.delete( <query>, <justOne>)

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method is analogous to the
``SQL DELETE`` with the ``query`` argument analogous to the ``WHERE``
statement and the ``justOne`` argument analogous to the ``LIMIT 1``.

Consider the following examples that illustrate the usage of the
:method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method:

- If there is a ``query`` argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes from the collection all
  documents that match the ``query``.
  
  The following operation deletes all documents from the ``csbios``
  collection where the ``first`` field in the subdocument ``name``
  starts with ``G``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove( { 'name.first' : /^G/ } )

- If there is a ``query`` argument and there is a ``justOne`` argument,
  the :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes from
  the collection a single documents that match the ``query``.

  The following operation deletes a single documents from the
  ``csbios`` collection where the ``turing`` field equals
  ``true``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove( { turing: true }, 1 )

- If there is no ``query`` argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes all documents from a
  collection. The method does not remove the indexes on the collection
  nor does it :method:`drop` the collection.
  
  The following operation deletes all documents from the ``csbios``
  collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove()

Capped Collection

Isolation
~~~~~~~~~

If the ``query`` argument to the :method:`remove()
<db.collection.remove()>` method matches multiple documents in the
collection, the delete operation may interleave with other write
operations to that collection. For an unsharded collection, you have
the option to override this behavior with the :operator:`$atomic`
isolation operator, effectively isolating the delete operation and
blocking all other operations during the delete. To isolate the query,
include ``$atomic: 1`` in the ``query`` parameter as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.csbios.remove( { turing: true, $atomic: 1 } )
