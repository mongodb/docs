|service| displays existing snapshots for a given {+cluster+} on the 
:guilabel:`Snapshots` page. To view snapshots that |service| has 
already taken:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-details.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

Alternatively, to view a list of all ``M10+`` {+clusters+} with
{+cloud-backup+} enabled:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-details.rst

   .. step:: View the list of {+clusters+}.

      If you choose to retain backups from a {+cluster+} you
      terminate, they remain accessible here under their source 
      {+cluster+} name until they expire or you delete them.
