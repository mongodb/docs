Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform searches on your documents
by using the Atlas Search feature. The {+library-short+} allows you to
perform Atlas Search queries by using the :ref:`php-aggregation-builder-api`.

.. note:: Deployment Compatibility

   You can use the Atlas Search feature only when
   you connect to MongoDB Atlas clusters. This feature is not
   available for self-managed deployments.

To learn more about Atlas Search, see the :atlas:`Atlas Search Overview
</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/>`. The Atlas Search implementation
for the {+library-short+} internally uses the ``$search`` aggregation operator
to perform queries. To learn more about this operator, see the
:atlas:`$search </atlas-search/aggregation-stages/search/>` reference in
the Atlas documentation.

.. note:: Atlas Vector Search

   To perform searches on vector embeddings in MongoDB, you can use the
   Atlas Vector Search API. To learn about this feature, see
   the :ref:`php-vector-search` guide.

Atlas Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can perform Atlas Search queries, you must create an Atlas
Search index on your collection. To learn more about creating this index
type, see the :ref:`php-atlas-search-index` guide.

Search Aggregation Stage
------------------------

Import the following classes into your application to perform Atlas
Search queries by using the Aggregation Builder:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/atlas-search.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-imports
   :end-before: end-imports

To create a ``$search`` stage in your aggregation pipeline, perform the
following actions:

1. Create a ``Pipeline`` instance to store the pipeline stages.

#. Call the ``Stage::search()`` method to create the Atlas Search stage.

#. Within the body of the ``search()`` method, use methods from the
   ``Search`` builder class to construct your Search query criteria.

The following code demonstrates the template for constructing basic Atlas Search
queries:

.. code-block:: php

   $pipeline = new Pipeline(
       Stage::search(
           /* Atlas Search query specifications
           Search::compound(...) */
       ),
   );

Atlas Search Query Examples
---------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to perform different types of Atlas
Search queries by using the Aggregation Builder. The examples in this
section use sample data from the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants``
collection.

Compound Query with Filter 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``Search::compound()`` method to combine two or more operators
into a single query. This method takes named arguments for your clauses,
such as ``must`` and ``filter``. In each clause, use the
``Search::text()`` method to specify the strings to look for when
performing the full-text search.

This example performs an Atlas Search query that has the following
specifications:

- Includes a ``must`` clause to search the ``name`` field for the string
  ``"kitchen"``
- Includes a ``should`` clause to highly rank documents in which the
  ``cuisine`` field includes ``"american"``
- Includes a ``filter`` field to include only documents in which the
  ``borough`` value is ``"Queens"`` in the results

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/atlas-search.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-compound-search-query
      :end-before: end-compound-search-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {"_id":...,"borough":"Queens","cuisine":"American","name":"Kitchen Door"}
      {"_id":...,"borough":"Queens","cuisine":"American","name":"Cc Kitchen"}
      {"_id":...,"borough":"Queens","cuisine":"American","name":"Suite Kitchen"}
      // Results truncated

Autocomplete Query 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+library-short+} provides the ``Search::autocomplete()`` method to run
autocomplete searches on documents in your collections.

To learn more about this type of Atlas Search query, see the
:atlas:`autocomplete </atlas-search/autocomplete/>` reference in the
Atlas documentation.

.. note::

   Your Atlas Search index must be configured for autocomplete queries.
   To learn more, see :atlas:`How to Index Fields for Autocompletion 
   </atlas-search/field-types/autocomplete-type/>` in the Atlas
   documentation.

The following code performs an Atlas Search autocomplete query for the
string ``"Lucy"`` on the ``name`` field:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/atlas-search.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-autocomplete-search-query
      :end-before: end-autocomplete-search-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false
      
      {"name":"Juicy Lucy"}
      {"name":"Lucy'S Vietnamese Kitchen"}
      {"name":"Lucy'S Cantina Royale"}
      // Results Truncated

You can also pass the following optional parameters to the ``autocomplete()``
method to customize the query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``fuzzy``
     - Enables fuzzy search and fuzzy search options
     - ``false``

   * - ``tokenOrder``
     - Specifies order in which to search for tokens
     - ``'any'``

To learn more about these parameters, see the :atlas:`Options
</atlas-search/autocomplete/#options>` section of the
``autocomplete`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.

Search Options
--------------

You can use the ``search()`` method to perform many types of Atlas
Search queries. Depending on your desired query, you can pass the
following optional parameters to ``search()``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``index``
     - ``string``
     - Provides the name of the Atlas Search index to use

   * - ``highlight``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies highlighting options for displaying search terms in their
       original context

   * - ``concurrent``
     - ``bool``
     - Parallelizes search query across segments on dedicated search nodes

   * - ``count``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies the count options for retrieving a count of the results

   * - ``searchAfter``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies a reference point for returning documents starting
       immediately following that point

   * - ``searchBefore``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies a reference point for returning documents starting
       immediately preceding that point

   * - ``scoreDetails``
     - ``bool``
     - Specifies whether to retrieve a detailed breakdown of the score
       for results

   * - ``sort``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies the fields on which to sort the results

   * - ``returnStoredSource``
     - ``bool``
     - Specifies whether to perform a full document lookup on the
       backend database or return only stored source fields directly
       from Atlas Search

   * - ``tracking``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies the tracking option to retrieve analytics information
       on the search terms

To learn more about these parameters, see the :atlas:`Fields
</atlas-search/aggregation-stages/search/#fields>` section of the
``$search`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.
