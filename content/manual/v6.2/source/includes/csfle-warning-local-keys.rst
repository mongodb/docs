.. warning:: Do Not Use the Local Key Provider in Production

   The Local Key Provider is an insecure method of storage and is
   **not recommended** for production. Instead,
   you should store your {+cmk-long+}s in a remote
   :wikipedia:`{+kms-long+} <Key_management#Key_management_system>`
   (KMS).

   To learn how to use a remote KMS in your {+csfle-abbrev+} implementation,
   see the :ref:`<csfle-tutorial-automatic-encryption>` guide.
