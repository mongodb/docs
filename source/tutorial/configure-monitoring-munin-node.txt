=================================================
Configure Hardware Monitoring with ``munin-node``
=================================================

Overview
--------

To chart the hardware statistics collected
with `Munin <http://munin-monitoring.org/>`_, MMS supports the
following `munin-node <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munin-node>`_
plugins:

- ``cpu`` plugin, which creates the ``cputime`` chart.

- ``iostat`` plugin, which creates the ``iostat`` chart.

- ``iostat_ios`` plugin, which creates the ``iotime`` chart.

Install the ``munin-node`` Package
----------------------------------

You
must install the ``munin-node`` package on all of the host systems that
you wish to monitor. Ensure that the Monitoring Agent can connect to the
``munin-node`` process on port 4949 of the monitored host to collect data.

.. note::

   ``munin-node``, and hardware monitoring is only available for
   MongoDB instances running on Linux hosts.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, issue the following command to install
``munin-node``:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install munin-node

To install ``munin-node`` on Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora systems, issue
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install munin-node

.. note::

   For Red Hat and CentOS 6.8 systems, you will need to install the
   EPEL repository **before** installing ``munin-node``. To install the
   EPEL repository, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Configure ``munin-node``
------------------------

When installation is complete, ensure that ``munin-node``:

- is running. Use the command, "``ps -ef | grep "munin"``" to confirm. If
  the process is not running, issue the command
  "``/etc/init.d/munin-node start``".

- will start following the next system reboot. This is the default
  behavior on most Debian-based systems. Red Hat and related
  distributions should use the "``chkconfig``" command, to configure
  this behavior (i.e. "``chkconfig munin-node on``")

- is accessible from the system running the agent. ``munin-node`` uses
  port 4949, which needs to be open on the monitored system, so the
  agent can access this data source. Use the following procedure to
  test access:

  .. code-block:: sh

     telnet [HOSTNAME] 4949
     fetch iostat
     fetch iostat_ios
     fetch cpu

  Replace ``[HOSTNAME]`` with the hostname of the monitored
  system. Run these commands from the system where the Monitoring Agent is
  running. If these "``fetch``" commands return data, then
  ``munin-node`` is running and accessible by the Monitoring Agent.

.. note::

   On some platforms, ``munin-node`` does not have all required
   plugins enabled.

   For CentOS and Ubuntu, the ``munin-node`` package does not have the ``iostat``
   and ``iostat_ios`` plugins enabled. Use the following operation to enable
   these plugins:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/iostat /etc/munin/plugins/iostat
      sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/iostat_ios /etc/munin/plugins/iostat_ios
      sudo /etc/init.d/munin-node restart

If ``munin-node`` is running but inaccessible, make sure that you have
access granted for the system running the Monitoring Agent and that no
firewalls block the port between ``munin-node`` and the Monitoring
Agent. You may find the ``munin-node`` configuration at
``/etc/munin-node/munin-node.conf``, ``/etc/munin/munin-node.conf``, or ``/etc/munin-node.conf``,
depending on your distribution.

Additional Considerations for ``munin-node``
--------------------------------------------

- If you have numbered disk devices (e.g. ``/dev/sda1`` and
  ``/dev/sda2``) then you will need to configure support for numbered
  disk in the munin iostat plugin. Find the configuration file at
  ``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node`` or a similar path, and add
  the following value:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [iostat]
         env.SHOW_NUMBERED 1

- If you have Munin enabled and do not have ``iostat ios`` data in
  your Munin charts, your ``munin-node`` may not have write access to
  required state files in its ``munin/plugin-state/`` directory. See
  the ``munin-node`` plugin log (i.e. ``/var/log/munin/munin-node.log``
  or similar depending on your distribution) for more information.

  The full path of this state directory depends on the
  system, but is typically ``/var/lib/munin/plugin-state/``. Run the
  following command sequence to correct this issue:

  .. code-block:: sh

     touch /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/iostat-ios.state
     chown -R [username]:[group] /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/
     chmod -R 660 /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/

  Replace ``[username]`` and ``[group]`` with the username and group
  that the ``munin-node`` process runs with.

- Add the host running the Monitoring Agent to the *allow* directive in the
  ``/etc/munin-node/munin-node.conf`` file. The *allow* directive lists hosts
  allowed to query the munin-node process. Otherwise, traffic from the MMS host
  will be allowed via firewall but will not be collected by munin.

If you encounter any other problems, check the log files for ``munin-node`` to
ensure that there are no errors with Munin. ``munin-node`` writes logs files in
the ``/var/log/`` directory on the monitored system.
