You can associate custom metadata with each user of your App. For
example, you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or
any other information that you want to associate with the user.

You can source the metadata for a user from two sources:

- A collection in MongoDB Atlas that stores custom user data. You can
  associate each user with a document in the collection by their user
  ID. You can store arbitrary data in each document.

- An authentication provider. If the provider uses JSON Web Tokens, such
  as Google, Facebook, or a custom provider, you can define metadata
  fields in the provider configuration that associate data from the
  user's JWT with their user account.

.. _custom-user-data:

Custom User Data
----------------

You can store arbitrary data about your application users in a MongoDB
collection. Your App maps each user to a document in the collection by
querying a specific field for the user's ID. When a user authenticates,
your App looks up the user's data and includes it in their access token.

Consider a user with the ID ``"63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e"``. If your
custom user data collection was set up to store the user's ID in the
``userId`` field, the user would map to the following document:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   {
     "_id": "63ed2e4fb7f367c92578e526",
     "user_id": "63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e",
     "preferences": {
       "preferDarkMode": true
     },
     "dateOfBirth": "1989-03-11T00:00:00.000Z"
   }

When you use custom user data, keep the following things in mind:

- **Store One Document Per User**: Documents that contain user data must
  include the user's ID in a specific field. If multiple documents
  specify the same user's ID, App Services only exposes the data from
  the document that was inserted first.

- **Keep Custom User Data Small**: The user's full custom user document
  is included in their access token. In general, aim to keep custom user
  data documents small (say, less than 16KB). Other services might limit
  the HTTP header size, which means that larger custom user data objects
  can cause integration issues.

- **Custom Data May Be Stale**: A user's custom data is *sourced* from a
  MongoDB collection but is stored in and read from a user's
  authentication access token. If a user has a valid access token when
  the underlying document changes, their custom data in that session
  does not update until they refresh their access token or
  re-authenticate.

Create and Manage Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are responsible for managing documents in the custom user data
collection. Depending on your use case, you may:

- Automatically create a document for each user when they register for
  your application using a :ref:`user creation function
  <user-creation-function>`. This function runs before the user is
  issued an access token, so the data you add will be in the access
  token on their first login.

- Use an :ref:`authentication trigger <authentication-triggers>` to
  update a user's custom data when they register or log in and to delete
  their data if their account is deleted. Triggers run asynchronously
  and may finish after the user's access token is created.

- Use a :ref:`scheduled trigger <scheduled-triggers>` to periodically
  update or delete custom user data.

- Manually create, update, and delete documents in the collection using
  standard CRUD operations from a Function, an Atlas Device SDK, a MongoDB
  driver, or MongoDB Compass.

Secure Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your App's custom user data includes personal or private user
information, you should restrict access to the custom user data
collection. Consider using one of the following permission models to
restrict read and write access to privileged users only:

- A user may read or write their own custom user data document. Deny
  read and write access to all other documents.

  .. example::

     The following collection configuration has one role that grants a
     user read and write access to a document if and only if their ID is
     contained in the document's ``user_id`` field.

     .. code-block:: json
        :caption: A custom user data collection configuration

        {
          "database": "<Database Name>",
          "collection": "<Collection Name>",
          "roles": [
            {
              "name": "ThisUser",
              "apply_when": { "user_id": "%%user.id%%" },
              "insert": false,
              "read": true,
              "write": true,
              "search": false,
              "delete": false
            }
          ],
          "filters": []
        }

- No user may read or write any custom user data documents. Instead,
  use a system function to manage custom user data on behalf of users.

.. _user-creation-function:

User Creation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define a Function that runs every time a new user successfully
registers but before their new user account is created. If the function
throws or otherwise errors, the user account creation fails. This lets
you ensure that users always have custom data associated with them once
created.

The function receives a :ref:`user metadata object <user-objects>` as
its only argument. You can use this to create a new custom user data
document for the user.

.. code-block:: javascript

   exports = async function onUserCreation(user) {
     const customUserDataCollection = context.services
       .get("mongodb-atlas")
       .db("myapp")
       .collection("users");
     try {
       await customUserDataCollection.insertOne({
         // Save the user's account ID to your configured user_id_field
         user_account_id: user.id,
         // Store any other user data you want
         favorite_color: "blue",
       });
     } catch (e) {
       console.error(`Failed to create custom user data document for user:${user.id}`);
       throw e
     }
   }

.. tip::

   Once you've configured a user creation function, App Services
   prevents you from deleting the function. If you want to delete the
   function, first change your custom user data configuration to use a
   different user creation function.

Enable Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You can configure and enable custom user data in the App Services
      Admin UI.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Custom User Data Configuration Screen

            Click :guilabel:`App Users` in the left navigation menu.
            Then, select the :guilabel:`User Settings` tab and find the
            :guilabel:`Custom User Data` section.

         .. step:: Enable Custom User Data

            Click the :guilabel:`Enable Custom User Data` toggle to set
            it to :guilabel:`On`.

            .. figure:: /images/enable-custom-user-data-toggle-realm-ui.png

               :width: 750px
               :lightbox:

         .. step:: Specify the Custom User Data Collection

            You must store the custom data for your application's users in a
            single collection of a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. To configure your
            application to read user data from this collection, you need to
            specify the following values:

            - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`: The name of a :doc:`linked MongoDB cluster
              </mongodb>` that contains the custom user data collection.

            - :guilabel:`Database Name`: The name of the MongoDB database that
              contains the custom user data collection.

            - :guilabel:`Collection Name`: The name of the MongoDB collection that
              contains custom user data.

            .. figure:: /images/custom-user-data-config-realm-ui.png
               :alt: Input boxes for the collection and user id field in the App Services UI.
               :width: 750px
               :lightbox:

         .. step:: Specify the User ID Field

            Every document in the custom user data collection has a field that
            maps it to a specific application user. The field must be of type
            ``ObjectID`` or a ``string`` type that represents that ObjectID.
            This field must be present in every document that maps to a user.

            Specify the name of the field that contains each user's ID in the
            :guilabel:`User ID Field` input.

            .. note::

               If two documents contain the same user ID, one stored as a string
               and the other as an ObjectID, App Services
               maps the document with the string type to the user.

         .. step:: Define a User Creation Function (Optional)

            If you want to use a :ref:`user creation Function
            <user-creation-function>`, define it in the inline editor or
            reference an existing function by name.

         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Application

            Once you have configured the custom user data collection, you can
            make custom user data available to client applications by deploying
            your application. To deploy a draft application from the App Services UI:

            1. Click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the left navigation menu.

            2. Find the draft in the deployment history table and then click
               :guilabel:`Review & Deploy Changes`.

            3. Review the diff of changes and then click :guilabel:`Deploy`.

            Once the application successfully deploys, App Services begins to associate
            custom data with users. When a user logs in, App Services automatically
            queries the custom user data collection for a document where the
            specified :guilabel:`User ID Field` contains the user's ID. If a
            document matches, App Services exposes the data in the document in the
            ``custom_data`` field of that user's :ref:`user object
            <user-objects>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To define custom user data with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
            application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the App Services UI.

         .. step:: Configure Custom User Data

            You must store the custom data for your application's users in a single
            collection of a :ref:`linked Atlas cluster <link-a-data-source>`. Every
            document in the collection should include a specific field that contains the
            user ID of the App Services user that it describes.

            To configure your application to read user data from this collection, define a
            :ref:`custom user data configuration document <config-custom-user-data>` in
            the ``/auth/custom_user_data.json``:

            .. code-block:: javascript
               :caption: /auth/custom_user_data.json

               {
                 "enabled": <Boolean>,
                 "mongo_service_name": "<MongoDB Data Source Name>",
                 "database_name": "<Database Name>",
                 "collection_name": "<Collection Name>",
                 "user_id_field": "<User ID Field Name>",
                 "on_user_creation_function_name": "<Function Name>"
               }


         .. step:: Deploy the Custom User Data Configuration

            Once you've configured custom user data, you can push the updated config to
            your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the update on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

         .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

      .. step:: Configure Custom User Data

         Send a request to the :admin-api-endpoint:`Configure Custom
         User Data <operation/adminSetCustomUserDataConfig>`
         endpoint.

         Make sure to include your Admin API ``access_token``, the
         ``groupId`` of the Atlas project containing your App, and
         the App's internal ``appId`` hex string:

         .. code-block:: shell

            curl --request PATCH 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/custom_user_data' \
              --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
              --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
              --data '{
                "mongo_service_id": "<MongoDB Data Source ID>",
                "database_name": "<Database Name>",
                "collection_name": "<Collection Name>",
                "user_id_field": "<User ID Field Name>",
                "on_user_creation_function_id": "<User Creation Function ID>",
                "enabled": true
              }'

         If you successfully configure custom user data, App Services
         returns a ``204`` response.

Access Custom User Data from a Client Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code examples that demonstrate how to access and update custom user
data from the client application, see the documentation for the
Atlas Device SDKs:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-access-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Node SDK <node-access-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-access-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-custom-user-data>`
- :ref:`Web SDK <web-access-custom-user-data>`

Best Practices for Modifying Permissions in Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Permissions <permissions>` will automatically refresh for a user when you 
change their custom user data document. Their :ref:`user session <user-sessions>` 
will terminate and then refresh automatically. 

For user permissions to refresh automatically, the custom user data 
documents should be stored in a normal collection and
not in a :manual:`view </core/views/>` or :manual:`time series </core/timeseries-collections/>` collection. 

For permissions to refresh automatically, don't delete a custom user data document. 
Rather, unset all the non-ID fields in the document. 

.. example::

  Consider the following document where the user is assigned read and write
  permissions: 

  .. code-block:: json
    :caption: Custom user data document

    {
      "_id": "63ed2erealobjectid78e526",
      "user_id": "63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e",
      "canRead": true,
      "canWrite": true,
    }

  The ``canRead`` and ``canWrite`` fields can help determine the roles for this document's
  collection. For example, the ``canRead`` field is used to determine eligibility 
  for the following ``readAllRole`` in the ``apply_when`` expression: 

  .. code-block:: json
    :caption: Custom user data document

    {
      "name": "readAllRole"
      "apply_when": {"%%user.custom_data.canRead": true},
      ...
    }

  Say you would like to remove the user's document
  because they haven't been active for an extended period of time.
  First, you need to correctly remove the employee's permissions, by unsetting
  the non-ID fields. The document would then look like:

  .. code-block:: json
    :caption: Correctly updated custom user data document

    {
      "_id": "63ed2erealobjectid78e526",
      "user_id": "63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e"
    } 

  Unsetting the non-ID field allows App Services to automatically
  refresh the user's permissions according to the roles. 
  You can now safely delete the document if necessary.

.. _auth-provider-metadata:

Authentication Provider Metadata
--------------------------------

Atlas App Services can read user metadata from authentication providers. Then,
App Services exposes each user's data in a field of their :ref:`user
object <user-objects>`. For example, you might want to access a user's name,
email, birthday, or gender.

You can configure App Services to request metadata with the access token
when users log in. You can access that data from the logged-in user's
object with a client SDK.

You can define the metadata to request when you configure authentication
providers. Specify optional metadata fields that you want to access through
the user's account. These metadata fields vary depending on provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Provider
     - Metadata fields

   * - Facebook
     - - ``name``
       - ``first_name``
       - ``last_name``
       - ``picture``
       - ``gender``
       - ``birthday``
       - ``min_age``
       - ``max_age``
       - ``email``

   * - Google
     - - ``name``
       - ``first_name``
       - ``last_name``
       - ``picture``
       - ``email``

   * - Custom JWT
     - Any field in the JWT as specified by the Custom JWT provider's
       :ref:`metadata fields
       <custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields>`
       configuration.

.. important:: Avoid Stale Authentication Provider Metadata

  If a user's metadata is updated after the access token is issued, requests
  using the previously created access token will not have the newly
  updated metadata. Their user metadata will update when they refresh
  their access token or re-authenticate.

.. note:: Security and Authentication Provider Metadata

  Authentication provider metadata can be externally-defined by clients and
  external authentication providers and should be regarded with caution. You should
  not rely solely on authentication provider metadata for security-related
  decisions, such as using this metadata in rule expressions for data access
  permissions.

            **Custom JWT authentication**

            The metadata_fields array has an additional property, ``field_name``.
            In custom JWT authentication, ``name`` represents the path to the field.
            The ``field_name`` represents the name of the field.

.. note:: Tips for Users with Multiple Linked Authentication Providers

  - To ensure the most up-to-date metadata, users should re-authenticate after
    switching to a different authentication provider. Failure to do so may result
    in outdated metadata reflected in the :guilabel:`Users` table in
    the UI's :guilabel:`App Users` page and for requests using authentication providers.
  - If a user switches between authentication providers, it may take up to 30 minutes
    for metadata to propagate. The request is always guaranteed to have the
    most up-to-date metadata associated with the authentication provider used.

Access User Metadata from a Client Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code examples that demonstrate how to access user metadata
data from the client application, see the documentation for the Atlas Device SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-user-metadata>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-user-metadata>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-user-metadata>`
- :ref:`Node SDK <node-user-metadata>`
