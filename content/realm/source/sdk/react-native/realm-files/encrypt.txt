==================================
Encrypt a Realm - React Native SDK

You can encrypt the realm database file on disk with AES-256 +
SHA-2 by supplying a 64-byte encryption key when opening a realm.

Realm transparently encrypts and decrypts data with standard
:wikipedia:`AES-256 encryption <Advanced_Encryption_Standard>` using the
first 256 bits of the given 512-bit encryption key. Realm
uses the other 256 bits of the 512-bit encryption key to validate
integrity using a :wikipedia:`hash-based message authentication code
(HMAC) <HMAC>`.

.. note:: Cannot Encrypt an Existing Unencrypted Realm

    You must encrypt a realm the first time you open it. 
    If you try to open an existing unencrypted realm using a configuration
    that contains an encryption key, Realm throws an error.

The following code demonstrates how to generate an encryption key and
open an encrypted realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/encrypted-realm.test.snippet.encrypted-realm.tsx
   :language: typescript

The following are key impacts to consider when encrypting a realm.

Store & Reuse Keys
----------------------

You **must** pass the same encryption key every time you open the encrypted realm.
If you don't provide a key or specify the wrong key for an encrypted
realm, the Realm SDK throws an error.

Apps should store the encryption key securely, typically in the target
platform's secure key/value storage, so that other apps cannot read the key.

Performance Impact
------------------

Reads and writes on encrypted realms can be up to 10% slower than unencrypted realms.

Encryption and Atlas Device Sync
--------------------------------

You can encrypt a :ref:`synced realm <react-native-open-a-synced-realm>`.

.. include:: /includes/encrypt-atlas-device-sync.rst

If you need unique keys for each user of your application, you can use an OAuth provider or
use one of the :ref:`Realm authentication providers <users-and-authentication>`
and an :ref:`authentication trigger<authentication-triggers>`
to create a 64-bit key and store that key in a :ref:`user object <user-objects>`.

Access an Encrypted Realm from Multiple Processes
-------------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: ``realm@11.8.0``

Starting with Realm React Native SDK version v11.8.0, Realm supports opening
the same encrypted realm in multiple processes.

If your app uses Realm React Native SDK version v11.7.0 or earlier, attempting to 
open an encrypted realm from multiple processes throws this error:
``Encrypted interprocess sharing is currently unsupported.``

Encrypt App Services App Metadata
---------------------------------

If you use Atlas Device Sync with your realm, your App Services App uses an
on-device metadata file to determine changes that should sync.

You can encrypt this metadata file in a similar manner as encrypting your
realm.

To learn more, refer to :ref:`Encrypt App Metadata <react-native-encrypt-app-metadata>`.
