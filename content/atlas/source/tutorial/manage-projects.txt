Groups are now projects in the organizations and projects hierarchy.

You can create multiple projects in an organization.

.. include:: /includes/list-projects-hierarchy.rst

.. _create-project:

Create a Project
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a project for an organization, you must be either an
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or an
:authrole:`Organization Project Creator`.

When you create a project, you are added as an
:authrole:`Project Owner` for the project.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-create-new-project.rst
   
.. _view-projects:

View Projects
-------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view a project, you must either: 

- Be an :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner`
- Receive an :ref:`invitation <atlas_add_users>` that grants access to
  the project. An :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` can invite users to projects.

.. include:: /includes/fact-project-invite-deprecation.rst

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-view-projects-ui.rst

A {+bcp+} icon appears next to each project name that has a
:ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`.

.. _update-project:

Update a Project
----------------

You can update project details such as the project name and tags.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a project, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst

   .. step:: Update project details.

      You can update the project name and tags in the :guilabel:`Project Settings` page.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. _move-project:

Move a Project
--------------

When you move a project to another |service| organization, |service| 
copies the project users and their respective roles to the 
same project in the destination organization. However, |service| 
doesn't carry over teams assigned to the project because you define 
teams at the organization level. 

When you move projects across organizations, your changes take effect
immediately. The move doesn't:

- Impact cluster uptime or current cluster configuration. 
- Cause downtime for your {+database-deployment+} or changes to your
  connection string.

|service| carries over VPC peering connections and private endpoint 
configurations to the destination organization. You don't need to 
recreate them.

.. important::

   |service| removes existing API Keys after moving the project. You
   must :ref:`create a new API Key <create-project-api-key>`
   after moving the project.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To move a project to another |service| organization, you must be an
:authrole:`Organization Owner` for both the current and the destination
organization.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To move a project for an organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps-move-project.rst

.. _delete-project:

Delete a Project
----------------

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, you 
   can't delete the project if any snapshots exist.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To delete a project for an organization, you must either have the
  :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project or have the
  :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the project's organization.

- You must terminate any |service| Services apps and/or |charts| instances.

- The project has no outstanding invoices.

- The project has no active {+database-deployments+}.
  :ref:`Terminate active {+clusters+} <terminate-cluster>` or
  :ref:`{+Flex-clusters+} <terminate-flex-cluster>` in the project
  before you delete it.

- The project has no configured :ref:`private endpoint connections
  <private-endpoint>`.

- The project has no active :ref:`federated database instances  <atlas-data-federation>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

You can delete from the organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view
or the project's :guilabel:`Project Setting` view.

To delete a project from the organization's
:guilabel:`Projects` view:

.. include:: /includes/steps-delete-project.rst

To delete from the project's :guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

.. include:: /includes/steps-delete-project-from-settings.rst
