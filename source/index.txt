The {+atlas-cli+} is a command line interface built specifically for |service|. 
After you install and configure the {+atlas-cli+}, you can manage |service|
{+database-deployments+} from the terminal with:

- Short, intuitive commands. While you can use ``curl`` commands to access the
  |service| APIs from the terminal, {+atlas-cli+} commands are much shorter.
- Fewer system resources. Managing |service| from the terminal requires less
  available random access memory (RAM) and CPU processing time than the |service| UI.
