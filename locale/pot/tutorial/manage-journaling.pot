msgid "MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to guarantee :doc:`write operation </core/write-operations>` durability and to provide crash resiliency. Before applying a change to the data files, MongoDB writes the change operation to the journal. If MongoDB should terminate or encounter an error before it can write the changes from the journal to the data files, MongoDB can re-apply the write operation and maintain a consistent state."

msgid "With journaling enabled, if :program:`mongod` stops unexpectedly, the program can recover everything written to the journal, and the data remains in a consistent state. By default, the greatest extent of lost writes, i.e., those not made to the journal, are those made in the last 100 milliseconds. See :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more information on the default."
