Add a Member to a Shard

   :description: Add a member to a shard in a sharded cluster to increase redundancy and availability, ensuring the new member reaches the `SECONDARY` state before reconfiguring its priority and votes.

You can add members to an existing shard in a :term:`sharded cluster`.
You might want to add a member to a shard for the same reasons you'd 
want to add a member to any :term:`replica set <replica set>`. For example, 
increasing the number of members provides additional candidates to replace 
a primary in the event of a :ref:`failover <replication-auto-failover>`. 
Additional members also increase data redundancy and replica set 
availability.

For more information, refer to :ref:`replica-set-architecture`.

About This Task
---------------

.. include:: /includes/tip-repl-set-add-members.rst

Before You Begin
----------------

To add a member to a shard replica set, you need:

#. An active sharded cluster replica set.

#. A new host server for the new member. The new host server must be able 
   to support your sharded data set and be accessible by the active replica 
   set through the network.

Steps

   .. step:: Prepare the Data Directory

      Prepare the new member's :term:`data directory <dbpath>` using one of the
      following strategies:

      - Have the new member automatically sync data from an existing member.
        This process takes time but does not require administrator intervention.

        Make sure the new member's data directory *does not* contain data. The
        new member will copy the data from an existing member.

        If the new member is in a :term:`recovering` state, it must exit and
        become a :term:`secondary` before MongoDB
        can copy all data as part of the replication process.

      - Manually copy the data directory from an existing member. The new
        member becomes a secondary member and will catch up to the current
        state of the replica set. Copying the data over may shorten the
        amount of time it takes for the new member to sync with the other 
        replica set members.

        Ensure that you can copy the data directory to the new member and
        begin replication within the :ref:`window allowed by the oplog
        <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`. Otherwise, the new instance will have
        to perform an initial sync, which completely resynchronizes the
        data, as described in :ref:`resync-replica-member`.

        To check the current state of replica set members with regards to the 
        oplog, use :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()`.

      For background on replication deployment patterns, see the
      :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures` document.

   .. step:: Start the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

      Specify the data directory
      and the replica set name. The following example specifies the
      ``/srv/mongodb/db0`` data directory and the ``rs0`` replica set:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb/db0 --replSet rs0  --bind_ip localhost,<ip address of the mongod host>

      .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

      For more information on configuration options, see the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` manual page.

      .. tip::

         You can specify the data directory, replica set name, and the ip
         binding in the ``mongod.conf`` :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, and start the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the following command:

         .. code-block:: sh

            mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

   .. step:: Connect to the replica set's primary

      You can only add members while connected to the primary. To connect to
      the primary, use ``mongosh``. Replace the ``host`` and ``port`` values 
      with relevant values for your deployment:
      
      .. code-block:: sh

         mongosh --host mongodb0.example.com --port 28015

      If you do not know which member is the primary, connect to any member 
      of the replica set and issue the :method:`db.hello()` command.

   .. step:: Use :method:`rs.add()` to add the new member to the replica set 
   
      Pass the :rsconf:`member configuration document <members>` to the
      method.  For example, to add a member at host
      ``mongodb3.example.net``, issue the following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.add( { host: "mongodb3.example.net:27017", priority: 0, votes: 0 } )

   .. step:: Ensure that the new member has reached :replstate:`SECONDARY` state

      To check the state of the replica set members, run
      :method:`rs.status()`:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.status()

Next Steps
----------

Once the newly added member has transitioned into
:replstate:`SECONDARY` state, use :method:`rs.reconfig()` to update
the newly added member's :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` and
:rsconf:`~members[n].votes` if needed.

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst

Example
~~~~~~~

If :method:`rs.conf()` returns the configuration document for 
``mongodb3.example.net:27017`` as the fifth element in the 
:rsconf:`members` array, to update its priority and votes to
``1``, use the following sequence of operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var cfg = rs.conf();
   cfg.members[4].priority = 1
   cfg.members[4].votes = 1
   rs.reconfig(cfg)
