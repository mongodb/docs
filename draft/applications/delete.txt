.. default-domain:: mongodb

Of the four basic database operations (i.e. CRUD), *delete* operations
are those that remove documents from a :term:`collection` in
MongoDB. The :ref:`remove() <crud-delete-remove>` method in the
:program:`mongo` shell provides this operation, as do corresponding
methods in the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`.

For more information about document removal and other write operations
see :ref:`/core/write-operations`, for documentation of other basic
database operations see the :doc:`/crud` page.

Remove
------

Use the :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method to
delete documents from a collection. [#indexes]_ Consider the syntax of
the following prototype operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.delete( <query>, <justOne>)

In the :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` consider the
following rough analogies to SQL:

- :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` has the same function as
  the ``DELETE`` statement,

- the ``<query>`` argument corresponds to the ``WHERE`` statement, and

- the ``<justOne>`` argument has the same affect as ``LIMIT 1``.

Consider the following examples that illustrate the use of the
:method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>`:

- If there is a query argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes from the collection all
  documents that match the query.

  The following operation deletes all documents from the ``csbios``
  collection where the ``first`` field in the subdocument ``name``
  starts with ``G``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.csbios.remove( { 'name.first' : /^G/ } )

- If there is a query argument and you specify the ``justOne``
  argument, :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` only deletes a
  single documents from the collection that matches the query.

  The following operation deletes a single document from the
  ``csbios`` collection where the ``turing`` field equals ``true``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.csbios.remove( { turing: true }, 1 )

- If there is no ``query`` argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes all documents from a
  collection. The following operation deletes all documents from the
  ``csbios`` collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.csbios.remove()

  .. note::

     This operation is not equivalent to the :method:`drop()
     <db.collection.drop()>` method.

.. [#indexes] The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method
   does not delete indexes.

Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isolation
~~~~~~~~~

If the query argument to the :method:`remove()
<db.collection.remove()>` method matches multiple documents in the
collection, the delete operation may interleave with other write
operations to that collection. For an unsharded collection, you have
the option to override this behavior with the :operator:`$atomic`
isolation operator, effectively isolating the delete operation and
blocking all other operations during the delete operation. To isolate the operation,
include ``$atomic: 1`` in the ``query`` parameter as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.csbios.remove( { turing: true, $atomic: 1 } )
