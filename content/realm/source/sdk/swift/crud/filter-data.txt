Overview
--------

To filter data in your realm, you can leverage
Realm's query engine. 

.. versionadded:: 10.19.0: Realm Swift Query API

The :ref:`Realm Swift Query API <ios-realm-swift-query-api>` offers an 
idiomatic way for Swift developers to query data. Use Swift-style syntax 
to query a realm with the benefits of auto-completion and 
type safety. The Realm Swift Query API does not replace the NSPredicate
Query API in newer SDK versions; instead, you can use either.

For SDK versions prior to 10.19.0, or for Objective-C developers, 
Realm's query engine supports :ref:`NSPredicate Query
<ios-nspredicate-query>`.

About the Examples on This Page
-------------------------------
   
The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
priority -- higher is more important -- and a count of
minutes spent working on it. Finally, a ``Task`` can have one
or more string ``labels`` and one or more integer ``ratings``.

A ``Project`` has zero or more ``Tasks``.

See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
``Task``, below:

.. _ios-realm-swift-query-api:

Realm Swift Query API
---------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.19.0

   For SDK versions older than 10.19.0, use the :ref:`NSPredicate query API 
   <ios-nspredicate-query>`.

You can build a filter with Swift-style syntax using the ``.where`` 
:swift-sdk:`Realm Swift query API <Structs/Query.html>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.realm-swift-query.swift
   :language: swift

This query API constructs an :ref:`NSPredicate <ios-nspredicate-query>` 
to perform the query. It gives developers a type-safe idiomatic API to 
use directly, and abstracts away the NSPredicate construction.

The ``.where`` API takes a callback that evaluates to true or false. The
callback receives an instance of the type being queried, and you can 
leverage the compiler to statically check that you are creating valid queries
that reference valid properties. 

In the examples on this page, we use the ``$0`` shorthand to reference 
the variable passed into the callback.

.. _ios-where-operators:

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

There are several types of operators available to query a
:ref:`Realm collection <ios-client-collections>`. Queries
work by **evaluating** an operator expression for every
object in the collection being
queried. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

Comparison Operators
````````````````````

You can use Swift comparison operators with the Realm Swift 
Query API (``==``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``).

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find long-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property is at or above a certain value.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-comparison-operators.swift
      :language: swift

Collections
```````````

You can query for values within a collection using the ``.contains`` operators.
You can search for individual values by element, or search within a range.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``.in(_ collection:)``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the property referenced by the expression contains an element in the given array.

   * - | ``.contains(_ element:)``
     - Equivalent to the ``IN`` operator. Evaluates to ``true`` if the property referenced by the expression contains the value.

   * - ``.contains(_ range:)``
     - Equivalent to the ``BETWEEN`` operator. Evaluates to ``true`` if the property referenced by the expression contains a value that is within the range.

   * - ``.containsAny(in: )``
     - Equivalent to the ``IN`` operator combined with the ``ANY`` operator. Evaluates to ``true`` if any elements contained in the given array are present in the collection.

.. example::

   - Find tasks where the ``labels`` MutableSet collection property contains "quick win".
   - Find tasks where the ``progressMinutes`` property is within a given range of minutes.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-collections-contains.swift
      :language: swift

   Find tasks where the ``labels`` MutableSet collection property contains any of the elements in the given array: "quick win" or "bug".

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-collections-contains-any.swift
      :language: swift

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0: The ``IN`` operator

The Realm Swift Query API now supports the ``IN`` operator. Evaluates to ``true`` if the property referenced by the expression contains the value.

.. example::

   Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-collections-in.swift
      :language: swift

Logical Operators
`````````````````

You can make compound queries using Swift logical operators (``&&``, ``!``, 
``||``).

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-logical-operators.swift
      :language: swift

String Operators
````````````````

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. note::

   You can use the following options with string operators:

   - ``.caseInsensitive`` for case insensitivity.

     .. code-block:: swift
              
        $0.name.contains("f", options: .caseInsensitive)

   - ``.diacriticInsensitive`` for diacritic insensitivity: Realm treats 
     special characters as the base character (e.g. ``é`` -> ``e``).

     .. code-block:: swift
         
        $0.name.contains("e", options: .diacriticInsensitive)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``.starts(with value: String)``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the collection contains an element whose value begins with the specified string value.

   * - | ``.contains(_ value: String)``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``.ends(with value: String)``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the collection contains an element whose value ends with the specified string value.

   * - | ``.like(_ value: String)``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``==``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``!=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is not lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's string operators to find:

   - Projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' 
   - Projects with names that contain 'ie'
   - Projects with an ``assignee`` property whose value is similar to ``Al?x``
   - Projects that contain e-like characters with diacritic insensitivity 

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-string-operators.swift
      :language: swift

.. include:: /includes/string-sort-and-query-limitations-note.rst

Geospatial Operators
````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 10.47.0

Use the ``geoWithin`` operator to query geospatial data with one of the 
SDK's provided shapes:

- ``GeoCircle``
- ``GeoBox``
- ``GeoPolygon``

This operator evaluates to ``true`` if:

- An object has a geospatial data "shape" containing a ``String`` property 
  with the value of Point and a ``List`` containing a longitude/latitude 
  pair.
- The longitude/latitude of the persisted object falls within the geospatial
  query shape.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Geospatial.snippet.geowithin.swift
   :language: swift

For more information about querying geospatial data, refer to 
:ref:`swift-query-geospatial`.

Aggregate Operators
```````````````````

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``.avg``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``.count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection. This
       is currently only supported on :ref:`to-many relationship
       collections <ios-to-many-relationship>` and not on lists of
       primitives. In order to use ``.count`` on a list of primitives,
       consider wrapping the primitives in a :ref:`Realm
       object <ios-realm-objects>`.

   * - | ``.max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``.min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``.sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Projects that contain only low-priority tasks below 5.
   - Projects where all tasks are high-priority above 5.
   - Projects that contain more than 5 tasks.
   - Long running projects.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-aggregate-operators.swift
      :language: swift

Set Operators
`````````````

A **set operator** uses specific rules to determine whether
to pass each input collection object to the output
collection by applying a given query expression to every element of
a given :ref:`list <ios-list-collections>` property of
the object.

.. example::

   Running the following queries in ``projects`` collections returns:
   
   - Projects where a set of string ``labels`` contains any of "quick win", "bug".
   - Projects where any element in a set of integer ``ratings`` is greater than 3.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-set-operators.swift
      :language: swift

.. _ios-realm-swift-query-api-subquery:

Subqueries
~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate through a collection property with another query using a
subquery. To form a subquery, you must wrap the expression in parentheses
and immediately follow it with the ``.count`` aggregator.

.. code-block:: swift

   (<query>).count > n

If the expression does not produce a valid subquery, you'll get an
exception at runtime.

.. example::

   Running the following query on a ``projects`` collection returns projects
   with tasks that have not been completed by a user named Alex.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.tsq-subquery.swift
      :language: swift

.. _ios-nspredicate-query:

NSPredicate Queries
-------------------

You can build a filter with NSPredicate:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.predicates.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.predicates.m
         :language: objectivec

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters consist of **expressions** in an NSPredicate. An expression consists of
one of the following:

- The name (keypath) of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s).
- A value, such as a string (``'hello'``) or a number (``5``).

Dot Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When referring to an object property, you can use **dot notation** to refer
to child properties of that object. You can even refer to the properties of
:ref:`embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` and :ref:`relationships
<ios-client-relationships>` with dot notation.

For example, consider a query on an object with a ``workplace`` property that
refers to a Workplace object. The Workplace object has an embedded object
property, ``address``. You can chain dot notations to refer to the zipcode
property of that address: 

.. code-block:: objective-c

   workplace.address.zipcode == 10012

Substitutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following substitutions in your predicate format strings:

- ``%@`` to specify values
- ``%K`` to specify `keypaths <https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Expressions.html#grammar_key-path-expression>`_

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.substitutions.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.substitutions.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-filter-data-operators:

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

There are several types of operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <ios-client-collections>`. Filters
work by **evaluating** an operator expression for every
object in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

Comparison Operators
````````````````````

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. important:: Types Must Match

   The type on both sides of the operator must be equivalent. For
   example, comparing an :ref:`ObjectId with string
   <ios-filter-object-id>` will result in a precondition failure with a
   message like: 
   
   .. code-block::
      :copyable: false
   
      "Expected object of type object id for property 'id' on object of type 
      'User', but received: 11223344556677889900aabb (Invalid value)"
   
   You can compare any :ref:`numeric type
   <ios-supported-property-types>` with any other numeric type.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``between``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is between or equal to the right-hand range. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is within the right-hand date range.

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is in the right-hand list or string.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find long-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property is at or above a certain value.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

Logical Operators
`````````````````

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``and``
       | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``not``
       | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``or``
       | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.logical-operators.m
             :language: objectivec

      .. tab::

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.snippet.logical-operators.swift
             :language: swift


String Operators
````````````````

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. note::

   You can use the following modifiers with the string operators:

   - ``[c]`` for case insensitivity.

     .. tabs-realm-languages::

        .. tab::
           :tabid: swift

           .. code-block:: swift
              
              NSPredicate(format: "name CONTAINS[c] 'f'")

        .. tab::
           :tabid: objective-c

           .. code-block:: objective-c

              [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @"name CONTAINS[c] 'f'"]


   - ``[d]`` for diacritic insensitivity: Realm treats special characters as the base character (e.g. ``é`` -> ``e``).

     .. tabs-realm-languages::

        .. tab::
           :tabid: swift

           .. code-block:: swift
              
              NSPredicate(format: "name CONTAINS[d] 'e'")

        .. tab::
           :tabid: objective-c

           .. code-block:: objective-c

              [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @"name CONTAINS[d] 'e'"]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``beginsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the right-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the left-hand string expression.

   * - | ``contains``, ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``endsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is not lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find
   projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' and
   projects with names that contain 'ie':

Geospatial Operators
````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 10.47.0

You can perform a geospatial query using the ``IN`` operator with one
of the SDK's provided shapes:

- ``GeoCircle``
- ``GeoBox``
- ``GeoPolygon``

This operator evaluates to ``true`` if:

- An object has a geospatial data "shape" containing a ``String`` property 
  with the value of Point and a ``List`` containing a longitude/latitude 
  pair.
- The longitude/latitude of the persisted object falls within the geospatial
  query shape.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Geospatial.snippet.nspredicate-query.swift
   :language: swift

For more information about querying geospatial data, refer to 
:ref:`swift-query-geospatial`.

Aggregate Operators
```````````````````

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``@avg``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection. This
       is currently only supported on :ref:`to-many relationship
       collections <ios-to-many-relationship>` and not on lists of
       primitives. In order to use ``@count`` on a list of primitives,
       consider wrapping the primitives in a :ref:`Realm
       object <ios-realm-objects>`.

   * - | ``@max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Long running projects.

Set Operators
`````````````

A **set operator** uses specific rules to determine whether
to pass each input collection object to the output
collection by applying a given predicate to every element of
a given :ref:`list <ios-list-collections>` property of
the object.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``ALL``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for all objects in the collection.

   * - ``ANY``, ``SOME``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for any objects in the collection.

   * - ``NONE``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to false for all objects in the collection.


.. example::

   We use the query engine's set operators to find:

   - Projects with no complete tasks.
   - Projects with any top priority tasks.

.. _ios-nspredicate-subquery:

Subqueries
~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate through a collection property with another query using the
``SUBQUERY()`` predicate function. ``SUBQUERY()`` has the following signature:

.. code-block:: objective-c

   SUBQUERY(<collection>, <variableName>, <predicate>)

- ``collection``: the name of the list property to iterate through
- ``variableName``: a variable name of the current element to use in the subquery
- ``predicate``: a string that contains the subquery predicate. You can use the
  variable name specified by ``variableName`` to refer to the currently iterated
  element.

.. example::

   Running the following filter on a ``projects`` collection returns projects
   with tasks that have not been completed by a user named Alex.
