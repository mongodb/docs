|fts| queries might return many results. To make navigating results 
easier, you can either use pagination to divide results into discrete
pages or use cursor iteration to view all the results for your query.  

The following tutorials take you through the steps for paginating your
query results:

- The :ref:`fts-paginate-results` page describes how to use the
  :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` and ``searchBefore`` options to
  build functions similar to "Next Page", "Previous Page", "Load More",
  and infinite scroll in your application.
  
  To retrieve the paginated results non-sequentially and view the total
  number of search results for a query, you can use the :pipeline:`$skip`
  and :pipeline:`$limit` stages after the :pipeline:`$search` stage.
  This method might take longer than expected for large query results.
  To learn more, see the :ref:`pagination-skip-limit-tutorial` tutorial.
   
- The :ref:`iterate-cursor-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  create an index and iterate the cursor until it is exhausted to return
  all results for a query.
