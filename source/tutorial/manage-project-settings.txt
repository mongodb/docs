Edit Project Settings
---------------------

To modify project settings, select the project in the
:guilabel:`Context` and click :guilabel:`Settings`.

The :guilabel:`Project Settings` displays the configurable settings.
See :ref:`group-settings-page` to view the setting descriptions.

.. only:: onprem

   If you access |mms| as a user with the :authrole:`Global Owner`role,
   you can also update :guilabel:`Admin Project Settings` under the
   :guilabel:`Global Admin Only` section. See 
   :ref:`admin-only-group-settings` to view the
   administrative setting descriptions.

Project Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Project Settings` apply to all the users in the project.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Project`

     - Sets your project's name.

       .. note:: 

          Only a user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` access for the
          project can edit the project name.

   * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

     - Sets your project's time zone.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates the collection of log data for all
       hosts. This overwrites the statuses set on the individual hosts.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Profiling Information for All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates |mms| collection of data from the
       MongoDB :manual:`database profilers </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
       running on your :program:`mongod` instances. A :program:`mongod`
       instance must have its profiler enabled in order for |mms| to
       collect data from it.

       When you change this setting, |mms| applies the change globally
       to all :program:`mongod` processes in the project. For example,
       if you disable this setting, |mms| disables the collection of
       profiling data for all the project's processes. This setting
       does not affect whether the profiler is enabled on a given
       :program:`mongod` process, only whether |mms| collects profiling
       data.

       To enable the collection of profiling data on a
       process-by-process basis, see :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

       When profiling is enabled, |mms| collects data from MongoDBâ€™s
       profiler to provide statistics about performance and database
       operations. Ensure exposing profile data to |mms| is consistent
       with your information security practices. Also be aware the
       profiler can consume resources which may adversely affect
       MongoDB performance.

       For more information, see :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics. For more information, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

   * - :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates`

     - Allows you to reset and remove all detected duplicate hosts.
       This is useful if your server environment has drastically
       changed and you believe a host is incorrectly marked as a
       duplicate.

   * - :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames`

     - Allows you to specify resolvable hostnames or |ipaddr| addresses
       for your deployment's host. |mms| keeps a list of the multiple
       ways to which each host is referred (hostname, |fqdn|, |ipv4|
       address, |ipv6| address) and uses heuristics to determine the
       best choice. Specify a preferred hostname to make sure |mms|
       uses a hostname that can resolve to a host. The method you 
       choose becomes the method used to display the hosts in |mms|.

       To specify a preferred hostname, click :guilabel:`Add` and do
       one of the following:

       - To specify hostnames that end with a particular string, click
         the :guilabel:`Ends With` button and enter the string.

       - To specify hostnames that match a pattern, click the
         :guilabel:`Regex` button and enter a regular expression. An
         expression that uses "starts with" behavior must have ``.*``
         at the end in order to correctly match. 

         .. example::

            To specify hostnames that start with ``acme-``, enter:

            .. code-block:: none

               ^acme-.*

   * - :guilabel:`Suppress Mongos Automatic Discovery`

     - Suppresses automatic discovery of all :program:`mongos`
       processes in your deployment's sharded clusters.

   * - :guilabel:`PagerDuty Service Key`

     - Sets a default service key for alert notifications sent to a
       `PagerDuty <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`__
       account. |mms| enters the key by default when you add a
       PagerDuty notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. If you add PagerDuty
       notifications and if the key used to send the notifications
       becomes invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the key.

       You can add PagerDuty notifications only for alerts that require
       user acknowledgement. Informational alerts, such as the alert
       that a replica set has elected a new primary, cannot use
       PagerDuty notification.

       Users can acknowledge PagerDuty alert notifications only from
       the PagerDuty dashboard.

   * - :guilabel:`Flowdock Settings`

     - Sets default values for alert notifications sent to Flowdock.
       |mms| enters the values by default when you add a Flowdock
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. If you add Flowdock
       notifications, and if credentials to send notifications become
       invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the credentials.

       Set the following:

       - :guilabel:`Org Name`: The Flowdock organization name in
         lower-case letters. This is the name that appears after
         ``www.flowdock.com/app/`` in the URL string.

       - :guilabel:`Flow Name`: The flow name in lower-case letters.
         The flow name appears after the org name in the URL string:
         ``www.flowdock.com/app/<org-name>/<flow-name>``.

       - :guilabel:`API Token`: Your Flowdock "personal API token"
         found on the `<https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens>`_ page
         of your Flowdock account.

   * - :guilabel:`HipChat Settings`

     - Sets a default room and API token for alert notifications sent
       to a HipChat account. |mms| enters the values by default when
       you add a HipChat notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. If you add HipChat
       notifications and the token used to send notifications becomes
       invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the token.


   * - :guilabel:`Slack Settings`

     - Sets a default channel and token for alert notifications sent to
       a Slack account. You can use either an API token or a Bot token.
       To create an API token, see the `<https://api.slack.com/web>`_
       page in your Slack account. For information on Bot users in
       Slack, see `<https://api.slack.com/bot-users>`_.

       |mms| will enter these values by default when you add a Slack
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. If add Slack
       notifications and the token used to send notifications becomes
       invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the token.

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook Settings`

     - Adds a :guilabel:`Webhook URL` endpoint to which |mms| can send
       alert notifications for programmatic processing. |mms| sends an
       alert notification as an HTTP POST request in which the request
       body contains a JSON document that uses the same format as the
       Public API's :doc:`Alerts resource </reference/api/alerts>`.

       |mms| adds a request header called ``X-MMS-Event`` to
       distinguish between various alert states. The possible values
       for this header are:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 30 70

          * - ``alert.open``

            - The alert was just opened.

          * - ``alert.close``

            - The alert was resolved.

          * - ``alert.update``

            - A previously opened alert is still open.

          * - ``alert.acknowledge``

            - The alert was acknowledged.

          * - ``alert.cancel``

            - The alert became invalid and was canceled.

          * - ``alert.inform``

            - Represents an informational alert, which is a
              point-in-time event, such as "Primary Elected."

       If you specify a key in the :guilabel:`Webhook Secret` field,
       |mms| adds the ``X-MMS-Signature`` request header, which
       contains the hex-encoded HMAC signature of the request body. The
       signature is created using the provided secret.

       To send alert notifications to a Webhook, select the Webhook
       notification option when creating or editing an :doc:`alert
       configuration </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. If you
       add a Webhook notification and the URL or optional key becomes
       invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the Webhook settings.

   Admin Project Settings
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following project settings in the :guilabel:`Global Admin Only`
   section of :guilabel:`Settings` could, in certain situations, affect
   more than the project. For example, setting logging to a high
   verbosity would cause system logs to roll over faster. Only users
   with the :authrole:`Global Owner` role can edit these settings:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Setting

        - Description

      * - :guilabel:`Mongos Deactivation Threshold`

        - Change the amount of time before |mms| removes an unreachable
          :program:`mongos` process from the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab
          view. By default, |mms| waits 30 days before removing an
          unreachable :program:`mongos`. Set this to the amount of time
          in seconds to wait before removal. This setting applies only
          if the :program:`mongos` is not managed by |mms| Automation.

      * - :guilabel:`Monitoring Agent Log Level`

        - Change the verbosity of the Monitoring Agent log.

      * - :guilabel:`{+aagent+} Log Level`

        - Change the verbosity of the {+aagent+} log.
