Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and a ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements
in your connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster
- MongoDB username
- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``create()`` method constructing a ``MongoClient`` object.

.. tip::

   Follow the :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of MongoDB Server.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see :manual:`Stable API
</reference/stable-api>` in the MongoDB Server manual.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code uses the ``serverApi`` option to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

.. include:: /includes/connect/connect-reactor.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/atlas-connection.java
   :language: java

Local Deployments
-----------------

To connect to a local MongoDB deployment, use ``localhost`` as the hostname. By
default, the ``mongod`` process runs on port 27017, though you can customize this for
your deployment.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to a local MongoDB
deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/choose-connect-target.java
   :start-after: start-connect-local
   :end-before: end-connect-local
   :language: java
   :copyable:

Replica Sets
------------

To connect to a replica set, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and 
port numbers of the replica-set members in your connection string.

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can 
specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct the {+driver-short+} to 
perform automatic discovery to find the others. To instruct the driver to perform
automatic discovery, perform one of the following actions:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet`` parameter.
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter.
- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the 
MongoDB replica set ``sampleRS``, which is running on port ``27017`` of three different
hosts, including ``host1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/choose-connect-target.java
   :start-after: start-connect-replica
   :end-before: end-connect-replica
   :language: java
   :copyable:

.. note:: create() is Non-Blocking

   The ``create()`` method constructing a ``MongoClient`` is *non-blocking*.
   When you connect to a replica set, the method returns immediately while the
   client uses background threads to connect to the replica set.
   
   If you create a ``MongoClient`` and immediately print the string representation
   of its ``nodes`` attribute, the list might be empty while the client connects to
   the replica-set members.

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize a replica set, you must connect directly to a single member. To do so,
set the ``directConnection`` connection
option to ``True``. You can do this in the following ways:

- Passing an argument to the ``create()`` method constructing a ``MongoClient``
- Setting the parameter in your connection string.

   .. tab:: MongoClient
      :tabid: mongoclient

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/choose-connect-target.java
         :start-after: start-arg-constructor
         :end-before: end-arg-constructor
