Retryable writes allow MongoDB drivers to automatically retry certain
write operations a single time if they encounter network errors, or if
they cannot find a healthy :term:`primary` in the
:ref:`replica sets <replication>` or :ref:`sharded cluster
<sharding-introduction>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Retryable writes have the following requirements:

Supported Deployment Topologies
  Retryable writes require a :ref:`replica set <replication>`
  or :ref:`sharded cluster <sharding-introduction>`, and do **not**
  support :term:`standalone instances <standalone>`.

Supported Storage Engine
  Retryable writes require a storage engine supporting document-level
  locking, such as the :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` or
  :doc:`in-memory </core/inmemory>` storage engines.

3.6+ MongoDB Drivers
  Clients require MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 3.6 or greater:

  .. include:: /includes/3.6-drivers.rst

MongoDB Version
  The MongoDB version of every node in the cluster must be ``3.6`` or
  greater, and the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of each node in the
  cluster must be ``3.6`` or greater. See
  :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` for more information on
  the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag.

Write Acknowledgment
  Write operations issued with a :doc:`/reference/write-concern` of ``0``
  are **not** retryable.

Retryable Writes and Multi-Document Transactions
------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 4.0

The :ref:`transaction commit and abort operations <transactions-retry>`
are retryable write operations. If the commit operation or the abort
operation encounters an error, MongoDB drivers retry the operation a
single time regardless of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is set to
``true``.

The write operations inside the transaction are not individually
retryable, regardless of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is set to
``true``.

For more information on transactions, see :doc:`/core/transactions`.

Enabling Retryable Writes
-------------------------

MongoDB drivers do **not** enable retryable writes by default with the
exception of :ref:`transaction commit and abort operations
<transactions-retry>`.

MongoDB Drivers
  To enable retryable writes in MongoDB drivers, add the
  :urioption:`retryWrites` option to your
  :ref:`connection string <mongodb-uri>`:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://localhost/?retryWrites=true

:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
  To enable retryable writes in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use
  the :option:`--retryWrites <mongo --retryWrites>` command line option:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo --retryWrites

.. _retryable-write-ops:

Retryable Write Operations
--------------------------

The following write operations are retryable when issued with
acknowledged write concern; e.g., :doc:`/reference/write-concern`
cannot be :writeconcern:`{w: 0} </<number/>>`.

.. note::

   The write operations inside the :doc:`transactions
   </core/transactions>` are not individually retryable.

     - Descriptions

   * - | :method:`db.collection.insertOne()`

     - Insert operations.

       | :method:`db.collection.replaceOne()`
       | :method:`db.collection.save()`
       | :method:`db.collection.update()` where ``multi`` is ``false``

     - Single-document update operations.

   * - | :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`
       | :method:`db.collection.remove()` where ``justOne`` is ``true``

     - Single document delete operations.

       | :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`

     - ``findAndModify`` operations. All ``findAndModify`` operations
       are single document operations.

   * - :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()` with the following write
       operations:

       - :ref:`bulkwrite-write-operations-insertOne`

       - :ref:`updateOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-updateOneMany>`

       - :ref:`bulkwrite-write-operations-replaceOne`

       - :ref:`deleteOne <bulkwrite-write-operations-deleteOneMany>`

     - Bulk write operations that only consist of the single-document
       write operations. A retryable bulk operation can include any
       combination of the specified write operations but cannot include
       any multi-document write operations, such as ``updateMany``.


   * - :method:`Bulk <Bulk()>` operations for:

       - :method:`Bulk.find.removeOne()`
       - :method:`Bulk.find.replaceOne()`
       - :method:`Bulk.find.replaceOne()`

     - Bulk write operations that only consist of the single-document
       write operations. A retryable bulk operation can include any
       combination of the specified write operations but cannot include
       any multi-document write operations, such as ``update`` which
       specifies ``true`` for the ``multi`` option.

Behavior
--------

Persistent Network Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB retryable writes make only **one** retry attempt. This helps
address transient network errors and
:ref:`replica set elections <replica-set-elections>`, but not persistent
network errors.

Failover Period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the driver cannot find a healthy :term:`primary` in the destination
replica set or sharded cluster shard, the drivers wait
:urioption:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS` milliseconds to determine the new
primary before retrying. Retryable writes do not address instances where
the failover period exceeds :urioption:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS`.

.. warning::

   If the client application becomes temporarily unresponsive for more
   than the :parameter:`localLogicalSessionTimeoutMinutes` after
   issuing a write operation, there is a chance that when the client
   applications starts responding (without a restart), the write
   operation may be retried and applied again.

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.6.3

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command, and its :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell helper :method:`db.serverStatus()` includes statistics on
retryable writes in the :serverstatus:`transactions` section.
