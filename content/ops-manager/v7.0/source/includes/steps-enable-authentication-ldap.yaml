  .. warning:: Recommend Using |tls-ssl| with |ldap|

     By default, |ldap| traffic is sent as plain text. This means that
     credentials (username and password) are exposed to basic network
     threats like sniffers and replay. Use |ldaps| (|ldap| over 
     |tls-ssl|) to encrypt authentication. Many modern directory 
     services, such as Active Directory, require encrypted  
     connections.

  a. In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Deployment Authentication Mechanism` section,
     select {{mechanism}}.

  b. Select the appropriate type of {{mechanism}} authentication.

     .. important:: 

        - If you are using LDAP authorization,
          you must select :guilabel:`Native LDAP Authentication`.
        - If you are not using LDAP authorization, you must add users to the 
          ``$external`` database in your MongoDB deployment. For an example, see 
          :manual:`LDAP Authentication </tutorial/create-users/#ldap-authentication>`.

     |mms| limits Agents to using one :term:`mechanism <authentication

  a. Select the {{mechanism}} option from the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` 
     section.
  
  b. Provide credentials for the {+mdbagent+}:

        * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Agent Password`
          - Enter the password for Agent's |ldap| Username.

        * - MongoDB Agent LDAP Group DN
          - If you enabled LDAP Authorization, enter the |dn| of the
            group of which the MongoDB Agent user is a member.
