Overview
--------

.. short-description::
   
   Use operators and compound queries to retrieve documents in MongoDB.

In the previous read guide, :ref:`guide-read-query`,
you read data using equality queries. In this guide, you will:

- Read data from the ``{+guides-db+}.{+guides-coll+}`` collection with MongoDB's comparison operators.
- Combine query criteria to make compound queries.
- Use **dot notation** to query embedded fields.

Read Data with Embedded Fields and Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise, you will read data using comparison operators.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/find_operators_less_than.rst

Read Data with Compound Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you will read data from MongoDB using AND and OR logic to form compound queries.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/read_compound.rst

Summary
-------

If you have successfully completed this guide, you have read data from MongoDB
using MongoDB query operators and compound queries.

You can combine query operators in almost limitless ways to express complex queries.
For example, you could query for documents that have rings AND a specific chemical
compound in their atmosphere, or that are a specific temperature, AND all
have the letter 'E' in their name.

In the next guide, you'll learn how to insert data into MongoDB.
