Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

With |backup|, you can restore from a stored snapshot or, if you are
restoring a replica set, you may
build a :doc:`custom snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>` reflecting a
different point in the last 24 hours. For all backups, restoring from
a stored snapshot is faster than restoring from a custom snapshot in the
last 24 hours.

|backup| takes and stores a snapshot every 6 hours. These
snapshots are available for restores following the snapshot
retention policy. [#snapshot-retention]_

Select a Stored Snapshot for the Restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|backup| provides two paths through which you can select a stored
snapshot to restore from: the :guilabel:`Restore` button, and the
:guilabel:`Restore this snapshot` links for each snapshot in the
Snapshots table. If you choose :guilabel:`Restore this snapshot`, a
modal window will appear prompting you to select the destination for
the snapshot. If you click on the :guilabel:`Restore` button, you will
need to complete the following steps before you can select the
snapshot destination.

#. Above the Snapshots table, click on :guilabel:`Restore`. A window
   for selecting the restoration point appears.

#. Select the snapshot to use. Be sure the :guilabel:`Use Point In
   Time` checkbox is not selected.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Select Destination` button.
