|service| offers a feature that moves infrequently accessed immutable
data from your |service| cluster to a MongoDB-managed read-only
:adl:`Data Lake </>` on |aws| |s3| bucket without user action.

|service| offers this *{+Online-Archive+}* feature only on ``M10`` and
greater clusters. Once |service| archives the data, you have a unified
view of your |service| and {+Online-Archive+} data from a read-only
|data-lake|.

|service| archives data based on the criteria you specify in an
archiving rule. The criteria combines a date with a number of
days. |service| archives data when the current date exceeds the
date plus the number of days specified in the archiving rule.

To archive data:

1. |service| runs :pipeline:`$match` query every five minutes to
   determine the documents that match the criteria for archiving.
   |service| refers to this query as a *job*.

2. For documents that match the archival criteria, |service|:

   a. Writes the first 2 GB of document data to the |aws| |s3| bucket
      as files of up to 100 MB each per job. This would be up to 20
      files.

   b. Writes each subsequent quantity of document data (up to 2 GB)
      with each :pipeline:`$match` query run.

|service| provides a unified endpoint through which you can query both
your live cluster and archived data using the same database and
collection name you use in your |service| cluster. You can't use the
unified endpoint over a private connection such as
:doc:`Peering </security-vpc-peering>` or {+aws-pl+}. You must use a
standard internet connection over |tls|.

If you activate {+Online-Archive+} for an |aws| cluster, these |aws|
|s3| buckets exist in the same region as your cluster. If you activate
{+Online-Archive+} for a |gcp| or |azure| cluster, {+Online-Archive+}
creates the archive in the region closest to your cluster's primary
based on a calculation of distance between the cluster and |s3|.

.. important::

   |service| encrypts your archived data using MongoDB's |aws|
   encryption keys. It can't use any encryption-at-rest encryption keys
   you might have used on your cluster data.

|data-lake| for {+Online-Archive+}
----------------------------------

When you configure your ``M10`` or greater |service| cluster for
{+Online-Archive+}, |service| creates a read-only :adl:`Data Lake </>`,
one per cluster, on |aws| |s3| for your archived data.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can't write to the {+Online-Archive+} |data-lake|.

- You can't :adl:`configure </config/config-data-lake>` or
  :adl:`administer </administration>` any |data-lake| through the:

  - |service| console,
  - |data-lake| :adl:`CLI </reference/cli/datalake-cli>`, or
  - |data-lake| :adl:`API </reference/api/datalakes-api>`.

Viewing the {+Online-Archive+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view your |data-lake| for the {+Online-Archive+}:

1. Navigate to the |data-lake| page in the |service| console.

2. Click :guilabel:`Data Lake` from the left navigation in your
   :guilabel:`Project` page.

Querying the {+Online-Archive+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query your {+Online-Archive+} data, use the connection string
through the |data-lake| :guilabel:`Connect` button to connect to your
|aws| |s3| bucket.

Deleting {+Online-Archive+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you delete all the {+Online-Archive+}s, |service| deletes the
|data-lake|. After deleting all the {+Online-Archive+}s, if you create
an {+Online-Archive+} with the same settings as a deleted
{+Online-Archive+}, |service| creates a new |data-lake| for the new
{+Online-Archive+}.

.. _online-archive-pricing:

{+Online-Archive+} Costs
------------------------

{+Online-Archive+} stores infrequently accessed immutable data to lower
the data storage costs on your |service| cluster. You incur costs for
storage on |aws| and queries on archived data.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about the storage and query costs, see
   :website:`Atlas pricing page </cloud/atlas/pricing>`.

Manage Your {+Online-Archive+}
--------------------------

You can configure an {+Online-Archive+} for a collection on your
cluster through your |service| UI and |api|. Once you create an
{+Online-Archive+}, you can view the list of archives, edit an
archiving rule, pause archiving, and delete your {+Online-Archive+} at
any time. If you need to move archived data back to your cluster, you
must use |mongodump| or |mongoexport|. The following pages describe how
