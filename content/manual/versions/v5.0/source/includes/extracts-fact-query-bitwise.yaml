  .. list-table::

     * - ``{ <field>: { {{op}}: <numeric bitmask> } }``

     * - ``{ <field>: { {{op}}: <`` :doc:`BinData </reference/bson-types>` ``bitmask> } }``

     * - ``{ <field>: { {{op}}: [ <position1>, <position2>, ... ] } }``

  The ``field`` value must be either numeric or a
  :doc:`BinData </reference/bson-types>` instance. Otherwise, :query:`{{op}}`
  will not match the current document.

  Numeric Bitmask
    You can provide a numeric bitmask to be matched against the operand field.
    The bitmask must be a non-negative 64-bit signed integer.
    Otherwise, :query:`{{op}}` returns an error.

  BinData Bitmask
    You can also use an arbitrarily large :doc:`BinData </reference/bson-types>`
    instance as a bitmask.

  Position List
    If querying a list of bit positions, each ``<position>`` must be a non-negative
    integer. Bit positions start at ``0`` from the least significant bit. For
    example, the decimal number ``254`` would have the following bit positions:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1

  :query:`{{op}}` will not match numerical values that cannot be represented as
  a signed 64-bit integer. This can be the case if a value is either too large
  or too small to fit in a signed 64-bit integer, or if it has a fractional
  component.

  Numbers are sign extended. For example, :query:`{{op}}` considers bit position ``200``
  to be set for the negative number ``-5``, but bit position ``200`` to be clear
  for the positive number ``+5``.

  In contrast, :doc:`BinData </reference/bson-types>` instances are zero-extended.
  For example, given the following document:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.save({ x: BinData(0, "ww=="), binaryValueofA: "11000011" })

  :query:`{{op}}` will consider all bits outside of ``x`` to be clear.
