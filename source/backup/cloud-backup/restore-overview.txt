|service| lets you restore data from 

- :ref:`scheduled and on-demand snapshots <restore-from-snapshot>`
- :ref:`{+pit-restore+} <restore-from-continuous>` 
- :ref:`locally-downloaded snapshot files <restore-from-local-file>`
- :ref:`snapshots of a cluster using {+encrypt-at-rest+} <restore-from-ear>`
- :ref:`a Cloud Manager deployment <restore-from-cloud-manager>`

To learn more about:

- {+Cloud-Backup+}, see :ref:`restore-overview`.
- Faster cross-project restores, see  :ref:`aws-cross-project`.
- Restoring snapshots using {+encrypt-at-rest+}, see :ref:`restore-from-ear`.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view cloud backup restore jobs, you must have
:authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access 
to the project.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't restore a snapshot created
from a MongoDB 7.0 sharded cluster with 3 or fewer shards
to a MongoDB 8.0 sharded cluster with 3 or fewer shards
with the default :ref:`embedded config server <config-server-types>` configuration on MongoDB 8.0.
You must first disable the :ref:`Managed Configs <config-server-management>`
to create a sharded cluster with dedicated config server before restoring the snapshot.
