Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB."

msgid "The *Materialized Paths* pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of the node's ancestors or path. Although the *Materialized Paths* pattern requires additional steps of working with strings and regular expressions, the pattern also provides more flexibility in working with the path, such as finding nodes by partial paths."
