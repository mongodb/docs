Introduction
------------

You can select which conditions trigger alerts and how users are notified.

Default Alert Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| provides the following default alerts for a new project:

- :alert:`Replica set has no primary`

- :alert:`Cluster is missing an active mongos`

- :alert:`Disk space % used on Data Partition is`

- :alert:`Disk I/O % utilization on Data Partition is`

- :alert:`User joined the project`

- :alert:`Users awaiting approval to join project`

- :alert:`Credit card is about to expire`

Notification Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure an alert, you select how notifications are sent. You can
select multiple notification methods, such as email, text message, or team
collaboration tools.

To use certain notification methods, you must first enter default values in
:guilabel:`Project Settings`, accessed through the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.
|service| fills in the default values automatically when you select that
notification method. If a default value becomes invalid, |service| sends
an email to the project owner. The following notification methods require
default values in :guilabel:`Project Settings`:

- PagerDuty

- Flowdock

- HipChat

- Slack

- Webhook

Configure an Alert
------------------

When you create a new alert you have the option of using an existing alert
setting as a template.

Delete or Disable an Alert
--------------------------

If you delete or disable an alert setting, |service| cancels active alerts
related to the setting. A disabled alert setting remains visible but
grayed-out and can be later re-enabled. A deleted alert setting does not
remain visible.
