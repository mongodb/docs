  chart builder.

- Improved :ref:`Query Bar <query-bar>` in the chart builder, allowing
  the chart author to specify custom aggregation pipeline stages.

- |charts-short| now runs against :term:`secondary` replica set members
  by default, and allows :ref:`Data Source <data-sources>` owners to
  change the read preference.

- Charts now remain visible when changing the dashboard layout and
  refreshing charts.

Bug fixes in this release:

- Duplicating a dashboard no longer breaks
  :ref:`embedded charts <embedding-charts>`.

- Tooltips on area charts now show on hover over any part of the area,
  not just the data points.

|charts| SaaS v1.2.0
--------------------

*Released Apr 16, 2019*

- Ability to :ref:`embed charts <embedding-charts>` in external
  applications.

  appear in the wrong order.

|charts| SaaS v1.1.1
--------------------

*Released Feb 14, 2019*

Improvements in this release:

- New Chart Types:

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Bar <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Area <line-area-chart-ref>`

- New default :ref:`sort behavior <charts-sort-data>` in charts.

- New :ref:`filter bar <charts-filter-documents>` in the chart builder,
  with increased performance and usability.

Bug fixes in this release:

- Changes to :ref:`filter parsing <filter-date>` to better align with
  MongoDB Shell syntax and Javascript in general. Specifically, filters
  using ``Date()`` to represent the current date or
  ``Date("2019-01-01")`` to represent a specific date will need to be
  changed to ``new Date()`` or ``ISODate()`` and
  ``new Date("2019-01-01")`` or ``ISODate("2019-01-01")``, since the
  Date() function now correctly  returns the date as a string
  representation.

- Fixed rendering issues in certain browser versions relating to the
  :ref:`continuous color picker <color-palette-customization>`.

- Miscellaneous performance, reliability and security improvements.
