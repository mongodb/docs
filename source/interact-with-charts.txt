Interactive Filtering
---------------------

On a dashboard, you can interact with a chart that has 
:guilabel:`Filter or highlight` enabled to filter data 
in other charts.

With :guilabel:`Filter or highlight` enabled, clicking a chart element 
with an associated  :ref:`dashboard filter <dashboard-filtering>` 
temporarily reconfigures the scope of that dashboard filter to a single 
chart series, category or field value.

Interactive filtering is useful for getting quick insights into 
subcategories of your data on dashboards with multiple charts. 
Interactive filtering is temporary; you can revert to your original 
dashboard filter at any time.

To enable :guilabel:`Filter or highlight`:

1. Hover over the chart on the dashboard to reveal four buttons in the 
   upper right corner of the chart.
#. Click the second button for :guilabel:`Interactive Filters`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Filter or highlight` from the dropdown.

.. note::
   
   By default, charts set :guilabel:`Interactive Filters` to 
   :guilabel:`Filter or highlight`.

   Setting a chart's :guilabel:`Interactive Filters` to 
   :guilabel:`Filter` reflects dashboard filters 
   and temporary interactive filters. That chart cannot be highlighted 
   to set interactive filters on other charts.

   Setting a chart's :guilabel:`Interactive Filters` to 
   :guilabel:`Ignore` ignores any dashboard or interactive filters.

.. example::
   
   On the |charts| :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>`, movie 
   statistics are displayed across a range of chart types.

   If you create a dashboard filter for ``rated``, the content rating 
   of a movie (e.g. G, PG-13, R), you can click a specific movie rating 
   on any one of your charts to temporarily reconfigure the scope of 
   your dashboard filter to that specific movie rating.

   If you click on the PG-13 rating section of the 
   :guilabel:`Movie Ratings` donut chart, the rest of the charts on 
   your dashboard update to display only data for PG-13 movies. When 
   you :ref:`clear the selection <remove-interactive-filter>` of the 
   PG-13 rating, your dashboard reverts to displaying charts according 
   to the ``rated`` dashboard filter.

The chart upon which you set an interactive filter is highlighted, 
*not* filtered. It :ref:`emphasizes <emphasize-series>` the element for 
which your other charts are filtered. You can 
:ref:`clear the selection <remove-interactive-filter>` from that 
highlighted chart.

A highlighted chart displays a status icon in the bottom left corner.

Filtered charts display the :icon-fa5:`filter` icon.

You can apply an interactive filter to all chart types *except*:

- :ref:`Number Charts <number-chart-ref>` 
- :ref:`Gauge Charts <gauge-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Top Item Charts <top-item-ref>`
- :ref:`Geospatial Scatter Charts <geospatial-scatter-type>`
- :ref:`Geospatial Heatmaps <geospatial-heatmap-type>`

Filter a Dashboard by a Chart Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To interactively filter a dashboard based on a chart element, you must 
first create a dashboard filter for the field that you want to filter 
by.

.. example::
   
   To filter the :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>` to only 
   English movies, you must have a dashboard filter on the ``language`` 
   field.

To filter a dashboard by a chart element, you can click on:

- a legend entry
- a chart category, such as an X or Y series label
- a chart mark, such as a bar segment or line chart node

When you hover over a chart element with an associated dashboard 
filter, your cursor displays the :icon-fa4:`hand-pointer-o` icon. 

If a chart element isn't filterable, your cursor displays the 
:icon-fa4:`mouse-pointer` icon. You might be able to add a dashboard 
filter for that value's field to make that element filterable.

.. note::
   
   If the dashboard filter card associated with a clicked element is 
   disabled, |charts-short| enables it temporarily until you 
   :ref:`clear the selection <remove-interactive-filter>` of that 
   element.

When you filter a dashboard by a chart element, |charts-short| disables 
all other dashboard filters until you clear the selection.

.. _remove-interactive-filter:

Remove an Interactive Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove an interactive dashboard filter by: 

- Clicking the whitespace on the highlighted chart upon which you set 
  the interactive filter, or

- Changing the associated dashboard filter.

.. _emphasize-series:

Click to Emphasize Series
-------------------------

Chart viewers can interact with a chart to highlight one or more series 
in a multi-series chart. This behavior applies to any chart type that 
displays a discrete color legend, except for geospatial charts. The 
following chart types support emphasizing specific series: 

- :ref:`Grouped and Stacked Bar/Column charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line/Area charts <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Scatter charts <scatter-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Donut charts <donut-chart-ref>`


Emphasize a Single Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you click a label in the chart legend at the top right, 
|charts-short| emphasizes the selected data series by reducing the 
opacity of all the other data series.

.. figure:: /images/charts/emphasize-single-series.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Emphasize single data series

Emphasize Multiple Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To emphasize multiple data series at once, **shift-click** as many 
labels in the legend as you would like. Charts adjusts the opacity of
the selected data series from de-emphasized to emphasized. 

.. figure:: /images/charts/multiple-series-emphasized.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Emphasize multiple data series


Emphasize All Data Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore the opacity of all data series to the default emphasized 
state, click the chart background.

.. figure:: /images/charts/all-series-emphasized.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Emphasize all data series


Zoom and Pan a Scatter Chart
----------------------------

Chart viewers can zoom and pan a non-geospatial :ref:`scatter chart 
<scatter-chart-ref>`. 

Zoom
~~~~

To zoom in or out of the chart, scroll up or down. |charts-short| 
automatically adjusts the axis bounds to change the viewport, while 
keeping the plotted points the same size.

The resulting view after zooming and panning is only visible to you and 
does not persist page reloads. To revert back to the original axis 
bounds, reload the chart page. 

Pan
~~~

To pan the chart, click and drag over the chart surface. 

View the Percentage of the Whole
--------------------------------

Chart viewers can hover on each data point to view the value as a 
percentage of the whole. The part to whole relationship appears in the 
tooltip for the data point. This behavior applies to any chart type 
that displays a part of the whole relationship, specifically:

- :ref:`100% Stacked Bar Charts <one-hundred-stacked-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Column Charts <stacked-ref-example>`
- :ref:`100% Stacked Area Charts <one-hundred-stacked-area>`
- :ref:`Donut Charts <donut-chart-ref>`

For stacked charts, the whole value is the total value of the 
current category. For donut charts, the whole value is the total
value of the entire chart.

.. _show-data:

Show Data for an Item
---------------------
Chart viewers with Author or Owner :ref:`data source permissions 
<permission-model>` can view the original data that contributed to a 
chart element.

Chart viewers can show data for the following chart elements:

- Bar or mark on a chart plot area
- Chart legend entry
- Category axis label
- Table row
- Choropleth shape

.. note::

   Some charts (:ref:`geospatial-scatter-type`, :ref:`gauge-chart-ref`, and :ref:`top-item-ref`) do not support this functionality.

To view the original data that contributed to a chart element, 
right-click on the chart element and select 
:guilabel:`View data at point` from the context menu. You can 
switch between the :guilabel:`Table` view and :guilabel:`JSON` view.

Interact with Data in the Table View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chart viewers with Author or Owner :ref:`data source permissions 
<permission-model>` can resize and swap columns in the table view. 
Changes do not persist. Each column has a maximum width.

.. note::

   The dialog for the :guilabel:`Table` view displays a maximum of 
   1,000 rows.

Interact with Data in the JSON View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chart viewers with Author or Owner :ref:`data source permissions 
<permission-model>` can expand or collapse sections of the |json| 
document.

.. note::

   The dialog for the :guilabel:`JSON` view displays a maximum of 
   100 documents only.

Copy and Save a Chart as an Image
---------------------------------

Chart viewers can copy and save a chart as an image. The image file 
includes the chart contents, including the title of the chart.

Copy
~~~~

To copy a chart to your clipboard as an image, right-click on the chart 
and select :guilabel:`Copy chart as image` from the context menu. You 
can copy any chart type except data tables.

.. note:: 

   The copy feature is not available on Firefox. 

Save 
~~~~

To save a chart as a |png| file, right-click on the chart and select 
:guilabel:`Save as PNG` from the context menu.
