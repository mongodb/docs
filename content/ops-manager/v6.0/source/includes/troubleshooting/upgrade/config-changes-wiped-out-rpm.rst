Depending on your Linux distribution and local configurations,
|mms| may replace any changes you made to your configuration file on
upgrade. In |mms| 5.0 and later, if you use RPM packages, |mms| no longer
updates the configuration file upon upgrade. If a new |mms| version
requires new properties in the configuration file, you must add them to
the file upon upgrade.
