Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without
indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to return
query results. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB uses
the index to limit the number of documents it must scan.

Although indexes improve query performance, adding an index has negative
performance impact for write operations. For collections with a high
write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive because each insert must also
update any indexes.

Use Cases
---------

If your application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields,
you can create an index on those fields to improve performance. For
example, consider the following scenarios:

.. TODO: Add wildcard index scenario to the following table

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 10

   * - Scenario

     - Index Type

   * - A human resources department often needs to look up employees by
       employee ID. You can create an index on the employee ID field to
       improve query performance.

     - :ref:`Single Field Index <indexes-single-field>`

   * - A salesperson often needs to look up client information by
       location. Location is stored in an embedded object with fields
       like ``state``, ``city``, and ``zipcode``. You can create an
       index on the ``location`` object to improve performance for
       queries on that object.

       .. include:: /includes/indexes/embedded-object-need-entire-doc.rst

     - :ref:`Single Field Index <indexes-single-field>` on an embedded
       document

   * - A grocery store manager often needs to look up inventory items by
       name and quantity to determine which items are low stock. You can
       create a single index on both the ``item`` and ``quantity``
       fields to improve query performance.

Get Started
-----------

You can create and manage indexes in `{+atlas+} 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas?tck=docs_server>`__, with a driver
method, or with the MongoDB Shell. {+atlas+} is the fully
managed service for MongoDB deployments in the cloud.

Create and Manage Indexes in {+atlas+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For deployments hosted in {+atlas+}, you can create
and manage indexes with the {+atlas+} UI or the Atlas CLI. {+atlas+}
also includes a Performance Advisor that recommends indexes to improve
slow queries, ranks suggested indexes by impact, and recommends which
indexes to drop.

To learn how to create and manage indexes the {+atlas+} UI or the Atlas
CLI, see :atlas:`Create, View, Drop, and Hide Indexes 
</atlas-ui/indexes>`.

To learn more about the {+atlas+} Performance Advisor, see
:atlas:`Monitor and Improve Slow Queries </performance-advisor>`.

Details
-------

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the
collection's data set in an easy-to-traverse form. MongoDB indexes use a
:wikipedia:`B-tree <B-tree>` data structure.

The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered
by the value of the field. The ordering of the index entries supports
efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. In
addition, MongoDB can return sorted results by using the ordering in
the index.

The following diagram illustrates a query that selects and orders the
matching documents using an index:

.. include:: /images/index-for-sort.rst

Fundamentally, indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other
database systems. MongoDB defines indexes at the :term:`collection`
level and supports indexes on any field or sub-field of the documents
in a MongoDB collection.

.. _index-type-id:

Default ``_id`` Index
---------------------

MongoDB creates a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on the
:ref:`_id <document-id-field>` field during the creation of a
collection. The ``_id`` index prevents clients from inserting two
documents with the same value for the ``_id`` field. You cannot drop
this index on the ``_id`` field.

.. note::

   In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field
   to prevent errors.  This is most-often done by using a standard
   auto-generated :term:`ObjectId`.

.. [#b-tree] MongoDB indexes use a B-tree data structure.


.. _index-names:

Index Names
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys
and each key's direction in the index ( i.e. 1 or -1) using underscores
as a separator. For example, an index created on 
``{ item : 1, quantity: -1 }`` has the name ``item_1_quantity_-1``.

You can create indexes with a custom name, such as one that is more 
human-readable than the default. For example, consider an application
that frequently queries the ``products`` collection to populate data on
existing inventory. The following :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
method creates an index on ``item`` and ``quantity`` named ``query for
inventory``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.createIndex( 
     { item: 1, quantity: -1 } , 
     { name: "query for inventory" } 
   )

You can view index names using the :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()`
method. You cannot rename an index once created. Instead, you must
drop and re-create the index with a new name. 

.. _index-types:

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB provides a number of different index types to support specific
types of data and queries.

.. _index-intro-single-field:

Single Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the MongoDB-defined ``_id`` index, MongoDB supports the
creation of user-defined ascending/descending indexes on a :doc:`single
field of a document </core/index-single>`.

.. include:: /images/index-ascending.rst

For a single-field index and sort operations, the sort order (i.e.
ascending or descending) of the index key does not matter because
MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction.

See :doc:`/core/index-single` and :ref:`sort-results-single-field` for
more information on single-field indexes.

Compound Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB also supports user-defined indexes on multiple fields, i.e.
:doc:`compound indexes </core/index-compound>`.

The order of fields listed in a compound index has significance. For
instance, if a compound index consists of ``{ userid: 1, score: -1 }``,
the index sorts first by ``userid`` and then, within each ``userid``
value, sorts by ``score``.

.. include:: /images/index-compound-key.rst

For compound indexes and sort operations, the sort order (i.e.
ascending or descending) of the index keys can determine whether the
index can support a sort operation. See
:ref:`index-ascending-and-descending` for more information on the
impact of index order on results in compound indexes.

See also:

- :ref:`index-type-compound`,
- :ref:`sort-on-multiple-fields`, and
- :ref:`esr-indexing-rule` 

Multikey Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses :doc:`multikey indexes </core/index-multikey>` to index the
content stored in arrays. If you index a field that holds an array
value, MongoDB creates separate index entries for *every unique* element
of the array. These :doc:`multikey indexes </core/index-multikey>` allow
queries to select documents that contain arrays by matching on element
or elements of the arrays. MongoDB automatically determines whether to
create a multikey index if the indexed field contains an array value;
you do not need to explicitly specify the multikey type.

.. include:: /images/index-multikey.rst

See :doc:`/core/index-multikey` and :doc:`/core/multikey-index-bounds`
for more information on multikey indexes.

Geospatial Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support efficient queries of geospatial coordinate data, MongoDB
provides two special indexes: :doc:`2d indexes </core/2d>` that uses
planar geometry when returning results and :doc:`2dsphere indexes
</core/2dsphere>` that use spherical geometry to return results.

.. include:: /includes/indexes/sparse-index-considerations.rst

See :ref:`index-feature-geospatial` for a high level introduction to
geospatial indexes.

Text Search Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/indexes/text-search-indexes-overview.rst

.. include:: /includes/indexes/sparse-index-considerations.rst

Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support :ref:`hash based sharding <sharding-hashed-sharding>`,
MongoDB provides a :doc:`hashed index </core/index-hashed>` type,
which indexes the hash of the value of a field. These indexes have a
more random distribution of values along their range, but *only*
support equality matches and cannot support range-based queries.

Clustered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/clustered-collections-introduction.rst

See :ref:`clustered-collections`.

Wildcard Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use wildcard indexes to support
queries against multiple, arbitrary, or unknown fields. When you create
a wildcard index, you specify ``$**`` to represent all fields or all
values, allowing you to index any of the following with a single
command:

- All values of a field
- All fields in a document
- All fields in a document except specific field paths
- Multiple specific fields in a document

To learn more, see :ref:`wildcard-index-core`.

Index Properties
----------------

.. _unique-index:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`unique </core/index-unique>` property for an index causes
MongoDB to reject duplicate values for the indexed field. Other than
the unique constraint, unique indexes are functionally interchangeable
with other MongoDB indexes.

.. _partial-index:

Partial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Partial indexes </core/index-partial>` only index the documents in
a collection that meet a specified filter expression. By indexing a
subset of the documents in a collection, partial indexes have lower
storage requirements and reduced performance costs for index creation
and maintenance.

Partial indexes offer a superset of the functionality of sparse indexes
and should be preferred over sparse indexes.

Sparse Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`sparse </core/index-sparse>` property of an index ensures
that the index only contain entries for documents that have the indexed
field. The index skips documents that *do not* have the indexed field.

You can combine the sparse index option with the unique index option
to prevent inserting documents that have duplicate values for the indexed
field(s) and skip indexing documents that lack the indexed field(s).

.. _ttl-index:

TTL Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`TTL indexes </core/index-ttl>` are special indexes that MongoDB
can use to automatically remove documents from a collection after a
certain amount of time. This is ideal for certain types of information
like machine generated event data, logs, and session information that
only need to persist in a database for a finite amount of time.

See: :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` for implementation instructions.

Hidden Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.4

:doc:`Hidden indexes </core/index-hidden>` are not visible to the
:doc:`query planner </core/query-plans>` and cannot be used to support
a query.

By hiding an index from the planner, users can evaluate the potential
impact of dropping an index without actually dropping the index. If the
impact is negative, the user can unhide the index instead of having to
recreate a dropped index. And because indexes are fully maintained
while hidden, the indexes are immediately available for use once
unhidden.

Except for the ``_id`` index, you can hide any indexes.

Index Use
---------

Indexes can improve the efficiency of read operations. The
:doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan` tutorial provides an example of the
execution statistics of a query with and without an index.

For information on how MongoDB chooses an index to use, see :ref:`query
optimizer <read-operations-query-optimization>`.

Indexes and Collation
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-indexes-2.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-use.rst

For more information on collation, see the :doc:`collation reference
page </reference/collation/>`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-type-restrictions.rst

Covered Queries
---------------

When the query criteria and the :term:`projection` of a query include
*only* the indexed fields, MongoDB returns results directly from
the index *without* scanning any documents or bringing documents into
memory. These covered queries can be *very* efficient.

.. include:: /images/index-for-covered-query.rst

For more information on covered queries, see
:ref:`read-operations-covered-query`.

Index Intersection
------------------

MongoDB can use the :doc:`intersection of indexes
</core/index-intersection>` to fulfill queries. For queries that
specify compound query conditions, if one index can fulfill a part of a
query condition, and another index can fulfill another part of the
query condition, then MongoDB can use the intersection of the two
indexes to fulfill the query. Whether the use of a compound index or
the use of an index intersection is more efficient depends on the
particular query and the system.

For details on index intersection, see :doc:`/core/index-intersection`.

Restrictions
------------

Certain restrictions apply to indexes, such as the length of the index
keys or the number of indexes per collection. See :ref:`Index
Limitations <index-limitations>` for details.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Although indexes can improve query performances, indexes also present
some operational considerations. See :ref:`Operational Considerations
for Indexes <data-model-indexes>` for more information.
