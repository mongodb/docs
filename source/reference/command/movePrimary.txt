.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`shard cluster`, this command reassigns the database's
   primary shard. The primary shard for a database holds all
   un-sharded collections in the database. :dbcommand:`movePrimary`
   is an administrative command that is only available for
   :program:`mongos` instances. Only use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` when
   removing a shard from a shard cluster.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` changes the primary shard for this
   database in the cluster metadata, and migrates all un-sharded
   collections to the specified shard. Use the command with the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { moveprimary : "test", to : "shard0001" }

   When the command returns, the database's primary location will
   shift to the designated :term:`shard`. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeshard` command.

   .. warning::

      Before running :dbcommand:`movePrimary` you must ensure that
      *no* sharded data exists on this shard. You must drain this
      shard before running this command because it will move *all*
      data in this database from this shard. Use the
      :dbcommand:`removeshard` command to migrate sharded data from
      this shard.

      If you do not remove all sharded data collections before running
      :dbcommand:`movePrimary` your shard cluster may have orphaned
      and unreachable data.
