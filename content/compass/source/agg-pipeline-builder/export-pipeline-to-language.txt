         :alt: Aggregation Builder export button

   .. step:: Select your export language 

      On the right side of the card, click the drop-down menu under 
      :guilabel:`Exported Pipeline` and select your desired programming 
      language.

      The :guilabel:`My Pipeline` pane on the left of the export card displays 
      your pipeline in :binary:`mongosh` syntax. The 
      :guilabel:`Exported Pipeline` pane to the right displays your pipeline in 
      the selected programming language.
   
   .. step:: (Optional) Include import statements 

      Click the :guilabel:`Include Import Statements` checkbox to include the 
      required import statements for the selected programming language.

   .. step:: (Optional) Include driver syntax 

      Click the :guilabel:`Include Driver Syntax` checkbox to include 
      application code for the selected programming language. If you include 
      driver syntax, the copyable code reflects :ref:`project 
      <compass-query-bar-project>`, :ref:`sort <compass-query-bar-sort>`, :ref:`maxtimems 
      <compass-query-bar-max-time-ms>`, :ref:`collation <compass-query-bar-collation>`, 
      :ref:`skip <compass-query-bar-skip>` and :ref:`limit <compass-query-bar-limit>` options. 

   .. step:: Click :icon-fa4:`files-o`

      Click the :icon-fa4:`files-o` icon at the top-right of the pipeline to 
      copy your pipeline for the selected programming language. You can now 
      integrate and execute your created pipeline in your application.
