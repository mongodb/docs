Remove
------

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method is the method to
delete documents from a collection. The :method:`remove()
<db.collection.remove()>` method does not delete indexes.

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method has the
following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.delete( <query>, <justOne>)

The :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method is analogous to the
``SQL DELETE`` with the ``query`` argument analogous to the ``WHERE``
statement and the ``justOne`` argument analogous to the ``LIMIT 1``.

Consider the following examples that illustrate the usage of the
:method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method:

- If there is a ``query`` argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes from the collection all
  documents that match the ``query``.
  
  The following operation deletes all documents from the ``csbios``
  collection where the ``first`` field in the subdocument ``name``
  starts with ``G``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove( { 'name.first' : /^G/ } )

- If there is a ``query`` argument and there is a ``justOne`` argument,
  the :method:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes from
  the collection a single documents that match the ``query``.

  The following operation deletes a single documents from the
  ``csbios`` collection where the ``turing`` field equals
  ``true``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove( { turing: true }, 1 )

- If there is no ``query`` argument, the :method:`remove()
  <db.collection.remove()>` method deletes all documents from a
  collection. The method does not remove the indexes on the collection
  nor does it :method:`drop` the collection.
  
  The following operation deletes all documents from the ``csbios``
  collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.csbios.remove()
