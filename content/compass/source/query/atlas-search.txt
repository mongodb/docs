Atlas Search queries are run as an :ref:`aggregation pipeline stage 
<compass-agg-builder>`. If you have an existing Atlas Search Index for data on 
your Atlas cluster, you can run :pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` 
queries. If you have an  existing Atlas Vector search index on your data in 
Atlas, you can also run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. 

Before You Begin 
----------------

Create an :ref:`Atlas Search index <compass-create-search-index>` or an 
:ref:`Atlas Vector Search index <compass-create-vector-search>`.

.. note:: 
   
   Atlas Search index management in the |compass-short| UI is available only 
   for: 
   
   - Atlas local deployments.
   - Deployments running MongoDB 7.0 or later. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Find the index you want to use in your query

      From the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab, click :guilabel:`Search Indexes`. 
      Hover over the search index you want to use in your query. 
      
   .. step:: Open the aggregation pipeline builder
      
      Click the :guilabel:`Aggregate` button that appears when you hover over 
      your search index.
         
   .. step:: Construct your query
      
      By default, |compass| selects the :pipeline:`$search` stage for your 
      query. You can also select the  :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage to use in 
      your query. If you are using a ``vectorSearch`` type index in your query, 
      you can use the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. 

      .. note:: 

         If you use the ``$search``, ``$searchMeta``, or ``$vectorSearch`` 
         stage, it must be the first stage in your aggregation pipeline.
         To combine vector and full-text search in the same pipeline, 
         perform a hybrid search. For more information, 
         see :ref:`as_hybrid-search`.

   .. step:: Run your query
