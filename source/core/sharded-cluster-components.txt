A MongoDB :term:`sharded cluster` consists of the following components:

* :doc:`shard </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`: Each shard contains a
  subset of the sharded data. Each shard can be deployed as a :term:`replica
  set`.

* :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router`: The ``mongos`` acts as a
  query router, providing an interface between client applications and the
  sharded cluster.

* :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`: Config servers
  store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster. As of MongoDB
  3.2, config servers can be deployed as a replica set.

Production Configuration
------------------------

In a production cluster, ensure that data is redundant and
that your systems are highly available. Consider the following
for a production sharded cluster deployment:

- Deploy Config Servers as a 3 member :term:`replica set`
- Deploy each Shard as a 3 member :term:`replica set`
- Deploy one or more :program:`mongos` routers

Where possible, consider deploying one member of each replica set 
in a site suitable for being a disaster recovery location.

Sharding requires at least two shards to distribute sharded data. Single 
shard sharded clusters may be useful if you plan on enabling sharding in the 
near future, but do not need to at the time of deployment.

You can deploy a :program:`mongos` router on each application server to ensure
each server has consistent access to the sharded cluster. Alternatively, 
deploy a group of :program:`mongos` routers and use a proxy or load balancer 
between the application and the :program:`mongos` group. In these deployments,
you *must* configure the load balancer for *client affinity* such that every
connection from a single client reaches the same :program:`mongos`.

Development Configuration
-------------------------

For testing and development, you can deploy a sharded cluster with a
minimum number of components. These **non-production** clusters have the
following components:

- A replica set :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` with one
  member.

- At least one shard as a single-member :term:`replica set`.

- One :program:`mongos` instance.
