.. _mongodb-analyzer-whats-new-2.0:

What's New in 2.0
-----------------

The 2.0 {+product+} release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Supports only {+driver-short+} v3.0 and higher.
- Drops support for the ``MALinq2002`` rule because {+driver-short+} v3.0
  removes the ``LINQ2`` provider.
- Drops support for ``IMongoQueryable``. As a result, the {+product-short+}
  attempts to analyze each ``IQueryable`` object, except for system collections and
  arrays. This version adds the ``LinqAnalysisVerbosity`` option to control
  the verbosity of ``IQueryable`` analysis.

.. _mongodb-analyzer-whats-new-1.5:

What's New in 1.5
-----------------

The 1.5 {+product+} release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- New analysis rules introduced for Entity Framework Core, which enable displaying
  MongoDB Query API translations for MongoDB Entity Framework Core Provider expressions at
  compile time
- Support for strong named 2.28 driver
- Supports fully qualified names for data models

.. _mongodb-analyzer-whats-new-1.4:

What's New in 1.4
-----------------

The 1.4 {+product+} release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Support for builders defined within variables. For example, the {+product-short+}
  analyzes the second line in the following code:

  .. code-block:: csharp
     :emphasize-lines: 2

     var movieFilterBuilder = Builders<Movie>.Filter;
     var filterReviews = movieFilterBuilder.Size(p => p.Reviews, 5);
