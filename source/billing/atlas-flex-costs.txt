- 100 operations/sec
- unlimited data transfer

{+Flex-clusters+} scale with your usage. If you use additional operations/sec,
MongoDB charges you based on the following pricing tiers.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

**Scenario 1 - Monthly Usage**

Your workload runs less than 100 ops/sec for 20 days, and then bursts 
up to 250 ops/second for 5 days. Then, for another 3 days, the workload bursts
to 500 ops/second.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Usage
     - Cost

   * - Your workload runs less than 100 ops/sec for 20 days.
     - $0.011/hour * 24 hours * 20 days = $5.28

   * - The workload bursts up to 250 ops/second for 5 days.
     - $0.0288/hour * 24 hours * 5 days = $3.46
   
   * - The workload bursts to 500 ops/second for another 3 days.
     - $0.0411/hour * 24 hours * 3 days = $2.96

   * - **Total Usage Charge**
     - **$5.28 + $3.46 + $2.96 = $11.70**

**Scenario 2 - One Day Use**

Your workload runs less than 100 ops/sec for 5 hours. It bursts up to
410 ops/second for 10 hours, followed by 9 hours at 150 ops/second. 
After these 24 hours, you delete the {+cluster+}.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Usage
     - Cost

   * - Your workload runs less than 100 ops/sec for 5 hours.
     - $0.011 hourly base cost * 5 hours = $0.055

   * - The workload bursts up to 410 ops/second for 10 hours.
     - $0.0411/hour * 10 hours = $0.41
   
   * - The workload drops to 150 ops/second for another 9 hours.
     - $0.0205/hour * 9 hours = $0.18

   * - You delete the cluster.
     - (no charge)

   * - **Total Usage Charge**
     - **$0.055 + $0.41 + $0.18 = $0.65**
