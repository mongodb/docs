|mms| provides several tools to help analyze slow queries
executed on your clusters. See the following sections for descriptions 
of each tool. To optimize your query performance, 
:ref:`review the best practices for query performance 
<query-best-practices>`.

Performance Advisor
-------------------

The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` monitors slow 
queries and suggests new indexes to improve query performance.

You can use the Performance Advisor to review the following information:

- :ref:`Index Ranking <pa-index-ranking>`
- :ref:`Drop Index Recommendations <pa-drop-index>`

Profiler
--------

The :ref:`Profiler <profile-databases>` displays slow-running 
operations and their key performance statistics. You can explore a 
sample of historical queries for up to the last 24 hours without 
additional performance overhead. Before you enable the 
Profiler, see :ref:`Considerations <considerations-profile-database>`.

Best Practices for Query Performance
------------------------------------

To optimize query performance, review the following best practices:

- Create queries that your current indexes support to reduce the time 
  needed to search for your results.
  
- Avoid creating documents with large array fields that require a lot 
  of processing to search and index.

- Optimize your indexes and remove unused or inefficent indexes. Too 
  many indexes can negatively affect write performance.

- Consider the suggested indexes from the :ref:`Performance Advisor 
  <performance-advisor>` with the highest :guilabel:`Impact` scores and 
  lowest :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting` scores.

- Create the indexes that the Performance Advisor suggests when they 
  align with your :manual:`Indexing Strategies 
  </applications/indexes/>`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-performance-advisor-timestamp.rst

- Perform :manual:`rolling index builds
  </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/#rolling-index-builds-on-replica-sets>`
  to reduce the performance impact of building indexes on 
  :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and :term:`sharded clusters 
  <sharded cluster>`.

- :ref:`Drop unused, redundant, and hidden indexes <pa-drop-index>` to 
  improve write performance and free storage space.
