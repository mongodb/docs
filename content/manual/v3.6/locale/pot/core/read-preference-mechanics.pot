msgid "The ``maxStalenessSeconds`` read preference option is intended for applications that read from secondaries and want to avoid reading from a secondary that has fallen overly far behind in replicating the primary's writes. For example, a secondary might stop replicating due to a network outage between itself and the primary. In that case, the client should stop reading from the secondary until an administrator resolves the outage and the secondary catches up."
