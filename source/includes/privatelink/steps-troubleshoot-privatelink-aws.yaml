  The :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab on the :guilabel:`Network Access`
  page lists each private endpoint you've created. The 
  :guilabel:`Atlas Endpoint Service Status` and 
  :guilabel:`Endpoint Status` fields show the status of each 
  private endpoint.

  Refer to the following statuses to help you determine the state of
  your private endpoint connections:

  :guilabel:`Atlas Endpoint Service Status`

     * - Status
       - Description

     * - Creating private link
       - |cloudgov-short| is creating the network load balancer 
         and |vpc| resources. 

     * - Failed
       - A system failure has occurred. 

     * - Ready for connection requests
       - The |cloudgov-short| network load balancer and |vpc| 
         endpoint service are created and ready to receive connection 
         requests.

     * - Deleting
       - |cloudgov-short| is deleting the private endpoint service.

     * - Status
       - Description

     * - Not configured
       - |cloudgov-short| created the network load balancer and |vpc| 
         endpoint 
         service, but |aws| hasn't yet created the interface endpoint.
         Click :guilabel:`Edit` and complete the wizard to create the
         interface endpoint.

     * - Pending acceptance
       - |aws| has received the connection request from your 
         interface endpoint to the |cloudgov-short| |vpc| endpoint 
         service.
       
     * - Pending
       - |aws| is establishing the connection between your
         interface endpoint and the |cloudgov-short| |vpc| endpoint 
         service.

     * - Failed
       - |aws| failed to establish a connection between 
         |cloudgov-short| 
         |vpc| resources and the interface endpoint in your |vpc|. 
         Click :guilabel:`Edit`, verify that the information you 
         provided is correct, and then create the private endpoint 
         again.

         .. important::

            If your interface endpoint fails, you might see
            the following message:

            .. example::

               No dns entries found for endpoint vpce-<guid>, 
               your endpoint must be provisioned in at least one subnet 
               Click "Edit" to fix the problem.

            This message indicated that you didn't specify
            a subnet when you created the {+aws-pl+}
            connection. To resolve this error:
            
            1. Click :guilabel:`Edit`. 
            #. Click :guilabel:`Back`. 
            #. Specify at least one subnet.
            #. Follow the remaining instructions to create
               the {+aws-pl+} connection.

     * - Available
       - |cloudgov-short| |vpc| resources are connected to the 
         interface endpoint in your |vpc|. You can connect to 
         |cloudgov-short| clusters in this region using {+aws-pl+}.

     * - Deleting
       - |cloudgov-short| is removing the interface endpoint from the 
         private endpoint service.

  a. For each resource that needs to connect to your |cloudgov-short| 
     clusters using {+aws-pl+}, the resource's security group must 
     allow outbound traffic to the interface endpoint's private IP(s) 
     on all ports.

     See :aws:`Adding Rules to a Security Group </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>`
     for more information.

  #. Your interface endpoint security group must allow inbound
     traffic on all ports from each resource that needs to connect to
     your |cloudgov-short| clusters using {+aws-pl+}.

     :aws:`Whitelist instance IP addresses or security groups </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>`
     to allow traffic from them to reach the interface endpoint 
     security group.
