:ref:`edit-backup-settings`
  Edit backup's settings, security credentials, snapshot schedule and retention policy.
  You can also change the backup's storage engine, and the preferred member for backup.

:ref:`stop-restart-terminate-backup`
  Stop backups for a replica set or sharded cluster. When you stop backups,
  |mms| stops taking new snapshots and retains existing snapshots. When
  you terminate a backup, |mms| deletes snapshots and runs the next backup
  job as a full backup.

:ref:`view-backup-snapshots`
  View all available backup snapshots.

:ref:`delete-backup-snapshots`
  Delete snapshots for replica sets and sharded clusters.

:ref:`resync-backup`
  Deprecated. You don't need to resync MongoDB databases that run with an
  |fcv-link| of 4.2 or later.

:ref:`disable-backup`
  Disable backup, which deletes all snapshots. If you later re-enable backup,
  this requires an :cloudmgr:`inital sync </reference/glossary/#std-term-initial-sync>`.

:ref:`change-backup-region`
  Change your backup region to any of the regions that support backups.
