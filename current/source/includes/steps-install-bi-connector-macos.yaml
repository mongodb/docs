  The MongoDB release team digitally signs all software packages to
  certify that a particular MongoDB package is a valid and unaltered
  MongoDB release. The ``bi-connector.asc`` key to validate the BI
  Connector is available on `pgp.mongodb.com <https://pgp.mongodb.com/bi-connector.asc>`__ 
  as a PGP key in ``.asc`` format.  

  a. Run the following command to downloaded the ``.sig`` file. 
       
     .. code-block:: sh 
            
        curl -LO https://info-mongodb-com.s3.amazonaws.com/mongodb-bi/v2/mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}.zip.sig

  #. Run the following command to download the import key file. 

     .. io-code-block::
        :copyable: true 

        .. input:: 
           :language: shell 

           curl -LO https://pgp.mongodb.com/bi-connector.asc
           gpg --import bi-connector.asc

        .. output:: 
           :language: shell 

           gpg: key 1CCF1A1263CDD699: public key "MongoDB BI Connector Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>" imported
           gpg: Total number processed: 1
           gpg:               imported: 1

  #. Run the following command to verify the MongoDB installation file.

     .. code-block:: shell
        
        gpg --verify mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}.zip.sig mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}.zip
        

     GPG should return this response:

     .. code-block:: shell

        gpg: Signature made Thu Jun 13 10:17:03 2024 PDT
        gpg:                using RSA key BD66803ABD3EB56953142EE51CCF1A1263CDD699
        gpg: Good signature from "MongoDB BI Connector Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>" [unknown]

     If the package is properly signed, but you do not currently trust
     the signing key in your local ``trustdb``, ``gpg`` will also return
     the following message: 

     .. code-block:: shell 

        gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
        gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
        Primary key fingerprint: BD66 803A BD3E B569 5314  2EE5 1CCF 1A12 63CD D699

     If you receive the following error message, confirm that you
     imported the correct public key: 

     .. code-block:: shell 

        gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

  a. Extract the downloaded ``.zip`` archive. Replace {SOURCE-PATH} with
     the path to the directory where you downloaded the ``.zip``
     archive. Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory
     where you want to extract the archive.

     
     .. code-block:: sh

        unzip {SOURCE-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}.zip -d {DESTINATION-PATH}

  b. Change to the ``mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}`` directory.
     Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory
     where you extracted the archive in the previous step.

     .. code-block:: sh

        cd {DESTINATION-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-{x86_64|arm64-macos{11|13}}-{version}/
  
  c. Install the programs within the ``bin/`` directory into a directory
     listed in your system ``PATH``. If a prior version exists, 
     overwrite the binaries.

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo install -m755 bin/mongo* /usr/local/bin/
...
