When you run ``main.go``, it should output the details of the movie from
the sample dataset which looks something like the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "_id": "573a1398f29313caabce9682",
       ...
       "title": "Back to the Future",
       ...
   }

If you receive no output or an error, check whether you properly set up
your environment variable and whether you loaded the sample dataset in
your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
