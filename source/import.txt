You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV``
files into deployments in |service| using either:

- live migration where |service| assists you, or
- tools for a self-guided migration of data from your existing deployments
  into |service|.

Tools for Migrating to |service|
--------------------------------

The following table discusses how to choose between different tools for
data migration and import for common cluster configurations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55

   * - Source Cluster Configuration
     - Import Strategy

   * - A MongoDB deployment that is managed by |com|.

     - Use :ref:`live migration (push) <migrate-from-com>` where |com|
       **pushes** data to |service| using a secure :term:`link-token` without
       requiring access to the source cluster through the cluster's firewall.

   * - A MongoDB deployment that is not managed by |com|.

     - Use :ref:`live migration (pull) <live-migration>` where |service|
       **pulls** data from the source deployment and requires access to
       the source deployment through the deployment's firewall.

   * - A shared multi-tenant cluster, or a cluster where you have no
       access to the oplog, or a cluster that runs a MongoDB version
       that is no longer supported.

     - Use :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`.

   * - A standard "single :term:`shard`" :term:`sharded cluster` MongoDB
       deployment in Compose.

     - `Migrate from Compose to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-compose/>`__.

   * - A replica set in |aws|.

     - `Migrate a MongoDB Replica Set from AWS to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-aws-to-atlas/>`__.

- To load data into a new cluster in |service|, see :ref:`Load Sample Data <sample-data>`.
- To make a copy of your cluster for testing purposes, see :manual:`MongoDB Backup Methods </core/backups>`.
- If the application that you want to migrate requires a near-continuous
  uptime, contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>` and share your
  uptime requirements and cluster configuration.
