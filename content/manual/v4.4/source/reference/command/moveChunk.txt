.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   Internal administrative command. Moves :term:`chunks <chunk>` between
   :term:`shards <shard>`. Issue the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command via
   a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance while using the :term:`admin database`.
   Use the following forms:


   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.moveChunk` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   .. code-block:: javascript


      db.adminCommand(
        {
          moveChunk: <namespace>,
          find: <query>,
          to: <string>,
          forceJumbo: <boolean>, // Starting in MongoDB 4.4
          _secondaryThrottle: <boolean>,
          writeConcern: <document>,
          _waitForDelete: <boolean>
        }
      )

   Alternatively:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand(
        {
          moveChunk: <namespace>,
          bounds: <array>,
          to: <string>,
          forceJumbo: <boolean>, // Starting in MongoDB 4.4
          _secondaryThrottle: <boolean>,
          writeConcern: <document>,
          _waitForDelete: <boolean>
        }
      )

   The :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description
   
      * - ``moveChunk``
        - string
        - The :term:`namespace` of the :term:`collection` where the
          :term:`chunk` exists. Specify the collection's full namespace,
          including the database name.

      * - ``find``
        - document
        - An equality match on the shard key that specifies the shard-key value
          of the chunk to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the
          ``find`` field but not both. Do **not** use the ``find`` field to
          select chunks in collections that use a :term:`hashed shard key`.

      * - ``bounds``
        - array
        - The bounds of a specific chunk to move. The array must consist of two
          documents that specify the lower and upper shard key values of a chunk
          to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the ``find`` field but
          not both. Use ``bounds`` to select chunks in collections that use a
          :term:`hashed shard key`.

          The value of ``bounds`` takes the following form:

          .. code-block:: javascript

             [ { hashedField : <minValue> } ,
               { hashedField : <maxValue> } ]

      * - ``to``
        - string
        - The name of the destination shard for the chunk.

      * - ``forceJumbo``
        - boolean
        - .. _movechunk-forceJumbo:
        
          Optional. A flag that determines if the command can move a
          chunk that is :ref:`too large to migrate
          <migration-chunk-size-limit>`. The chunk may or may not be
          labeled as :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`.

          - If ``true``, the command can move the chunk.

          - If ``false``, the command cannot move the chunk.

          The default is ``false``.

          .. warning::

             When you run :dbcommand:`moveChunk` with :ref:`forceJumbo:
             true <movechunk-forceJumbo>`, write operations to the
             collection may block for a long period of time during the
             migration. To migrate these large chunks without this long
             blocking period, see
             :ref:`balance-chunks-that-exceed-size-limit` instead.

          .. versionadded:: 4.4

      * - ``_secondaryThrottle``
        - boolean
        - Optional. Default is ``false``. 
             
          - If ``true``, then each document moved during chunk migration
            propagates to secondary members according to the write
            concern specified in the ``writeConcern`` field before the
            balancer proceeds with the next document.
            
            If ``_secondaryThrottle`` is ``true``, you must also specify
            the ``writeConcern`` field.
          
          - If ``false``, the balancer does not wait for replication to a
            secondary and instead continues with the next document.
          
          For more information, see
          :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.

      * - ``writeConcern``
        - document
        - Required if ``_secondaryThrottle`` is ``true``.
        
          A document containing the :ref:`write concern <write-concern>`
          that the ``_secondaryThrottle`` uses to wait for secondaries
          during the chunk migration.

          If ``_secondaryThrottle`` is ``false``, the ``writeConcern``
          field is ignored.

      * - ``_waitForDelete``
        - boolean
        - Optional. Internal option for testing purposes. The default is ``false``. If set
          to ``true``, the delete phase of a :dbcommand:`moveChunk` operation
          blocks.

   To learn how chunks move between shards, see
   :ref:`sharding-chunk-migration`.

Considerations
--------------

Only use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` in special circumstances
such as preparing your :term:`sharded cluster` for an initial
ingestion of data, or a large bulk import operation.  In most cases
allow the balancer to create and balance chunks in sharded clusters.
See :doc:`/tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster` for more information.

Behavior
--------

Indexes
~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`moveChunk` requires that all indexes exist on the
target (i.e. ``to`` ) shard before migration and returns an error if a
required index does not exist.

Meta Data Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`moveChunk` returns the following error message if another
metadata operation is in progress on the :data:`~config.chunks` collection:

.. code-block:: none

   errmsg: "The collection's metadata lock is already taken."

If another process, such as a balancer process, changes meta data
while :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is running, you may see this
error. You may retry the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` operation without
side effects.

``maxCatchUpPercentageBeforeBlockingWrites`` Server Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4.7 (and 4.2.15, 4.0.26), you can set the
:parameter:`maxCatchUpPercentageBeforeBlockingWrites` to specify the
maximum allowed percentage of data not yet migrated
during a :dbcommand:`moveChunk` operation when compared to the
total size (in MBs) of the chunk being transferred.
