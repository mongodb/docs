To minimize the impact of building an index on replica sets and sharded
clusters with replica set shards, use the following procedure to build
indexes in a rolling fashion.

This procedure *does* take one member out of the replica set at a time.
However, this procedure will only affect one member of the set at a
time rather than *all* secondaries at the same time.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` using the following
procedure, you must stop all writes to the collection during this
procedure.

If you cannot stop all writes to the collection during this procedure,
do not use the procedure on this page. Instead, build your unique index
on the collection by:

- issuing :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` on the primary for a
  replica set, or

- issuing :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` on the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` for a sharded cluster.

Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that your :term:`oplog` is large enough to permit the indexing
or re-indexing operation to complete without falling too far behind to
catch up. See the :ref:`oplog sizing <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`
documentation for additional information.


Procedure
---------

.. note::

   If you need to build an index in a :term:`sharded cluster`, repeat
   the following procedure for each replica set that provides each
   :term:`shard`.

   To create :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` using the
   following procedure, you must stop all writes to the collection
   during the index build. Otherwise, you may end up with inconsistent
   data across the replica set members. If you cannot stop all writes to
   the collection, do not use the following procedure to create unique
   indexes.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member:

Stop One Secondary and Restart as a Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process on one secondary. Restart the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process, making the following configuration updates:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
      - id: config-file
        name: Configuration File
        content: |

           If you are using a configuration file, make the following
           configuration updates:

           - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.

           - Change the :setting:`net.port` to a different port. [#different-port]_
             Make a note of the original port setting as a comment.

           - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
             :term:`config server` member, you must also:

             - Comment out the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option.

             - Set parameter :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks`
               (also available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
               ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

           For example, for a shard/config server replica set member,
           the updated configuration file will include content like the
           following example:

           .. code-block:: yaml

              net:
                 bindIp: localhost,<ip address of the mongod host>
                 port: 27218
              #   port: 27018
              #replication:
              #   replSetName: shardA
              #sharding:
              #   clusterRole: shardsvr
              setParameter:
                 skipShardingConfigurationChecks: true

      - id: command-line
        name: Command-line Options
        content: |

           If using command-line options, make the following
           configuration updates:

           - Remove :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`.

           - Modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` to a different port. [#different-port]_

           - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
             :term:`config server` member, you must also:

             - Remove :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>` if a
               shard member and :option:`--configsvr <mongod
               --configsvr>` if a config server member.

             - Set parameter
               :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks`
               (also available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
               ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

       This instance is now in "standalone" mode.

       For example, if your :binary:`~bin.mongod` *normally* runs with
       on the default port of ``27017`` with the :option:`--replSet
       <mongod --replSet>` option you would use the following
       invocation:

       .. code-block:: sh

          mongod --port 47017

.. [#different-port] By running the :binary:`~bin.mongod` on a different
   port, you ensure that the other members of the replica set and all
   clients will not contact the member while you are building the
   index.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index:

Build the Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the new index using the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, or comparable method in your
driver. This operation will create or rebuild the index on this
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

For example, to create an ascending index on the ``username`` field of
the ``records`` collection, use the following :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
operation:

.. code-block:: sh

   db.records.createIndex( { username: 1 } )

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod:

Restart the Program ``mongod`` as a Replica Set Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the index build completes, restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance as a member of the replica set using its normal
configuration file or command-line arguments. That is, undo the configuration
changes made when starting as a standalone.

For shard or config server members, be sure to remove the
:parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks` parameter.

For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 27017 --replSet rs0

Allow replication to catch up on this member.

Repeat the Procedure for the Remaining Secondaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the member catches up with the other members of the set, repeat
the procedure one member at a time for the remaining secondary members:

#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member`

#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index`

#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod`

Build the Index on the Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When all the secondaries have the new index, step down the primary,
restart it as a standalone using the procedure described above, 
and build the index on the former primary:

#. Use the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to step down the primary. Upon successful stepdown, the current primary
   becomes a secondary and the replica set members elect a new primary.
