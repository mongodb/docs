MongoDB provides built-in roles that provide the different levels of
access commonly needed in a database system. Built-in :ref:`database user
roles <database-user-roles>` and :ref:`database administration roles
<database-administration-roles>` roles exist in *each* database. The
``admin`` database contains additional roles.

This page provides a brief description of the built-in roles. For the
specific privileges granted by each role, see the
:doc:`/reference/built-in-roles` reference page.
