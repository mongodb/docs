  Specifies the :ref:`authentication mechanism

  For available mechanisms, see :ref:`authentication mechanisms
  <mongo-shell-authentication-mechanisms>`. 

  If unspecified, uses the :dbcommand:`isMaster` to determine the SASL
  mechanism or mechanisms for the specified user. See
  :data:`~isMaster.saslSupportedMechs`.

   Determines whether or not the supplied password should be pre-hashed
   before being used with the specified authentication mechanism. 

   - For :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <scram-mechanisms>`, although you may
     specify ``true``, setting this value to ``true`` does not improve
     security and may interfere with credentials using other mechanisms.

   - For all other methods, this value must be set to ``false``
     (default value). Any other value will result in authentication
     failure since those methods do not understand MongoDB pre-hashing.

   The default value is ``false``.
