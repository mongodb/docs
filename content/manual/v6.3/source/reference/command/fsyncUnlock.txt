Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: fsyncUnlock

   Reduces the lock taken by :dbcommand:`fsync` (with the lock option)
   on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance by 1.

   .. important::

      The :dbcommand:`fsync` ``lock`` and :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock`
      operations maintain a lock count. Each :dbcommand:`fsync` ``lock``
      operation increments the lock count, and :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock`
      decrements the lock count.

      To unlock a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for writes, the lock count
      must be zero. That is, for a given number of :dbcommand:`fsync`
      ``lock`` operations, you must issue a corresponding number of
      :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` operations to unlock the instance for
      writes.

   :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` is an administrative operation. Typically
   you will use :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` following a database
   :ref:`backup operation <backup-methods>`.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
      { 
        fsyncUnlock: 1, 
        comment: <any> 
      } 
   )

The ``comment`` field is optional and may contain a comment of any data
type.

Results
-------

The operation returns a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
 
   * - Field
     - Description
 
   * - ``info``
     - Information on the status of the operation
 
   * - ``lockCount`` (*New in version 3.4*)
     - The number of locks remaining on the instance after the operation.
 
   * - ``ok``
     - The status code.
 
.. tip::

   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the helper method
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.
 
Examples
--------

Consider a situation where :method:`db.fsyncLock()` has been issued two
times. The following :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` operation reduces the
locks taken by :method:`db.fsyncLock()` by 1:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsyncUnlock: 1 } )

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "fsyncUnlock completed", "lockCount" : NumberLong(1), "ok" : 1 }

As the ``lockCount`` is greater than 0, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
is locked against writes. To unlock the instance for writes, run the
unlock operation again:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsyncUnlock: 1 } )

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "fsyncUnlock completed", "lockCount" : NumberLong(0), "ok" : 1 }

The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is unlocked for writes.
