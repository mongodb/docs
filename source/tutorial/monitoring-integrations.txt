You can use a third-party application to view and analyze
:ref:`performance metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` that |service|
collects about your cluster.

At this time, you can either build a monitoring integration using the
{+atlas-admin-api+} or integrate |service| with |datadog|.

Build Monitoring Integrations with the {+atlas-admin-api+}
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can build a monitoring integration using the |service|
:doc:`API monitoring and logs endpoints
</reference/api/monitoring-and-logs/>`.

.. _datadog-integration:

Integrate |service| with Datadog
--------------------------------

You can configure |service| to send metric data about your project to
your |datadog| dashboards.

.. note::

   If your |service| project is configured to send alerts and events
   to Datadog, you do not need to follow this procedure. |service|
   sends project metrics to Datadog through the same integration used
   to send :ref:`alerts and events <notification-options>`.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| integration is only available on ``M10+`` clusters.

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have a Datadog account
and a Datadog |api| key. Datadog grants you an |api| key when you first
create a Datadog account.

If you do not have an existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
`<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To configure |service| integration with |datadog|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-datadog-integration.rst

Performance Metrics Available to Datadog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| tracks the following metric data for your |service|
cluster. The metric names in parentheses are the names used in
the Datadog :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`. Each metric is measured once
per minute.

.. note::
   
   The ``clustername`` tag identifies the |service| cluster associated 
   with the metric.
