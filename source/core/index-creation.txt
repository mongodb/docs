Index Build Operations on a Populated Collection
================================================

By default, creating an index on a populated collection blocks all
other operations on a database. When building an index on a populated
collection, the database that holds the collection is unavailable for
read or write operations until the index build completes. Any operation
that requires a read or write lock on all databases (e.g.
:command:`listDatabases`) will wait for the foreground index build to
complete.

.. index:: index; background creation
.. _index-creation-background:

Background Construction
-----------------------

.. note::

   The following section refers to building indexes on a standalone.
   For a replica set or a sharded cluster, use a rolling index build.
   See :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets` for details.

For potentially long running index building operations on standalone
deployments, consider the ``background`` option so that the MongoDB
database remains available during the index building operation.

For example, to create an index in the background of the ``zipcode``
field of the ``people`` collection, issue the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.createIndex( { zipcode: 1 }, { background: true } )

By default, ``background`` is ``false`` for building MongoDB indexes.

You can combine the background option with other options, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.createIndex( { zipcode: 1 }, { background: true, sparse: true } )

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Background indexing operations run in the background so that other database
operations can run while creating the index. However, the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell session or connection where you are creating
the index *will* block until the index build is complete. To continue
issuing commands to the database, open another
connection or :binary:`~bin.mongo` instance.

Queries will not use partially-built indexes: the index will only be
usable once the index build is complete.

.. note::

   If MongoDB is building an index in the background, you cannot
   perform other administrative operations involving that collection,
   including running :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, dropping the
   collection (i.e. :method:`db.collection.drop()`), and running
   :dbcommand:`compact`. These operations will return an error during
   background index builds.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

The background index operation uses an incremental approach that is
slower than the normal "foreground" index builds. If the index is
larger than the available RAM, then the incremental process can take
*much* longer than the foreground build.

Building an index can have a severe impact on the performance of the
database. If possible, build indexes during designated maintenance
windows.

Interrupted Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a background index build is in progress when a standalone (i.e. not
a member of a replica set) :binary:`~bin.mongod` terminates, when the
instance restarts the index build will restart as foreground index
build. If the index build encounters any errors, such as a duplicate
key error, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will exit with an error.

To start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` standalone (i.e. not a member of a
replica set) after a failed index build, use the
:setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` or :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry
<mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` to skip the index build on start up.

.. admonition:: MongoDB 4.0+
   :class: note

   You cannot specify :setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` or
   :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry <mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` for a
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` that is part of a replica set.

Rollbacks and Background Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB waits for any in-progress
:ref:`background index builds <index-creation-background>` to finish
before starting a :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

Build Indexes on Replica Sets and Sharded Clusters
--------------------------------------------------

To minimize the impact of building an index on:

- Replica Sets, use a rolling index build procedure as described in
  :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`.

- Sharded Clusters with Shard Replica Sets, use a rolling index build
  procedure as described in
  :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters`.

If not using the rolling index build procedure:

- A foreground index build on a :term:`primary` requires a DB
  lock. It replicates as a foreground index build on :term:`replica
  set` :term:`secondaries <secondary>`, and the replication worker
  takes a global DB lock that queues reads and writes to all databases
  on the indexing server.

- A background index build on a primary replicates as background index
  builds on secondaries. The replication worker does not take a global
  DB lock, and secondary reads are not affected.

- For both foreground and background index builds on the primary, the
  index operations on replica set secondaries begin after the primary
  finishes building the index.

The amount of time required to build the index on a secondary must be
within the window of the :term:`oplog`, so that the secondary can
catch up with the primary.

Dropping an Index during Index Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid dropping an index on a collection while any index is being
replicated on a secondary. If you attempt to drop an index from a
collection on a :term:`primary` while the collection has a background
index building on a :term:`secondary`, reads will be halted across all
namespaces and replication will halt until the background index build
completes.

.. index:: index; name
.. _index-names:

Index Names
-----------

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys
and each key's direction in the index, 1 or -1.

.. example:: Issue the following command to create an index on ``item``
   and ``quantity``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.createIndex( { item: 1, quantity: -1 } )

   The resulting index is named: ``item_1_quantity_-1``.

Optionally, you can specify a name for an index instead of using the
default name.

.. example:: Issue the following command to create an index on ``item``
   and ``quantity`` and specify ``inventory`` as the index name:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.products.createIndex( { item: 1, quantity: -1 } , { name: "inventory" } )

   The resulting index has the name ``inventory``.

To view the name of an index, use the :method:`getIndexes()
<db.collection.getIndexes()>` method.

View Index Build Operations
---------------------------

To see the status of an index build operation, you can use the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. To
filter the current operations for index creation operations, see
:ref:`currentOp-index-creation` for an example.

The :data:`~currentOp.msg` field will include the percent of the build
that is complete.

Terminate Index Build Operation
-------------------------------

To terminate an ongoing index build, use the :method:`db.killOp()`
method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. For index builds, the effects of
:method:`db.killOp()` may not be immediate and may occur well after
much of the index build operation has completed.

You cannot terminate a *replicated* index build on secondary members of
a replica set.

clusters with replica set shards, see:
