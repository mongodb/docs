   GraphQL is deprecated. :ref:`Learn More <migrate-hosting-graphql>`.

Every User object contains a JWT token that you can use to access Atlas App Services.

You can use the access token to query the Atlas GraphQL API from your client application.
Use any GraphQL client to query the Atlas GraphQL API, such as `graphql_flutter <https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_flutter>`__.
To learn more about setting up and querying the Atlas GraphQL API,
refer to :ref:`graphql-api` in the App Services documentation.

Retrieve the Access Token
-------------------------

You can get the access token with the :flutter-sdk:`User.accessToken
<realm/User/accessToken.html>` property.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/access_token_test.snippet.get-access-token.dart
   :language: dart

Refresh the Access Token
------------------------

The access token expires 30 minutes after a user logs in. It does not refresh automatically.
Refresh it with :flutter-sdk:`User.refreshCustomData() <realm/User/refreshCustomData.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/access_token_test.snippet.refresh-access-token.dart
   :language: dart

You can also periodically refresh the access token 
with `Timer.periodic() <https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Timer-class.html>`__
from the ``dart:async`` library. Wrap the call to ``User.refreshCustomData()``
with the timer's callback function.
