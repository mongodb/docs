Object and Value Comparison for MongoDB Document Validation

This module implements the core comparison engine for MongoDB documents and nested
data structures. It's designed specifically for validating code example outputs
against expected results, handling the complexities of MongoDB's flexible schema
and varied data representation.

Key Features:
    1. Deep Structural Comparison: Recursively compares nested objects and arrays
    2. MongoDB Type Normalization: Handles ObjectId, ISODate, and numeric variations
    3. Flexible Field Handling: Supports ignored fields and optional fields
    4. Ellipsis Pattern Support: Wildcard matching for partial validation
    5. Performance Safeguards: Timeout and recursion depth protection

Comparison Philosophy:
    The engine balances strict validation with practical flexibility:
    - Structural similarity is more important than exact representation
    - MongoDB type variations (int32 vs int64) are normalized
    - Field order in objects doesn't matter (unlike arrays)
    - Missing fields can be allowed or forbidden based on use case

Performance Characteristics:
    - Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n is expected structure size, m is actual
    - Space Complexity: O(d) where d is maximum nesting depth
    - Bounded Execution: Timeout and recursion limits prevent runaway comparisons
    - Early Termination: Fails fast on first structural mismatch

MongoDB-Specific Design Decisions:
    1. ObjectIds are compared as strings for reproducibility
    2. Dates/timestamps use ISO string comparison for consistency
    3. Numeric types are compared by value, not by specific type
    4. Binary data is base64-normalized for reliable comparison
    5. Decimal128 values are compared with appropriate precision

Error Reporting Strategy:
    - JSONPath-style location reporting (e.g., "$.users[0].address.city")
    - Specific error types for different mismatch categories
    - Helpful suggestions for common comparison failures
    - Context about what comparison strategy was attempted

Maintainer Notes:
    The comparison context (_Ctx) is the heart of the configuration system:
    - Tracks recursion depth and timeout to prevent infinite loops
    - Maintains ignore_fields set for flexible validation
    - Controls array comparison strategy selection
    - Provides early termination hooks for performance

class _Ctx:
    """
    Comparison context that tracks state and configuration during recursive comparison.

    This class serves as the central configuration and state management system
    for the comparison engine. It's designed to be passed down through recursive
    calls to maintain consistent behavior and prevent infinite loops.

    Design Rationale:
        Rather than passing individual parameters through every recursive call,
        the context object encapsulates all configuration and state. This makes
        the API cleaner and allows adding new features without breaking existing
        function signatures.

    Attributes:
        ignore_fields (Set[str]): Field names to skip during object comparison
        allow_omitted_fields (bool): Whether missing fields in actual are acceptable
        start_time (float | None): Monotonic time when comparison started
        timeout_seconds (float): Maximum allowed comparison time
        max_depth (int): Maximum recursion depth to prevent stack overflow
        current_depth (int): Current recursion level (0 at top level)
        comparison_type (str | None): Array comparison strategy preference
        array_size_threshold (int): Size limit for expensive array algorithms

    Performance Notes:
        - start_time uses monotonic clock for reliable timeout measurement
        - timeout_seconds can be adjusted for complex documents or slow systems
        - max_depth prevents stack overflow on circular or deeply nested data
        - array_size_threshold balances accuracy vs performance for large arrays

    Recursively compare two values of any type using MongoDB-aware semantics.

    This is the core comparison function that handles all data types and
    recursive structures. It's designed specifically for MongoDB document
    validation with support for flexible schemas and type variations.

    Comparison Order (optimized for common patterns):
        1. Recursion and timeout safety checks
        2. Ellipsis pattern matching (wildcards)
        3. Null/None value handling
        4. MongoDB type normalization
        5. Primitive value comparison with numeric flexibility
        6. Array comparison using strategy selection
        7. Object comparison with field handling
        8. Type mismatch detection and reporting

    Args:
        expected (Any): Expected value (can be any type)
        actual (Any): Actual value to compare against expected
        path (str): JSONPath location for error reporting (e.g., "$.users[0].name")
        ctx (_Ctx): Comparison context with configuration and state

    Raises:
        ComparisonError: If values don't match according to comparison rules

    Design Philosophy:
        The function prioritizes practical usability over strict type matching:
        - MongoDB's flexible types are normalized before comparison
        - Numeric types are compared by value, not by specific representation
        - String prefixes can be matched with ellipsis ("text...")
        - Objects support partial matching with ignored or optional fields

    MongoDB Type Handling:
        - ObjectId: Converted to string representation
        - ISODate: Normalized to ISO format string
        - NumberInt/NumberLong: Compared numerically
        - Binary: Base64-encoded for comparison
        - Decimal128: Handled with appropriate precision

    Performance Characteristics:
        - Early termination on first mismatch for fail-fast behavior
        - Ellipsis patterns avoid unnecessary deep comparison
        - Normalization is cached within single comparison operation
        - Recursion limits prevent exponential blowup on malformed data

    Error Context:
        Every error includes the JSONPath location where the mismatch occurred,
        making it easy to identify problematic data in large documents.
