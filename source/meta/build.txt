==================================
MongoDB Documentation Build System
==================================

This document contains more direct instructions for building the
MongoDB documentation.

Getting Started
---------------

Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Documentation project depends on the following tools:

- GNU Make
- GNU Tar
- Python
- Git
- Sphinx (documentation management toolchain)
- Pygments (syntax highlighting)
- PyYAML (for the generated tables)
- Droopy (Python package for static text analysis)
- Fabric (Python package for scripting and orchestration)
- Inkscape (Image generation.)
- python-argparse (For Python 2.6.)
- LaTeX/PDF LaTeX (typically texlive; for building PDFs)
- Common Utilities (rsync, tar, gzip, sed)

OS X
````

Install Sphinx, Docutils, and their dependencies with ``easy_install``
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   easy_install Sphinx Jinja2 Pygments docutils  PyYAML droopy fabric

Feel free to use ``pip`` rather than ``easy_install`` to install
python packages.

To generate the images used in the documentation, `download and
install Inkscape <http://inkscape.org/download/>`_.

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install a TeX
   distribution (for building the PDF.) If you do not have a LaTeX
   installation, use `MacTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/>`_. This
   is **only** required to build PDFs.

Arch Linux
``````````

Install packages from the system repositories with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   pacman -S python2-sphinx python2-yaml inkscape python2-pip

Then install the following Python packages:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install droopy fabric

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install the
   following packages from the system repository:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pacman -S texlive-bin texlive-core texlive-latexextra

Debian/Ubuntu
`````````````

Install the required system packages with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install python-sphinx python-yaml python-argparse inkscape python-pip

Then install the following Python packages:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install droopy fabric

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install the
   following packages from the system repository:

   .. code-block:: sh

      apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-recommended

Setup and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git://github.com/mongodb/docs.git

Then run the ``bootstrap.py`` script in the ``docs/`` repository, to
configure the build dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

   python bootstrap.py

This downloads and configures the `mongodb/docs-tools
<http://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools/>`_ repository, which contains
the authoritative build system shared between branches of the MongoDB
Manual and other MongoDB documentation projects.

You can run ``bootstrap.py`` regularly to update build system.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The MongoDB documentation build system is entirely accessible via
``make`` targets. For example, to build an HTML version of the
documentation issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   make html

You can find the build output in ``build/<branch>/html``, where
``<branch>`` is the name of the current branch.

In addition to the ``html`` target, the build system provides the
following targets:

``publish``
   Builds and integrates all output for the production build. Build
   output is in ``build/public/<branch>/``. When you run ``publish``
   in the ``master``, the build will generate some output in
   ``build/public/``.

``push``; ``stage``
   Uploads the production build to the production or staging web
   servers. Depends on ``publish``. Requires access production or
   staging environment.

``push-all``; ``stage-all``
   Uploads the entire content of ``build/public/`` to the web
   servers. Depends on ``publish``. Not used in common practice.

``push-with-delete``; ``stage-with-delete``
   Modifies the action of ``push`` and ``stage`` to remove remote file
   that don't exist in the local build. Use with caution.

``html``; ``latex``; ``dirhtml``; ``epub``; ``texinfo``; ``man``; ``json``
   These are standard targets derived from the default Sphinx
   Makefile, with adjusted dependencies. Additionally, for all of
   these targets you can append ``-nitpick`` to increase Sphinx's
   verbosity, or ``-clean`` to remove all Sphinx build artifacts.

   ``latex`` performs several additional post-processing steps on
   ``.tex`` output generated by Sphinx. This target will also compile
   PDFs using ``pdflatex``.

   ``html`` and ``man`` also generates a ``.tar.gz`` file of the build
   outputs for inclusion in the final releases.

Build Mechanics and Tools
-------------------------

Internally the build system has a number of components and
processes. See the `docs-tools README
<https://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for
more information on the internals. This section documents a few
of these components from a very high level and lists useful operations
for contributors to the documentation.

.. _build-fabric:

Fabric
~~~~~~

Fabric is an orchestration and scripting package for Python. The
documentation uses Fabric to handle the deployment of the build
products to the web servers and also unifies a number of independent
build operations. Fabric commands have the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   fab <module>.<task>[:<argument>]

The ``<argument>`` is optional in most cases. Additionally some tasks
are available at the root level, without a module. To see a full list
of fabric tasks, use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   fab -l

You can chain fabric tasks on a single command line, although this
doesn't always make sense.

Important fabric tasks include:

``tools.bootstrap``
   Runs the ``bootstrap.py`` script. Useful for re-initializing the
   repository without needing to be in root of the repository.

``tools.dev``; ``tools.reset``
   ``tools.dev`` switches the ``origin`` remote of the ``docs-tools``
   checkout in ``build`` directory, to ``../docs-tools`` to facilitate
   build system testing and development. ``tools.reset`` resets the
   ``origin`` remote for normal operation.

``tools.conf``
   ``tools.conf`` returns the content of the configuration object for
   the current project. These data are useful during development.

``stats.report:<filename>``
   Returns, a collection of readability statistics. Specify file names
   relative to ``source/`` tree.

``make``
   Provides a thin wrapper around Make calls. Allows you to start make
   builds from different locations in the project repository.

``process.refresh_dependencies``
   Updates the time stamp of ``.txt`` source files with changed
   include files, to facilitate Sphinx's incremental rebuild
   process. This task runs internally as part of the build process.

Buildcloth
~~~~~~~~~~

`Buildcloth <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildcloth/>`_ is a
meta-build tool, used to generate Makefiles programatically. This
makes the build system easier to maintain, and makes it easier to use
the same fundamental code to generate various branches of the Manual
as well as related documentation projects. See `makecloth/ in the
docs-tools repository
<https://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools/tree/master/makecloth>`_ for
the relevant code.

Running ``make`` with no arguments will regenerate these parts of the
build system automatically.

Rstcloth
~~~~~~~~

`Rstcloth <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rstcloth>`_ is a library for
generating reStructuredText programatically. This makes it possible to
generate content for the documentation, such as tables, tables of
contents, and API reference material programatically and
transparently. See `rstcloth/ in the docs-tools repository
<https://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools/tree/master/rstcloth>`_ for
the relevant code.
