You can create an |fts| index through the |service| UI, :ref:`API 
<atlas-search-api-ref>`, :atlas:`Atlas CLI 
</cli/stable/command/atlas-clusters-search-indexes-create/>`, and 
`Terraform <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/search_index>`__.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-search-out-agg.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

To create an |fts| index, you must have an |service| cluster with:

- MongoDB version ``4.2`` or higher
- Collection to create the |fts| index for

Create an |fts| Index Using the |service| UI 
--------------------------------------------

When you create a new |fts| index, choose a configuration method.

You can use either the default index definition or specify a custom
definition for the index. The default index definition is :ref:`dynamic 
mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>` of fields in the documents and will 
work with any collection. If you wish to create a custom index 
definition for :ref:`static mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>`, you 
can specify which fields to index with which analyzer and as which data 
type. 

The index name defaults to :guilabel:`default`. You can leave
the default name in place or choose one of your own.

.. include:: /includes/default-fts-index-name.rst

Index names must be unique within their namespace.

Procedure 
~~~~~~~~~

To create an |fts| index from the |service| UI:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-fts-index.rst

Create an |fts| Index Using the |fts| API 
-----------------------------------------

To create an |fts| index, send a ``POST`` request to the 
``fts/indexes`` :doc:`endpoint 
</reference/api/fts-indexes-create-one/>`. To learn more about the 
syntax and parameters for this endpoint, see 
:doc:`/reference/api/fts-indexes-create-one/`.

.. note:: 

   |service| doesn't create the index if the collection doesn't exist, 
   but it still returns a ``200`` status.

Create an |fts| Index Using the {+atlas-cli+} 
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-search-indexes-create.rst

.. _node-status-ref:

Node Status
-----------

When you create the |fts| index, the |fts| Indexes tab in the 
right-side panel of the {+atlas-ui+} displays information about |fts| 
indexes for the selected namespace. The :guilabel:`Status` column shows 
the current state of the index on the primary node of the cluster. 
Click the :guilabel:`View status details` link below the status to view 
the state of the index on all the nodes of the cluster.

.. figure:: /images/fts-index-status.png

     :figwidth: 700px

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Not Started 
     - |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Initial Sync 
     - |service| is building the index or re-building the 
       index after an edit. When the index is in this state:
       
       - For a new index, |fts| doesn't serve queries until the 
         index build is complete. 
       - For an existing index, you can continue to use the old index 
         for existing and new queries until the index rebuild 
         is complete.

   * - Active
     - Index is ready to use.

   * - Recovering
     - Replication encountered an error. This state commonly occurs 
       when the current replication point is no longer available on the 
       |mongod| oplog. You can still query the existing index until it 
       updates and its status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. Use the 
       error in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Failed 
     - |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.

While |service| builds the index and after the build completes, the 
:guilabel:`Documents` column shows the percentage and number of 
documents indexed. The column also shows the total number of documents 
in the collection.
