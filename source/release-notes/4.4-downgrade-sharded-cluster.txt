Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-downgrade-floor.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading


Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings. 

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

1. Namespace Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

   Before downgrading, resolve any collections or views with namespaces
   that exceed the 120-byte :limit:`Namespace Length` limit for Feature
   Compatibility Version (fCV) 4.2.

   To determine if you have any collections or views with namespaces
   that exceed the 120-byte limit, connect :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to a |target| and run:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function(d){
         let mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);

         mdb.getCollectionInfos( ).forEach(function(c){
            namespace = d.name + "." + c.name
            namespacelenBytes =  encodeURIComponent(namespace).length

            if (namespacelenBytes > 120) {
               print (c.type.toUpperCase() + " namespace exceeds 120 bytes:: " + namespace )
            }
         } )
      })

   If any collection or view namespace exceeds 120 bytes, then :red:`prior` to
   downgrading the fCV:

   - For unsharded collections, rename the collections using the
     :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command.

   - For sharded collections:

     - Use :pipeline:`$merge` to a new sharded collection with a shorter
       name, then drop the original collection.

     - Use :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` into
       a new collection with a shorter name, then drop the original collection.

   - For views, use :method:`db.createView()` to recreate the view
     using a shorter name, then drop the original view.

2. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded
cluster:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-fcv.rst

   .. note:: 

      While :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running on
      the sharded cluster, chunk migrations, splits, and merges
      can fail with ``ConflictingOperationInProgress``.

#. To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the
   updated ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica
   set member and each config server replica set member and check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. tip::

      For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
      following command against a shard replica set member, you must
      connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
      <shard-local-users>`.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.2" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of |newfcv|,
   wait for the member to reflect version |oldfcv| before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

3. Remove FCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:


4. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- If any view definitions that include |newversion| operators, such as
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` or :expression:`$function`. See also
  :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-new-agg-operators`.


.. |binary| replace:: any :binary:`~bin.mongod`/:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

5. Update Missing Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   In MongoDB 4.4, shard key fields can be :ref:`missing from documents
   <shard-key-missing>` in a sharded collection. 
   
   If you downgrade to 4.2 and a sharded collection contains documents
   missing shard key fields, 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances do not
   return documents that are missing the shard key fields. To avoid
   this situation, update the documents to includes the missing shard
   key fields before you downgrade.

   To find documents that are missing any part of the shard key, use the
   :query:`$exists` operator. 

   For example, if the collection ``contacts`` has the shard key ``{
   zipcode: 1 }``, to find documents without the ``zipcode`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.contacts.find( { zipcode: { $exists: false } } )

   To set the missing shard key field to ``null`` for these documents,
   you can use the :method:`db.collection.updateMany()` method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.contacts.updateMany( { zipcode: { $exists: false } }, { $set: { zipcode: null } } )

   If setting the missing shard key field to a non-``null`` value, you
   cannot use the :method:`db.collection.updateMany()` method and you
   must perform the update within a transaction or as a retryable
   write. For details, see :ref:`shard-key-missing-set`.

6. Update Shard Keys That Exceed 512 bytes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   In version 4.4, MongoDB removes the 512-byte limit on the shard key
   size. However, for MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, a shard key cannot
   exceed 512 bytes. Update any shard key value that exceed the
   512-byte size limit to be within the 512 byte size limit. To update
   a document's shard key value, see :ref:`update-shard-key`.

Procedure
---------

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
