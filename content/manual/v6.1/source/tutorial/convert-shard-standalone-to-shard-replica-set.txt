=================================================
Convert a Shard Standalone to a Shard Replica Set
=================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


Starting in MongoDB 3.6, all shards must be replica sets. Before you
can upgrade your 3.4 sharded cluster to version 3.6, you must convert
any shards that are running as standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances to replica set shards.
 
This tutorial describes the process for converting a shard standalone
into a shard :term:`replica set`. The procedure is specific to a shard
standalone. To convert just a standalone to a replica set (i.e. not a
part of any sharded cluster), see
:doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set` instead.

Procedure
---------

.. important:: 

   The following procedure converts a standalone shard to a
   single-member replica set shard. The procedure assumes that the
   single member runs on the same host and port as before.

#. Shut down the shard :term:`standalone` :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

#. Restart the shard instance with the :option:`--replSet <mongod
   --replSet>` option to specify the name of the new replica set. Ensure
   that the name is distinct (for instance, you could use the :data:`shard
   name <sh.status.shards._id>` as the replica set name); in particular,
   shard replica sets must not use the same name as the config server
   replica set.

   The other options can remain the same.

   For example, the following command starts a standalone instance as a
   member of a new replica set named ``shardA``. The other options
   stay the same as before; e.g. :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
   uses the standalone's existing database path of ``/srv/mongodb/db0``
   and :option:`--port <mongod --port>` is the same as before:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/db0 --shardsvr --replSet shardA --bind_ip localhost,<ip address of the mongod host>

   For more information on configuration options, see
   :doc:`/reference/configuration-options` and the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   manual page.

#. Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the shard :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate the new replica set:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

   The replica set is now operational. To view the replica set
   configuration, use :method:`rs.conf()`. To check the status of the
   replica set, use :method:`rs.status()`.

#. Disconnect from the instance.

#. Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to one of the sharded cluster's
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and retrieve the shard information:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var myShard = db.getSiblingDB("config").shards.findOne( { _id: "<name>"} )

   Replace ``<name>`` with the name of the shard. The ``<name>`` of the
   shard is separate from the shard replica set name (unless you are
   using the shard name as the replica set name). To retrieve the name
   of the shard, see the :data:`shards <sh.status.shards._id>` section
   in the results from the :method:`sh.status()` method. For example,
   if the result of :method:`sh.status()` includes the following shards
   section, the name of the two shards are ``"shard0000"`` and
   ``"shard0001"`` respectively:

   .. code-block:: none

      shards:
            {  "_id" : "shard0000",  "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27018",  "state" : 1 }
            {  "_id" : "shard0001",  "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27018",  "state" : 1 }


#. Update the ``host`` information with the replica set information:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      myShard.host = "<replica-set>/<member>"

   Replace ``<replica-set>`` with the name of the replica set. Replace
   ``<member>`` with the replica set member. For example
   ``shardA/mongodb1.example.net:27018``.

#. Save the information.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("config").shards.replaceOne(myShard, { writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } )

#. Repeat for the next standalone shard in the sharded cluster. Ensure
   that you use a distinct name for each shard replica set.

#. Once you have finished converting shard standalone instances to
   shard replica sets, force the members of sharded cluster to update
   their knowledge of other shards' connection strings by restarting all
   members of the sharded cluster:

   - config server replica sets
   - :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
   - shard replica sets

Additional Information
----------------------

To add members to this replica set, use the :method:`rs.add()` method.
For more information on adding members to a replica set, see
:doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.
