{+PIT-Restore+}s replay the :term:`oplog` to restore a {+cluster+} from 
a particular point in time within a window specified in the Backup
Policy. To learn more, see :ref:`pit-restore`.

Considerations
--------------

- Enabling {+PIT-Restore+} increases the monthly cost of your
  {+cluster+}.

  To learn more about the cost implications, see
  :ref:`billing <billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots>`.

- |service| {+clusters+} where {+PIT-Restore+} is enabled store 
  :term:`oplog` data on |aws| |s3|, including {+clusters+} backed by 
  |azure| and|gcp|.

- If you disable {+PIT-Restore+}, |service| will delete the 
  {+pit-restore+} history.

- You can't configure a restore window that is longer than the 
  :ref:`Hourly Snapshot Retention Time <creating-backup-policy>`.

- If you select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` option, you can
  specify the time of restore with one minute of granularity.
  
- If you select the :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp` option, you
  can specify the time of restore with one second of
  granularity.

- You can restore a {+cluster+} from any time during its 
  {+pit-restore+} window **except** between when you 
  initiated a restore and when |service| completes a 
  snapshot after the restore.

- |service| might create a host rollback alert due to
  differences in the data between the source and target
  {+clusters+}. You can ignore this alert.

- After the restore completes, |service| takes a snapshot of
  the restored {+cluster+}. This snapshot has a retention period
  equal to the {+cluster+}'s {+pit-restore+} window.

Required Access
---------------

To perform the following actions, you must have
:authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` access to |service|.

Procedure
---------

The following process outlines the steps for setting up {+PIT-Restore+} 
and recovering a point in time:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Enable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>`.

      1. :ref:`Create a new cluster 
         <create-new-cluster>`, or click the :icon-mms:`ellipsis` 
         next to the name of your {+cluster+} and select 
         :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Additional Settings`.

      #. Toggle :guilabel:`Turn on Cloud Backup` to :guilabel:`On`.

      #. Toggle :guilabel:`{+PIT-Restore+}` to :guilabel:`On`.

   .. step:: Configure your :ref:`{+pit-restore+} restore window <create-pit-policy>`.
      
      1. Click :guilabel:`Databases` in the top-left corner of 
         |service|.
   
      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click the 
         {+cluster+} name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Backup Policy`.
      
      #. In the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore Policy` section,

   .. step:: Recover a :ref:`point in time with {+pit-restore+} <restore-cluster>`.

      1. Click :guilabel:`Databases` in the top-left corner of \
         |service|.

      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on 
         the {+cluster+} name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore` button on the far
         right side of the screen.

      #. Select either the :guilabel:`Date & Time` or :guilabel:`Oplog
         Timestamp` tab.

      #. Enter the desired point in time to restore from.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

      #. Choose a project and cluster to restore to from the dropdown
         menus.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.
