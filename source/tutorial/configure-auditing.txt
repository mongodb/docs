MongoDB Enterprise provides the capability to audit :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`
and :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` instances. The auditing facility allows
administrators and users to track system activity for deployments
with multiple users and applications. Administrators can configure
auditing to write to the console, :term:`syslog`, a JSON
file or a BSON file. You can also use filters to restrict which events
are logged.
