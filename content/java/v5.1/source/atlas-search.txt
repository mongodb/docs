Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run :atlas:`{+search+} </atlas-search/>` queries on a collection.
{+search+} enables you to perform full-text searches on collections
hosted on MongoDB Atlas. {+search+} indexes specify the behavior of the
search and which fields to index.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to
create a free MongoDB deployment and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`MongoDB Get Started <unified-get-started>` guide. To learn more about
aggregation operations and builders, see the :ref:`java-aggregation` guide. 

Run a {+search+} Query
----------------------------

This section shows how to create an aggregation pipeline to run a
{+search+} query on a collection. You can use the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder
method to create a ``$search`` pipeline stage, which specifies the search
criteria. Then, call the ``aggregate()`` method and pass your pipeline as a
parameter.

.. note:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`{+search+} index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.
   Learn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator
   from the :ref:`{+search+} <java-atlas-search>` documentation.

Before running a {+search+} query, you must create a {+search+} index
on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create a {+search+}
index, see the :ref:`search-indexes` section in the Indexes guide. 

{+search+} Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example runs a {+search+} query by performing the
following actions:

- Constructs a ``$search`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to query for documents in which the ``title``
  field contains the word ``"Alabama"``

- Constructs a ``$project`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.project()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to include the ``title`` field in the query results

- Passes the pipeline stages to the ``aggregate()`` method and prints the results

   To view more examples that use the {+driver-short+} to perform {+search+}
   queries, see :atlas:`{+search+} Tutorials </atlas-search/tutorials/>`
   in the Atlas documentation.

{+search+} Metadata
--------------------------

Use the ``searchMeta()`` method to create a :manual:`$searchMeta
</reference/operator/aggregation/searchMeta/>` pipeline stage, which returns
only the metadata from of the {+search+} results. 

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.4.11 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is available only
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.4.11 and later. For a
   detailed list of version availability, see the MongoDB Atlas documentation
   on :atlas:`$searchMeta </atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta>`.

The following example shows the ``near`` metadata for a {+search+}
aggregation stage:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateSearchBuilderExample.java
   :start-after: // begin atlasSearchMeta
   :end-before: // end atlasSearchMeta
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To learn more about this helper method, see the
`searchMeta() <{+core-api+}/client/model/Aggregates.html#searchMeta(com.mongodb.client.model.search.SearchCollector)>`__
API documentation.
