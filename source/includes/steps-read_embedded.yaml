  If you wish to select documents that match all of the fields in an
  embedded JSON object, specify an exact match of the embedded document,
  including all of the fields and values in that embedded document in the
  order in which they appear in the collection.

  For example, the following query selects all documents where the
  ``size`` field equals the document ``{ "h" : 14, "w" : 21, "uom" : "cm"}``:
