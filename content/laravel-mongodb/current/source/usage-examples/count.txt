      You can count the number of documents returned by a query

   .. replacement:: result-operation

      the ``count()`` method to retrieve the results

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database
      - Counts the documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the matching document count
      
      The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``genres`` field includes ``"Biography"``
      - ``count()``: Counts the number of matching documents and returns
        the count as an integer
      
      .. io-code-block::
      
         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/CountTest.php
            :start-after: begin-eloquent-count
            :end-before: end-eloquent-count
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Number of documents: 1267

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Counts the documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the matching document count
      
      The example calls the following query builder methods:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``genres`` field includes ``"Biography"``
      - ``count()``: Counts the number of matching documents and returns
        the count as an integer
      
      .. io-code-block::

            :end-before: end-qb-count
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Number of documents: 1267
