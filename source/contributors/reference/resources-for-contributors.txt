Forums
------

`MongoDB-user`_ and `MongoDB-dev`_ mailing lists are good resources for
asking questions or learning from others' experiences. `MongoDB-user`_
is for users building applications with MongoDB, whereas `MongoDB-dev`_
is generally for users contributing to the database or building third
party tools.

`StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb>`_ is
another good resource. Post your MongoDB questions on StackOverflow,
tagging your questions with ``mongodb``. Also, be sure to check out the
``#mongodb`` IRC channel on Freenode.

Of course, if you can answer someone else's question on any of these
sites, feel free to jump in.

JIRA
----

If you find a bug in MongoDB or related projects, you can submit a JIRA
ticket to report the bug. See
:doc:`/contributors/tutorial/submit-bug-reports` for details.
