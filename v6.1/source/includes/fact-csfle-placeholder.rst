Throughout this guide, code examples use placeholder text. 
Before you run the examples, substitute your own values for 
these placeholders.

For example:

.. code-block:: go
   :copyable: false

   dek_id := "<Your Base64 DEK ID>"

You would replace everything between quotes with your {+dek-abbr+} ID.

.. code-block:: go
   :copyable: false

   dek_id := "abc123"
