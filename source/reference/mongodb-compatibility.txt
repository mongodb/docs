   |ldap| Authorization Compatibility
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :doc:`LDAP authorization </tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication>`
   was added to MongoDB Enterprise with version 3.4. This feature
   allows you to assign roles to users using |ldap|. This feature was
   later changed to provide additional security with MongoDB 3.4.11.
   |onprem| :ref:`3.4.13 <opsmgr-server-3.4.13>` or later,
   :ref:`3.6.3 <opsmgr-server-3.6.3>` or later, and
   :ref:`4.0.0 <opsmgr-server-4.0.0>` or later are compatible with
   MongoDB versions 3.4.11 or later.

Backup Considerations for MongoDB 4.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Backup </tutorial/nav/backup-deployments/>` support for MongoDB
4.2 with ``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : 4.2`` is currently extremely
limited. Support will be extended in future releases of |mms|.

To learn more about backup considerations specific to MongoDB
4.2, see :ref:`4.2-backup-considerations`.
