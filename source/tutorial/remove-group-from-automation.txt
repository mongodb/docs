When the |mms| free trial period expires, |mms| Automation is disabled
for your |mms| projects. As Automation doesn't manage your MongoDB
processes, you should:

- Remove your MongoDB processes from Automation
- Configure your processes to use Monitoring and Backup without
  Automation.

.. note::

   If you stop using |mms| Automation with your project, |mms| continues to monitor the project's deployments with two caveats:

   - |mms| tracks metrics at a less granular level.
   - |mms| stores metrics for a shorter period.

To stop using Automation with your Projects, you should:

.. include:: /includes/steps/suspend-automation.rst

.. seealso::

   You can choose to unmanage individual deployments and continue
   using Automation for the project. To learn how, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
