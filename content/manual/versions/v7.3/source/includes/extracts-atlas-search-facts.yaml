  **For data hosted on MongoDB Atlas**, MongoDB offers a 
  full-text search solution, :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Search 
  </atlas-search/>`. If you frequently run case-insensitive regex 
  queries (utilizing the ``i`` option), MongoDB recommends Atlas Search 
  queries that use the :pipeline:`$search` aggregation pipeline stage. 
  
  :atlas:`Atlas Search queries </reference/atlas-search/searching/>` 
  significiantly improve the performance of text queries and offer more 
  options for customizing query parameters. To learn more, see 
  :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Search </atlas-search/>`. 
  
  **For self-managed deployments**, you can find information on our 
  regex capability below.
