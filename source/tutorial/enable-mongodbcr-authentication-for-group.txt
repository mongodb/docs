Overview
--------

MongoDB users can use usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves against a MongoDB database.

   * - MongoDB Version
     - Default authentication mechanism

   * - MongoDB 3.0 and later
     - Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm (``SCRAM-SHA-1``).

   * - MongoDB 2.8 and earlier
     - MongoDB Challenge and Response (``MONGODB-CR``).

``SCRAM-SHA-1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is an IETF standard, `RFC 5802
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_, that defines best practice
methods for implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for
authenticating users with passwords.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` verifies supplied user credentials against the user’s
name, password and database. The user’s database is the database where
the user was created, and the user’s database and the user’s name
together serve to identify the user.

``MONGODB-CR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response mechanism that authenticates
users with passwords.

``MONGODB-CR`` verifies supplied user credentials against the user’s
name, password and database. The user’s database is the database where
the user was created. The user’s database and name together serve to
identify the user.

Considerations
--------------

This tutorial describes how to enable Username and Password
authentication for your |mms| MongoDB deployment.

.. note::
   The MongoDB Community version supports Username and Password
   authentication and x.509 authentication.

.. include:: /includes/note-reset-auth.rst

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable username and
password authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or
Backup agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure
them to use Usernames and Passwords. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-cr` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr` for instructions.
