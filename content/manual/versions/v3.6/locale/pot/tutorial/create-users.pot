msgid "MongoDB employs role-based access control (RBAC) to determine access for users. A user is granted one or more :ref:`roles <roles>` that determine the user's access or privileges to MongoDB :ref:`resources <resource-document>` and the :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>` that user can perform. A user should have only the minimal set of privileges required to ensure a system of :term:`least privilege`."

This first user must have privileges to create other users. As of MongoDB 3.0, with the localhost exception, you can only create users on the ``admin`` database. Once you create the first user, you must authenticate as that user to add subsequent users. :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` provides more detail about adding users when enabling access control for a deployment."
