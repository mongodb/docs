In {+csfle+} ({+csfle-abbrev+})-enabled client applications, you
can use :manual:`schema validation </core/schema-validation>`
to have your MongoDB instance enforce encryption of specific fields.
To specify which fields require encryption, use the
:ref:`automatic encryption rule keywords <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`
with the :query:`$jsonSchema` validation object. The server rejects any write operations to that collection
where the specified fields are not :bsontype:`Binary (BinData) <Binary>`
subtype 6 objects.

To learn how a {+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled client configured to use
automatic encryption behaves when it encounters a server-side schema,
see :ref:`field-level-encryption-automatic-remote-schema`.

To learn how a {+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled client configured to use
{+manual-enc+} behaves when it encounters a server-side schema,
see :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-server-side-schema`.

Example
-------

Consider an ``hr`` database with an ``employees`` collection.
Documents in the ``employees`` collection have the following form:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/reference/server-side-schema/document.json
   :language: json

You want to enforce the following behavior for client applications
using your collection:

.. TODO: Kenn Technical review. Question: In testing, I was able to insert a document
   with the incorrect encryption algorithm into this collection. Does schema
   validation not check the encryption algorithm used?

- When encrypting the ``age`` field, clients must follow these
  encryption rules:
  
  * Use the {+dek-long+} with an ``_id`` of
    ``UUID("e114f7ad-ad7a-4a68-81a7-ebcb9ea0953a")``.
  * Use the
    :ref:`randomized <field-level-encryption-random>`
    encryption algorithm.
  * The ``age`` field must be an integer.

- When encrypting the ``name`` field, clients must follow these
  encryption rules:
  
  * Use the {+dek-long+} with an ``_id`` of
    ``UUID("33408ee9-e499-43f9-89fe-5f8533870617")``.  
  * Use the
    :ref:`deterministic <field-level-encryption-deterministic>`
    encryption algorithm.
  * The ``name`` field must be a string.

The following :binary:`~bin.mongosh` code uses the
:dbcommand:`collMod` command to update the ``hr.employees``
collection to include a ``validator`` to enforce the
preceding behavior:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/reference/server-side-schema/command.js
   :language: javascript
