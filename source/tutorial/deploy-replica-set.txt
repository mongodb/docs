A :term:`replica set` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain
the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and :term:`high
availability` and are the basis for all production deployments.

To learn more about replica sets, see the :manual:`Replication
Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual.

You can use the {+osb+} to deploy a new replica set managed by
|service|. After deployment, use |service| to manage monitoring,
backups, and project configuration such as VPC peering or billing.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. |deployment| replace:: replica set

.. include:: /includes/prereqs-deploy-resource.rst

Considerations
--------------

|service| Public API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+osb+} uses the :atlas:`Create a Cluster
<reference/api/clusters-create-one>` endpoint of the |service| Public
|api| to deploy replica sets. Any requirements or limitations of the
|api| also apply to the {+osb+}.
