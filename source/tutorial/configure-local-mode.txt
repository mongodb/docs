   :description: How does Ops Manager download binaries with partial or no Internet access?
   :keywords: local mode, hybrid mode

.. |company| replace:: MongoDB, Inc.

In a default configuration, the {+mdbagent+}s and Backup Daemons
access MongoDB binaries over the internet from |company|

If your environment prevents granting all hosts in your MongoDB
deployment access to the internet, you have two options:

Hybrid Mode
   Only |onprem| has internet access.
   Configure |onprem| to download installers from the internet.
   Configure Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB hosts to download
   installers only from |onprem|.

Local Mode
   No hosts have internet access.
   Upload the installers to |onprem|. 
   Configure Backup Daemons an Managed MongoDB hosts to download
   installers only from |onprem|.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Hybrid Mode
      :tabid: hybrid

      To manage MongoDB hosts without internet access, you must
      specify that the
      :guilabel:`Source for agents to download MongoDB binaries` is
      :guilabel:`hybrid`.

      |onprem| hosts download MongoDB installer binaries from the
      internet. MongoDB hosts with {+mdbagent+}s download these
      installers from the |onprem| hosts and then install or upgrade
      MongoDB deployments.

      The following tutorial outlines the steps to run |onprem| with
      internet access when MongoDB hosts do not have internet access.

   .. tab:: Local Mode
      :tabid: local

      To manage MongoDB hosts and run |onprem| without internet
      access, you must specify that the
      :guilabel:`Source for agents to download MongoDB binaries` is
      :guilabel:`local`.

      For Backup Daemons or {+mdbagent+}s to install or upgrade MongoDB
      deployments, you must:

      - Use another internet-connected device to download the
        :dl:`MongoDB Server <enterprise>` and
        :dl:`MongoDB Database Tools  <database-tools>` installer
        binaries for each edition, version, and platform you need to
        support.
      - Load the MongoDB Server and MongoDB Database Tools installer
        binaries to each |onprem| host into the
        :setting:`Versions Directory`.
      - Update the :term:`version manifest`.

      The following tutorial outlines the steps to run |onprem|
      without internet access.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Community for Windows with |tls| Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem| supports MongoDB Community Edition for Microsoft Windows with
|tls| in the following versions:

- MongoDB versions 3.2.12 or later
- MongoDB versions 3.4.1 or later
- MongoDB release series 3.6, 4.0, and 4.2

To use earlier versions, you must download them from
:dl:`MongoDB <community>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you :doc:`configure an HTTP proxy <use-with-http-proxy>` for |onprem|,
the Backup Daemon, and the MongoDB Agents:

- Consider :ref:`adding sites from which to download the version manifest
  to the firewall whitelist <whitelist-sites-for-version-manifest>`.

- :ref:`Exclude internal hosts from the proxy <non-proxy-hosts-ops-manager>`.

Install MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan on running
:product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>` on Linux
hosts, then you must manually install a set of dependencies to each
host *before installing MongoDB*. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. To install the
dependencies, see the instructions for the appropriate host platform:

   .. tab:: Hybrid Mode
      :tabid: hybrid

      Required User Role to Change Mode
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure internet access for |onprem| and {+mdbagent+}s,
      you must have :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to
      |onprem|.

   .. tab:: Local Mode
      :tabid: local

      Required User Role to Change Mode
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure internet access for |onprem| and {+mdbagent+}s,
      you must have :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to
      |onprem|.

      .. _local-mode-determine-versions:

      Determine which Binaries to Store Locally and Download
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      MongoDB provides :dl:`Community <community>` and
      :dl:`Enterprise <enterprise>` installation binaries for all MongoDB versions and on all
      :ref:`platforms <ops-manager-operating-system>` that |onprem|
      supports.

      Download binaries associated to each combination of MongoDB
      version, platform, and edition that you want to support in your
      current and prospective |onprem|\-managed deployments, including
      one for:

      - Each platform and version that your current and planned
        MongoDB deployments run.

      - Each platform and version along the
        :doc:`upgrade path </tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager>` of
        any existing MongoDB deployments you want to upgrade.

        .. example::

           If you import an existing deployment of MongoDB 3.4
           Community on Ubuntu 14.04 and want to upgrade it to
           MongoDB 4.0 Enterprise on Ubuntu 14.04, you must
           download and store all archived binaries for:

           - MongoDB 3.4 Community Edition
           - MongoDB 3.6 Community Edition
           - MongoDB 4.0 Community Edition
           - MongoDB 4.0 Enterprise Edition

      - If you are running backups, you need the MongoDB binary for
        the platform on which the |onprem| :term:`Backup Daemon`
        runs.

        .. example::

           If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
           on a set of Ubuntu hosts and running |onprem| on Windows,
           you must have archived binaries of MongoDB 3.6.8 for
           Ubuntu and for Windows.

      - If you are running
        :doc:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup>`,
        you need the Enterprise edition of the MongoDB version that
        your deployment runs.

        .. example::

           If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
           on a set of Ubuntu hosts and want to query backups from
           an |onprem| install on Windows, you must have archived
           binaries of MongoDB Community 3.6.8 for Ubuntu and
           MongoDB Enterprise 3.6.8 Windows.

      - If you are running |onprem| 4.4 or later, download
        the :dl:`MongoDB Database Tools <database-tools>`  into the
        :setting:`Versions Directory`. These tools include
        :db-tools:`/mongodump` and :db-tools:`/mongorestore`.
        You need to download these tools for each platform and version that you need to support.
