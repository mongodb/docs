Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform a bulk
write operation that makes multiple changes to your data in a single
database call.

Consider a situation that requires you to insert documents, update
documents, and delete documents for the same task. If you use
the individual write methods to perform each type of operation, each write
accesses the database separately. You can use a bulk write operation to
optimize the number of calls your application makes to the server.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The documents in this collection are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Define the Write Operations
---------------------------

For each write operation you want to perform, create a corresponding
instance of one of the following operation classes that inherit from the
generic ``WriteModel`` class:

- ``InsertOneModel``
- ``UpdateOneModel``
- ``UpdateManyModel``
- ``ReplaceOneModel``
- ``DeleteOneModel``
- ``DeleteManyModel``

Then, pass a list of these instances to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following sections show how to create and use instances of the
preceding classes. The :ref:`kotlin-sync-bulkwrite-method` section
demonstrates how to pass a list of models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method
to perform the bulk operation.

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` instance and specify
the document you want to insert.

The following example creates an instance of ``InsertOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-insert-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-insert-one
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To insert multiple documents, create an instance of ``InsertOneModel``
for each document.

.. important::

   When performing a bulk operation, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. In this situation, the driver throws a
   ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a document, create an instance of ``UpdateOneModel`` and pass
the following arguments:

- A **query filter** that specifies the criteria used to match documents in your collection
- The update operation you want to perform. For more information about update
  operations, see the :manual:`Field Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update-field/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

An ``UpdateOneModel`` instance specifies an update for *the first*
document that matches your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-one
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To update multiple documents, create an instance of ``UpdateManyModel`` and pass
the same arguments as for ``UpdateOneModel``. The ``UpdateManyModel``
class specifies updates for *all* documents that match your query
filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``UpdateManyModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-many
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replace operation removes all fields and values of a specified document and
replaces them with new fields and values that you specify. To perform a
replace operation, create an instance of ``ReplaceOneModel`` and pass a
query filter and the fields and values you want to replace the matching
document with.

The following example creates an instance of ``ReplaceOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-replace-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-replace-one
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To replace multiple documents, you must create an instance of
``ReplaceOneModel`` for each document.

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a document, create an instance of ``DeleteOneModel`` and pass a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. A
``DeleteOneModel`` instance provides instructions to delete
only *the first* document that matches your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteOneModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-one
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To delete multiple documents, create an instance of ``DeleteManyModel`` and pass a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. An instance of
``DeleteManyModel`` provides instructions to remove *all* documents that
match your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``DeleteManyModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-many
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _kotlin-sync-bulkwrite-method:

Perform the Bulk Operation
--------------------------

After you define a model instance for each operation you want to perform,
pass a list of these instances to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.
By default, the method runs the operations in the order
specified by the list of models.

The following example performs multiple write operations by using the
``bulkWrite()`` method:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
      :start-after: start-bulk-write-mixed
      :end-before: end-bulk-write-mixed
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      
      AcknowledgedBulkWriteResult{insertedCount=1, matchedCount=5, removedCount=3,
      modifiedCount=2, upserts=[], inserts=[BulkWriteInsert{index=0,
      id=BsonObjectId{value=...}}]}

If any of the write operations fail, the {+driver-short+} raises a
``BulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations.
``BulkWriteError`` provides a ``details`` item that includes the
operation that failed, and details about the exception.

.. note::

   When the driver runs a bulk operation, it uses the write concern of the
   target collection. The driver reports all write concern errors after
   attempting all operations, regardless of execution order.

Customize Bulk Write Operation
------------------------------

The ``bulkWrite()`` method optionally accepts a parameter which
specifies options you can use to configure the bulk write
operation. If you don't specify any options, the driver performs the
bulk operation with default settings.

The following table describes the setter methods that you can use to
configure a ``BulkWriteOptions`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``ordered()``
     - | If ``true``, the driver performs the write operations in the order
         provided. If an error occurs, the remaining operations are not
         attempted. 
       |
       | If ``false``, the driver performs the operations in an
         arbitrary order and attempts to perform all operations.
       | Defaults to ``true``.

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Specifies whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Sets a comment to attach to the operation.

   * - ``let()``
     - | Provides a map of parameter names and values to set top-level
         variables for the operation. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields.

The following code creates options and uses the ``ordered(false)`` option to
specify an unordered bulk write. Then, the example uses the
``bulkWrite()`` method to perform a bulk operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk.kt
   :start-after: start-bulk-write-unordered
   :end-before: end-bulk-write-unordered
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

If any of the write operations in an unordered bulk write fail, the {+driver-short+}
reports the errors only after attempting all operations.

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee an order of execution. The
   order can differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.

Return Value
------------

The ``bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` object. You can
access the following information from a ``BulkWriteResult`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``wasAcknowledged()``
     - | Indicates if the server acknowledged the write operation.
         
   * - ``getDeletedCount()``
     - | The number of documents deleted, if any.

   * - ``getInsertedCount()``
     - | The number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``getInserts()``
     - | The list of inserted documents, if any.

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | The number of documents matched for an update, if applicable.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | The number of documents modified, if any.

   * - ``getUpserts()``
     - | The list of upserted documents, if any.
