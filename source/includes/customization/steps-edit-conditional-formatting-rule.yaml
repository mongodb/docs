  To reorder a rule, drag it to your desired rank. Conditional 
  formatting rules take precedence in the order that you put them in. 
  |charts| saves the order of your rules automatically.

  To edit a rule, click the :icon-fa4:`pencil` icon on that rule. When 
  you are finished editing, click :guilabel:`Save`. To abandon your 
  changes, click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

  To delete a rule, click the :icon-fa4:`trash-o` icon on that rule.
  |charts| deletes the rule immediately.
