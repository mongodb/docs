stepnum: 7
ref:  create-org-require-api-access-list
content: |

   When you create a new organization with the {+atlas-ui+}, |service|
   requires IP access lists for the {+atlas-admin-api+} by default. If
   you require an IP access list, your {+atlas-admin-api+} keys can
   make |api| requests only from the location-based IP or |cidr|
   addresses that you specify in the IP access list.
   
   To disable the IP access list requirement and allow your 
   {+atlas-admin-api+} keys to make requests from any address on the internet, toggle 
   :guilabel:`Require IP Access List for the {+atlas-admin-api+}`
   to :guilabel:`OFF`.
   
   To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-require-api-access-list`.
