msgid "This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system snapshots to capture a copy of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create binary database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the alternate procedure."

msgid "In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each shard in the cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time."
