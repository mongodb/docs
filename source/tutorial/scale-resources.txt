You can scale your :term:`replica set` and :term:`sharded cluster`
deployments up or down to match your desired configuration. Scaling up
increases the number of members and/or shards in the deployment,
thereby improving your deployment's redundancy and availability. The
scale of your deployment is configured in its corresponding
|k8s-custom-resource|.

Scale a Replica Set
  To scale your replica set deployment, set the :setting:`spec.members`
  setting to the desired number of replica set members. To learn more 
  about replication, see :manual:`Replication </replication/>` in the
  MongoDB manual. 

Scale a Sharded Cluster
  To scale your sharded cluster deployment, set the following settings
  as desired:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Setting
       - Description

     * - :setting:`spec.shardCount`
       - Number of :term:`shards <shard>` in the sharded cluster.

     * - :setting:`spec.mongodsPerShardCount`
       - Number of members per shard.

     * - :setting:`spec.mongosCount`
       - Number of Shard Routers.

     * - :setting:`spec.configServerCount`
       - Number of members in the Config Server.

  To learn more about sharded cluster configurations, see
  :manual:`Sharded Cluster Components
  </core/sharded-cluster-components/>` in the MongoDB manual.

Considerations
--------------

- The |k8s-op-short| does not support modifying deployment types.
  For example, you cannot convert a standalone deployment to a
  replica set. To modify the type of a deployment,
  we recommend the following procedure:

  1. Create the new deployment with the desired configuration.

  #. :opsmgr:`Back up the data </tutorial/nav/backup-deployments/>` from
     your current deployment.

  #. :opsmgr:`Restore the data
     </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments/>` from your current
     deployment to the new deployment.

  #. Test your application connections to the new deployment as needed.

  #. Once you have verified that the new deployment contains the
     required data and can be reached by your application(s), bring
     down the old deployment.

Procedure
---------

To scale up your deployment, select the desired tab based on the deployment 
configuration you want to scale:

.. tabs-deployments::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: repl

      Consider a replica set resource with the following
      |k8s-custom-resource|:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-replica-set.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :start-after: START-regular-replset
         :end-before: END-regular-replset
         :linenos:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/scale-repset.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      Consider a sharded cluster resource with the following
      |k8s-custom-resource|:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :start-after: START-regular-sharded
         :end-before: END-regular-sharded
         :linenos:

      To scale up this sharded cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/scale-sharded.rst
