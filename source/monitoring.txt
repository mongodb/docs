Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure **monitoring** in the
{+driver-short+}.

Monitoring is the process of getting information about the activities a running
program performs for use in an application or an application performance
management library.

You can use the {+driver-short+} to monitor cluster, driver command, and
connection pool events. These features help you make informed decisions when
designing and debugging your application.

This guide shows how to perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`Monitor specific events by using the {+driver-short+} <monitoring-monitor-events>`
- :ref:`Monitor connection pool events with Java Management Extensions (JMX) and JConsole <monitoring-jmx>`

.. tip::

   This guide shows how to use information about the meta activity of the driver.
   To learn how to record data transactions, see the :ref:`Monitoring Data Changes <kotlin-sync-change-streams>` page. 

.. _monitoring-monitor-events:

Monitor Events
--------------

To monitor an **event**, you must register a **listener** on your ``MongoClient``
instance.

An event is any action that happens in a running program. The driver includes functionality
for listening to a subset of the events that occur when the driver is running.

A listener is a class that performs some action when certain events occur.
A listener's API defines the events it can respond to.

Each method of a listener class represents a response to a certain event, and
accepts as an argument an event object representing the event.

The {+driver-short+} organizes the events it defines into three categories:

- Command events
- Server Discovery and Monitoring events
- Connection Pool events

The following sections show how to monitor each event category. For a full list of the events you can monitor,
`see the Java event package
<{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/package-summary.html>`__.

.. _command-events-kotlin:

Command Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A command event is an event related to a MongoDB database command. Some
examples of database commands that produce command events are ``find``,
``insert``, ``delete``, and ``count``.

To monitor command events, create a class that implements the
``CommandListener`` interface and register an instance of that class with your
``MongoClient`` instance.

For more information on MongoDB database commands, see the 
:manual:`MongoDB manual entry on database commands </reference/command/>`in 
the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. note:: Internal Commands

   The driver does not publish events for commands it calls internally. This
   includes database commands the driver uses to monitor your cluster and
   commands related to connection establishment, such as the initial ``hello``
   command.

.. important:: Redacted Output

   As a security measure, the driver redacts the contents of some command events. This
   protects the sensitive information contained in these command events. For a
   full list of redacted command events, see the
   :spec:`MongoDB command logging and monitoring specification </command-logging-and-monitoring/command-logging-and-monitoring.md>`.

Example
^^^^^^^

This example shows how to make a counter for database commands. The counter
keeps track of the number of times the driver successfully executes each database
command and prints this information every time a database command finishes.

To make a counter, follow these steps:

#. Make a class with counter functionality that implements the ``CommandListener`` interface.
#. Add an instance of the new class to a ``MongoClientSettings`` object.
#. Configure your ``MongoClient`` instance with the ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

The following code implements these steps:

.. _listener-mongo-client-settings-example:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/monitoring_counter.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      {find=1}
      {find=2}
      {find=2, endSessions=1}

For more information on the classes and methods mentioned in this section, see
the following API documentation:

- `CommandListener <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/CommandListener.html>`__
- `MongoClientSettings <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__

- `CommandSucceededEvent <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/CommandSucceededEvent.html>`__
- `CommandFailedEvent <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/CommandFailedEvent.html>`__

Server Discovery and Monitoring Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A server discovery and monitoring (SDAM) event is an event related to a change
in the state of the MongoDB instance or cluster you have connected the driver to.

The driver defines nine SDAM events and provides the following listener
interfaces, which listen for three SDAM events each: 

- `ClusterListener <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/ClusterListener.html>`__ : Listens for topology-related events
- `ServerListener <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/ServerListener.html>`__ : Listens for events related to ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` processes
- `ServerMonitorListener <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/ServerMonitorListener.html>`__ : Listens for heartbeat-related events

To monitor a type of SDAM event, create a class that implements one of the three
preceding interfaces and register an instance of that class with your
``MongoClient`` instance.

For a detailed description of each SDAM event, see the :spec:`MongoDB SDAM monitoring events specification </server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring-logging-and-monitoring.md>`.

Example
^^^^^^^

This example shows how to make a listener class that prints a message about the write
availability of your MongoDB instance.

To make an event that reports write status, perform the following tasks: 

#. Make a class that tracks cluster description changes, and
   implements the ``ClusterListener`` interface. 
#. Add an instance of the new class to a ``MongoClientSettings`` object.
#. Configure your ``MongoClient`` instance with the ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

The following code implements these steps:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/monitoring_writable.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Able to write to server

- `ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/event/ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent.html>`__

Connection Pool Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A connection pool event is an event related to a **connection pool** held by the driver.
A connection pool is a set of open TCP connections your driver maintains with
a MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the number of network handshakes
your application performs with a MongoDB instance and can help your
application run faster.

To monitor connection pool events, create a class that implements the
``ConnectionPoolListener`` interface and register an instance of that class with your
``MongoClient`` instance.

Example
^^^^^^^

This example shows how to make a listener class that prints a message each time
you check out a connection from your connection pool.

To make an event that reports connection checkouts, perform the following tasks: 

#. Make a class that tracks checkouts and implements the ``CommandListener`` interface.
#. Add an instance of the new class to a ``MongoClientSettings`` object.
#. Configure your ``MongoClient`` instance with the ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

The following code implements these steps:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/monitoring_librarian.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Let me get you the connection with id 21...

.. _monitoring-jmx:

Monitor Connection Pool Events with JMX
---------------------------------------

You can monitor connection pool events using **Java Management Extensions (JMX)**.
JMX provides tools to monitor applications and devices.

For more information on JMX, see
`the official Oracle JMX documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/index.html>`__.

JMX Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable JMX connection pool monitoring, add an instance of the
``JMXConnectionPoolListener`` class to your ``MongoClient`` object.

The ``JMXConnectionPoolListener`` class performs the following actions:

#. Creates MXBean instances for each ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process the driver
   maintains a connection pool with.
#. Registers these MXBean instances with the platform MBean server.

MXBeans registered on the platform MBean server have the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``clusterId``
     - A client-generated unique identifier. This identifier ensures that
       each MXBean the driver makes has a unique name when an application has
       multiple ``MongoClient`` instances connected to the same MongoDB deployment.

   * - ``host``
     - The hostname of the machine running the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process.

   * - ``port``
     - The port on which the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process is listening.

   * - ``minSize``
     - The minimum size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.

   * - ``maxSize``
     - The maximum size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.

   * - ``size``
     - The current size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.

   * - ``checkedOutCount``
     - The current count of connections that are in use.


All MXBean instances created by the driver are under the domain
``"org.mongodb.driver"``.

For more information on the topics discussed in this subsection, see the
following resources from Oracle:

- `Platform MBean Server Reference Documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/management/overview-java-se-monitoring-and-management.html#GUID-F7B9AB8A-F5A8-472A-AEC6-93B5B7FBE7CE>`__
- `MXBean Documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/mxbeans.html>`__
- `MBean Documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html>`__

JMX and JConsole Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how you can monitor the driver's connection pools using JMX
and **JConsole**. JConsole is a JMX compliant GUI monitoring tool that comes with
the Java Platform.

.. tip:: Consult the Official JMX and JConsole Documentation

   The descriptions of JMX and JConsole in this example are illustrative
   rather than a source of truth. For guaranteed up-to-date information, consult
   the following official Oracle resources:

   - `JConsole documentation <https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jconsole.html>`__
   - `JMX documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/index.html>`__

The following code snippet adds a ``JMXConnectionPoolListener`` to a
``MongoClient`` instance. The code then pauses execution so you can
navigate to JConsole and inspect your connection pools.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/monitoring_JMX.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Navigate to JConsole to see your connection pools...

Once you have started your server, open JConsole in your terminal by using the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   jconsole

Once JConsole is open, perform the following actions in the GUI:

#. Select the process running the preceding example code.
#. Press :guilabel:`Insecure Connection` in the warning dialog box.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`MBeans` tab.
#. Inspect your connection pool events under the ``"org.mongodb.driver"`` domain.

When you no longer want to inspect your connection pools in JConsole, do the
following:

#. Exit JConsole by closing the JConsole window.
#. Stop the program running by the preceding code snippet.

For more information on JMX and JConsole, see the following resources from
Oracle:

- `JConsole Documentation <https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jconsole.html>`__
- `Monitoring and Management Guide <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html>`__

For more information on the ``JMXConnectionPoolListener`` class, see
the API documentation for
`JMXConnectionPoolListener <{+core-api+}/com/mongodb/management/JMXConnectionPoolListener.html>`__.

Include the Driver in Your Distributed Tracing System
-----------------------------------------------------

If you use a **distributed tracing system**, you can include event data from the
driver. A distributed tracing system is an application that
tracks requests as they propagate throughout different services in a
service-oriented architecture.

If you use the driver in a `Spring Cloud <https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud>`__
application, use Spring Cloud Sleuth to include MongoDB event data in the
`Zipkin <https://zipkin.io/>`__ distributed tracing system.  

If you do not use Spring Cloud or want to include driver event data in a distributed
tracing system other than Zipkin, you must write a command event listener that
manages **spans** for your desired distributed tracing system.
