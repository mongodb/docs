Clusters
--------

MongoDB supports two different kinds of clusters: replica sets and sharded
clusters. Since a shard within a sharded cluster is typically a replica set,
a sharded cluster is a cluster of clusters. This relationship is reflected in
the way |mms| models clusters, and it might lead to unexpected results from
the **Clusters** resource. As an example, consider a deployment with one
sharded cluster containing four shards, and each shard is a three-node replica
set. In this scenario, the **Clusters** resource will return five entities:
one that represents the sharded cluster, and four to represent the replica
sets (shards). However, if each shard in this fictitious deployment was a
standalone ``mongod`` instead of a replica set, then the **Clusters** resource
would only return one entity representing the sharded cluster.


Sample Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "yyy",
     "groupId": "xxx",
     "typeName": "REPLICA_SET",
     "clusterName": "Cluster 0",
     "shardName": "shard001",
     "replicaSetName": "rs1",
     "lastHeartbeat": "2014-02-26T17:32:45Z",
     "links": [ ... ]
   }

Entity Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - id
     - string
     - Unique identifier.
   * - groupId
     - string
     - ID of the group that owns this cluster.
   * - typeName
     - enum
     - Specifies what kind of cluster this is. Possible values are:
       ``MASTER_SLAVE REPLICA_SET SHARDED SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``
   * - clusterName
     - string
     - Display name of the cluster. Only applies to sharded clusters. Note that
       ``mongod`` itself doesn't allow you to name a cluster; this name is
       supplied by (and editable within) |mms|. For a replica set within a sharded
       cluster, the cluster name is the name of its parent cluster.
   * - shardName
     - string
     - Name of the shard. Only present for a cluster of type ``SHARDED`` or
       ``REPLICA_SET`` that is part of a sharded cluster.
   * - replicaSetName
     - string
     - Name of the replica set. Only present for a cluster of type
       ``REPLICA_SET``.
   * - lastHeartbeat
     - date
     - The approximate last time |mms| processed a ping from this cluster.

Links
~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Relation
     - Description
   * - self
     - Me
   * - parentCluster
     - The parent cluster. Only present if the type is ``SHARDED`` or
       ``REPLICA_SET`` within a sharded cluster.
   * - group
     - The group that this cluster belongs to.
   * - clusters
     - The member shards that belong to this cluster. Only present if the type
       is ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``.
   * - hosts
     - The member hosts that belong to this cluster. Present for all types
       except ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``. Note: to get the hosts of a sharded
       cluster, follow the ``clusters`` link and get the ``hosts`` for each
       shard.


Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

- ``GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/clusters/CLUSTER-ID`` - Get a single
  cluster by ID.

- ``GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/clusters`` - Get all clusters in a
  group. Note that if |mms| hasn't received a ping from a cluster in several days,
  it will be considered inactive and will be filtered from this list. Use the
  ``parentClusterId`` query parameter to get all clusters with the specified
  parent cluster ID. The list of entities is sorted in ascending order by the
  date that |mms| discovered the cluster.

- ``PATCH /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/clusters/CLUSTER-ID`` - Update a
  cluster by ID. The only property that you may modify is the ``clusterName``,
  since all other properties of a cluster are discovered by |mms|. Additionally,
  this operation is only permitted on clusters of type ``SHARDED`` and
  ``SHARDED_REPLICA_SET``.
