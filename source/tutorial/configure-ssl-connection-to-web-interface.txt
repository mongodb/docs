You can configure |onprem| to encrypt connections from all Agents to
|onprem|, from website clients to the |application|, and from 
API clients to the REST API. 

To encrypt connections, you can:

- Set up an |https| proxy in front of |onprem|, or

- Run the |application| over |https|, as described on this page.
 
The following procedure configures |onprem| with a ``.pem`` file that
contains the |onprem| host's |tls-ssl| certificate. 

- If you are using automation, the {+aagent+} 
  updates the agents to use |https| after successfully completing the 
  procedure.

- If you are not using automation, you must configure all of the
  agents using the same procedure. By default, |onprem| accesses 
  |https| on port ``8443``.

   - To learn more about ``.pem`` files, read the
     :manual:`.pem file section </tutorial/configure-ssl>` in the 
     MongoDB manual.

   - To configure the {+bagent+}, see 
     :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ssl`.

   - To configure the {+magent+}, see 
     :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ssl`.
