This tutorial shows you how to stop :ref:`monitoring a process
<monitoring-functional-overview>`. Once you
stop monitoring a process, |mms| stops displaying its status and tracking its
metrics.

Understand the Objectives
-------------------------

Learn how to use the {+admin-api+} to:

- Find the host ID for the process.
- Stop monitoring the process that matches the host ID.
- Verify that |mms| no longer monitors the process.

Complete the Prerequisites
--------------------------

Complete these prerequisites before you complete the tutorial.

- :doc:`Configure your access to the {+admin-api+} </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`.

  the following roles:

  - :authrole:`Project Monitoring Admin`
  - :authrole:`Project Owner`
- :ref:`Terminate the backups <terminate-backup>` for the process before you
  stop monitoring it.
