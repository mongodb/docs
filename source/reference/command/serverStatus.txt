.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database's state. Monitoring
   applications can run this command at a regular interval to
   collect statistics about the instance.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1 } )

The value (i.e. ``1`` above) does not affect the operation of the
command. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
:method:`db.serverStatus()` wrapper for the command.

.. seealso::

   Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also displayed
   dynamically by :binary:`~bin.mongostat`. See the
   :doc:`/reference/program/mongostat` command for more information.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/serverStatus-command-projection.rst

For example, the following operation suppresses the ``repl``,
``metrics`` and ``locks`` information in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )

The following example includes
all :ref:`server-status-repl` information in the output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1,  repl: 1 } )

Include ``mirroredReads``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information (available
starting in version 4.4) is not included in the output. To return
:serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information, you must explicitly specify
the inclusion:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, mirroredReads: 1 } )

Include ``latchAnalysis``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :serverstatus:`latchAnalysis` information (available
starting in version 4.4) is not included in the output. To return
:serverstatus:`latchAnalysis` information, you must explicitly specify
the inclusion:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, latchAnalysis: 1 } )

.. _server-status-output:

Output
------

.. note::

   The output fields vary depending on the version of MongoDB,
   underlying operating system platform, the storage engine, and the
   kind of node, including :binary:`~bin.mongos`, :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :term:`replica set` member.

   For the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output specific to the version of
   your MongoDB, refer to the appropriate version of the MongoDB Manual.

      "user" : <num>,
      "rollovers" : <num>
   },

.. serverstatus:: asserts

   A document that reports on the number of assertions raised since the
   MongoDB process started. While assert errors are typically uncommon,
   if there are non-zero values for the :data:`asserts`, you should
   check the log file for more information. In many cases, these errors
   are trivial, but are worth investigating.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.regular

   The number of regular assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Check the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.warning

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, the field returns zero ``0``.

   In earlier versions, the field returns the number of warnings raised
   since the MongoDB process started.

   the MongoDB process started. These are errors that user may
   generate, such as out of disk space or duplicate key. You can
   prevent these assertions by fixing a problem with your application
   or deployment. Check the MongoDB log for more information.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.rollovers

   The number of times that the rollover counters have rolled over
   since the last time the MongoDB process started. The counters will
   rollover to zero after 2\ :superscript:`30` assertions. Use this
   value to provide context to the other values in the

   },

.. serverstatus:: extra_info

   A document that provides additional information regarding the
   underlying system.

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.note

   A string with the text ``"fields vary by platform."``

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.heap_usage_bytes

   The total size in bytes of heap space used by the database process.
   Available on Unix/Linux systems only.

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.page_faults

   The total number of page faults. The
   :serverstatus:`extra_info.page_faults` counter may increase
   dramatically during moments of poor performance and may correlate
   with limited memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and
   sporadic page faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.

   Windows draws a distinction between "hard" page faults involving
   disk I/O, and "soft" page faults that only require moving pages in
   memory. MongoDB counts both hard and soft page faults in this
   statistic.

   flow control enabled, as the :data:`majority commit
   <replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>` point lag grows
   close to the :parameter:`flowControlTargetLagSeconds`, writes on the
   primary must obtain tickets before taking locks. As such, the
   metrics returned are meaningful when run on the primary.

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

   data on lock uses.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.totalTime

   The time, in microseconds, since the database last started and
   created the :serverstatus:`globalLock`. This is roughly equivalent
   to total server uptime.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue

   A document that provides information concerning the number of
   operations queued because of a lock.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.total

   The total number of operations queued waiting for the lock (i.e.,
   the sum of :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.readers` and
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.writers`).

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations,
   should cause no concern. The
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.activeClients` readers and writers
   information provides context for this data.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   The number of operations that are currently queued and waiting for
   the read lock. A consistently small read-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, should cause no concern.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.writers

   The number of operations that are currently queued and waiting for
   the write lock. A consistently small write-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, is no cause for concern.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.activeClients

   A document that provides information about the number of connected
   clients and the read and write operations performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue` data.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.activeClients.total

   The total number of internal client connections to the database

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics

   A document which contains metrics on metadata refresh on sharded
   clusters.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countStaleConfigErrors

   The total number of times that threads hit stale config exception.
   Since a stale config exception triggers a refresh of the metadata,
   this number is roughly proportional to the number of metadata
   refreshes.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkStarted

   The total number of times that the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command
   has started on the shard, of which this node is a member, as part of
   a :ref:`chunk migration process <chunk-migration-procedure>`. This
   increasing number does not consider whether the chunk migrations
   succeed or not.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalDonorChunkCloneTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, taken by the :ref:`clone phase
   of the chunk migrations <chunk-migration-procedure>` from this
   shard, of which this node is a member. Specifically, for each
   migration from this shard, the tracked time starts with the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command and ends before the destination shard
   enters a catch-up phase to apply changes that occurred during the
   :ref:`chunk migrations <chunk-migration-procedure>`.

   metadata phase, all operations on the collection are blocked.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, taken by the :ref:`catch-up
   phase and the update metadata phase of the chunk migrations
   <chunk-migration-procedure>` from this shard, of which this node is
   a member.

   To calculate the duration of the catch-up phase, subtract

      * - Metrics
        - Description

      * - ``operationCount``
        - The number of write operations in the transaction.

      * - ``oplogOperationBytes``

        - The size of the corresponding oplog entry or entries for
          the transaction. [#oplog-change]_

      * - ``writeConcern``
        - The write concern used for the transaction.

   .. versionadded:: 4.2.2 (*Also available in 4.0.9*)

.. [#oplog-change]

   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB creates as many oplog entries as
   necessary to the encapsulate all write operations in a transaction
   whereas in version 4.0, the write operations in a transaction must
   fit within a single oplog entry. See :ref:`txn-oplog-size-limit` for
   details.

.. note::

   The following is not an exhaustive list.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.uri

   A string. For internal use by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.async

   A document that returns statistics related to the asynchronous
   operations API. This is unused by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.block-manager

   A document that returns statistics on the block manager operations.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache

   A document that returns statistics on the cache and page evictions
   from the cache.

   The following describes some of the key
   :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache` statistics:

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.maximum bytes configured

      Maximum cache size.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.bytes currently in the cache

      Size in byte of the data currently in cache. This value should
      not be greater than the ``maximum bytes configured`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.unmodified pages evicted

      Main statistics for page eviction.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.tracked dirty bytes in the cache

      Size in bytes of the dirty data in the cache. This value should
      be less than the ``bytes currently in the cache`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache

      Number of pages read into the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache` with
      the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache

      Number of pages written from the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache`
      with the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-cache-setting.rst

      Amount of time, in milliseconds, to create the most recent
      checkpoint. An increase in this value under stead write load may
      indicate saturation on the I/O subsystem.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions

   A document that returns information on the number of concurrent of
   read and write transactions allowed into the WiredTiger storage
   engine. These settings are MongoDB-specific.

   To change the settings for concurrent

.. _server-status-write-backs-queued:

writeBacksQueued
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "writeBacksQueued" : <boolean>,

.. serverstatus:: writeBacksQueued

   A boolean that indicates whether there are operations from a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance queued for retrying. Typically, this
   value is false.  See also :term:`writeBacks`.

.. _memory-status:

      "virtual" : <int>,
      "supported" : <boolean>,
      "mapped" : <int>,
      "mappedWithJournal" : <int>
   },


.. serverstatus:: mem

   A document that reports on the system architecture of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and current memory use.

.. serverstatus:: mem.bits

   A number, either ``64`` or ``32``, that indicates whether the
   MongoDB instance is compiled for 64-bit or 32-bit architecture.

.. serverstatus:: mem.resident

   The value of :serverstatus:`mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to
   the amount of RAM, in mebibyte (MiB), currently used by the database
   process. During normal use, this value tends to grow. In dedicated
   database servers, this number tends to approach the total amount of
   system memory.

.. serverstatus:: mem.virtual

   :serverstatus:`mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in mebibyte
   (MiB), of virtual memory used by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

.. serverstatus:: mem.supported

   A boolean that indicates whether the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :serverstatus:`mem` values may not be accessible to the database
   server.


.. serverstatus:: mem.note

   The field :serverstatus:`mem.note` appears if
   :serverstatus:`mem.supported` is false.

   The :serverstatus:`mem.note` field contains the text: ``"not all mem
   info support on this platform"``.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.wtime.num

   The total number of :dbcommand:`getLastError` operations with a
   specified write concern (i.e. ``w``) that wait for one or more
   members of a replica set to acknowledge the write operation (i.e. a
   ``w`` value greater than ``1``.)

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.wtime.totalMillis

   The total amount of time in milliseconds that the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   has spent performing :dbcommand:`getLastError` operations with write
   concern (i.e. ``w``) that wait for one or more members of a replica
   set to acknowledge the write operation (i.e. a ``w`` value greater
   than ``1``.)

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.wtimeouts

   The number of times that :term:`write concern` operations have timed
   out as a result of the ``wtimeout`` threshold to
   :dbcommand:`getLastError`. This number increments for both default
   and non-default write concern specifications.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.getLastError.default

   A document that reports on the use of :dbcommand:`getLastError`
   specific to operations where a default write concern was used
   (meaning, a non-``clientSupplied`` write concern). The possible
   origins of a default write concern are:
   
   - ``implicitDefault``
   - ``customDefault``
   - ``getLastErrorDefaults``
   
   Refer to the following table for information on
   each possible write concern origin, or ``provenance``:

   perform the sort operation using an index.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operation.writeConflicts

   The total number of queries that encountered write conflicts.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.queryExecutor

   A document that reports data from the query execution system.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.queryExecutor.scanned

   The total number of index items scanned during queries and

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores` reports on the
   ``getmore`` operations, which are requests for additional results
   from the oplog :term:`cursor` as part of the oplog replication
   process.

   .. TODO move the documentation of getmore into some central place

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.num

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores.num` reports the
   total number of ``getmore`` operations, which are operations that
   request an additional set of operations from the replication sync
   source.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.totalMillis

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores.totalMillis`
   reports the total amount of time required to collect data from
   ``getmore`` operations.

   .. note::

      This number can be quite large, as MongoDB will wait for more
      data even if the ``getmore`` operation does not initial return
      data.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.numEmptyBatches

   The number of empty ``oplog`` batches a secondary receives from its
   sync source. A secondary receives an empty batch if it is fully
   synced with its source and either:
   
   - The ``getmore`` times out waiting for more data, or
   
   - The sync source's majority commit point has advanced since the
     last batch sent to this secondary.

   For a primary, if the instance was previously a secondary, the
   number reports on the empty batches received when it was a
   secondary. Otherwise, for a primary, this number is ``0``.
