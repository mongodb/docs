.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` is an :term:`admin database` command that 
   allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs. Use the following syntax:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
   :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to 
   send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` will cause the existing log file to be 
   renamed by appending the current timestamp to the filename.  
   The rotated files will have a timestamp of the form 
   <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS> 
   appended to the filename.
   A new log file will be created
   with the name which was specified by the 
   :setting:`--logpath` runtime option to :program:`mongod` 
   or :program:`mongos`.

   .. note::

      .. versionadded:: 2.0.3   
      The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is available to 
      :program:`mongod` instances running on Windows systems with 
      MongoDB release 2.0.3 and higher.

.. :error:`16175` is thrown if logRotate fails
