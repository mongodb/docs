Install Python 2.4 Requirements
-------------------------------

If your system is running Python 2.4, you will need to install the
``hmac`` and ``hashlib`` Python modules. You can do so using
``easy_install`` as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo easy_install hmac hashlib

.. important::

   Do not use ``pip`` to install modules when using Python 2.4 or 2.5,
   as there are some compatibility issues. Some users have reported
   problems installing ``hmac``, if ``easy_install`` produces an error
   or you suspect a problem with these libraries see
   :ref:`instructions for installing hmac manually <troubleshooting-hmac>`.

Alternate ``hmac`` Installation
-------------------------------

If ``easy_install`` produces an error when trying to install ``hmac``,
or you see the following error in your agent logs, you will need to
install the ``hmac`` package manually:

.. code-block:: none

   AttributeError:'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'new'

To install the ``hmac`` package, begin by downloading the latest
source package. The following example uses version ``20101005``.
Issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/h/hmac/hmac-20101005.tar.gz

Always download the latest version of ``hmac``, which
you can find at the `hmac page on PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hmac>`_.

Extract the files from the archive with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   tar -zxf hmac-20101005.tar.gz

Change directories and build and install the package with the
following sequence:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd hmac-20101005/
   python setup.py install

You may need root (i.e. ``sudo``) privileges to run the final
``install`` step.
