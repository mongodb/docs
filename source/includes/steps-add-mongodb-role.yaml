  A role applies to the database on which it is defined and can grant access
  down to the collection level. The combination of the role name and its
  database uniquely identify that role. Type the database name in the
  :guilabel:`database` :guilabel:`Identifier` field and the name you want for
  the role in the :guilabel:`name` :guilabel:`Identifier` field.

  You can grant privileges in two ways:

  - heading: "Give a role the privileges of another role."

      To grant a new role all the privileges of one or more existing roles,
      select the roles in the :guilabel:`Inherits From` field. The field
      provides a drop-down list that includes both :manual:`MongoDB
      built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` and any custom roles you
      have already created.
  - heading: "Add a privilege directly."
    pre: |
      To grant specific privileges to the role, click :guilabel:`ADD
      PRIVILEGES FOR A RESOURCE`.

      In the :guilabel:`Resource` field, specify the resource to which to
      apply the role. Select the database from the drop-down menu.
      To specify the whole database, leave the field
      blank. To specify a collection, enter the collection name. If the
      resource is on the ``admin`` database, you can click
      :guilabel:`ADMIN` and apply the role outside the ``admin`` database.

      In the :guilabel:`Available Privileges` section, select the actions
      to apply. For a description of each action, see :manual:`Privilege
      Actions </reference/privilege-actions>` in the MongoDB manual.
