Overview
--------

Billing is at the organization level. Each organization has its own
account, plan, and billing method. All projects in an organization
share the same billing settings.

.. _pricing-information:

Pricing Information for |mms| Features
--------------------------------------

|mms| pricing is described at
`https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_.

Monthly Billing
---------------

Your credit card is charged monthly.

|mms| Standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |mms| Standard, |mms| monthly charges are based on :ref:`Server
Hours <server-pricing>` and :ref:`backup-pricing`.

|mms| Premium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |mms| Premium, |mms| monthly charges are based on
:ref:`backup-pricing`.

.. _server-pricing:

Server Hours (|mms| Standard)
-----------------------------

The following charges are for |mms| Standard only.

The monthly charges include a charge for each billable server. A server
is billable if it is running a :program:`mongod` process and is a data
bearing node. Servers that act solely as config servers, arbiters and
:program:`mongos` routers are not billable.

The monthly rate is as specified on
`https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_. The monthly
rate for each server is annualized and then divided by ``365 * 24`` to
calculate an an Hourly Server Rate for each server. We sample your
account once per hour to determine the number of servers running.

.. _backup-pricing:

Backup Costs
------------

Backup costs are affected by both the size of your backed-up snapshots
and on your settings for snapshot frequency and retention.

Size
~~~~

Monthly backup costs are based on the size per-gigabyte of your most
recent snapshot.

The cost per GB per month for backup pricing is as specified on
`https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_. The monthly
rate is annualized and then divided by 365 to arrive at a Daily Backup
Rate per GB. The first 1 GB per replica set is free.

The size of the snapshot is roughly equivalent to the size of all
documents and all indexes for all the databases backed up. To retrieve
the size in gigabyte of the documents and indexes for a given database,
you can issue the :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats>`
method and sum the ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize`` fields.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stats(1024*1024*1024).dataSize + db.stats(1024*1024*1024).indexSize

Snapshot Frequency and Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rate is based on your having 28 snapshots at steady state: 

- The six-hour snapshots are kept for two days; 

- The daily snapshots for one week,

- The weekly snapshots for one month,

- The monthly for one year. 

Adding that up, you get 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 snapshots. We adjust the
backup rate each day based on the following formula:

.. code-block:: none

   backupRatePerMonth = $1.25 + snapshotAtSteadyState/28 * $1.25

.. seealso:: :ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`.

Lowering the Monthly Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frequency and Retention Settings
````````````````````````````````

Lowering snapshot frequency or retaining fewer snapshots lowers the
cost per gigabyte. Retaining an increased number of snapshots or
increasing the snapshot retention increases the cost per gigabyte.

To change a backed-up deployment's schedule, click :guilabel:`Backup`, then
the ellipsis icon for the backup, then :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule`.
Administrators can change frequency and retention through the
:doc:`snapshotSchedule resource </reference/api/snapshot-schedule>` in the
API. Lowering snapshot frequency increases how long it takes to build a
point-in-time restore.


Excluding Databases or Collections
``````````````````````````````````

To reduce the size of your snapshots, you can exclude non-mission
critical databases and collections from your backup. From the Backup
Dashboard, click on the gear icon, select :guilabel:`Edit Excluded
Namespaces` and enter the namespaces that you wish to exclude.
