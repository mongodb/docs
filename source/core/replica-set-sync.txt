In order to maintain up-to-date copies of the shared data set,
secondary members of a replica set :term:`sync` or replicate data from
other members. MongoDB uses two forms of data synchronization:
initial sync to populate new members
with the full data set, and replication to apply ongoing changes to the
entire data set.

.. _replica-set-initial-sync:

Initial Sync
------------

Initial sync copies all the data from one member of the replica set to
another member. A member uses initial sync when the member has no data,
such as when the member is new, or when the member has data but is
missing a history of the set's replication.

When you perform an initial sync, MongoDB:

#. Clones all databases. To clone, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` queries every
   collection in each source database and inserts all data into its
   own copies of these collections.  At this time, ``_id`` indexes are
   also built. The clone process only copies valid data, omitting
   invalid documents.

#. Applies all changes to the data set. Using the oplog from the
   source, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` updates its data set to reflect the
   current state of the replica set.

#. Builds all indexes on all collections (except ``_id`` indexes,
   which were already completed).

   When the :binary:`~bin.mongod` finishes building all index builds, the member
   can transition to a normal state, i.e. :term:`secondary`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   When the clone process omits an invalid document from the sync,
   MongoDB writes a message to the logs that begins with ``Cloner:
   found corrupt document in <collection>``.

To perform an initial sync, see
:doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.

Initial Sync and ``renameCollection``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.12

Starting in MongoDB 3.2.12, if a collection is renamed on the sync
source while an initial sync is running, the initial sync for the
target member fails and restarts to avoid data corruption (See
:issue:`SERVER-26117`). Operations that rename collections include:

- :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command and
  :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method.

- Aggregation (:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method or
  :dbcommand:`aggregate` command) with the :pipeline:`$out` stage.

- Map-reduce (:method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` method or
  :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command) with the ``out`` option.

- :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command.

.. _replica-set-replication:

Replication
-----------

Secondary members replicate data continuously after the initial sync.
Secondary members copy the :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` from
their *sync from* source and apply these operations in an asynchronous
process.

In most cases, secondaries sync from the primary. Secondaries may
automatically change their *sync from* source if needed based on
changes in the ping time and state of other members' replication.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   .. include:: /includes/fact-voting-node-sync-incompatibility.rst

Secondaries avoid syncing from
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>` and :ref:`hidden
members <replica-set-hidden-members>`.

If a secondary member has :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` set to ``true``,
it can only sync from other members where :rsconf:`~members[n].buildIndexes`
is ``true``. Members where :rsconf:`~members[n].buildIndexes` is ``false`` can
sync from any other member, barring other sync restrictions.
:rsconf:`~members[n].buildIndexes` is ``true`` by default.

.. _replica-set-internals-multi-threaded-replication:

Multithreaded Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB applies write operations in batches using multiple threads to
improve concurrency. MongoDB groups batches by namespace (:ref:`MMAPv1
<storage-mmapv1>`) or by document id (:ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`) and simultaneously applies each group of
operations using a different thread. MongoDB always applies write
operations to a given document in their original write order.

While applying a batch, MongoDB blocks all read operations. As a
result, secondary read queries can never return data that reflect a
state that never existed on the primary.

Pre-Fetching Indexes to Improve Replication Throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   Applies to MMAPv1 only.

With the :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, MongoDB fetches
memory pages that hold affected data and indexes to help improve the
performance of applying oplog entries. This *pre-fetch* stage minimizes
the amount of time MongoDB holds write locks while applying oplog
entries. By default, secondaries will pre-fetch all :ref:`indexes`.

Optionally, you can disable all pre-fetching or only pre-fetch
the index on the ``_id`` field. See the :setting:`~replication.secondaryIndexPrefetch`
setting for more information.
