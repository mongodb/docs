msgid "Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, [#chunk-disambiguation]_ and stores each of those chunks as a separate document. By default GridFS limits chunk size to 255k. GridFS uses two collections to store files. One collection stores the file chunks, and the other stores file metadata."

You also can access information from arbitrary sections of files, which allows you to \"skip\" into the middle of a video or audio file."
