Add the MongoDB Java driver to your project in one of the following ways:

- If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the following to
  your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

  .. include:: /includes/crud/install/java-maven-versioned.rst

- If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
  ``build.gradle`` dependencies list:

  .. include:: /includes/crud/install/java-gradle-versioned.rst

Once you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your

the project in your IDE.
