Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: reIndex

   .. deprecated:: 6.0
   
   Attempting to run the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command writes a warning 
   message to the log.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.collection.reIndex` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command drops all indexes on a
   collection and recreates them. This operation may be expensive for
   collections that have a large amount of data and/or a large number
   of indexes. 

   .. warning::

      - :dbcommand:`reIndex` may only be run on :term:`standalone` 
        instances. 
      - For most users, the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command is unnecessary.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-no-atlas-support.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        reIndex: <collection> 
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Description
 
   * - reIndex
     - The name of the collection to reindex.
 

Behavior
--------

For MongoDB 5.0 or later, :dbcommand:`reIndex` may only be run on 
:term:`standalone` instances.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`reIndex` obtains an exclusive (W) lock on the collection and blocks 
other operations on the collection until it completes.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

.. see::

   :doc:`/core/index-creation` for more information on the
   behavior of indexing operations in MongoDB.
