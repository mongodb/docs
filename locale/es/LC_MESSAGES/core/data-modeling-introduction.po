"Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. Unlike SQL databases, where you "
"must determine and declare a table's schema before inserting data, "
"MongoDB's :term:`collections <collection>` do not enforce "
":term:`document` structure. This flexibility facilitates the mapping of "
"documents to an entity or an object. Each document can match the data "
"fields of the represented entity, even if the data has substantial "
"variation. In practice, however, the documents in a collection share a "
"similar structure."

"The key challenge in data modeling is balancing the needs of the "
"application, the performance characteristics of the database engine, and "

"the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and processing "
"of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data itself."

"In MongoDB, write operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level, "
"and no single write operation can atomically affect more than one "
"document or more than one collection. A denormalized data model with "
"embedded data combines all related data for a represented entity in a "
"single document. This facilitates atomic write operations since a single "
"write operation can insert or update the data for an entity. Normalizing "
"the data would split the data across multiple collections and would "
"require multiple write operations that are not atomic collectively."
