Overview 
--------

|charts| displays up to six prebuilt charts based on the data
source that you selected. You can use any one of the suggested charts
when you create a new chart or when you modify an existing chart. After
applying a suggested chart, you can make changes to the chart type and
add or remove fields if you wish to customize the prebuilt chart.

      chart type and add or remove fields if you wish to customize the
      prebuilt chart.
