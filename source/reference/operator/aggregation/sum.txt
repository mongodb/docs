==================
$sum (aggregation)
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. group:: $sum

   Returns the sum of all the values for a specified
   field in the grouped documents, as in the second use above.

   Alternately, if you specify a value as an argument,
   :group:`$sum` will increment this field by the specified value
   for every document in the grouping. Typically, as in the first
   use above, specify a value of ``1`` in order to count members of the
   group.
