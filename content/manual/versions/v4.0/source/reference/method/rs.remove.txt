.. method:: rs.remove(hostname)

   Removes the member described by the ``hostname`` parameter from the
   current :term:`replica set`. This function will disconnect the
   shell briefly and forces a reconnection as the :term:`replica set`
   renegotiates which member will be :term:`primary`. As a
   result, the shell will display an error even if this command
   succeeds.

   The :method:`rs.remove()` method has the following parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``hostname``
   
        - string
   
        - The hostname of a system in the replica set.
          
          
   


   .. note::

      Before running the :method:`rs.remove()` operation, it is good
      practice to *shut down* the replica set member that you are
      removing.
