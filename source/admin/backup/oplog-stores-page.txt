This page configures the backing replica sets that store oplog slices.
Oplog slices are compressed batches of the entries in the tailed
:term:`oplogs <oplog>` of your backed-up deployments.

.. warning::

   Do not modify the oplog store’s connection string to point to a
   different replica set. Existing data will not be copied and a resync
   will be required.

From this page you can:

- Add a member to a replica set by adding the host to the replica set
  connection string in the :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>` field. Do
  **not** modify the connection string to point to a different replica
  set.

- Change the authentication credentials or connection options for a
  oplog store by modifying the appropriate fields.

- Add an additional oplog store by clicking the :guilabel:`Add New
  Oplog Store` button at the bottom of the page.

- Enable and disable new assignments to oplog stores using the
  checkboxes in the :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` column.

- Assign labels that can be used to assign the oplog store to a
  specific group. Enter labels in :guilabel:`Assignment Labels`.
  Separate multiple labels with commas.

After saving changes to the oplog store’s values, you must restart all
the |onprem| instances, including those running activated Backup
Daemons, for the changes to take effect.
