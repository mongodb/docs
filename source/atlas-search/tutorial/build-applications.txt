The following tutorials take you through the steps for building applications
in :appservices:`{+atlas-app-services+} </>` with features from |fts|:

- The :ref:`reactivesearch-tutorial` tutorial describes how to 
  set up |service| with {+atlas-app-services+}. In the tutorial, you
  use {+atlas-app-services+} to run queries and build a search UI 
  that uses `Searchbox <https://opensource.appbase.io/searchbox/>`_ 
  and `ReactiveSearch <https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/>`_ 
  UI libraries.

- The :appservices:`Build Reverse Search Into Your Application 
  </tutorial/triggers-fts/>` tutorial demonstrates how to build a new feature on top of 
  your application by using a combination of :appservices:`Atlas Triggers 
  </triggers/>`, :appservices:`Atlas Functions </functions>`, and |fts| queries.
  In the tutorial, you build an alerting feature that stores your search parameters 
  in |service| and performs a reverse search on any new documents against your 
  stored parameters.
