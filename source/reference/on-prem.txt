On Prem MMS Reference
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS On Prem components use the default ports and health-check endpoints
described here.

Ports
-----

Although the following components are logically distinct, the *MMS
Application and Monitoring Server*, *MMS Backup Ingestion Server*, and
*MMS Backup Alerts Service* are all part of the MMS Application
package and typically run on a single system. The MMS Backup Daemon
typically runs on a distinct system.

MMS Application and Monitoring Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. describe:: 8080

   Web server, available from browsers. The system running the
   Monitoring Agent must be able to access this port as well.

MMS Backup Ingestion Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. describe:: 8081

   Available from browsers for HTTP restores, and from systems running
   the Backup Agent.

.. describe:: 8091

   *Optional*

   Used for internal diagnostics. Only available on the localhost interface.

MMS Backup Alerts Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. describe:: 8650

   A "kill-port" that the control script uses to signal a shutdown.

   Only available on the localhost interface.

.. describe:: 8092

   *Optional*

   Used for internal diagnostics. Only available on the localhost interface.


MMS Backup Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. describe:: 8640

   A "kill-port" that the control script uses to signal a shutdown.

   Only available on the localhost interface.

.. describe:: 27500-27503

   The backup daemon uses this port range to on the localhost
   interface to run :program:`mongod` instances to apply oplog entries
   to maintain the local copies of the backed up database.

.. describe:: 8090

   *Optional*

   Used for internal diagnostics. Only available on the localhost interface.

Health-Check Endpoints
----------------------

MMS On Prem provides health-check endpoints for the monitoring of the On
Prem components via a standard monitoring service, such as Zabbix or
Nagios.

.. _backup-http-service-endpoint:

Backup HTTP Service Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Backup HTTP Service <backup-http-service>` on the :ref:`MMS
Application and Monitoring Server <mms-application-package>` exposes the
following endpoint:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://localhost:8091/health

The endpoint checks the connections from the service to the :ref:`MMS
Application Database <mms-application-database>` and the :ref:`MMS Backup
Blockstore Database <mms-backup-blockstore-database>`

A successful return from the endpoint returns the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   {
     "mms_db": "OK",
     "backup_db": "OK"
   }

.. _backup-alert-service-endpoint:

Backup Alert Service Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Backup Alert Service <backup-alert-service>` on the :ref:`MMS
Application and Monitoring Server <mms-application-package>` exposes the
following health-check endpoint:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://localhost:8092/health

.. _backup-daemon-endpoint:

Backup Daemon Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` on the Backup Daemon server
exposes a health-check endpoint at:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://localhost:8090/health
