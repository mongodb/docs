===============================
Delete {+adl+} Pipeline 
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete your {+dl+} pipeline at any time from the |service| |ui| 
and {+dl+} Pipelines |api|. When you delete your {+dl+} pipeline, 
|service| deletes all underlying datasets, including the data, and 
removes the {+dl+} datasets from your federated database instances 
where it's referenced. You can't undo this operation.
