An :abbr:`IP address (Internet Protocol address)` is a unique numeric
identifier for a device connecting to a network. In |service|, you can 
only connect to a cluster from a trusted IP address. Within |service|, 
you can create a list of trusted IP addresses, referred to as a 
whitelist, that can be used to connect to your cluster and access your 
data. 

Procedure
---------

You must add your IP address to the whitelist before you can connect to 
your cluster. To add your IP address to the whitelist:

   For information on configuring additional whitelist entries in
   your project, see :doc:`/security-whitelist/`.

Next steps

Now that you added your connection IP address to the whitelist, 
proceed to :doc:`Create a Database User for Your Cluster 
</tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster>`.
