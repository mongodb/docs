   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Configure` for the Prometheus integration card.
      
   .. step:: Enter your preferred username and password.

      Prometheus authentication credentials are specifically designed
      for use with the Prometheus integration in |mms|. |mms| uses these
      credentials to only access the Prometheus discovery endpoint and
      scrape Prometheus metrics from |mms| nodes. They are strictly
      limited to these functions and do not have any additional
      permissions or capabilities beyond accessing and collecting
      monitoring data. 
      
      .. important::
      
         Copy your username and password in a secure location. You can't
         access the password after you leave this screen.
      
   .. step:: Enter your IP address and port.
      
      .. tip::
      
         The default value, ``0.0.0.0:9216``, scrapes metrics on port
         ``9216`` on all |ipv4| addresses on the local machine.
      
   .. step:: (Optional) Encrypt all Prometheus metrics.
      
      If you enable this setting, |mms| assures that your Prometheus
      instance uses ``https`` to scrape metrics.

                 You are responsible for the following:
                 
                 - TLS Certificate Key File issuance and renewal.
                 - Checking if the endpoint started correctly in the automation agent logs.
      
         * - TLS Certificate Key File Password
           - Required if the certificate key file is encrypted.

         * - `HTTP SD <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/>`__
           - This method requires Prometheus v2.28 and later. It
             generates the `scrape_config <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config>`__
             part of your `configuration file <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file>`__
             to discover targets over an HTTP endpoint.
      
         * - `File Service Discovery <https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets>`__
           - This method allows Prometheus to read |yaml| or |json|
             documents to configure the targets to scrape from.
