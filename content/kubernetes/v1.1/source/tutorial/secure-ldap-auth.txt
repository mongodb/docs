General Prerequisites
---------------------

Before you configure LDAP authentication for your MongoDB deployments,
complete the following tasks:

- Ensure that you deploy the MongoDB Enterprise database resource.
  MongoDB Community databases don't support LDAP authentication.
- :doc:`Deploy the replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` or
  :doc:`deploy the sharded cluster </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`
  whose client authentication you want to secure with |ldap|.
