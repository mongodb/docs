  .. important:: Connection Troubleshooting

     If you are having trouble connecting to your {+fdi+}, double check 
     that you have added your IP address to your :atlas:`IP Access List 
     </tutorial/accesslist-connection-ip-address/>` and that you are 
     specifying the correct database user credentials. If you have 
     forgotten your database user credentials, you can always 
     :atlas:`create a new database user 
     </tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/>`.
