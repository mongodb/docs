Overview
--------

To add your existing MongoDB deployments to |mms|
:ref:`monitoring-functional-overview` you must install a Monitoring Agent
on one of the servers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Server Networking Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The servers that host the MongoDB deployment must have full networking
access to each other through their fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
You can view a server's FQDN by issuing ``hostname -f`` in a shell
connected to the server.

MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you will run :term:`MongoDB Enterprise`,
you must manually install a set of dependencies to each
server **before installing MongoDB**. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. See the link for the
server's operating system:

.. include:: /includes/list-links-per-os-for-enterprise-dependencies.rst

Procedure
---------

Install the Monitoring Agent on one of the servers. See
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-monitoring-agent`.
