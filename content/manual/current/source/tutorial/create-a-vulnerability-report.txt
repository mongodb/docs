If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in MongoDB products
or have experienced a security incident related to MongoDB products,
please report the issue to aid in its resolution. For more information on 
vulnerability reports, see the following resources:

* `MongoDB Security information <https://www.mongodb.com/security>`__ on our website 
* `Webform <https://www.mongodb.com/bug-submission-form>`__ for vulnerability report submission

Evaluation of a Vulnerability Report
------------------------------------

MongoDB, Inc. validates all submitted vulnerabilities through internal 
investigation. If needed, MongoDB representatives will reach out to the 
reporter for further information and to provide the results of the 
investigation. Please allow MongoDB representatives up to one week to 
acknowledge submissions.

Disclosure
----------

MongoDB, Inc. requests that you do *not* publicly disclose any information
regarding the vulnerability or exploit the issue until it has had the
opportunity to analyze the vulnerability, to respond to the notification,
and to notify key users, customers, and partners.

The amount of time required to validate a reported vulnerability
depends on the complexity and severity of the issue. MongoDB, Inc. takes all
required vulnerabilities very seriously and will always ensure that
there is a clear and open channel of communication with the reporter.

After validating an issue, MongoDB, Inc. coordinates public disclosure of
the issue with the reporter in a mutually agreed timeframe and
format. If required or requested, the reporter of a vulnerability will
receive credit in the published security bulletin.
