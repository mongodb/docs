MongoDB supports :rfc:`X.509 certificate <5280>` authentication for use
with a secure :doc:`TLS </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`
connection. X.509 client authentication allows clients to authenticate
to servers with certificates rather than with a username and password.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable X.509 Authentication for |mms|, you must obtain valid |tls|
certificates that a single certificate authority (CA) generated and
signed. To learn more about the certificate requirements, see
:manual:`Client x.509 Certificate
</tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication>` in the MongoDB
Manual.

X.509 Client Certificate Authentication requires you to
:doc:`enable and configure </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`
|tls| for the deployment.

Procedures
----------

This tutorial assumes that you have already configured your MongoDB
deployment to use X.509 certificate authentication and |tls|. If you
have not done so, refer to the
:manual:`Use X.509 Certificates to Authenticate Clients
</tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication>` and
:manual:`Configure mongod and mongos for TLS </tutorial/configure-ssl>`
tutorials.

Create MongoDB User from the X.509 ``subject``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Deployments Managed by Automation
      :tabid: managed-x509

      When {+aagent+} is activated, |mms| manages {+mdbagent+} authentication.

      To configure X.509 for {+mdbagent+} authentication, see
      :ref:`enable-x509-for-project`.


   .. tab:: Deployments Not Managed by Automation
      :tabid: unmanaged-x509

      .. include:: /includes/fact-mdbagent-x509-subject-as-user.rst


Edit MongoDB Agent Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use X.509 authentication, you must configure the {+mdbagent+} for
|tls|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/mongodb-agent-configure-tls.rst

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-tls` provides more
details about configuring the MongoDB Agent for |tls|.

After you configure the {+mdbagent+}, 
configure the X.509 Authentication mechanism in the |mms| interface, as
described in :doc:`/tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group`.
