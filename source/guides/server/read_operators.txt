      In the previous read guide, :doc:`/guides/server/read_queries`,
      you read data using embedded fields and ``dot notation``. In
      this guide, you will:

      - read data from the ``inventory`` collection with MongoDB's comparison operators.
      - combine query criteria to make compound queries

     Read Data with Embedded Fields and Comparison Operators
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     In this exercise, you will read data using comparison operators.

     .. include:: /includes/steps/read_operators.rst

     Read Data with Compound Queries
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Now you will read data from MongoDB using AND and OR logic to form compound queries.

     .. include:: /includes/steps/read_compound.rst

     Retrieving Data with More Than One Compounding Clause
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Now you will retrieve data from MongoDB using AND and OR logic together to form compound queries.
