Configuring  |monitoring|
=========================

This document discusses specific configuration options for
|monitoring|, including hardware monitoring with Munin-Node and using
|monitoring| with SSL.

Hardware Monitoring with Munin-Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|monitoring| provides support for collecting and charting hardware
statistics collected with `Munin <http://munin-monitoring.org/>`_. You
must install the ``munin-node`` package on each the host system that
you wish to monitor.

.. note::

   ``munin-node``, and hardware monitoring is only available for
   MongoDB instances running on Linux hosts.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, issue the following command to install
``munin-node``: ::

   sudo apt-get install munin-node

To install ``munin-node`` on Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora systems, issue
the following command: ::
   
   yum install munin-node

.. note:: 

   For Red Hat and CentOS 6.8 systems, you will need to install the
   EPEL repository **before** installing ``munin-node``. To install the
   EPEL repository, issue the following command: ::

      rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

When installation is complete, ensure that ``munin-node``:

- is running. Use the command, "``ps -ef | grep "munin"``" to confirm. If
  the process is not running, issue the command
  "``/etc/init.d/munin-node start``".

- will start following the next system reboot. This is the default
  behavior on most Debian-based systems. Red Hat and related
  distributions should use the "``chkconfig``" command, to configure
  this behavior (i.e. "``chkconfig munin-node on``")

- is accessible from the system running the agent. ``munin-node`` uses
  port 4949, which needs to be open on the monitored system, so the
  agent can access this data source. Use the following procedure to
  test access: ::

       telnet [HOSTNAME] 4949
       fetch iostat
       fetch iostat_ios
       fetch cpu

  Replace ``[HOSTNAME]`` with the hostname of the monitored
  system. Run these commands from the system where the MMS Agent is
  running. If these "``fetch``" commands return data, then
  ``munin-node`` is running and accessible by MMS agent.

.. note:: 

   On some platforms, ``munin-node`` does not have all required
   plugins enabled.

   For CentOS, the ``munin-node`` package does not have the ``iostat``
   and ``iostat_ios`` plugins enabled. Use the following operation to enable
   these plugins: ::
   
       sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/iostat /etc/munin/plugins/iostat 
       sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/iostat_ios /etc/munin/plugins/iostat_ios 
       sudo /etc/init.d/munin-node restart

If ``munin-node`` is running but inaccessible, make sure that you have
access granted for the system running the Monitoring agent and that no
firewalls block the port between ``munin-node`` and the Monitoring
agent. You may find the ``munin-node`` configuration at
"``/etc/munin-node/munin-node.conf``" or "``/etc/munin-node.conf``",
depending on your distribution.

Additional considerations:

- If you have numbered disk devices (e.g. ``/dev/sda1`` and
  ``/dev/sda2``) then you will need to configure support for numbered
  disk in the munin iostat plugin. Find the configuration file at
  ``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node`` or a similar path, and add
  the following value: ::

       [iostat]
           env.SHOW_NUMBERED 1

- If you have Munin enabled and do not have ``iostat ios`` data in
  your Munin charts, your ``munin-node`` may not have write access to
  required state files in its ``munin/plugin-state/`` directory. See
  the ``munin-node`` plugin log (i.e. ``/var/log/munin/munin-node.log``
  or similar depending on your distribution) for more information.

  The full path of this state directory depends on the
  system, but is typically ``/var/lib/munin/plugin-state/``. Run the
  following command sequence to correct this issue: ::

       touch /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/iostat-ios.state
       chown -R [username]:[group] /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/
       chmod -R 660 /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/

  Replace ``[username]`` and ``[group]`` with the username and group
  that the ``munin-node`` process runs with.

If you encounter any other problems, check the log files for
``munin-node`` to ensure that there are no errors with
Munin. ``munin-node`` writes logs files in the ``/var/log/`` directory
on the monitored system.

.. _ssl:

Using SSL with |monitoring|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|monitoring| can monitor MongoDB instances running with SSL. To use SSL with
``mongod`` and ``mongos``, you must enable it at compile time, or use
one of the `subscriber builds <http://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download>`_.
MongoDB added SSL support in version 2.0.

To monitor a host with SSL enabled, you can either:

1. Edit the ``settings.py`` file in your agent installation, so that
   the ``useSslForAllConnections`` value is ``True``, as follows: ::

      useSslForAllConnections = True

   Then restart the Monitoring agent. After restarting the agent you
   may observe a five minute delay before |monitoring| receives data
   from the agent.

2. Enable support on a per-host basis in the MMS console by clicking
   on the edit (i.e. "Pencil") button on the right hand-side of the
   "Hosts" page. In the dialogue that pops up, click the check-box on
   the SSL tab.

   If you enable SSL support globally you **will not** be able to
   override this setting on a per-host basis.
