     comma. Use *which* to introduce a nonrestrictive clause, and use

     independent clauses, it must be preceded by *and* or by a
     semicolon. Preceding it with only a comma creates a comma splice.

   trillion
     *Trillion* indicates different numbers in different numeration
     systems. In the short-scale system (used in the English-speaking
     countries), it indicates 10 :sup:`12`, or 1,000,000,000,000. In
     the long-scale system (used in Spanish-speaking countries), it
     indicates 10 :sup:`18`, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

     To avoid confusion when you're citing a large number such as a
     trillion, express the amount in numerals. If space constraints
     prevent writing numerals, use *trillion* as defined in the
     short-scale system.
