Deploy a MongoDB Replica Set to CentOS VMs on Windows Azure
===========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In this tutorial, you will learn to deploy a MongoDB replica set to
CentOS VMs on Windows Azure and access it from outside Azure. The
following are the tasks to achieve this:

   #. Sign up for the feature on the Azure portal
   #. Set up affinity group 
   #. Create and set up the virtual machines
   #. Install and run MongoDB 
   #. Configure the replica set

#. Signing up

   Sign up for ‘Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks’ preview feature
   from the new Azure portal* In the ‘Preview’ portal, go to
   Account->Preview Features.

   Sign up for the “Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks”

   .. TODO make this a subscript 

   .. note:: 

      “*” – The VM Role beta program from the old Azure portal (shown
      below) is not the same as the preview feature above
 
#. Set up affinity group

   The affinity group needs to be set up from the old portal.
   
   #. If in the new Azure Management preview portal, click ‘Preview’ at
      the top of the screen and then ‘Take me to the previous portal’
      to switch to the old portal

   #. Once in the old portal, click ‘Hosted Services, Storage Accounts
      & CDN’

   #. Select ‘Affinity Groups’ and then ‘New Affinity Group’

   #. In the “Create a New Affinity Group” dialog, enter an affinity
      group name such as “mongoaffinitygroup” and choose a location

      * Choose one of the newer Azure data centers such as “West US”,
        “East US” or “West Europe”

#. Create and set up the virtual machines

   To create a 3-node MongoDB replica set you will be creating 3 VM
   instances. For this step, log in to the new preview portal, or from
   the old portal, click `Visit the Previous Portal` at the bottom of
   the page

Create instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instance 1
++++++++++

   #. In the portal, click New->Virtual Machine->From Gallery

   #. On the VM OS Selection page, choose ‘OpenLogic CentOS 6.2’ and
      click the next arrow to continue

   #. On the VM Configuration page, specify values for the parameters

      * Virtual Machine Name  -  ``mongodbrs1``
      * New User Name – ``mongouser``. This user will be added to the
        ``sudoers`` list file
      * New Password box – type a strong password that confirms to the
        Azure specifications
      * Retype the password to confirm
      * Size – Choose appropriate size from drop down list. For
        anything but small test instances, choose a size larger than
        Medium
      * Leave ``Upload SSH key for Authentication`` unchecked

      Click the next arrow to continue

   #. On the VM Mode page, specify values for the required parameters

      * Select ‘Standalone Virtual Machine’
      * DNS – a valid DNS prefix e.g. "mongodbrs"
      * Storage Account box – choose ‘Use Automatically Generated Storage Account’
      * In the ‘Region/Affinity Group/Virtual Network’ box, select the
        affinity group created previously “mongoaffinitygroup”

      Click next arrow to continue

   #. On the VM Options page select ``None for Availability Set``

   #. Click the check mark to create the VM instance

Instance 2
++++++++++

A similar process to creating instance 1.

   #. In the portal, click New->Virtual Machine->From Gallery
   #. On the VM OS Selection page, choose ‘OpenLogic CentOS 6.2’ and then the next arrow to continue
   #. On the VM Configuration page, specify values for the parameters

      * Virtual Machine Name – "mongodbrs2"
      * New User Name – "mongouser". This user will be added to the Sudoers list file. For ease of use specify the same user name as for instance 1
      * New Password box  – type a strong password that confirms to the Azure specifications
      * Retype the password to confirm
      * Size – Choose the same instance size as instance 1
      * Leave ‘Upload SSH key for Authentication’ unchecked

      Click the next arrow to continue

   #. On the VM Mode page, specify values for the required parameters

      * Select ‘Connect to Existing Virtual Machine’
      * In the dropdown choose instance 1 ‘mongodbrs1’
      * Storage Account box – choose ‘Use Automatically Generated Storage Account’
      * The ‘Region/Affinity Group/Virtual Network’ box should be automatically set to “mongoaffinitygroup”

      Click the next arrow to continue

   #. On the VM Options page select ‘None for Availability Set’

   #. Click the check mark to create the VM instance

Instance 3
++++++++++

A similar process for creating instance 2. Choose ‘mongodbrs3’ to be the Virtual Machine Name in step 3.

Configure endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the virtual machines are connected you need to configure the endpoints to:
* Allow remote connection
* Allow mongo traffic

Instance 1
++++++++++

#. In the management portal, click virtual machines and click the name of instance 1, ‘mongodbrs1’
#. Now click on endpoints
#. The ssh endpoint should be automatically created. For this endpoint ensure the following are set

   * Protocol – tcp
   * Public Port – 22
   * Private Port – 22
   * Load Balanced – No
#. Create a new endpoint for MongoDB by clicking on ‘Add Endpoint’ at the bottom of the screen
#. Ensure ‘Add endpoint’ is selected and click the right arrow to go to the next screen

#. Specify the endpoint details as below:

   * Name : MongoDB-Port
   * Protocol : TCP
   * Public Port : 27018
   * Private Port : 27018

   Click on check mark to create endpoint

The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

Instance 2
++++++++++

We need to configure the endpoints for instance 2 similar to instance 1:

#. In the management portal, click ‘virtual machines’ and click the name of instance 2
#. Now click on ‘endpoints’
#. The ssh endpoint should be automatically created. Ensure that:

   * Name – SSH
   * Protocol – TCP
   * Private Port – 22
   * Load Balanced – No

#. Now click on Edit Endpoint at the bottom of the screen and set ‘Public Port’ to 23. Click on the ‘check mark’ to update
#. Create a new endpoint for MongoDB by clicking on ‘Add Endpoint’ at the bottom of the screen
#. Ensure ‘Add Endpoint’ is selected and click the right arrow to go to the next screen
#. Specify the endpoint details as below:

   * Name: MongoDB-Port
   * Protocol: TCP
   * Public Port: 27019
   * Private Port: 27019

   Click on check mark to create endpoint

The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

Instance 3
++++++++++

Create endpoints for instance 3 similar to instance 2 with the following changes:

#. In step 4, set public port to 24
#. In step 7, set public and private ports to be 27020

The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

Update OS
+++++++++

Use this optional step to update the operating system on each of your
VM instances. Once the machine endpoints have been configured above,
you need to log into the machines to update them. More information on
this can be found at ‘How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running
Linux’ Use the username and password you used when creating the
virtual machine instances.  Once you are connected to the machine,
update the operating system by running: sudo yum update and following
the prompts. This could take some time.

.. note::

   When connecting to instances 2 and 3, remember to use ports 23 and
   24 and not the default ssh port of 22.

Set up disks
++++++++++++

Once the instances are updated, you can then attach a data disk to
each of the instances. The data disks will be storing the actual
mongodb data as part of –dbpath. More information on Azure data disks
can be found at Data Disk Concepts.  To set up the data disk follow
the steps outlined below for each of the instances you created:

   #. Attach an empty disk to the instance as described in How to: Attach
      an empty disk
      #. Create a data disk of at least 10 GB
   #. Now initialize the data disk by following the steps described at
      How to: Initialize a new data disk in Linux Ensure you use ext4 for
      the file system and not ext3
   #. Also once mounted, create a mongodb data directory by:
      #. Log on onto the instance
      #. Then run sudo chown `id -u` /mnt/datadrive/ to make the
         mongouser the owner of the data directory
      #. Run the following command: mkdir -p /mnt/datadrive/data

#. Install and run MongoDB

As part of this step, you will be using the official 10gen supplied
packages to install, configure and run MongoDB as a service using
YUM. You want to install as a service since this would ensure that
mongod is started on machine restart also. More information can be
found at Install MongoDB on RedHat Enterprise, CentOS, or Fedora Linux
doc page.

Install MongoDB
+++++++++++++++

Repeat the following steps on each instance.
   #. Log onto the instance
   #. Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo file to hold information about your repository using your favorite editor as sudo. Place the following configuration in /etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo file:

   .. code-block:: shell

      [10gen]
      name=10gen Repository
      baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64
      gpgcheck=0
      enabled=1

   #. After saving the new .repo file, issue the following command to update the local package database: sudo yum update
   #. Issue the following command (as root or with sudo) to install the latest stable version of MongoDB and the associated tools:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo yum install mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

   #. When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB.

Configure MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The packages installed in the previous step configure MongoDB using
the /etc/mongod.conf file in conjunction with the control script. You
can find the init script at /etc/rc.d/init.d/mongod. As part of this
step you will edit the mongod.conf file to set the appropriate
parameters. If the parameters are commented, make sure to uncomment
them.

Instance 1
++++++++++

   #. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY
   #. As sudo, edit /etc/mongod.conf to set the following parameters:

      .. code-block::

         port = 27018
	 dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
	 logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
	 replSet = mongors

   #. Save the config file

Instance 2
++++++++++

   #. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY
   #. As sudo, edit /etc/mongod.conf to set the following parameter:

      .. code-block::

         port = 27019
	 dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
	 logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
	 replSet = mongors

   #. Save the config file

Instance 3
++++++++++

   #. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY
   #. As sudo, edit /etc/mongod.conf to set the following parameter:

      .. code-block::

         port = 27020
	 dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
	 logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
	 replSet = mongors

   #. Save the config file

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the configuration files have been edited, start the database process mongod on each instance by:
   #. Log on onto the instance
   #. Run the following command to start the process:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongod –config /etc/mongod.conf

   #. This should start the mongod process
   #. Verify that mongod start by tailing the log file using the
      command

      .. code-block:: shell

         tail –f /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log

   #. The ``waiting for connections`` message in the log file indicates
      mongod is up and running and waiting for client
      connections. This may take a while as mongod preallocates its
      journal files

Configure the replica set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point in time, you should have mongod running on all 3 of your
instances. You can now configure the 3 instances as a replica set by
connecting to 1 of the 3 instances from within Azure or from outside.
Connect to the running mongod process using the mongo shell:

   #. If connected to the VM instance type the following command where
      port is 27018 for instance 1, 27019 for instance 2 and 27020 for
      instance 3:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongo –port <port number>

   #. If connecting to the mongod process in Azure from your local
      machine use the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell 

         mongo –host mongodbrs.cloudapp.net –port <port number>

   #. In the mongo shell type the following:

      .. code-block:: shell

         > conf = {
  	      _id = “mongors”,
	      members : [
	         {id:0, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27018},
	       	 {id:0, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27019},
	       	 {id:0, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27020}]}
	 > rs.initiate(conf)

   #. This will start the initialization of the mongodb replica set
   #. Type the command ``rs.status()`` to check the status of the
      replica set. Upon successful initialization, you should see 1 of
      the 3 instances being the `Primary` of the set and the other 2
      being the `Secondaries`

   #. You have now successfully initiated the replica set

Summary
~~~~~~~

In this tutorial you have learned how to create a set of CentOS
virtual machines on Windows Azure, deploy MongoDB to them and create a
replica set out of them. You can access this set from anywhere using
the connection string ``mongodb://mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27018,
mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27019,
mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27020/?replicaSet=mongors``.

More information on MongoDB can be found at
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/.

To create and deploy a replica set to Windows Virtual Machines on
Azure you can use the MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure.
