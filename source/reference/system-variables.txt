Overview
--------

|bi-short| provides the following environment variables:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 40 40
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - System Variable
     - Data Type
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - ``full_pushdown_exec_mode``
     - boolean
     - Specifies whether a query error is returned for queries with
       clauses that aren't fully translated to the MongoDB query language.
       SQL query predicates are used to filter data returned by the query.
     - ``0 (false)``
   * - ``log_level``
     - integer
     - Specifies the logging level for |bi-short|:

       - ``-1``: Do not log.
       - ``0``: Log only messages for database users, such as basic
         ``mongosqld`` events and state changes.
       - ``1``: Log messages for database users and ``mongosqld`` administrators.
       - ``2``: For internal use only.
     - ``2 (Atlas-hosted) and 0 (self-managed)``
   * - ``max_nested_table_depth``
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum number of unique nested field paths that
       ``mongosqld`` maps to a relational table for a collection.
     - ``50``
   * - ``max_num_global_tables``
     - integer
     - The maximum number of tables allowed in a MongoDB deployment with an automatically-
       generated schema.
     - ``4000``
   * - ``max_num_tables_per_collection``
     - integer
     - The maximum number of tables allowed in a collection in a table with an
       automatically-generated schema.
     - ``200``
   * - ``max_nested_table_depth``
     - integer
     - The default limit for table's nesting depth of arrays
       that MongoDB translates to tables, in a collection with an 
       automatically-generated schema.
     - ``10``
   * - ``max_num_fields_per_collection``
     - integer
     - The maximum number of fields examined per collection in a table with an
       automatically-generated schema.
     - ``2000``
   * - ``mongodb_max_varchar_length``
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum string length returned for columns using
       the ``VARCHAR`` data type. A value of ``0`` specifies
       no limit.
     - ``0``
   * - ``polymorphic_type_conversion_mode``
     - string
     - Determines how |bi-short| evaluates document fields that are
       specified with multiple data types. For example, ``count``
       could be a number in one document and a string in another.
       The data type that |bi-short| selects depends on the value
       of the ``schema_mapping_mode`` system variable. A value of
       ``majority`` causes |bi-short| to select the type
       that appears in the majority of document fields, while a value
       of ``lattice`` would cause |bi-short| to select string as the
       data type for ``count``. See :doc:`Cached Sampling </schema/cached-sampling>`
       for more information.

       Set ``polymorphic_type_conversion_mode`` to one of the following
       values:

       - ``off``:
         Queries may fail if you do not explicitly cast
         document fields that are specified with multiple data types.
       - ``fast``:
         |bi-short| converts only document fields that
         appeared as multiple data types during sampling.
       - ``safe``:
         |bi-short| converts all document fields to the data type
         discovered during sampling, even if the fields do not appear
         as multiple data types.
     -  ``off``
   * - ``reconcile_arithmetic_agg_functions``
     - boolean
     - Allows you to choose the behavior where MongoDB does not
       automatically convert types for some queries using arithmetic
       aggregate functions. In MongoDB version 3.6 and earlier, this
       behavior results in improved performance, compared with implicit
       type conversions for arithmetic aggregation functions in subsequent
       versions.

       See :doc:`Type Conversion Modes </reference/type-conversion>` for
       more information.
     - ``true``
   * - ``sample_refresh_interval_secs``
     - integer
     - Specifies how frequently, in seconds, that the |bi-short| schema
       is updated. A value of ``0`` specifies that the schema is not 
       refreshed after |bi-short| starts.

       See :doc:`Cached Sampling </schema/cached-sampling>` for more
       information.
     - ``0``
   * - ``sample_size``
     - integer
     - Specifies how many documents |bi-short| samples when generating
       its schema. A value of ``0`` specifies that |bi-short| performs
       a collection scan across all sample :option:`namespaces <mongosqld --sampleNamespaces>`.

       See :doc:`Cached Sampling </schema/cached-sampling>` for more
       information.
     - ``100``
   * - ``schema_mapping_mode``
     - string
     - Specifies how the MongoDB schema is transformed into a relational
       schema:

       - ``lattice``: See :doc:`Sampling Type Conflicts </schema/type-conflicts>`
         for more information. 
       - ``majority``: |bi-short| assigns the most common data type for
         a field occuring in a sample.

     - ``lattice``
   * - ``type_conversion_mode``
     - string
     - Specifies the semantics that |bi-short| uses for type conversions,
       such as the ``CAST`` function.

       - ``mysql``
       - ``mongosql``
     - ``mongosql``

Setting System Variables
------------------------

You must have the :atlas:`atlasAdmin </security-add-mongodb-users/#database-user-privileges>` database role to set environment
variables on an Atlas-hosted |bi-short|. To set them for a self-managed
|bi-short|, you must have the :authaction:`inprog` privilege on the
MongoDB database to which you've connected the |bi-short|.

Use any SQL client that is connected to |bi-short| to set these
variables. The following example sets ``mongodb_max_varchar_length``
to ``100``:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   SET GLOBAL mongodb_max_varchar_length = 100

You must start a new connection to the |bi-short| after setting a system
variable. The connection you used to set the system variable is not affected.
