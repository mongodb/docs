Deploy Replica Set and Configure Authentication and Authorization
=================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With :doc:`authentication </core/authentication>` enabled, MongoDB
forces all clients to identify themselves before granting access to
the server. :doc:`Authorization </core/authorization>`, in turn,
allows administrators to define and limit the resources and operations
that a user can access. Using authentication and authorization is a
key part of a complete security strategy.

All MongoDB deployments support authentication. By default, MongoDB
runs without authentication enabled. You can enable when deploying
MongoDB, or enable authentication after deploying; however, you cannot
enable authentication on a running deployment without downtime.

This tutorial provides a procedure for creating a MongoDB :doc:`replica
set </core/replication-introduction>` that uses the challenge-response
authentication mechanism. The tutorial includes creation of a minimal
authorization system to support basic operations.

Considerations
--------------

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication requires an authentication mechanism, which defaults to
``MONGODB-CR``. To support :ref:`inter-process authentication
<inter-process-auth-key-file>` with ``MONGODB-CR`` MongoDB uses a
:setting:`keyFile` to authenticate communication between members of a
deployment. The content of the key file is the shared secret used for
all internal authentication.

To ensure that you can continue to use the deployment and have access
to create users, you should have a user administrator. Create this
user before enabling authorization checking. During this procedure you
will create a user administrator that you will use to administer this
deployment.

Procedure
---------

This procedure deploys a replica set in which all members use the same key
file.
