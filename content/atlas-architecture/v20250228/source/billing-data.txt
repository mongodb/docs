Tracking and managing cloud spending can be difficult in a large
organization. While :ref:`cost-saving configurations
<arch-center-cost-saving-config>` help you proactively manage spending, 
{+service+}
also provides tools for you to view and analyze
spending. You can:

- Categorize {+service+} resources based on your organization's billing needs.
- Leverage billing data to visualize and understand your {+service+} spending.
- Pull billing data programmatically to integrate with your FinOps
  tools for charge-back and accounting purposes within each department
  and application.

On this page, learn how to use built-in {+service+} tools and
{+service+} billing data to track your cloud spending.

Apply Resource Tags
-------------------

You can apply resource tags in |service| for precise cost allocation by
categorizing resources according to departments, projects, or cost
centers. You can also group and analyze tagged resources in financial
reports, providing a clear and organized view of how various teams or
projects contribute to overall cloud spending. To learn more, see
:ref:`configure-resource-tags`.

Access Billing Data Programmatically
------------------------------------

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides a |rest|\ful interface that allows you
to programmatically access your billing data for use with external tools
and reports. Combine this feature with :ref:`resource tags
<configure-resource-tags>` to easily categorize your {+service+}
spending.

You can retrieve all your pending invoices with the
:oas-atlas-op:`Return All Pending Invoices for One Organization
</listPendingInvoices>` |api| endpoint. The endpoints response body
contains the ``results.lineItems.tags`` field, which reflect the tags
you applied to your resources (such as organizations and {+clusters+}).
You can then feed this line-item-level billing data into external FinOps
tools and reports track your {+service+} spending by environment, team,
or other tag values. 

Enable Cross-Organization Billing
---------------------------------

|service| allows you to share a billing subscription across many
organizations and to pay a single invoice for them. Enable
cross-organization billing for easy visibility into {+service+} spending
for all of your organizations. 

After you configure a paying organization, you pay invoices for the paying
organization that include a list of charges incurred for all linked
organizations. To learn more, see :ref:`cross-org-billing`.

After you enable cross-organization billing, you can view linked
invoices if you have the :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` role or
the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the paying organization.

Review Your Monthly Cost Visualization
--------------------------------------

To view your billing data monthly, navigate to the :guilabel:`Cost
Explorer` page. The Cost Explorer provides a granular view of cloud
spending in chart and table form, allowing users to analyze costs by
{+clusters+}, projects, or teams. Historical spending data and
customizable filters help identify trends and inefficiencies, enabling
better financial decision-making and resource optimization. You can view
your usage over the past six months, and access your billing data up to
the past 18 months. If your organization uses cross-organizational
billing, you can view billing data across all linked organizations.

The Billing Cost Explorer filters and groups usage data by organization,
project, {+cluster+}, and service. Each filter contains a :guilabel:`Usage`
chart with stacked columns representing the total cost incurred each
month. Underneath, there is a :guilabel:`Usage By Month` table that
displays the billing data shown in the chart. To learn more, see
:ref:`cost-explorer`.

Review Your Annual Cost Visualization
-------------------------------------

To view your billing data annually, navigate to the :guilabel:`Billing
Overview` page. This page helps you to understand the costs incurred by
your organization's {+service+} usage by service, deployment, and
project. Each category contains a :guilabel:`Usage` chart with stacked
columns representing the total cost incurred each month. To learm more,
see :ref:`Year-to-Date Usage Chart <billing-visualizations>`.

Review Your Invoice Cost Visualization
--------------------------------------

To view your billing data as an invoice, click on the
:guilabel:`Invoice Date` or :guilabel:`Invoice Period` you want to
view. This page shows you the costs incurred by your {+service+} usage
over the invoice period through the :guilabel:`Total Usage` and
:guilabel:`By Deployment` charts.

For the  :guilabel:`Total Usage` chart, you can filter your usage by
service to view charges incurred by a particular {+service+} service.
For the :guilabel:`By Deployment` chart, you can view the proportion of
your usage incurred by each of your {+clusters+} and serverless instances
across all your projects.

To view line-item charges, see :ref:`view-past-invoices`.

Create Billing Dashboards
-------------------------

You can visualize your billing data in a |charts| billing dashboard
to help you optimize your |service| spending. Billing dashboards contain
prebuilt charts that help you monitor your {+service+} usage in an
organization across different categories and periods of time, and
|charts| integrates with {+service+} to seamlessly ingest billing data.

By default, billing dashboards include the following metrics and charts:

- Total spending across the organization
- Biggest spenders in the organization
- Total spending by instance size, project, cluster, product category, or SKU
- Total cost by product category

You can also customize your billing dashboard by applying :ref:`dashboard
filters <billing-dashboard-filter>` and adding new charts, including any
charts that use :ref:`tags <configure-resource-tags>` that you've
applied to your billing data. 

To create or manage a billing dashboard, see :ref:`billing-dashboards`.
