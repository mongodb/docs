.. method:: rs.reconfig(configuration[, force])

   :param configuration: A :term:`document` that specifies
                         the configuration of a replica set.

   :param force: Optional. Specify ``{ force: true }`` as the force
                 parameter to force the replica set to accept the new
                 configuration even if a majority of the members are
                 not accessible. Use with caution, as this can lead to
                 :term:`rollback` situations.

   Initializes a new :term:`replica set` configuration. This function
   will disconnect the shell briefly and forces a reconnection as the
   replica set renegotiates which node will be
   :term:`primary`. As a result, the shell will display an error even
   if this command succeeds.

   :method:`rs.reconfig()` provides a wrapper around the
   ":dbcommand:`replSetReconfig`" :term:`database command`.

   :method:`rs.reconfig()` overwrites the existing replica set
   configuration. Retrieve the current configuration object with
   :method:`rs.conf()`, modify the configuration as needed and then
   use :method:`rs.reconfig()` to submit the modified configuration
   object.

   To reconfigure a replica set, use the following sequence of
   operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf = rs.conf()

      // modify conf to change configuration

      rs.reconfig(conf)

   If you want to force the reconfiguration if a majority of the set
   isn't connected to the current member, or you're issuing the
   command against a secondary, use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf = rs.conf()

      // modify conf to change configuration

      rs.reconfig(conf, { force: true } )

   .. warning::

      Forcing a :method:`rs.reconfig()` can lead to :term:`rollback`
      situations and other difficult to recover from
      situations. Exercise caution when using this option.
