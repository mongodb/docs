Overview
--------

MongoDB Enterprise Edition includes authentication mechanisms that aren't
available in MongoDB Community Edition. In this guide, you can learn how to
authenticate to MongoDB by using these authentication mechanisms. To learn about
the other authentication mechanisms available in MongoDB, see the
:ref:`Authentication Mechanisms <java-rs-auth>` guide.

Specify an Authentication Mechanism
-----------------------------------

You can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting
to MongoDB by using either of the following:

- Connection string
- ``MongoCredential`` factory method

A **connection string** (also known as a **connection URI**) specifies how to
connect and authenticate to your MongoDB cluster.

To authenticate by using a connection string, include your settings in your
connection string, then pass it to the ``MongoClients.create()`` method to
instantiate your ``MongoClient``. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String`
tab in the following sections to see the syntax for authenticating by using a connection string.

You can also use the ``MongoCredential`` class to specify your
authentication details. The ``MongoCredential`` class contains static factory
methods that construct instances containing your authentication mechanism and
credentials. When you use the ``MongoCredential`` helper class,
use the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class to configure your
connection settings.  Select the
:guilabel:`MongoCredential` tab in the following sections to see the syntax for
authenticating using a ``MongoCredential``.

Mechanisms
----------

.. _java-rs-gssapi-auth-mechanism:

Kerberos (GSSAPI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) authentication mechanism
allows you to authenticate to a Kerberos service by using your
principal name.

The following sections contain code examples that use the following placeholders:

- ``username``: your URL-encoded principal name, such as ``"username%40REALM.ME"``
- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tabs to
see the corresponding syntax.

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      The following example authenticates to GSSAPI by using a connection string:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gssapi-connection-string
         :end-before: // end-gssapi-connection-string
         :language: java

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the GSSAPI authentication mechanism by using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, call the ``createGSSAPICredential()``
      method, as shown in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gssapi-mongocredential
         :end-before: // end-gssapi-mongocredential
         :language: java

To acquire a
`Kerberos ticket <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.security.jgss/javax/security/auth/kerberos/KerberosTicket.html>`__,
the GSSAPI Java libraries require you to specify the realm and Key Distribution
Center (KDC) system properties. You can set these settings as shown in the
following example:

.. code-block:: none

   java.security.krb5.realm=MYREALM.ME
   java.security.krb5.kdc=mykdc.myrealm.me

You might need to specify one or more of the following additional
``MongoCredential`` mechanism properties, depending on your Kerberos setup:

- ``SERVICE_NAME``
- ``CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME``
- ``JAVA_SUBJECT``
- ``JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES``
- ``JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER``

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      .. important::

         You can specify the following GSSAPI properties only through the
         ``MongoCredential`` class:

         - ``JAVA_SUBJECT``
         - ``JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES``
         - ``JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER``

         Select the :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tab to learn how to specify these properties.

      To specify the GSSAPI additional properties, include the property in the
      connection string as a URL parameter in the format:
      ``<PROPERTY_NAME>:<value>``.

      The following example authenticates to GSSAPI and specifies additional properties:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gssapi-connection-string-properties
         :end-before: // end-gssapi-connection-string-properties
         :language: java

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the GSSAPI additional properties, call the
      ``withMechanismProperty()`` method on your ``MongoCredential``
      instance, and pass the property name and value as parameters. Use the
      property name constants defined in the ``MongoCredential`` class:

      - `SERVICE_NAME_KEY <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#SERVICE_NAME_KEY>`__
      - `CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME_KEY <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME_KEY>`__
      - `JAVA_SUBJECT_KEY <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#JAVA_SUBJECT_KEY>`__
      - `JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_KEY <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_KEY>`__
      - `JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER_KEY <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER_KEY>`__

      Select the :guilabel:`SERVICE_NAME_KEY` or :guilabel:`JAVA_SUBJECT_KEY` tab to
      see how to specify the corresponding property:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab::
            :tabid: SERVICE_NAME_KEY

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
               :start-after: // start-gssapi-service-key
               :end-before: // end-gssapi-service-key
               :language: java

         .. tab::
            :tabid: JAVA_SUBJECT_KEY

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
               :start-after: // start-gssapi-subject-key
               :end-before: // end-gssapi-subject-key
               :language: java

By default, the {+driver-short+} caches Kerberos tickets by ``MongoClient`` instance.
If your deployment frequently creates and destroys ``MongoClient`` instances,
you can change the default Kerberos ticket caching behavior to cache by process
to improve performance.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To cache Kerberos tickets by process, you must use the ``MongoCredential`` authentication
      mechanism, because the connection string authentication mechanism does not support the ``JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER``
      mechanism property. Select the :guilabel:`MongoCredential`
      tab to learn how to cache Kerberos tickets by process.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To cache Kerberos tickets by process, specify the ``JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER``
      mechanism property and provide a
      `KerberosSubjectProvider <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/KerberosSubjectProvider.html#%3Cinit%3E()>`__
      in your ``MongoCredential`` instance, as shown in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gssapi-ticket-cache
         :end-before: // end-gssapi-ticket-cache
         :language: java

.. note::

   On Windows, Oracle's JRE uses `LSA <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/lsa-authentication>`__
   rather than `SSPI <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/sspi>`__
   in its implementation of GSSAPI, which limits interoperability with
   Windows Active Directory and implementations of single sign-on. See the
   following resources for more information:

   - `JDK-8054026 <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8054026>`__
   - `JDK-6722928 <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6722928>`__
   - `SO 23427343 <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23427343/cannot-retrieve-tgt-despite-allowtgtsessionkey-registry-entry>`__

.. _java-rs-plain-auth-mechanism:

LDAP (PLAIN)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
server by using your directory server username and password.

.. tip::

   The authentication mechanism is named ``PLAIN`` instead of ``LDAP`` since it
   authenticates using the `PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   (SASL) defined in RFC-4616 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4616>`_.

The following sections contain code examples that use the following placeholders:

- ``ldap_username``: your LDAP username
- ``ldap_password``: your LDAP user's password
- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tabs to
see the corresponding syntax.

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-ldap-connection-string
         :end-before: // end-ldap-connection-string
         :language: java

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the LDAP (PLAIN) authentication mechanism by using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, call the ``createPlainCredential()``
      method, as shown in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-ldap-mongocredential
         :end-before: // end-ldap-mongocredential
         :language: java

.. _java-rs-mongodb-oidc:

MONGODB-OIDC
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   The MONGODB-OIDC authentication mechanism requires {+mdb-server+} v7.0 or later running
   on a Linux platform.

The following sections describe how to use the MONGODB-OIDC authentication mechanism to
authenticate to various platforms.

For more information about the MONGODB-OIDC authentication mechanism, see
:manual:`OpenID Connect Authentication </core/security-oidc/>` and
:manual:`MongoDB Server Parameters </reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.oidcIdentityProviders>`
in the MongoDB Server manual.

.. _java-rs-mongodb-oidc-azure-imds:

Azure IMDS
++++++++++

If your application runs on an Azure VM, or otherwise uses the
`Azure Instance Metadata Service <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/instance-metadata-service>`__
(IMDS), you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in Azure
support.

You can specify Azure IMDS OIDC authentication either by 
using a ``MongoCredential`` or as part of the connection string.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tabs to
see the corresponding syntax.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongodb-azure-imds-connection-string
    
      Replace the ``<username>`` placeholder with the client ID or application ID of the
      Azure managed identity or enterprise application. Replace the ``<percent-encoded audience>`` 
      placeholder in the following code with the percent-encoded value of the audience server
      parameter configured on your MongoDB deployment.

      The comma (``,``) character and its encoding (``%2C``) are
      reserved, and using these characters in a value causes the
      driver to interpret commas as delimiters of key-value pairs.
      You must specify values that contain commas in a ``MongoCredential`` instance, as
      demonstrated in the :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tab.
     
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-azure-oidc-connection-string
         :end-before: // end-azure-oidc-connection-string
         :language: java

   .. tab:: MongoCredential
      :tabid: mongodb-azure-mongo-credential

      Replace the ``<username>`` placeholder with the client ID or application ID of the
      Azure managed identity or enterprise application. Replace the ``<audience>``
      placeholder with the value of the
      ``audience`` server parameter configured on your MongoDB deployment.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-azure-oidc-mongocredential
         :end-before: // end-azure-oidc-mongocredential
         :language: java

.. _java-rs-mongodb-oidc-gcp-imds:

GCP IMDS
++++++++

If your application runs on a Google Compute Engine VM, or otherwise uses the
`GCP Instance Metadata Service <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata>`__,
you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in GCP
support.

You can specify GCP IMDS OIDC authentication either by 
using a ``MongoCredential`` or as part of the connection string.

The following sections contain code examples that use the following
placeholders:

- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tabs to
see the corresponding syntax.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongodb-gcp-imds-connection-string
    
      Replace the ``<percent-encoded audience>`` placeholder in the
      following code with the percent-encoded value of the audience server
      parameter configured on your MongoDB deployment.

      The comma (``,``) character and its encoding (``%2C``) are
      reserved, and using these characters in a value causes the
      driver to interpret commas as delimiters of key-value pairs.
      You must specify values that contain commas in a ``MongoCredential`` instance, as
      demonstrated in the :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tab.
     
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gcp-oidc-connection-string
         :end-before: // end-gcp-oidc-connection-string
         :language: java

   .. tab:: MongoCredential
      :tabid: mongodb-gcp-mongo-credential

      Replace the ``<audience>`` placeholder with the value of the
      ``audience`` server parameter configured on your MongoDB deployment.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
         :start-after: // start-gcp-oidc-mongocredential
         :end-before: // end-gcp-oidc-mongocredential
         :language: java

.. _java-rs-auth-kubernetes:

Kubernetes
++++++++++

If your application runs on a Kubernetes cluster, you can authenticate
to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in Kubernetes support.

Select from the :guilabel:`Connection String` or
:guilabel:`MongoCredential` tabs to see the corresponding syntax.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongodb-kubernetes-connection-string

      To specify Kubernetes OIDC as the authentication mechanism, set the following 
      options in your connection string:

      - ``authMechanism``: Set to ``MONGODB-OIDC``.
      - ``authMechanismProperties``: Set to ``ENVIRONMENT:k8s``. 

      .. code-block:: java
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(
            "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/" +
            "?authMechanism=MONGODB-OIDC" +
            "&authMechanismProperties=ENVIRONMENT:k8s");

   .. tab:: MongoCredential
      :tabid: mongodb-kubernetes-mongo-credential

      Replace the ``hostname`` and ``port`` with the network address and port 
      number of your MongoDB deployment.

      .. code-block:: java
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createOidcCredential(null)
            .withMechanismProperty("ENVIRONMENT", "k8s");

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(
            MongoClientSettings.builder()
               .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->
                      builder.hosts(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress("<hostname>", <port>))))
               .credential(credential)
               .build());

Custom Callback
+++++++++++++++

The {+driver-short+} doesn't offer built-in support for all platforms, including
Azure Functions and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Instead, you
must define a custom callback to use OIDC to authenticate from these platforms.
To do so, use the ``"OIDC_CALLBACK"`` authentication property, as shown in the following
code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
   :start-after: // start-oidc-callback-create
   :end-before: // end-oidc-callback-create
   :language: java

The value of the ``"OIDC_CALLBACK"`` property must be a lambda or other implementation
of the ``OidcCallback`` functional interface that accepts an ``OidcCallbackContext``
as a parameter and returns an ``OidcCallbackResult``.

The following example uses an example callback to retrieve an OIDC token from a file
named ``"access-token.dat"`` in the local file system:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.java
   :start-after: // start-oidc-callback
   :end-before: // end-oidc-callback
   :language: java
