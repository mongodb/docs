The ``mongosync`` binary is the primary process used in
{+c2c-product-name+}. ``mongosync`` migrates data from one cluster to
another and can keep the clusters in continuous sync. 

For an overview of the ``mongosync`` process, see :ref:`about-mongosync`.

To get started with ``mongosync``, refer to the :ref:`Quick Start Guide
<c2c-quickstart>`. 

For more detailed information, refer to the
:ref:`c2c-install` or :ref:`c2c-connecting` page that best fits your
situation. 

.. _c2c-verifier-disclaimer:

Embedded Verifier Disclaimer
----------------------------

Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` includes an embedded verifier to
perform a series of verification checks on all supported
collections on the destination cluster to confirm that
it was successful in transferring documents from the
source cluster to the destination.

When you start the ``mongosync`` process, it provides the following disclaimer: 

.. code-block:: none

   Embedded verification is enabled by default. Verification checks for data 
   consistency between the source and destination clusters. Verification will 
   cause mongosync to fail if any inconsistencies are detected, but it does not 
   check for all possible data inconsistencies. Please see the documentation at 
   https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/verification/embedded 
   for more details. Verification requires approximately 0.5 GB of memory per 1 
   million documents on the source cluster and will fail if insufficient memory 
   is available. Accepting this disclaimer indicates that you understand the 
   limitations and memory requirements for this tool. To skip this disclaimer 
   prompt, use –-acceptDisclaimer.

   To disable the embedded verifier, specify 'verification: false' when starting 
   mongosync. Please see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/verification/ 
   for alternative verification methods.

   Do you want to continue? (y/n):

If you have already read and accepted the disclaimer, you can 
start ``mongosync`` with the :option:`--acceptDisclaimer` option 
to skip this notification.

Settings
--------

Cluster Independence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` syncs collection data between a source cluster and
destination cluster. ``mongosync`` does not synchronize :ref:`users
<users>` or :ref:`roles <built-in-roles>`. As a result, you can create
users with different access permissions on each cluster.

.. _c2c-mongosync-config:

Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options for ``mongosync`` can be set in a YAML configuration file. Use
the :option:`--config` option. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mongosync --config /etc/mongosync.conf

For information on available settings, see :ref:`Configuration <c2c-config>`.

Cluster and Collection Types
----------------------------

.. _c2c-sharded-cluster-behavior:

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+c2c-product-name+} supports replication between sharded clusters.
``mongosync`` replicates individual shards in parallel from the source
cluster to the destination cluster. However ``mongosync`` does not
preserve the source cluster's sharding configuration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongosync-balancer.rst

Pre-Split Chunks
''''''''''''''''

When ``mongosync`` syncs to a sharded destination cluster, it pre-splits chunks 
for sharded collections on the destination cluster. For each sharded collection, 
``mongosync`` creates twice as many chunks as there are shards in the 
destination cluster. 

Chunk Distribution
''''''''''''''''''

.. important::
   
   Even if the source cluster is balanced, ``mongosync`` doesn't
   ensure balance of the destination cluster. Because ``mongosync``
   doesn't support the execution of sharding operations during
   migration, you must wait until it is safe to accept writes 
   to rebalance the destination cluster. See :ref:`sharding-balancing`
   for guidance on how to rebalance the cluster and 
   :ref:`sharded cluster limitations <c2c-sharded-limitations>`
   for information on sharded cluster limitations in ``mongosync``.

``mongosync`` does not preserve chunk distribution from the source to
the destination, even with multiple ``mongosync`` instances. It is not
possible to reproduce a particular pre-split of chunks from a source
cluster on the destination cluster. 

The only sharding configuration that ``mongosync`` preserves from the
source cluster to the destination cluster is the sharding key. Once the
migration finishes, you can enable the destination cluster's balancer which
distributes documents independently of the source cluster's distribution. 

Primary Shards
''''''''''''''

When you sync to a sharded destination cluster, ``mongosync`` assigns a
primary shard to each database by means of a round-robin. 

.. warning::

   Running :dbcommand:`movePrimary` on the source or desintation cluster
   during migration may result in a fatal error or require you to
   restart the migration from the start. For more information, see
   :ref:`c2c-sharded-limitations`. 

Config Shard Cluster
''''''''''''''''''''

Starting in 8.0, MongoDB introduces support for config shard clusters, also known
as embedded config server clusters.

``mongosync`` supports sync from dedicated config server sharded clusters to 
embedded config server sharded clusters and vice versa. Additionally, ``mongosync`` 
supports sync from replica sets to config sharded clusters, but not vice versa.

To learn more about embedded config servers, see :ref:`config-shard-concept`.

Multiple Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sync a source cluster to multiple destination clusters, use one
``mongosync`` instance for each destination cluster. For more
information, see :ref:`Multiple Clusters Limitations
<multiple-clusters-limitations>`. 

.. _c2c-capped-collections:

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/collections/behavior-capped-collections.rst

.. _c2c-reads-and-writes: 

Reads and Writes
----------------

.. _c2c-write-blocking:

Write Blocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-write-blocking-enable.rst

You must enable write-blocking when you start ``mongosync`` if you want
to use :ref:`reverse synchronization <c2c-api-reverse>` later.

User Permissions
''''''''''''''''

.. include:: /includes/fact-write-blocking-requirement.rst

Permissible Reads
'''''''''''''''''

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-operations-source.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-operations-check.rst

Permissible Writes
''''''''''''''''''

.. include:: /includes/fact-write-blocking-check.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-write-blocking-when.rst

Read and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, ``mongosync`` sets the read concern level to
:readconcern:`"majority"` for reads on the source cluster. For writes on
the destination cluster, ``mongosync`` sets the write concern level to
:writeconcern:`"majority"` with :ref:`j: true <wc-j>`. 

For more information on read and write concern configuration and
behavior, see :ref:`read-concern` and :ref:`write-concern`. 

Read Preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` requires the :readmode:`primary` read preference when
connecting to the source and destination clusters. For more information,
see :ref:`connections-read-preference`. 

Legacy Index Handling 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` rewrites legacy index values, like ``0`` or an empty
string, to ``1`` on the destination. ``mongosync`` also removes any 
invalid index options on the destination.

.. _mongosync-considerations:

Considerations for Continuous Sync
----------------------------------

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-no-mongosync-disaster-recovery.rst

If the source cluster shuts down before ``mongosync`` can commit, such as in 
a disaster scenario, the destination cluster might not have a consistent 
snapshot of the source data. To learn more, see :ref:`c2c-behavior-consistency`.

.. note:: 
  
   After commit, you can't resume continuous sync between two clusters since 
   ``mongosync`` can only sync into empty destination clusters. If you need to 
   use the same two clusters after :ref:`cutover <c2c-cutover-process>`, you can 
   call the :ref:`c2c-api-reverse` endpoint to keep the clusters in sync.
   Otherwise, start a new continuous sync operation by using a new empty 
   destination cluster. 

.. _c2c-behavior-temporary-changes:

Temporary Changes to Collection Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` temporarily alters the following collection characteristics during 
synchronization. The original values are restored during the commit process.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Change
     - Description
  
   * - Unique Indexes
     - Unique indexes on the source cluster are synced as non-unique indexes 
       on the destination cluster.

   * - TTL Indexes
     - Synchronization sets ``expireAfterSeconds`` to the value of ``MAX_INT``
       on the destination cluster.

   * - Hidden Indexes
     - Synchronization replicates hidden indexes as non-hidden.

   * - Write Blocking
     - If you enable write-blocking, ``mongosync`` blocks writes: 

       - On the destination cluster during sync.
       - On the source cluster when ``commit`` is received.
      
       To learn more, see :ref:`c2c-write-blocking`.

   * - Capped Collections
     - Synchronization sets capped collections to the maximum allowable
       size. 

   * - Dummy Indexes 
     - In some cases, synchronization may create dummy indexes on the 
       destination to support writes on sharded or collated collections. 

Rolling Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/rolling-build-limitation.rst

``mongosync`` Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` stores its metadata in a database or multiple databases 
during migration. The metadata databases can be named any of the following: 

- ``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use``
- Anything beginning with ``mongosync_internal_``
- Anything beginning with ``mongosync_reserved_for_verification_``

You should drop any metadata databases after a successful migration. 

Destination Clusters
--------------------

.. _c2c-behavior-consistency:

Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` supports :term:`eventual consistency` on the destination
cluster. Read consistency is not guaranteed on the destination cluster until 
commit. Before committing, the source and destination clusters may differ at a 
given point in time. To learn more, see :ref:`mongosync-considerations`.

While ``mongosync`` is syncing, ``mongosync`` may reorder or combine writes 
as it relays them from source to destination. For a given document, the total 
number of writes may differ between source and destination.

Transactions might not appear atomically on the destination cluster.
Retryable writes may not be retryable on the destination cluster.

Profiling
~~~~~~~~~

If profiling is enabled on a source database, MongoDB creates a special
collection named ``<db>.system.profile``. After synchronization is
complete, {+c2c-product-name+} will not drop the
``<db>.system.profile`` collection from the destination even if the
source database is dropped at a later time. The ``<db>.system.profile``
collection will not change the accuracy of user data on the
destination.

Views
~~~~~

If a database with views is dropped on the source, the destination may
show an empty ``system.views`` collection in that database. The empty
``system.views`` collection will not change the accuracy of user
data on the destination.

.. _c2c-system-collections:

System Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/collections/behavior-system-collections.rst

UUIDs
~~~~~

``mongosync`` creates collections with new :abbr:`UUIDs (universally
unique identifiers)` on the destination cluster. There is no
relationship between UUIDs on the source cluster and the destination
cluster. If applications contain hard-coded UUIDs (which MongoDB does
not recommend), you may need to update those applications before they
work properly with the migrated cluster. 

Sorting
~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` inserts documents on the destination cluster in an
undefined order which does not preserve natural sort order from the
source cluster. If applications depend on document order but don't have
a defined sort method, you may need to update those applications to
specify the expected sort order before the applications work properly
with the migrated cluster. 

Performance
-----------

Resilience
~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` is resilient and able to handle non-fatal errors. Logs
that contain the word "error" or "failure" do not indicate that
``mongosync`` is failing or corrupting data. For example, if a network
error occurs, the ``mongosync`` log may contain the word "error' but
``mongosync`` is still able to complete the sync. In the case that a
sync does not complete, ``mongosync`` writes a fatal log entry. 

.. _c2c-mongosync-ddl:

Data Definition Language (DDL) Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using DDL operations (operations that act on collections or databases
such as :method:`db.createCollection()` and :method:`db.dropDatabase()`)
during sync increase the risk of migration failure and may negatively
impact ``mongosync`` performance. For best performance, refrain from
performing DDL operations on the source cluster while the sync is in
progress.

For more information on DDL operations, see
:ref:`txn-prod-considerations-ddl`. 

Network Latency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network latency or long physical distances between migration components
can negatively affect sync speed.

Latency between ``mongosync`` and destination shards
  For each operation on the source cluster, ``mongosync`` does two 
  roundtrips to the destination server. The larger the latency, the 
  slower the sync.

Latency between destination shards
  ``mongosync`` runs operations and updates its own metadata in batches 
  in a transaction on the destination cluster. This can result in 
  cross-shard transactions, which may be more costly if the shards are 
  far apart.

Latency between the nodes of any replica set on the source or destination cluster
  ``mongosync`` uses :writeconcern:`"majority"` writes and 
  :readconcern:`"majority"` reads, which require acknowledgement from 
  multiple nodes in a replica set, including shard-backing replica 
  sets. If the majority of these nodes aren't in the same region, there 
  will be negative performance implications.

Interruptions During Sync
-------------------------

The following considerations pertain to interruptions during the
``mongosync`` process. 

Errors and Crashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``mongosync`` encounters an error or becomes unavailable during
synchronization, or you can resume your ``mongosync`` operation from where
it stopped. The ``mongosync`` binary is stateless and stores the
metadata for a restart on the destination cluster. 

To continue sync, restart ``mongosync`` once it becomes available again
and use the same parameters as your interupted sync. Once you restart
``mongosync``, the process resumes from where it stopped.

Cluster Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your source or destination cluster crashes unexpectedly, you can safely
restart ``mongosync`` from where it left off. Once your cluster is available
again, restart ``mongosync`` and use the same parameters as your interupted
sync. 

.. _c2c-pause-behavior:

Paused Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``mongosync`` is in the :ref:`PAUSED <c2c-state-paused>` state,
``mongosync`` does not support the following actions:

- Upgrading the MongoDB version of the source or destination cluster
- Enabling and then disabling the balancer

You can upgrade ``mongosync`` while it is in the ``PAUSED`` state.
