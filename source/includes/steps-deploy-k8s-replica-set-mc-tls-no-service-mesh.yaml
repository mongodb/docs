title: "Define external connectivity settings."
stepnum: 5
ref: define-external-connectivity
level: 4
content: |

  Specify global values that affect all clusters in a |multi-cluster| using
  the :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>` settings and
  cluster-specific overrides using the
  :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice>` settings.

  When you provide these settings in the |mongodb-multi| specification,
  the |k8s-op-short| creates external services for each Pod in all
  |k8s| clusters. You then use these services to establish external
  connectivity to all ``mongod`` processes in your deployment.

title: "Define an external domain for each |k8s| member cluster."
stepnum: 6
ref: define-external-domain
level: 4
content: |

  Define an external domain for each member cluster using the
  :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalDomain <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externaldomain>`
  setting.

  As a result, the |k8s-op-short| registers all ``mongod`` processes in the
  |k8s| member cluster under a hostname according to the following convention:

  .. code-block:: sh

     <pod-name>.<externalDomain>

  For example, a ``mongod`` process may have the following hostname:
  ``my-replica-set-0-0.cluster-1.example.com``.

title: "Verify external connectivity for each member cluster."
stepnum: 11
ref: check-external-connectivity
level: 4
content: |

  1. Check the status of external services in all member clusters:

     .. code-block:: sh

        kubectl get services

     |k8s| should return one external service created for each Pod of the replica set in all member clusters.

  #. Verify that each external service is exposed externally and is reachable.
     Run the command similar to the following example:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongosh mongodb://my-replica-set-0-0.cluster-0.example.com:27017 \
        -tls -tlsCAFile "issuer-ca.pem"

     Connecting to ``my-replica-set-0-0.cluster-0.example.com:27017`` should
     direct client traffic to an external service named ``my-replica-set-0-0-svc-external``,
     which, in turn, directs traffic to the ``mongod`` process.

  #. Configure your |dns| zone for the specified external domain to point to
     the corresponding external services. This configuration depends on
     your environment or the cloud provider you are using.
