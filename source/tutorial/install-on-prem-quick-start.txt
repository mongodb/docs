Install On Prem MMS for Development and Testing
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS On Prem is a package that lets you run the MongoDB Management Service
(MMS) on site. MMS monitors and backs up your MongoDB infrastructure.

On Prem MMS uses the components described in
:doc:`/core/system-overview`. In a test deployment, you can run an
entire On Prem MMS deployment on a single system as in the
:ref:`on-prem-minimal-deployment-diagram` diagram. Run the replica set
being monitored on a separate system.

The minimal deployment is for testing and development purposes
only. Running on a single server is *not** suitable for production
deployments.

Considerations
--------------

The IP address for the MMS On Prem Service is stored in the
conf-mms.properties file. If the IP address should change, for example if
you run on EC2 and choose to stop and restart the EC2 instance, then you
must update the previous address with the new one in the
``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file.

Your test users who access the service must also update the address in the
URL they use to connect and in their ``monitoring-agent.config`` files.

backup the replica set.
