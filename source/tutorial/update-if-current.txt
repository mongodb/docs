Overview
--------

The *Update if Current*
pattern is an approach to :ref:`concurrency control
<concurrency-control>` when multiple applications have access to the
data.

Pattern
-------

The pattern queries for the document to update. Then, for each field to
modify, the pattern includes the field and its value in the returned
document in the query predicate for the update operation. This way, the
update only modifies the document fields *if* the fields have not
changed since the query.

Example
-------

Consider the following example in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. The
example updates the ``quantity`` and the ``reordered`` fields of a
document *only* if the fields have not changed since the query.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   The :method:`db.collection.update()` method now returns a
   :method:`WriteResult()` object that contains the status of
   the operation. Previous versions required an extra
   :method:`db.getLastErrorObj()` method call.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myDocument = db.products.findOne( { sku: "abc123" } );
   
   if ( myDocument ) {
      var oldQuantity = myDocument.quantity;
      var oldReordered = myDocument.reordered;
      
      var results = db.products.update( 
         { 
           _id: myDocument._id,
           quantity: oldQuantity,
           reordered: oldReordered
         },
         { 
           $inc: { quantity: 50 },
           $set: { reordered: true }
         }
      )
      
      if ( results.hasWriteError() ) {
         print( "unexpected error updating document: " + tojson(results) );
      }
      else if ( results.nMatched === 0 ) {
         print( "No matching document for " +
                "{ _id: "+ myDocument._id.toString() + 
                ", quantity: " + oldQuantity + 
                ", reordered: " + oldReordered 
                + " } "
         );
      }
   }

Modifications to the Pattern
----------------------------

Another approach is to add a ``version`` field to the documents.
Applications increment this field upon each update operation to the
documents. You must be able to ensure that *all* clients that connect
to your database include the ``version`` field in the query predicate.
To associate increasing numbers with documents in a collection, you can
use one of the methods described in
:doc:`/tutorial/create-an-auto-incrementing-field`.
