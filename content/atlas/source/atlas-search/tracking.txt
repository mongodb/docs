The |fts| ``tracking`` option allows you to track your search queries.
When you track your queries, |service| tracks the search terms and
provides analytics information about the search terms in your queries.
You can use the analytics information to improve the quality of your
search application and to refine your query to return relevant results. 

.. note:: 

   You must have an ``M10`` or higher cluster to take advantage of the
   analytics information returned by |fts| ``tracking`` option.
   |service| doesn't track search terms or display analytics for
   queries on free and {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``searchTerms``
     - string
     - Text or term associated with the query to track. You can specify
       only one term per query.
     - Required

.. _fts-tracking-behavior:

Behavior
--------

For each |fts| index on your cluster, |service| collects the
following metrics for the tracked search terms that were run using that
index: 

- Number of |fts| queries for the tracked terms.
- Number of times |fts| didn't return any results for queries for the
  tracked terms. 

|service| counts the number of queries per day for tracked search terms.
|service| has a limit on the number of search terms that it captures per
{+cluster+} each day from tracked :pipeline:`$search` queries. Once
|service| reaches the limit, it doesn't capture new, unique search
terms. However, if you run queries for previously tracked terms for the
day after |service| reaches the limit and stops capturing, |service|
continues to increment the counter for those terms regardless of the
limit for the day.  

|service| resets the terms that are tracked, the count for the terms
that are tracked, and the limit on the number of tracked search terms at
the beginning of each day in :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)`.

.. example:: 

   This example demonstrates how |service| counts the terms that are
   tracked. Suppose you run queries for the term ``summer`` on:
   
   - Day 1 before |service| reaches the limit on the number of tracked
     search terms for that day. Then on Day 1, |service| counts the
     number of queries for ``summer`` and  metrics are available for
     ``summer`` if ``summer`` is one of the top search terms on that day.
   - Day 2 before and after |service| reaches the limit on the number of
     tracked search terms for that day. Then on Day 2, |service| counts
     the number of queries for ``summer`` before and after it reaches
     the limit for the number of tracked search terms and metrics are
     available for ``summer`` if ``summer`` is one of the top search
     terms on that day. 
   - Day 3 after |service| reaches the limit on the number of tracked
     search terms for that day. Then on Day 3, |service| doesn't count
     the query for term ``summer`` and metrics aren't available for
     ``summer`` on that day. 

|fts| doesn't use the term that you specify with the ``tracking`` option
to process the query. Also, the search term that you specify with the
``tracking`` option doesn't have any effect on the results that |fts|
returns for the query. 

.. _fts-tracking-output:

Output 
------

You can view metrics for the queries tracked using the ``tracking``
option in the {+atlas-ui+} :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page for an
|fts| index. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-query-analytics-page-nav`. 

The :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page displays the following metrics 
for a predefined date range such as the current day, last 7 days, last 
30 days, or last 90 days, or a custom range (in :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated
Universal Time)`) that you specify, with a per day granularity: 

- :ref:`fts-query-analytics-all-tracked-queries`
- :ref:`fts-query-analytics-no-results-queries`

To learn more, see :ref:`fts-query-analytics`.

.. _fts-tracking-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following query against the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
searches the ``title`` field for the term ``summer``. The query uses the
``tracking`` option (highlighted) to enable |fts| to capture analytics
information for the query term ``summer``. If you have the sample data
on your cluster and a |fts| index named ``default`` on the ``title``
field in the collection, you can run the following query against the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection on your cluster. To learn more about
loading the sample data and creating a |fts| index, see
:ref:`fts-tutorial-ref` tutorial.

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 

   .. input:: 
      :language: json 
      :emphasize-lines: 8-10

      db.movies.aggregate([
        {
          "$search": {
            "text": {
              "query": "summer",
              "path": "title"
            },
            "tracking": {
              "searchTerms": "summer"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "$limit": 5
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "title": 1
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output:: 
      :language: json

      [
        { title: 'Summer' },
        { title: 'Summer Stock' },
        { title: 'Early Summer' },
        { title: 'Summer Interlude' },
        { title: 'Violent Summer' }
      ]

If you run this query, you can view metrics for it in the
:guilabel:`Query Analytics` page for the index if |service| collected
data for the tracked search term. To learn more, see
:ref:`fts-query-analytics`.
