The |k8s-op-full| translates the human knowledge of creating a MongoDB
instance into a scalable, repeatable, and standardized method.
Kubernetes needs help creating and managing stateful applications like
databases. It needs to configure the network, persist storage, and
dedicate computing capacity without additional human effort on each
container.

The |k8s-op-short| manages the typical lifecycle events for a MongoDB
cluster: provisioning storage and computing power, configuring network
connections, setting up users, and changing these settings as needed.
It accomplishes this using the Kubernetes API and tools.

You provide the Operator with the specifications for your MongoDB
cluster. The Operator uses this information to tell Kubernetes how to
configure that cluster including provisioning storage, setting up the
network connections, and configuring other resources.

The |k8s-op-full| works together with MongoDB |com|, which further
configures to MongoDB clusters. When MongoDB is deployed and running in
Kubernetes, you can manage MongoDB tasks using |com|.

You can then deploy MongoDB databases as you deploy them now after the
cluster is created. You can use the |com| console to run MongoDB at
optimal performance.
