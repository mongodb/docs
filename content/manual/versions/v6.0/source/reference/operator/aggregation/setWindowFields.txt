.. pipeline:: $setWindowFields

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Performs operations on a specified span of documents in a collection,
known as a *window*, and returns the results based on the chosen
:ref:`window operator <setWindowFields-window-operators>`.

.. include:: /includes/setWindowFields-introduction-examples.rst

.. _setWindowFields-syntax:

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage syntax:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {
      $setWindowFields: {
         partitionBy: <expression>,
         sortBy: {
            <sort field 1>: <sort order>,
            <sort field 2>: <sort order>,
            ...,
            <sort field n>: <sort order>
         },
         output: {
            <output field 1>: {
               <window operator>: <window operator parameters>,
               window: {
                  documents: [ <lower boundary>, <upper boundary> ],
                  range: [ <lower boundary>, <upper boundary> ],
                  unit: <time unit>
               }
            },
            <output field 2>: { ... },
            ...
            <output field n>: { ... }
         }
      }
   }

The :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage takes a document with these
fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 15 70

   * - Field
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - :ref:`partitionBy <setWindowFields-partitionBy>`

     - Optional

     - .. _setWindowFields-partitionBy:
     
       Specifies an :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` to group
       the documents. In the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage, the
       group of documents is known as a *partition*. Default is one
       partition for the entire collection.

   * - :ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>`

     - Required for some operators (see
       :ref:`setWindowFields-restrictions`)

     - .. _setWindowFields-sortBy:
     
       Specifies the field(s) to sort the documents by in the partition.
       Uses the same syntax as the :pipeline:`$sort` stage. Default is
       no sorting.

   * - :ref:`output <setWindowFields-output>`

     - Required

     - .. _setWindowFields-output:
     
       Specifies the field(s) to append to the documents in the output
       returned by the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage. Each field is
       set to the result returned by the :ref:`window operator
       <setWindowFields-window-operators>`.
       
       A field can contain :ref:`dots <document-dot-notation>` to
       specify embedded document fields and array fields. The semantics
       for the embedded document dotted notation in the
       :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage are the same as the
       :pipeline:`$addFields` and :pipeline:`$set` stages. See
       :ref:`embedded document $addFields example
       <add-field-to-embedded>` and :ref:`embedded document $set example
       <set-add-field-to-embedded>`.

       - The ``window operator`` is the :ref:`window operator
         <setWindowFields-window-operators>` name to use in the
         :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage.

       - The ``window operator parameters`` are the parameters to pass
         to the :ref:`window operator
         <setWindowFields-window-operators>`.

   * - :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>`

     - Optional

     - .. _setWindowFields-window:
     
       Specifies the window boundaries and parameters. Window boundaries
       are inclusive. Default is an unbounded window, which includes all
       documents in the partition.
       
       Specify either a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>` or
       :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` window.

   * - :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`

     - Optional

     - .. _setWindowFields-documents:
     
       A window where the lower and upper boundaries are specified
       relative to the position of the current document read from the
       collection.
       
       The window boundaries are specified using a two element array
       containing a lower and upper limit string or integer. Use:
       
       - The ``"current"`` string for the current document position in
         the output.
       
       - The ``"unbounded"`` string for the first or last document
         position in the partition.
       
       - An integer for a position relative to the current document. Use
         a negative integer for a position before the current
         document. Use a positive integer for a position after the
         current document. ``0`` is the current document position.

       See :ref:`setWindowFields-documents-window-examples`.

   * - :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>`

     - Optional

     - .. _setWindowFields-range:

       A window where the lower and upper boundaries are defined using
       a range of values based on the :ref:`sortBy
       <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field in the current document.
       
       The window boundaries are specified using a two element array
       containing a lower and upper limit string or number. Use:
       
       - The ``"current"`` string for the current document position in
         the output.
       
       - The ``"unbounded"`` string for the first or last document
         position in the partition.
       
       - A number to add to the value of the :ref:`sortBy
         <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field for the current document. A
         document is in the window if the :ref:`sortBy
         <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field value is inclusively within the
         lower and upper boundaries.

       See :ref:`setWindowFields-range-window-example`.

   * - :ref:`unit <setWindowFields-unit>`

     - Optional

     - .. _setWindowFields-unit:

       Specifies the units for time :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>`
       window boundaries. Can be set to one of these strings:
       
       - ``"year"``
       
       - ``"quarter"``

       - ``"month"``

       - ``"week"``
       
       - ``"day"``
       
       - ``"hour"``
       
       - ``"minute"``
       
       - ``"second"``
       
       - ``"millisecond"``
       
       If omitted, default numeric :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>`
       window boundaries are used.

       See :ref:`setWindowFields-time-range-window-examples`.

   :ref:`setWindowFields-examples`

Behavior
--------

The :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage appends new fields to existing
documents. You can include one or more :pipeline:`$setWindowFields`
stages in an aggregation operation.

.. include:: /includes/setWindowFields-and-transactions-snapshots.rst

The ``$setWindowFields`` stage doesn't guarantee the order of the
returned documents.

.. _setWindowFields-window-operators:

Window Operators
----------------

.. include:: /includes/setWindowFields-operators.rst

.. _setWindowFields-restrictions:

Restrictions
------------

Restrictions for the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage:

- Prior to MongoDB 5.3, the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` 
  stage cannot be used:

  - Within :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.
  - With :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern.

- :ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` is required for:

  - :ref:`Rank <setWindowFields-rank-operators>` and :ref:`order
    <setWindowFields-order-operators>` window operators.
  
  - Bounded windows (either a :ref:`documents
    <setWindowFields-documents>` window or a :ref:`range
    <setWindowFields-range>` window).

  - :group:`$linearFill` operator.

- :ref:`Range <setWindowFields-range>` windows require all :ref:`sortBy
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` values to be numbers.

- :ref:`Time range <setWindowFields-unit>` windows require all
  :ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` values to be dates.

- :ref:`Range <setWindowFields-range>` and :ref:`time range
  <setWindowFields-unit>` windows can only contain one :ref:`sortBy
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field and the sort must be ascending.

- You cannot specify both a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`
  window and a :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` window.

- These operators use an implicit window and return an error if you
  specify a :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` option:
  
  - :ref:`Rank <setWindowFields-rank-operators>` operators.

  - :group:`$shift` operator.

- For :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` windows, only numbers in
  the specified range are included in the window. Missing, undefined,
  and ``null`` values are excluded.

- For :ref:`time range <setWindowFields-unit>` windows:

  - Only date and time types are included in the window.

  - Numeric boundary values must be integers. For example, you can use 2
    hours as a boundary but you cannot use 1.5 hours.

- For empty windows or windows with incompatible values (for example,
  using :group:`$sum` on strings), the returned value depends on the
  operator:
  
  - For :group:`$count` and :group:`$sum`, the returned value is ``0``.
  
  - For :group:`$addToSet` and :group:`$push`, the returned value is an
    empty array.
  
  - For all other operators, the returned value is ``null``.

The following examples use the ``cakeSales`` collection.

.. _setWindowFields-documents-window-examples:

Documents Window Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Documents Window to Obtain Cumulative Quantity for Each State
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This example uses a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>` window
in :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` to output the cumulative cake sales
``quantity`` for each ``state``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cakeSales.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: "$state",
            sortBy: { orderDate: 1 },
            output: {
               cumulativeQuantityForState: {
                  $sum: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     documents: [ "unbounded", "current" ]
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

.. include:: /includes/setWindowFields-partition-sort-date.rst

- ``output``:

  - Sets the ``cumulativeQuantityForState`` field to the cumulative
    ``quantity`` for each ``state``, which increases by successive
    additions to the previous value in the partition.

  - Calculates the cumulative ``quantity`` using the :group:`$sum`
    operator run in a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`
    window.

    The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between an ``unbounded`` lower limit and the ``current`` document.
    This means :group:`$sum` returns the cumulative ``quantity`` for the
    documents between the beginning of the partition and the current
    document.

In this example output, the cumulative ``quantity`` for ``CA`` and
``WA`` is shown in the ``cumulativeQuantityForState`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 4, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-05-18T16:09:01Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 41, "quantity" : 162, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 162 }
   { "_id" : 0, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:10:30Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 120, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 282 }
   { "_id" : 2, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-01-11T06:31:15Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 145, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 427 }
   { "_id" : 5, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-01-08T06:12:03Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 43, "quantity" : 134, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 134 }
   { "_id" : 3, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-02-08T13:13:23Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 104, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 238 }
   { "_id" : 1, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-03-20T11:30:05Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 14, "quantity" : 140, "cumulativeQuantityForState" : 378 }

Use Documents Window to Obtain Cumulative Quantity for Each Year
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This example uses a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>` window
in :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` to output the cumulative cake sales
``quantity`` for each :expression:`$year` in ``orderDate``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cakeSales.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: { $year: "$orderDate" },
            sortBy: { orderDate: 1 },
            output: {
               cumulativeQuantityForYear: {
                  $sum: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     documents: [ "unbounded", "current" ]
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

- ``partitionBy: { $year: "$orderDate" }`` :ref:`partitions
  <setWindowFields-partitionBy>` the documents in the collection by
  :expression:`$year` in ``orderDate``. There are are partitions for
  ``2019``, ``2020``, and ``2021``.

- ``sortBy: { orderDate: 1 }`` :ref:`sorts
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` the documents in each partition by
  ``orderDate`` in ascending order (``1``), so the earliest
  ``orderDate`` is first.

- ``output``:

  - Sets the ``cumulativeQuantityForYear`` field to the cumulative
    ``quantity`` for each year, which increases by successive
    additions to the previous value in the partition.

  - Calculates the cumulative ``quantity`` using the :group:`$sum`
    operator run in a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`
    window.

    The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between an ``unbounded`` lower limit and the ``current`` document.
    This means :group:`$sum` returns the cumulative ``quantity`` for the
    documents between the beginning of the partition and the current
    document.

In this example output, the cumulative ``quantity`` for each year is
shown in the ``cumulativeQuantityForYear`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 5, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-01-08T06:12:03Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 43, "quantity" : 134, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 134 }
   { "_id" : 4, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-05-18T16:09:01Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 41, "quantity" : 162, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 296 }
   { "_id" : 3, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-02-08T13:13:23Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 104, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 104 }
   { "_id" : 0, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:10:30Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 120, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 224 }
   { "_id" : 2, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-01-11T06:31:15Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 145, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 145 }
   { "_id" : 1, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-03-20T11:30:05Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 14, "quantity" : 140, "cumulativeQuantityForYear" : 285 }

Use Documents Window to Obtain Moving Average Quantity for Each Year
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This example uses a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>` window
in :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` to output the moving average
for the cake sales ``quantity``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cakeSales.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: { $year: "$orderDate" },
            sortBy: { orderDate: 1 },
            output: {
               averageQuantity: {
                  $avg: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     documents: [ -1, 0 ]
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

- ``partitionBy: "$orderDate"`` :ref:`partitions
  <setWindowFields-partitionBy>` the documents in the collection by
  :expression:`$year` in ``orderDate``. There are are partitions for
  ``2019``, ``2020``, and ``2021``.

- ``sortBy: { orderDate: 1 }`` :ref:`sorts
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` the documents in each partition by
  ``orderDate`` in ascending order (``1``), so the earliest
  ``orderDate`` is first.

- ``output``:

  - Sets the ``averageQuantity`` field to the moving average
    ``quantity`` for each year.

  - Calculates the moving average ``quantity`` using the :group:`$avg`
    operator run in a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`
    window.

    The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between ``-1`` and ``0``. This means :group:`$avg` returns the
    moving average ``quantity`` between the document before the current
    document (``-1``) and the current document (``0``) in the partition.

In this example output, the moving average ``quantity`` is shown in the
``averageQuantity`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 5, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-01-08T06:12:03Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 43, "quantity" : 134, "averageQuantity" : 134 }
   { "_id" : 4, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-05-18T16:09:01Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 41, "quantity" : 162, "averageQuantity" : 148 }
   { "_id" : 3, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-02-08T13:13:23Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 104, "averageQuantity" : 104 }
   { "_id" : 0, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:10:30Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 120, "averageQuantity" : 112 }
   { "_id" : 2, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-01-11T06:31:15Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 145, "averageQuantity" : 145 }
   { "_id" : 1, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-03-20T11:30:05Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 14, "quantity" : 140, "averageQuantity" : 142.5 }

Use Documents Window to Obtain Cumulative and Maximum Quantity for Each Year
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This example uses a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>` window
in :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` to output the cumulative and maximum
cake sales ``quantity`` values for each :expression:`$year` in
``orderDate``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cakeSales.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: { $year: "$orderDate" },
            sortBy: { orderDate: 1 },
            output: {
               cumulativeQuantityForYear: {
                  $sum: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     documents: [ "unbounded", "current" ]
                  }
               },
               maximumQuantityForYear: {
                  $max: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     documents: [ "unbounded", "unbounded" ]
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

- ``partitionBy: "$orderDate"`` :ref:`partitions
  <setWindowFields-partitionBy>` the documents in the collection by
  :expression:`$year` in ``orderDate``. There are are partitions for
  ``2019``, ``2020``, and ``2021``.

- ``sortBy: { orderDate: 1 }`` :ref:`sorts
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` the documents in each partition by
  ``orderDate`` in ascending order (``1``), so the earliest
  ``orderDate`` is first.

- ``output``:

  - Sets the ``cumulativeQuantityForYear`` field to the cumulative
    ``quantity`` for each year.

  - Calculates the cumulative ``quantity`` using the :group:`$sum`
    operator run in a :ref:`documents <setWindowFields-documents>`
    window.

    The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between an ``unbounded`` lower limit and the ``current`` document.
    This means :group:`$sum` returns the cumulative quantity for the
    documents between the beginning of the partition and the current
    document.

  - Sets the ``maximumQuantityForYear`` field to the maximum
    ``quantity`` for each year.

  - Calculates the maximum ``quantity`` of all the documents using the
    :group:`$max` operator run in a :ref:`documents
    <setWindowFields-documents>` window.
    
    The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between an ``unbounded`` lower and ``upper`` limit. This means
    :group:`$max` returns the maximum quantity for the documents in the
    partition.

In this example output, the cumulative ``quantity`` is shown in the
``cumulativeQuantityForYear`` field and the maximum ``quantity`` is
shown in the ``maximumQuantityForYear`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

Range Window Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses a :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` window in
:pipeline:`$setWindowFields` to return the sum of the ``quantity``
values of cakes sold for orders within plus or minus 10 dollars of the
current document's ``price`` value:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cakeSales.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: "$state",
            sortBy: { price: 1 },
            output: {
               quantityFromSimilarOrders: {
                  $sum: "$quantity",
                  window: {
                     range: [ -10, 10 ]
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

- ``partitionBy: "$state"`` :ref:`partitions
  <setWindowFields-partitionBy>` the documents in the collection by
  ``state``. There are partitions for ``CA`` and ``WA``.

- ``sortBy: { price: 1 }`` :ref:`sorts
  <setWindowFields-sortBy>` the documents in each partition by
  ``price`` in ascending order (``1``), so the lowest ``price``
  is first.

- ``output`` sets the ``quantityFromSimilarOrders`` field to the sum of
  the ``quantity`` values from the documents in a :ref:`range
  <setWindowFields-range>` window.

  - The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
    between a lower limit of ``-10`` and an upper limit of ``10``. The
    range is inclusive.
    
  - :group:`$sum` returns the sum of ``quantity`` values contained in a
    range of plus or minus 10 dollars of the current document's
    ``price`` value.

In this example output, the sum of the ``quantity`` values for documents
in the window is shown in the ``quantityFromSimilarOrders`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 2, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-01-11T06:31:15Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 145, "quantityFromSimilarOrders" : 265 }
   { "_id" : 0, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:10:30Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 120, "quantityFromSimilarOrders" : 265 }
   { "_id" : 4, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-05-18T16:09:01Z"),
     "state" : "CA", "price" : 41, "quantity" : 162, "quantityFromSimilarOrders" : 162 }
   { "_id" : 3, "type" : "vanilla", "orderDate" : ISODate("2020-02-08T13:13:23Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 13, "quantity" : 104, "quantityFromSimilarOrders" : 244 }
   { "_id" : 1, "type" : "chocolate", "orderDate" : ISODate("2021-03-20T11:30:05Z"),
     "state" : "WA", "price" : 14, "quantity" : 140, "quantityFromSimilarOrders" : 244 }
   { "_id" : 5, "type" : "strawberry", "orderDate" : ISODate("2019-01-08T06:12:03Z"),

Time Range Window Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a Time Range Window with a Positive Upper Bound
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

The following example uses a :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` with
a positive upper bound time range :ref:`unit <setWindowFields-unit>` in
:pipeline:`$setWindowFields`. The pipeline outputs an array of
``orderDate`` values for each ``state`` that match the specified time
range.

.. code-block:: javascript

               recentOrders: {
                  $push: "$orderDate",
                  window: {
                     range: [ "unbounded", 10 ],
                     unit: "month"
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }

.. include:: /includes/time-range-window-example.rst

- The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains documents
  between an ``unbounded`` lower limit and an upper limit set to ``10``
  (10 months after the current document's ``orderDate`` value) using a
  time range :ref:`unit <setWindowFields-unit>`.
    
- :group:`$push` returns the array of ``orderDate`` values
  for the documents between the beginning of the partition and the
  documents with ``orderDate`` values inclusively in a range of the
  current document's ``orderDate`` value plus ``10`` months.

In this example output, the array of ``orderDate`` values for ``CA`` and
``WA`` is shown in the ``recentOrders`` field:
