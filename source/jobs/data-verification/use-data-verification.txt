Data verification runs as a separate process that is tightly
coupled to a sync job. Data verification can be enabled for one-time 
sync jobs. This page details how to enable and debug the 
data verification process.

Enable Data Verification
------------------------

You can enable data verification when :ref:`creating a sync job <rm-create-jobs>`
on the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

On the :guilabel:`Migration Options` module, click the 
:guilabel:`Verify migrated data` check box for your sync job.

.. note:: Data Verification Duration

   The Data Verification process can take as long or longer than the data sync job.
   You can click :guilabel:`Terminate` to cancel a Data Verification process.

To view status and metadata information about the data verification process
for a sync job, click the :guilabel:`SYNC JOB / DATA VERIFICATION` slider.

   * - FAILED
     - The source and destination databases do not match. The corresponding errors are listed on the :guilabel:`Issues` pane.
   * - VERIFIED
     - Data validation is successful, the source and destination databases match.

Data Verification Issues
------------------------

If the data verification process detects any differences between the 
source database and destination collections, the errors are
reported in the Data Verification :guilabel:`Issues` pane.

In this example, the data verification process is detecting that the
number of documents in the target collection do not match the source
database.

#. The Verification status is :guilabel:`FAILED`.
#. The specific issue and error detail is displayed in the :guilabel:`Issues` pane.
