.. _faq-public-ip-changes:

Do |service| {+cluster+}\'s public IPs ever change?
---------------------------------------------------

The factors that determine if and when |a-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IP 
address changes depends on the cluster tier.

.. note::

    This section applies to ``M10`` or larger {+dedicated-clusters+} only 
    unless specified.

|A-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IP addresses must change when you:

- Vertically scale an :ref:`NVMe-backed <nvme-storage>` cluster on
  :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>` or :ref:`Microsoft Azure
  <microsoft-azure>`.
- :ref:`Convert a replica set to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`.
- :ref:`Add shards to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-shardNum>`.
- :ref:`Change the region into which a cluster is deployed <scale-cluster-region>`.
- :ref:`Scale <scale-cluster-open-dialog>` an ``M0`` or {+Flex-cluster+}
  to an ``M10`` or larger {+cluster+}.
- :ref:`Terminate <terminate-cluster>` then re-deploy a 
  {+cluster+} with the same name *but in a different tier* within 
  36 hours.
- :ref:`Enable Encryption at Rest 
  <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>` on a {+cluster+} with a 
  lifetime less than 12 hours.

|A-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IPs don't change when you:

- Vertically scale a {+cluster+} on :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  <amazon-aws>` or :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>` that is not
  backed by an :ref:`NVMe SSD <nvme-storage>`, or vertically
  scale a {+cluster+} from any tier on :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`.
- Unpause the {+cluster+}.
- :ref:`Terminate <terminate-cluster>` and then re-deploy a {+cluster+}
  with a lifetime of 12 hours or more within 12-36 hours.
- Experience a maintenance or a healing event on your {+cluster+}.

To find the public IP address for any node in your {+cluster+}, use the
``nslookup`` tool from the command line. The IP address is shown in the
``Address`` portion of the output.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ nslookup ds-shard-00-00-17jcm.mongodb-dev.net

    Address: 34.226.104.79

.. _faq-atlas-side-hostnames:

Can I specify my own VPC for my |service-fullname| project?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No. An |service| project, and its clusters, are associated with a
region-specific |vpc|.

|service| creates a |vpc| when you deploy the first ``M10+`` dedicated
paid cluster to a given provider and region. For multi-region clusters,
|service| creates one |vpc| per region if there is not already a |vpc|
for that region.

*(AWS deployments only)* |service| also creates a |vpc| when you create
a :doc:`VPC peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` to an |aws|
|vpc|. |service| creates the |vpc| in the same region as the peered
|vpc|.

To use a different |vpc| (that is, on the customer's own cloud
infrastructure accounts), you would need to use |mms-full|
or Ops Manager.

How do I find my Atlas-side hostnames to open up my outbound firewall?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your firewall blocks outbound network connections, you must open
outbound access from your application environment to
|service-fullname|. To configure your application-side networks to
accept |service| traffic you can use the 
:oas-bump-atlas-op:`Return All IP Addresses for One Project <getgroupipaddresses>`
API endpoint to retrieve all IP addresses for your project.

You can pass the IP addresses programmatically into your application-tier 
orchestration automation to push firewall updates.

.. _faq-cross-region:

How many cross-region network permissions does |service| support?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/facts/cross-region-limits.rst

If you would exceed the cross-region permissions limit when creating a
cluster through the {+atlas-admin-api+}, the |api| returns the following
error:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "error" : 403,
     "detail" : "Cannot have more than 40 cross-region network permissions.",
     "reason" : "Forbidden"
   }

.. _atlas-faq-aws-transit-gateway:

Can Atlas be used with AWS Transit Gateway?
-------------------------------------------

Yes. |aws| PrivateLink powers |service| Private Endpoints. This allows
for transitive connectivity. You can use the
:aws:`AWS Transit Gateway </vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-getting-started.html>`
with your |vpc| if you connected your |vpc| to |service| via |aws|
PrivateLink.

.. _atlas-faq-aws-direct-connect:

Can Atlas be used with AWS Direct Connect?
------------------------------------------

Yes. |aws| PrivateLink powers |service| Private Endpoints. This allows
for transitive connectivity. You can use :aws:`AWS Direct Connect </whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect-network-to-amazon.html>` with your
|vpc| if you connected your |vpc| to |service| via |aws| PrivateLink.
