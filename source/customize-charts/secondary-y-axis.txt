If you map multiple :guilabel:`Aggregation` or :guilabel:`Value` fields
to the :guilabel:`Y axis`, you can plot one set of values on a secondary
Y axis. This customization option is useful for comparing two data series
with significantly different scales using the same chart.

Usage
-----

You can plot a secondary Y axis on the following chart types:

- :ref:`Grouped column <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete line <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Continuous line <continuous-charts>`
- :ref:`Continuous area <continuous-charts>`

To plot a field on a secondary Y axis:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Customize` tab above the :ref:`encoding channels
   <encoding-channels>` in the :doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`.
#. Scroll down in the :guilabel:`Customize` panel and click the field you
   want to plot on the secondary Y axis.
#. Set the :guilabel:`Plot on Secondary Axis` toggle switch to
   :guilabel:`On`.

After the secondary Y axis is enabled, you can customize its :ref:`value
axis options <value-axis-options>`.

When the secondary Y axis is used for at least one series, two separate
legends appear for the left Y axis and the right Y axis, each showing the
series mapped to that legend.

Example
-------

The following chart uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database. The ``metacritic`` field rates movies on a scale of 0-100, while
the ``tomatoes.critic`` field uses a scale of 0-10. This chart shows the
total scores for all movies for ten directors, with the ``metacritic``
totals on the left Y axis and the ``tomatoes.critic`` totals on the right.

The chart shows that Woody Allen gets better ratings from the Rotten Tomatoes
reviewers, while Steven Soderbergh does better with the Metacritic reviewers.
