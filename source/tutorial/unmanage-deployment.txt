=======================================
Remove a Deployment from MMS Monitoring
=======================================


.. question: you can only stop managing the deployment as a whole, right,
   not part of a deployment such as a shard or rs member?


.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove a deployment from monitoring by MMS, in which case MMS no
longer manages the deployment nor displays it in the MMS
:guilabel:`Deployment` page

This procedure *does not* shut down the deployment. The deployment
continues to run. If you also intend to stop the servers, do that first.
See :doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.

Consideration
-------------

Instead of removing a deployment from monitoring, you can optionally
disable its alerts, which allows you to continue to view the deployment in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.

Prerequisite
------------

If the deployment is no longer needed for any purpose, shut down the
deployment before removing it. Otherwise the deployment will continue to
run, even though MMS no longer monitors it. See
:doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.

Procedure
---------

To remove a deployment from management by MMS:
