Clusters
========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB supports two types of clusters: :term:`replica sets
<replica set>` and :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.
A sharded cluster can contain replica sets within it: each shard can be a
replica set and the config server can also be a replica set. These
relationships are reflected in the way |mms| models clusters, and it
might lead to unexpected results from the ``clusters`` resource. 

.. example::
   
   Consider a deployment with one sharded cluster containing four
   shards, and each shard is a three-node replica set. 

   In this scenario, the ``clusters`` resource will return five
   entities: 

   - One that represents the sharded cluster, and 
   - Four that represent the replica sets (shards). 

   However, if each shard in this fictitious deployment were a
   standalone :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` instead of a replica set, then the
   ``clusters`` resource returns only one entity representing the
   sharded cluster.
