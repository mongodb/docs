Chunk Migration Across Shards
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Chunk migration moves the chunks of a sharded collection from one shard
to another and is part of the :doc:`balancer
</core/sharding-balancing>` process.

Chunk Migration
---------------

MongoDB migrates chunks in a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute the
chunks of a sharded collection evenly among shards. Migrations may be
either:

- Manual. Only use manual migration in limited cases, such as
  to distribute data during bulk inserts. See :ref:`Migrating Chunks
  Manually <sharding-balancing-manual-migration>` for more details.

- Automatic. The :doc:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` process
  automatically migrates chunks when there is an uneven distribution of
  a sharded collection's chunks across the shards. See :ref:`Migration
  Thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>` for more details.

All chunk migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command to
   the source shard.

#. The source starts the move with an internal :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
   command. During the migration process, operations to the chunk
   route to the source shard. The source shard is responsible for
   incoming write operations for the chunk.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the chunk and
   starts receiving copies of the data.

#. After receiving the final document in the chunk, the destination
   shard starts a synchronization process to ensure that it has the
   changes to the migrated documents that occurred during the migration.

#. When fully synchronized, the destination shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the cluster metadata with the new
   location for the chunk.

#. After the destination shard completes the update of the metadata,
   and once there are no open cursors on the chunk, the source shard
   deletes its copy of the documents.

The migration process ensures consistency and maximizes the availability of
chunks during balancing.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

   While copying and deleting data during migrations, the balancer
   waits for replication to secondaries. See :v2.2:`Secondary Throttle
   in the v2.2 Manual
   </tutorial/configure-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle>`
   for details.
