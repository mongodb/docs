- An Atlas cluster. See :ref:`guides-create-a-cluster`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the {+db-deployments+} page for your project.

   .. step:: Click on your cluster name.

      .. figure:: /images/sample-data-cluster.png
         :figwidth: 600px
         :alt: sample-data-cluster

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Collections` tab.

      .. figure:: /images/sample-data-tab.png

         :alt: sample-data-tab
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Load Sample Dataset`.

      .. figure:: /images/sample-data-load.png
         :figwidth: 600px
         :alt: sample-data-load
      
      .. note::

      Once the load completes, the :guilabel:`Collections` tab refreshes 
      to show your sample data.

      You see the following databases in your cluster:
