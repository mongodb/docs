|service| can faciliate a live migration where |com| pushes a source
sharded cluster to a sharded |service| cluster. |service| keeps the target
cluster in sync with the source cluster until you cut your applications
over to the target cluster in |service|.

Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure, stop
writes to the source cluster: stop your application instances,
point them to the |service| cluster, and restart them.

Restrictions
------------

.. include:: /includes/live-migration-from-com-restrictions.rst

- You can't use a :doc:`Global Cluster </global-clusters>` as the
  target for live migration.

To live migrate a replica set cluster from |com| to |service|, see
:doc:`/import/migrate-from-com-rs`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the live migration from |com| to |service|:

Live Migration Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow. For detailed steps,
see the :ref:`procedure for migrating a sharded cluster from
Ops Manager or Cloud Manager to Atlas <lm-com-procedure-sharded>`.

.. _lm-com-upgrade-path-sharded:

Migration Path and Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/live-migration-from-com-platforms.rst

|service| live migration (push) supports the following migration paths:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/push-live-migration-upgrade-path-sharded.rst

.. note::

   For sharded clusters, the major MongoDB versions on the source and target
   clusters must be exactly the same.

.. include:: /includes/import/network-access-lm-from-com.rst

.. _lm-com-migration-validation-sharded:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the live migration procedure, |service| runs validation
checks on the source and target clusters.

- The source cluster is a sharded cluster.

- The target |service| cluster is a sharded cluster with the same
  number of :term:`shards <shard>` as the source sharded cluster.

- The target |service| cluster doesn't have |bic| enabled.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-network-encryption-push-migration.rst

Target Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When configuring the target cluster, consider the following:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-perf-target-cluster.rst

- The target |service| cluster must be a sharded cluster.

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  cluster as the target for live migration.

- Do **not** change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Cloud Backups

Avoid Namespace Changes

Avoid Elections

Rolling Restarts

Staging and Production Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/live-migrate-from-com-staging-prod.rst

Dropping Data in the Target Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your target sharded cluster contains existing data, the live
migration service detects this and warns you that it will drop data
and collections from the target sharded cluster before live migrating
data into it.

Migrating from MongoDB Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are :opsmgr:`migrating </tutorial/migrate-community-to-atlas>`
to |service| from MongoDB Community using |onprem|, you must accept
the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Migration Agreement
</reference/legal/live-migration-atlas-licensing>` as the first step
in the :ref:`Live Migration procedure <lm-com-procedure-sharded>`.

Migrate Your Cluster
--------------------

.. important::

   Avoid making changes to the source cluster configuration while the
   live migration procedure runs, such as removing sharded cluster members
   or modifying :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` runtime settings, such as
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``.
