Start with a Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless you are already very familiar with C++ and the MongoDB database,
or already know that you specifically want to work on the Core Server,
we highly recommend that you start by contributing to one of the
Drivers. Why?

- Smaller codebase(s) than the core server.
    Each driver has a relatively small codebase. This means it is
    easier to get familiar with all the parts and how they work
    together. Drivers are individually less complex than the core
    server, and they are similar in function to each other.

- Fewer requirements to get a pull request approved.
    There are fewer moving parts in a driver than the core server, due
    to the smaller codebase. This makes it easier for us to tell if
    your change is going to break something else, whether that
    something else is an existing part of the driver or a planned new
    feature.

- More likely to be in a language with which you are comfortable.
    With drivers for different languages, you're likely to be
    comfortable in at least one of those languages.

- Apache License.
    Among other things, you do not have to sign the contributor
    agreement when contributing to the drivers, which can hold up the
    pull request process.
