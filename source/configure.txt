You can define the settings that the {+mcli+} uses to interact with
MongoDB services like |service|, |cloud-short|, and |onprem| by using
the :ref:`mcli-config-command` command. The first time you run this
command, the {+mcli+} creates a :ref:`configuration file
<mcli-config-file>` called ``mongocli.toml`` to store your settings. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To configure the {+mcli+}:

- Add your |ipaddr| or |cidr| block to the |api| whitelist for your
  MongoDB service.
- Generate a |svc-api-key| if you don't already have one.
  
  .. note::

     |svc-api-key|\s are role-based. Different roles have different
     privileges and capabilities, and some {+mcli+} commands are available
     to some roles but not others. Be sure that the roles assisgned to
     your |svc-api-key| are appropriate for the commands you intend to
     use.

To learn more about generating a |svc-api-key| for
your MongoDB service, see the following documentation:

- :atlas:`Atlas API Access </configure-api-access>`
- :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager API Access </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`
- :opsmgr:`Ops Manager API Acess </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`

Procedure
---------

The :ref:`mcli-config-command` command varies slightly depending on the
MongoDB service for which you want to configure the {+mcli+}.
