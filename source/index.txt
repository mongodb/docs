Basically, what it is (fully managed blah blah blah). Uses MongoDB 3.2
w WT storage engine. No support for MongoDB Enterprise.

.. admonition:: Question

   Do we need to state somewhere in this manual (probabaly not on this
   page) that you can't bring in existing cluster to |service|. or is
   it self-evident?

.. admonition:: FYI

   the left hand side kind of mirrors a bit of the left hand menu in
   the UI. Such as having Alerts. Let me know if you prefer we roll up
   some of these.

Key Features
