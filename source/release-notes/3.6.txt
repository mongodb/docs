.. _3.6-rel-notes-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

The following features are available starting in MongoDB 3.6.

More Expressive ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$lookup` adds support for specifying multiple join
conditions as well as uncorrelated sub-queries by allowing variable
specification and pipeline execution on the joined collection.

For details, see the :pipeline:`$lookup` syntax for
:ref:`lookup-syntax-let-pipeline`.

New Aggregation Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support newly added :ref:`sessions <3.6-sessions>`, MongoDB 3.6 adds the
following new aggregation pipeline stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$listSessions`

     - Lists sessions in the ``system.sessions`` collection in the
       ``config`` database.

   * - :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`

     - Lists sessions cached in memory by the server.

   * - :pipeline:`$currentOp`

     - Returns a stream of documents containing information
       on active and/or dormant operations on a :program:`mongod`
       instance.

New Aggregation Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :expression:`$arrayToObject`

     - Converts an array of key value pairs to a document.

   * - :expression:`$objectToArray`

     - Converts a document to an array of documents representing
       key-value pairs.

   * - :expression:`$mergeObjects`

     - Combines multiple documents into a single document.

   * - :expression:`$dateFromString`

     - Converts a date/time string to a date object.

   * - :expression:`$dateFromParts`
     - Constructs a BSON Date object given the date's constituent
       parts.

   * - :expression:`$dateToParts`
     - Returns a document containing the constituent parts of a date.


New Aggregation Helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds a helper, :method:`db.aggregate()`, to perform
aggregations that do not rely on an underlying collection, such
as those that start with :pipeline:`$currentOp` or
:pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

New Aggregation Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:variable:`REMOVE` allows for the conditional exclusion of a field.

New ``hint`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method support a new ``hint``
option to specify the index to use.

.. note::

   The ``hint`` does not apply to :pipeline:`$lookup` and
   :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages.

New ``comment`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method support a new ``comment``
option to help trace the operation through the database profiler,
currentOp, and logs.

Support for Time Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds support for time zones to :doc:`aggregation date
operators </reference/operator/aggregation-date>`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Aggregation Compatibility Changes <aggregate-compatibility>`


Array Update Operator Enhancements
----------------------------------

.. _3.6-arrayFilters:

``arrayFilters``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands and methods can accept an ``arrayFilters``
parameter to specify which elements to modify in an array field:

.. list-table::

MongoDB 3.6 adds the following new positional operators for update
operations on arrays and nested arrays:

- The all positional :update:`$[]` operator updates all elements in
  an array.

- The filtered positional :update:`$[\<identifier\>]` operator updates
  all elements in an array that match the :ref:`3.6-arrayFilters`
  criteria.

Replica Sets
------------

- Added the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command to dynamically
  resize a replica set member's oplog. Available for instances running
  the WiredTiger storage engine.

- Added the
  :ref:`catchUpTakeoverDelayMillis <repl-conf-catchup-takeover-delay>`
  configuration option, dictating the amount of time a node waits to
  run for election after determining that it is ahead of the current
  :term:`primary`.

- For replica sets that use the protocol version 1 (``pv1``), arbiters
  will vote no in elections if they detect a healthy primary of equal
  or greater priority to the candidate. For more information on replica
  set protocol versions, see
  :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`.

Sharded Clusters
----------------

- Added :parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxConnecting` parameter
  for :program:`mongos` to control the rate at which :program:`mongos`
  adds connections to a :program:`mongod` instance.


Query Operators
---------------

New Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds the following new query operators:

- The new :query:`$jsonSchema` operator matches documents that validate
  against the given JSON Schema. To use :query:`$jsonSchema`,
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be set to "3.6".

- The :query:`$expr` allows the use of aggregation expressions within
  the query language.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`3.6-compatibility-enabled`

Removed Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 removes the deprecated ``$pushAll`` operator. For more
information, see :ref:`3.6-pushall-compatibility`.


General Enhancements
--------------------

MongoDB 3.6 includes the following enhancements:

- Collections have an immutable :ref:`unique identifier
  <collections-uuids>`.

- Added support for specifying full Unix domain socket paths with
  :option:`--bind_ip`.

- Added support for the ``zlib`` compressor for
  ``--networkMessageCompressors`` option (or
  :setting:`net.compression.compressors` setting if using the
  configuration file). ``--networkMessageCompressors`` option (or
  :setting:`net.compression.compressors` setting) enables network
  compression for communication between :program:`mongod`,
  :program:`mongos`, and :program:`mongo` shell.

- Added support for Diagnostics Capture (also known as ``FTDC``) in
  :program:`mongos`. In previous versions, the feature was available
  for :program:`mongod` only. See :ref:`param-ftdc`.

  .. note:: FTDC is enabled by default.

- :program:`mongod` now offers a :option:`--timeZoneInfo` option. Use
  this option to specify the path to your system time zone database.
  The default configuration file included with Linux packages sets this
  to ``/usr/share/zoneinfo``.

- The new :parameter:`honorSystemUmask` startup option for
  :program:`mongod` causes new files created by MongoDB to have
  the read/write permissions specified by the `umask
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask>`_ of the user who runs the
  :program:`mongod` process. Only available on Linux and OS X systems.

- Date operations now accept consistent date ranges across all supported
  operating systems. You may safely work with years in the range ``0``
  through ``9999``.

- MongoDB 3.6 introduces a new :doc:`wire protocol
  </reference/mongodb-wire-protocol>` opcode called :ref:`wire-op-msg`.
  This opcode's message format is extensible and designed to subsume
  the functionality of other opcodes.

- The :limit:`maxWriteBatchSize <Write Command Batch Limit Size>` limit
  of a database, indicating the maximum number of write operating
  permitted in a write batch, raises from ``1,000`` to ``100,000``.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

- An index can cover a query on fields within nested documents.

- Multikey indexes can cover queries over non-array keys if the index
  tracks which fields make it multikey.

- When creating an index, you cannot specify ``*`` as the name of the
  index. See :ref:`3.6-index-asterisk`.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

- Added the following options to the :dbcommand:`listDatabases` admin
  command:

  - ``nameOnly`` to return only the database names (which does not
    require database locks) instead of returning both the database names
    and size information (which does require database locks).

  - ``filter`` to return databases that match the specified match
    criteria on the outputs.

- Modified behavior of the :dbcommand:`validate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.validate()` method such that only for ``full``
  validation does the WiredTiger storage engine force a checkpoint,
  flush all in-memory data to disk, then verify the on-disk data. See
  also :ref:`3.6-validate-compatibility`.

- The ``<database>.system.profile`` entry for :dbcommand:`update` and
  :dbcommand:`delete` contains the entire update/delete document applied
  to the named collection.

- :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` waits until all collections drops in the
  database have propagated to a majority of the replica set members.

Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
