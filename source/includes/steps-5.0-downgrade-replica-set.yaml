  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

  Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
  time:

  a. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-clean-shutdown.rst

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
     before downgrading the next secondary. To check the member's state,
     use the :method:`rs.status()` method in :mongosh:`mongosh </>`.

  #. Once the member is in ``SECONDARY`` stage, downgrade the next
     secondary.

  Skip this step if the replica set does not include an arbiter.
  
  Downgrade the :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiter-configuration>` member of
  the replica set:

  a. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-clean-shutdown.rst

  #. Delete the contents of the arbiter data directory. The 
     :setting:`storage.dbPath` configuration setting or 
     :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` command line option specify the
     data directory of the arbiter :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

     .. code-block:: bash

        rm -rf /path/to/mongodb/datafiles/*

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``ARBITER`` state. To check
     the member's state, connect :mongosh:`mongosh </>` to the
     member and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

ref: 5.0-step-down-primary
pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in :mongosh:`mongosh </>` to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()
post: |
  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
  preferable to shutting down the primary directly.

   b. Replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with
