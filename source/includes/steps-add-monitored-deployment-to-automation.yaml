  When adding a MongoDB deployment to an existing automated deployment,
  you have the option of importing the added deployment's users and
  roles. To import these users and roles:

  a. Check :guilabel:`Yes, merge in additional users and roles`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Continue`. 

  .. important::

     If you choose not to import the users and roles now, you cannot import
     them later. You can create new, or modify existing, users and roles for
     the added deployment once it is under automation. See
     :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users` for how to create or modify users and
     :doc:`/reference/user-roles` for the list and definitions of roles in 
     |onprem|.

  If the imported users and roles conflict with those already in the automated
  deployment, you are prompted to select which versions of the users and roles
  should be used:

  a. Select the correct user or role.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.
