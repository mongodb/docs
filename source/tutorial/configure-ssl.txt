===========================================
Configure ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` for SSL
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document helps you to configure MongoDB to support SSL. MongoDB
clients can use SSL to encrypt connections to :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` instances.

.. note:: The `default distribution of MongoDB`_ does **not** contain
   support for SSL. To use SSL, you must either build MongoDB locally
   passing the ``--ssl`` option to ``scons`` or use `MongoDB
   Enterprise`_.

.. _`default distribution of MongoDB`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
.. _`MongoDB Enterprise`: http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise

These instructions assume that you have already installed a build of
MongoDB that includes SSL support and that your client driver supports
SSL. For instructions on upgrading a cluster currently not using SSL to
using SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   - MongoDB's SSL encryption only allows use of strong SSL ciphers
     with a minimum of 128-bit key length for all connections.

   - MongoDB Enterprise for Windows includes support for SSL.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients` to learn about SSL support for
   Python, Java, Ruby, and other clients.

``.pem`` File
-------------

Before you can use SSL, you must have a :file:`.pem` file containing a
public key certificate and its associated private key.

MongoDB can use any valid SSL certificate issued by a certificate
authority, or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed
certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted,
there will be *no* validation of server identity. Although such a
situation will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you
vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by
a trusted certificate authority will permit MongoDB drivers to verify
the server's identity.

In general, avoid using self-signed certificates unless the network is
trusted.

Additionally, with regards to :ref:`authentication among replica
set/sharded cluster members <inter-process-auth>`, in order to minimize
exposure of the private key and allow hostname validation, it is
advisable to use different certificates on different servers.

For *testing* purposes, you can generate a self-signed certificate and
private key on a Unix system with a command that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /etc/ssl/
   openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out mongodb-cert.crt -keyout mongodb-cert.key

This operation generates a new, self-signed certificate with no
passphrase that is valid for 365 days. Once you have the certificate,
concatenate the certificate and private key to a :file:`.pem` file, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   cat mongodb-cert.key mongodb-cert.crt > mongodb.pem

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`

.. _ssl-mongod-ssl-cert-key:

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with SSL Certificate and Key
-------------------------------------------------------------

To use SSL in your MongoDB deployment, include the following run-time
options with :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`:

- :setting:`net.ssl.mode` set to ``requireSSL``. This setting restricts each
  server to use only SSL encrypted connections. You can also specify
  either the value ``allowSSL`` or ``preferSSL`` to set up the use of
  mixed SSL modes on a port. See :setting:`net.ssl.mode` for details.

- :setting:`~net.ssl.PEMKeyfile` with the :file:`.pem` file that contains the
  SSL certificate and key.

Consider the following syntax for :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile <pem>

For example, given an SSL certificate located at
:file:`/etc/ssl/mongodb.pem`, configure :program:`mongod` to use SSL
encryption for all connections with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem

.. note::

   - Specify ``<pem>`` with the full path name to the certificate.

     ..  relative paths aren't supported with --fork because of a
         server issue.

   - If the private key portion of the ``<pem>`` is encrypted, specify
     the passphrase. See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

   - You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the following example:

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslMode = requireSSL
        sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem

To connect, to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using
SSL, the :program:`mongo` shell and MongoDB tools must include the
``--ssl`` option. See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on
connecting to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` running with SSL.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl`

.. _ssl-mongod-ca-signed-ssl-cert-key:

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with Certificate Validation
------------------------------------------------------------

To set up :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` for SSL encryption
using an SSL certificate signed by a certificate authority, include the
following run-time options during startup:

- :setting:`net.ssl.mode` set to ``requireSSL``. This setting restricts each
  server to use only SSL encrypted connections. You can also specify
  either the value ``allowSSL`` or ``preferSSL`` to set up the use of
  mixed SSL modes on a port. See :setting:`net.ssl.mode` for details.

- :setting:`~net.ssl.PEMKeyfile` with the name of the :file:`.pem` file that
  contains the signed SSL certificate and key.

- :setting:`~net.ssl.CAFile` with the name of the :file:`.pem` file that
  contains the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority.

Consider the following syntax for :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile <pem> --sslCAFile <ca>

For example, given a signed SSL certificate located at
:file:`/etc/ssl/mongodb.pem` and the certificate authority file at
:file:`/etc/ssl/ca.pem`, you can configure :program:`mongod` for SSL
encryption as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

.. note::

   - Specify the ``<pem>`` file and the ``<ca>`` file with either the
     full path name or the relative path name.

   - If the ``<pem>`` is encrypted, specify the passphrase. See
     :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

   - You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the following example:

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslMode = requireSSL
        sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
        sslCAFile = /etc/ssl/ca.pem

To connect, to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using
SSL, the :program:`mongo` tools must include the both the
:option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>` and
:option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongo --sslPEMKeyFile>` option.
See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on connecting to
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` running with SSL.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl`

Block Revoked Certificates for Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent clients with revoked certificates from connecting, include
the :setting:`sslCRLFile` to specify a :file:`.pem` file that contains
revoked certificates.

For example, the following :program:`mongod` with SSL configuration
includes the :setting:`sslCRLFile` setting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslCRLFile /etc/ssl/ca-crl.pem --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

Clients with revoked certificates in the :file:`/etc/ssl/ca-crl.pem`
will not be able to connect to this :program:`mongod` instance.

.. _ssl-mongod-weak-certification:

Validate Only if a Client Presents a Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases it is important to ensure that clients present valid
certificates. However, if you have clients that cannot present a
client certificate, or are transitioning to using a certificate
authority you may only want to validate certificates from clients that
present a certificate.

If you want to bypass validation for clients that don't present
certificates, include the :setting:`~net.ssl.weakCertificateValidation`
run-time option with :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`. If the
client does not present a certificate, no validation occurs. These
connections, though not validated, are still encrypted using SSL.

For example, consider the following :program:`mongod` with an SSL
configuration that includes the :setting:`~net.ssl.weakCertificateValidation`
setting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslWeakCertificateValidation --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

Then, clients can connect either with the option :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`
and **no** certificate or with the option :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`
and a **valid** certificate. See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more
information on SSL connections for clients.

.. note::

   If the client presents a certificate, the certificate must be a
   valid certificate.

   All connections, including those that have not presented
   certificates are encrypted using SSL.

Run in FIPS Mode
----------------

`MongoDB Enterprise`_ supports running in FIPS mode.

If your :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` is running on a system
with an OpenSSL library configured with the FIPS 140-2 module, you can
run :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` in FIPS mode, with the
:setting:`~net.ssl.FIPSMode` setting.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x (RHEL 6.x) or its derivatives such as
CentOS 6.x, the OpenSSL toolkit must be at least
``openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5`` to run in FIPS mode. To upgrade the toolkit
for these platforms, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   yum update openssl

.. _ssl-certificate-password:

SSL Certificate Passphrase
--------------------------

The PEM files for :setting:`~net.ssl.PEMKeyfile` and
:setting:`~net.ssl.ClusterFile` may be encrypted. With encrypted PEM files,
you must specify the passphrase at startup with a command-line or a
configuration file option or enter the passphrase when prompted.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   In previous versions, you can only specify the passphrase with a
   command-line or a configuration file option.

To specify the passphrase in clear text on the command line or in a
configuration file, use the :setting:`~net.ssl.PEMKeyPassword` and/or the
:setting:`~net.ssl.ClusterPassword` option.

To have MongoDB prompt for the passphrase at the start of
:program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` and avoid specifying the
passphrase in clear text, omit the :setting:`~net.ssl.PEMKeyPassword` and/or
the :setting:`~net.ssl.ClusterPassword` option. MongoDB will prompt for each
passphrase as necessary.

.. important:: The passphrase prompt option is available if you run the
   MongoDB instance in the foreground with a connected terminal. If you
   run :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` in a non-interactive
   session (e.g. without a terminal or as a service on Windows),
   you cannot use the passphrase prompt option.
