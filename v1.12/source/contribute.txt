How to Contribute
=================

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the {+connector+}. We guide
community contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Please
ensure that your pull request meets the following criteria:

- Includes documentation comments describing your feature
- Includes unit tests that cover the functionality of your feature
- Passes the Gradle ``check`` task, which includes the following tasks:

  a. ``test`` task
  b. ``integrationTest`` task
  c. ``spotlessCheck`` task

To get started, check out the source code and create a branch by running the
following commands in your shell:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-kafka.git
   cd mongo-kafka
   git checkout -b <your branch name>

Once you push your changes to your feature branch, make sure it passes the
Gradle checks. You can run the checks with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./gradlew clean check --continue -Dorg.mongodb.test.uri=<your local mongodb replica set connection uri>

.. important:: Integration Tests

   You must have a local MongoDB replica set running to perform Gradle integration
   tests. To learn how to set up a MongoDB replica set, see 
   :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set/>` in the MongoDB manual.

.. note:: Skipped Tests

   You can skip tests in the ``integrationTest`` task related to 
   the following areas unless your code specifically modifies connector behavior
   related to these areas:

   - Specific versions of MongoDB
   - Authentication

   You can run the authentication tests by enabling authentication in your
   local MongoDB replica set and specifying your credentials in your connection URI. To learn how
   to enable authentication in a replica set, see
   :manual:`Deploy Replica Set With Keyfile Authentication </tutorial/deploy-replica-set-with-keyfile-access-control/>`
   in the MongoDB manual.

   You can run tests related to a specific MongoDB version by deploying a local replica set
   with that version of MongoDB.

To learn more about the connector source code, see the :github:`GitHub repository <mongodb/mongo-kafka>`.

To learn more about Gradle, see the official
`Gradle website <https://docs.gradle.org/>`__.
