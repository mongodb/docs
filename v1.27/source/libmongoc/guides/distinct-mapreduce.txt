This document provides some practical, simple, examples to demonstrate the ``distinct``
and ``mapReduce`` commands.

Setup
-----

First we'll write some code to insert sample data:

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/doc-common-insert.c
   :start-after: start-common-insert
   :end-before: end-common-insert
   :language: c
   :dedent:

"distinct" Command
------------------

This is how to use the ``distinct`` command to get the distinct values of ``x`` which are greater
than ``1``:

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/basic_aggregation/distinct.c
   :language: c
   :caption: distinct.c

"mapReduce" - Basic Example
---------------------------

A simple example using the map reduce framework. It simply adds up the number of occurrences
of each "tag".

First define the ``map`` and ``reduce`` functions:

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/basic_aggregation/constants.c
   :language: c
   :caption: constants.c

Run the ``mapReduce`` command. Use the generic command helpers (e.g. `mongoc_database_command_simple <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_database_command_simple.html>`__).
Do not the read command helpers (e.g. `mongoc_database_read_command_with_opts <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_database_read_command_with_opts.html>`__)
because they are considered retryable read operations. If retryable reads are enabled, those operations will retry once on
a retryable error, giving undesirable behavior for ``mapReduce``.

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/basic_aggregation/map-reduce-basic.c
   :language: c
   :caption: map-reduce-basic.c

"mapReduce" - More Complicated Example
--------------------------------------

You must have replica set running for this.

In this example we contact a secondary in the replica set and do an "inline" map reduce, so the
results are returned immediately:

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/basic_aggregation/map-reduce-advanced.c
   :language: c
   :caption: map-reduce-advanced.c

Running the Examples
--------------------

Here's how to run the example code

.. literalinclude:: /libmongoc/includes/examples/basic_aggregation/basic-aggregation.c
   :language: c
   :caption: basic-aggregation.c

If you want to try the advanced map reduce example with a secondary, start a replica set (instructions
for how to do this can be found `here <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set-for-testing/>`_).

Otherwise, just start an instance of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: none

   $ mongod

Now compile and run the example program:

.. code-block:: none

   $ cd examples/basic_aggregation/
   $ gcc -Wall -o agg-example basic-aggregation.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libmongoc-1.0)
   $ ./agg-example localhost

   Next double: 3.000000
   map reduce
   { "result" : "outCollection", "timeMillis" : 155, "counts" : { "input" : 84, "emit" : 126, "reduce" : 3, "output" : 3 }, "ok" : 1 }
   { "_id" : "cat", "value" : 63 }
   { "_id" : "dog", "value" : 42 }
   { "_id" : "mouse", "value" : 21 }
   more complicated map reduce
   { "results" : [ { "_id" : "cat", "value" : 63 }, { "_id" : "dog", "value" : 42 }, { "_id" : "mouse", "value" : 21 } ], "timeMillis" : 14, "counts" : { "input" : 84, "emit" : 126, "reduce" : 3, "output" : 3 }, "ok" : 1 }
