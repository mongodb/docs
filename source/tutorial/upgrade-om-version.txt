Update the major and minor versions of your |onprem| instance and :term:`backing databases` in the :ref:`k8s-om-specification` that |k8s-op-short| uses to manage your deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. warning::

   To maintain existing settings and availability, back up the following in your current |onprem| instance: 
   
   - Your ``conf-mms.properties`` to a secure location. The ``conf-mms.properties`` stores settings for the |onprem| instance.
   - Your ``gen.key`` files to a secure location.  The :ref:`gen.key <gen-key>` provides details to encrypt and decrypt |onprem|\s backing databases and user credentials. |onprem| might delete these files as part of the upgrade process.
   - Your :ref:`application database <appdb-om-arch>`. If the upgrade fails, you need a current backup to restore your |onprem| instance.

1. Upgrade |onprem| by following the considerations, prerequisites, and procedure in :ref:`upgrade-om`.

2. Reference :ref:`compatible-mdb-versions` to ensure your :term:`backing databases` use a MongoDB version that is compatible with the new |onprem| version.

3. If you need to upgrade your backing databases to a compatible MongoDB version, see :ref:`meko-upgrade-mdb-version`.

Procedure
---------

The following example updates |onprem| from 4.0 to 5.0 and the application 
database to MongoDB ``4.2.11-ent``.
