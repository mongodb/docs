Definition
----------

.. expression:: span

   The ``span`` operator finds text search matches within regions of a
   text field. You can use it to find strings which are near each other
   to specified degrees of precision. The ``span`` operator is more
   computationally intensive than other operators, because queries must
   keep track of positional information.

   ``span`` queries aren't ranked by score.

.. _span-syntax:

Syntax
------

``span`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   {
      $search: {
        "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
        "span": {
          <clauses>: {
            <search queries>
          }
        }
      }
   }

.. note::

   Internal ``span`` search queries can use the :ref:`term <term-ref>`
   operator, but not the :ref:`search <search-ref>` or
   :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operators.

Examples
--------

The following examples use a collection called ``fruit`` which
contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 3,
     "type" : "grapes",
     "description" : "Six bunches of grapes weigh about 3 pounds."
   }

``first``
~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses a ``first`` clause to find documents
in which the string ``bunches`` appears near the beginning of the
``description`` field. The ``endPositionLte`` parameter has a
value of ``2``, specifying that the search term must be the first
or second word in the field.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "span": {
           "first": {
             "operator": {
               "term": {
                 "path": "description",
                 "query": "bunches"
               }
             },
             "endPositionLte": 2
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the document with ``_id: 3``, which has a
``description`` field with ``bunches`` as the second word.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 3,
     "type": "grapes",
     "description": "Six bunches of grapes weigh about 3 pounds."
   }

``near``
~~~~~~~~

The following query looks for documents in which the strings
``bunches`` and ``bananas`` are found near each other. The
``inOrder`` parameter is set to ``false``, so the search terms can
be in any order. The ``slop`` parameter is set to ``4``, so
the search terms must be separated by no more than 4 words.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search : {
         "span": {
           "near": {
             "clauses": [
               { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "bunches" } },
               { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "bananas" } }
             ],
             "slop": 4,
             "inOrder": false
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query finds the following result:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
    "_id": 2,
    "type": "banana",
    "description": "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   }

``or``
~~~~~~

The following query uses two ``term`` clauses to look for documents
in which the ``description`` field has either ``bananas`` or ``apples``
as the first word.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "span": {
           "first": {
             "endPositionLte": 1,
             "operator": {
               "or": {
                 "clauses": [
                   { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "bananas" } },
                   { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "apples" } }
                 ]
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query finds the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "type": "apple",
     "description": "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   }, {
     "_id": 2,
     "type": "banana",
     "description": "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   }

``subtract``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``subtract`` clause is useful for excluding certain strings from
your search results. The following query looks for documents in which
the ``description`` field contains the words ``six`` and ``bunches``,
in any order, within 3 words of each other. It excludes any document
in which the word ``five`` occurs between ``six`` and ``bunches``.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search : {
         "span": {
           "subtract": {
             "include": {
               "span": {
                 "near": {
                   "clauses": [
                     { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "six" } },
                     { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "bunches" } }
                   ],
                   "inOrder": false,
                   "slop": 3
                 }
               }
             },
             "exclude": { "term": { "path": "description", "query": "five" } }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query finds the following result:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
    "_id": 3,
    "type": "grapes",
    "description": "Six bunches of grapes weigh about 3 pounds."
   }

The document with ``_id: 2`` isn't included. Although its
``description`` field includes the words ``six`` and ``bunches``, it
also has ``five`` between them, and ``five`` is in the ``exclude``
clause of the query.
