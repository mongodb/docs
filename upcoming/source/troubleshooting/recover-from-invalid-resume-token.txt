Overview
--------

Learn how to recover from an invalid resume token
in a {+source-connector+}. 

Stack Trace
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following stack trace indicates that the source connector has an invalid resume token:

.. code-block:: text

   ...
   org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.ConnectException: ResumeToken not found.
   Cannot create a change stream cursor
   ...
   Command failed with error 286 (ChangeStreamHistoryLost): 'PlanExecutor
   error during aggregation :: caused by :: Resume of change stream was not
   possible, as the resume point may no longer be in the oplog
   ... 


.. _invalid-resume-token-cause:

Cause
-----

When the ID of your source connector's resume token does not correspond to any
entry in your MongoDB deployment's :ref:`oplog <replica-set-oplog>`, 
your connector has no way to determine where to begin to process your
MongoDB change stream. Click the following tabs to see scenarios 
in which you can experience this issue:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Paused Connector
      :tabid: paused-connector

      In this scenario, you pause your source connector and you fill your MongoDB
      deployment's oplog:
      
      #. You start a Kafka deployment with a {+source-connector+}.
      #. You produce a change event in your source MongoDB namespace, and your 
         connector stores a resume token corresponding to this event.
      #. You pause your source connector.
      #. While your connector pauses, you fill your MongoDB oplog such that MongoDB
         deletes the oplog entry corresponding to your resume token.
      #. You restart your source connector and it is unable to resume
         processing as its resume token does not exist in your MongoDB oplog.


   .. tab:: Infrequently Updated Namespace
      :tabid: infrequently-updated-namespace

      In this scenario, your source connector listens for changes on an infrequently
      updated MongoDB namespace and the
      :ref:`heartbeat feature <invalid-resume-token-prevention>` is not enabled:
      
      #. You start a Kafka deployment with a {+source-connector+}.
      #. You produce a change event in your source MongoDB namespace, and your
         connector stores a resume token corresponding to this event.
      #. Your source MongoDB namespace is not updated in the time it takes for your MongoDB
         deployment to rotate the change event corresponding to your resume token out of its
         oplog.
      #. You produce a change event in your source MongoDB namespace and your 
         source connector is unable to resume processing as its resume token does 
         not exist in your MongoDB oplog.

For more information on the oplog, see the 
:ref:`MongoDB Manual <replica-set-oplog>`.

For more information on change streams, see the
:ref:`<kafka-source-change-streams>` guide.

Solutions
---------

You can recover from an invalid resume token using one of the following
strategies:

- :ref:`<temporarily-tolerate-errors>`
- :ref:`<troubleshoot-reset-stored-offsets>`

.. _temporarily-tolerate-errors:

Temporarily Tolerate Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure your source connector to tolerate errors 
while you produce a change stream event that updates the 
connector's resume token. This recovery strategy is the 
simplest, but there is a risk that your connector briefly 
ignores errors unrelated to the invalid resume token. If you 
aren't comfortable briefly tolerating errors
in your deployment, you can 
:ref:`delete stored offsets <troubleshoot-delete-stored-offsets>` instead.

To configure your source connector to temporarily tolerate errors:

#. Set the ``errors.tolerance`` option to tolerate all errors:

   .. code-block:: java

      errors.tolerance=all

#. Insert, update, or delete a document in the collection referenced by your source connector to
   produce a change stream event that updates your connector's resume token.

#. Once you produce a change stream event, set the ``errors.tolerance``
   option to no longer tolerate errors:
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
      errors.tolerance=none

For more information on the ``errors.tolerance`` option, see the
:ref:`<source-configuration-error-handling>` page.

.. _troubleshoot-reset-stored-offsets:
.. _troubleshoot-delete-stored-offsets:

Reset Stored Offsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reset your Kafka Connect offset data, which contains your resume token,
to allow your connector to resume processing your change stream.

To reset your offset data, change the value of the
``offset.partition.name`` configuration property to a partition name that does
not exist on your Kafka deployment. You can set your ``offset.partition.name``
property like this:

.. code-block:: properties

   offset.partition.name=<a string>

.. tip:: Naming your Offset Partitions

   Consider using the following pattern to name your offset partitions:

   .. code-block:: properties

      offset.partition.name=<source connector name>.<monotonically increasing number>

   This pattern provides the following benefits:

   - Records the number of times you reset your connector
   - Documents to which connector an offset partition belongs

   For example, if you named your source connector ``"source-values"`` and you are
   setting the ``offset.partition.name`` property for the first time, 
   configure your connector as follows:

   .. code-block:: properties

      offset.partition.name=source-values.1

   The next time you reset your connector's offset data, configure
   your connector as follows:

   .. code-block:: properties

      offset.partition.name=source-values.2

To learn more about the ``offset.partition.name`` configuration property, see
the :ref:`<source-configuration-error-handling>` page.

To learn about naming your connector, see the official 
`{+kafka+} <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_configuring>`__
documentation.

.. _invalid-resume-token-prevention:

Prevention
----------

To prevent invalid resume token errors caused by an
:ref:`infrequently updated namespace <invalid-resume-token-cause>`, enable
**heartbeats**. Heartbeats is a feature of your source connector that causes 
your connector to update its resume token at regular intervals as well as when
the contents of your source MongoDB namespace changes.

Specify the following option in your source connector configuration to enable
heartbeats:

.. code-block:: properties

   heartbeat.interval.ms=<a positive integer>

To learn more about heartbeats, see the 
:ref:`<source-configuration-error-handling>` guide.
