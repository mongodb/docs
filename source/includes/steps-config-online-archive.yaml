     ``<database>.<collection>``), in the :guilabel:`Namespace` field. 

     You can't modify the :manual:`namespace 
     </reference/limits/#faq-dev-namespace>` once the online archive is 
     created. 

  #. Specify an already indexed date field from the documents in the 
     collection in the :guilabel:`Date field to archive on` field.

     You can't modify the date field once the online archive is created.

  #. Specify the number of days in the :guilabel:`Age limit` field. 

  Data is archived after the specified number of days after the specified date.

  The specified fields are used to partition your archived data. Partitions 
  are similar to folders. You can move the date field to the first position 
  of the partition if you frequently query by the specified date field. 

  For example, suppose you are configuring the online archive for the 
  ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. If your archived 
  field is the ``released`` date field, which you moved to the first 
  position, your first queried field is ``title``, and your second queried 
  field is ``plot``, your partition will look similar to the following: 

  .. code-block:: sh 
     :copyable: false 

     /released/title/plot

  .. note:: 

     Data partitions based on the date field from the document are truncated 
     to the day even if there are timestamps with seconds in the date field 
     value. 
  
  While partitions improve query performance, queries that don't contain 
  these fields require a full collection scan of all archived documents, which 
  will take longer and increase your costs. To learn more about how partitions 
  improve your query performance in Data Lake, see `Data Structure in S3 
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/datalake/admin/optimize-query-performance#data-structure-in-s3>`__.

  You can run :manual:`explain </reference/method/cursor.explain/>` on the

  1. Click :guilabel:`Begin Archiving` in the :guilabel:`Confirm an online

  2. Click :guilabel:`Confirm` in the :guilabel:`Begin Archiving` window.

  .. note:: 

     Once your document is queued for archiving, you can no longer edit the 
     document. You must use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` or :binary:`mongoexport 
     <bin.mongoexport>` to move archived data back into the live |service| 
     cluster delete the archive to remove the data from the archive.
