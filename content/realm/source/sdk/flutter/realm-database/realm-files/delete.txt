In some cases, you may want to completely delete a realm file from disk.

Realm avoids copying data into memory except when absolutely required.
As a result, all objects managed by a realm have references to the file
on disk. Before you can safely delete the file, you must ensure the
deallocation of these objects:

- All objects read from or added to the realm
- All List and Results objects
- All ThreadSafeReference objects
- The realm itself

.. warning:: Don't delete files while realms are open

   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.

Delete a Realm File
-------------------

You can delete the ``.realm``, ``.note`` and ``.management`` files
for a given configuration with the static method
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.deleteRealm() <realm/Realm/deleteRealm.html>`,
which accepts a path to a realm file as an argument.
