Overview
--------

|mms| users provide access to |mms| projects. You can create a new user in a project
to give access to that project. You can later give the user access to additional
projects. When you create a user, you assign the user a role in the project. A
role determines the actions the user can perform and the data the user can
access.

.. note::

   |mms| users are separate from :doc:`MongoDB users
   </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`.

Procedures
----------

Add Users
+++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-user.rst

.. only:: cloud

   If the console finds a connected Jira account, |mms| will automatically
   add the user to your Jira group and the |mms| console.

   Users can also create accounts using the `account registration page
   <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register/user>`_, or through Jira at
   `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

   .. index:: users; propagation

   .. note::

      If you create an account in Jira or make any changes to that
      account from *within* Jira, it can take up to 30 minutes for that
      change to propagate to |mms|. During this window you cannot add a
      user to a project in |mms|. Also, passwords changed in Jira are subject
      to the same propagation delay for |mms| accounts.

.. only:: onprem

   Users can create accounts using the account registration page of
   your |mms| installation if |mms| configuration is not
   :setting:`Invitation Only Mode`. If the |mms| is in
   :setting:`setting:: Invitation Only Mode`, new users can register only
   by invitation. The invitation provides a URL that displays the
   registration link.

View |mms| Users
++++++++++++++++

To view users, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Users`. The page lists users who have
access to your |mms| project, their roles, their time zones, and other
information. The page also lists any invitations to join the project waiting
for a reply, as well as any requests from users who want to join the project.
A user can request to join a project when first registering for |mms|.

View Invitations
++++++++++++++++

When you invite a user to join a project, |mms| then sends an email to the
prospective new user. To view invitations sent but not yet accepted, click
:guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Users`. The page lists any users with
pending invitations. To cancel an invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove |mms| Users
++++++++++++++++++

.. only:: cloud

   |mms| won't let you delete the last user in a project. You must instead
   :ref:`delete the project <remove-group>`. Deleting the project will delete
   the project's users. |mms| also won't let you delete a user who is the
   only user with the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the project. You
   must first assign the role to at least one other user before deleting
   the original user.

Assign Roles to |mms| Users
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assign :doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>` to |mms| users to limit the actions
they can perform and the data they can view.

To assign roles to users in a :doc:`project </tutorial/create-group>`, you must
have either the :ref:`User Admin <user-admin-role>` role or :ref:`Owner
<owner-role>` role in the project. The user who creates a project automatically
has the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/manage-users-assign-roles.rst

To assign roles inside of |mms|, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Users`. Click the user's gear icon and select
:guilabel:`Edit User`. Click the appropriate checkboxes to assign
:doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>`.
