100.9.1 Changelog
-----------------

*Released 2023-11-09*

This version updates external dependencies and fixes an issue where mongodump 
could change the ordering of fields in a view definition (:issue:`TOOLS-3411`). 
View pipelines and schema validation are the only collection options sensitive 
to field ordering. Depending on the contents of the view or validator options, 
the following can change:

- The set of results returned by a view, or
- The criteria that determines which documents are accepted by a validator.

Not all view pipelines or schema validations are affected by key reordering.
