Bulk query conversion allows you to convert many
queries from a single UI action, avoiding the need to convert 
each query individually. You can select and convert one 
or more queries, stored procedures, triggers, and views in bulk 
by enabling the multi-select toggle.

Bulk conversions create a job that queues and executes each query 
conversion in batches. You can view the status of an in-progress 
bulk conversion or for individual queries in the 
:guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Enable multi-selection

      Click the :guilabel:`Enable multi-selection` toggle to show the query 
      selection pane.

   .. step:: Select your conversions

      - To include or exclude a query from your bulk conversion job,
        click the :icon-fa5:`check-square` icon next to the field name.

      - To include or exclude entire categories from your download,
        click :icon-fa5:`check-square` next to the category name.

      - To include or exclude queries by their current status, use 
        the :ref:`Filter<rm-filter-queries>` to select a status.
   
   .. step:: Convert queries

      Click the :guilabel:`Convert` button. Selected queries are 
      queued for conversion and execute in batches. Total progress
      of the conversion displays at the bottom-left of the page.

      .. tip::

         To stop a bulk conversion, click the red :guilabel:`Terminate` 
         button in the lower-left corner of the screen and click the 
         red :guilabel:`Terminate` button on the pop-up modal. Once a 
         bulk job cancels, the bulk conversion status updates to 
         ``Bulk convert job terminated``.

   .. step:: (Optional) Provide feedback on the converted queries

      Provide feedback on converted queries to help improve future query conversions.
      To provide feedback, click the :icon-fa5:`thumbs-up` or :icon-fa5:`thumbs-down`
      icon on the bottom right corner of the converted query panel. Then, you can 
      provide feedback details and click :guilabel:`Submit`. 

Next Steps
----------

After the queries have been converted, review them for 
correctness before incorporating them into production code. You 
can use the :ref:`Test Queries<rm-query-converter-test-bench>` 
feature to help with validation.
