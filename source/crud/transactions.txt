Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} driver to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to run a series of operations that do 
not change any data until the transaction is committed. If any operation in 
the transaction returns an error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards 
all data changes before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you intend to run 
sequentially. Sessions allow you to run operations in an
**ACID-compliant transaction**, which is a transaction that meets an expectation
of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB guarantees that the 
data involved in your transaction operations remains consistent, even if the 
operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a
``MongoClient`` instance as a ``ClientSession`` type. We recommend that you reuse
your ``MongoClient`` for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
creating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``ClientSession`` only with the ``MongoClient`` (or associated
   ``MongoDatabase`` or ``MongoCollection``) that created it. Using a
   ``ClientSession`` with a different ``MongoClient`` results in operation
   errors.

Causal Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB enables **causal consistency** in client sessions.
The causal consistency model guarantees that operations within a session
run in a causal order. Clients observe results that are consistent
with the causal relationships, or the dependencies between
operations. For example, if you perform a series of operations where
one operation logically depends on the result of another, any subsequent
reads reflect the dependent relationship.

.. note::
   
   A client session enables causal consistency even if it does not perform a transaction.

The following table describes the guarantees that causally
consistent sessions provide:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guarantee
     - Description

   * - Read your writes
     - Read operations reflect the results of preceding write operations.

   * - Monotonic reads
     - Read operations do not return results that reflect an earlier data state than
       a preceding read operation.

   * - Monotonic writes
     - If a write operation must precede other write operations, the driver
       runs this write operation first.

       For example, if you call ``insert_one()`` to insert a document, then call
       ``update_one()`` to modify the inserted document, the driver runs the 
       insert operation first.

   * - Writes follow reads
     - If a write operation must follow other read operations, the driver runs
       the read operations first.

       For example, if you call ``find()`` to retrieve a document, then call
       ``delete_one()`` to delete the retrieved document, the driver runs the find
       operation first.

In a causally consistent session, MongoDB guarantees causal consistency between only the
following operations:

- Read operations that have a ``majority`` read concern
- Write operations that have a ``majority`` write concern

   To learn more about the concepts mentioned in this section, see the 
   following {+mdb-server+} manual entries:

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>` tutorial.

Methods
-------

After you start a session by using the ``start_session()`` method, you can manage 
the session state by using the following methods provided by the returned ``ClientSession``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``start_transaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on
         this session. Returns an error if there is already
         a transaction in progress for the session. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |
       | **Parameters**: ``read_concern``, ``write_concern``, ``read_preference``, ``max_commit_time_ms``
       | **Return Type**: ``ContextManager``

   * - ``abort_transaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or the
         transaction has been committed or ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |

   * - ``commit_transaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.

   * - ``with_transaction()``
     - | Starts a transaction on this session and runs ``callback`` once, then
         commits the transaction. In the event of an exception, this method may retry
         the commit or the entire transaction, which may invoke the callback multiple 
         times by a single call to ``with_transaction()``.
       |
       | **Parameters**: ``callback``, ``read_concern``, ``write_concern``, ``read_preference``, ``max_commit_time_ms``
       | **Return Value**: The result of the ``callback`` function

   * - ``end_session()``
     - | Finishes this session. If a transaction has started, this method aborts it.
         Returns an error if there is no active session to end.

A ``ClientSession`` also has methods to retrieve session
properties and modify mutable session properties. To learn more about these
methods, see the :ref:`API documentation <api-docs-transaction>`.

Example
-------

The following example shows how you can create a session, create a
transaction, and commit a multi-document insert operation through the
following steps:

1. Create a session from the client by using the ``start_session()`` method.
#. Use the ``with_transaction()`` method to start a transaction.
#. Insert multiple documents. The ``with_transaction()`` method runs the
   insert operation and commits the transaction. If any operation results in
   errors, ``with_transaction()`` cancels the transaction. This method
   ensures that the session closes properly when the block exits.
#. Close the connection to the server by using the ``client.close()`` method.

Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding
code:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction.py
         :start-after: start-transaction
         :end-before: end-transaction
         :language: python
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction-async.py
         :start-after: start-transaction
         :end-before: end-transaction
         :language: python
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

If you require more control over your transactions, you can use the ``start_transaction()``
method. You can use this method with the ``commit_transaction()`` and ``abort_transaction()``
methods described in the preceding section to manually manage the transaction lifecycle.

.. note:: Parallel Operations Not Supported

   {+driver-short+} does not support running parallel operations within a single transaction.

   If you're using {+mdb-server+} v8.0 or later, you can perform write operations on multiple
   namespaces within a single transaction by calling the ``bulk_write()`` method on a ``MongoClient``
   instance. For more information, see the :ref:`pymongo-bulk-write` guide.
