title: Install ``hmac`` and ``hashlib`` Python modules
stepnum: 1
ref: install-hmac-hashlib-modules
action:
  - pre: |
      Install these Python modules with ``easy_install``:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo easy_install hmac hashlib
  - pre: |
      Do not use ``pip`` to install modules when using Python 2.4 or 2.5,
      as there are some compatibility issues. Some users have reported
      problems installing ``hmac``, if ``easy_install`` produces an error
      or you suspect a problem with these libraries see
      :ref:`instructions for installing hmac manually <troubleshooting-hmac>`.
  - pre: |
      If ``easy_install`` produces an error when trying to install ``hmac``,
      or you see the following error in your agent logs, you will need to
      install the ``hmac`` package manually:
    language: none
    code: |
      AttributeError:'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'new'
  - pre: |
      To install the ``hmac`` package, begin by downloading the latest
      source package. The following example uses version ``20101005``.
      Issue the following command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/h/hmac/hmac-20101005.tar.gz
post: |
  Always download the latest version of ``hmac``, which
  you can find at the `hmac page on PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hmac>`_.
