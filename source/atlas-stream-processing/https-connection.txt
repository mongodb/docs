Add an HTTPS Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add an HTTPS connection to your {+SPI+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: create-https-connection-cli

      Creating an HTTPS connection to an {+SPI+} using the 
      {+atlas-cli+} is not currently supported.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: create-https-connection-ui

      Creating an HTTPS connection to an {+SPI+} using the 
      |service| UI is not currently supported.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: create-https-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for adding a 
      connection to a connection registry.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Connection </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>`

      If the API endpoint requires authentication, such as an API key or 
      Bearer Access Token authentication, you should add
      authentication details as headers when you define the connection to prevent
      providing these as plaintext as part of the :pipeline:`$https` operator.

      :gold:`Other authentication schemes, such as Digest Auth or OAuth, are not currently supported.`

      To learn how to use HTTPS connections with {+atlas-sp+}, see :ref:`<atlas-sp-agg-https>`.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl --user "<publicApiKey>:<privateApiKey>" --digest \
           --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
           --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2023-02-01+json" \
           --include \
           --data '{"name": "HTTPSConnection","type": "Https","url": "<apiBasePath>"}' \
           --request POST "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/<projectID>/streams/<tenantName>/connections"
