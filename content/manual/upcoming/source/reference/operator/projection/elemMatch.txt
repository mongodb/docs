Definition
----------

.. projection:: $elemMatch

  The :projection:`$elemMatch` operator limits the contents of an
  ``<array>`` field from the query results to contain only the **first**
  element matching the :projection:`$elemMatch` condition.

- You cannot specify a :query:`$text` query operator in an
  :projection:`$elemMatch`.


Examples
--------

The examples on the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator
assumes a collection ``schools`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    _id: 1,
    zipcode: "63109",
    students: [
                 { name: "john", school: 102, age: 10 },
                 { name: "jess", school: 102, age: 11 },
                 { name: "jeff", school: 108, age: 15 }
              ]
   }
   {
    _id: 2,
    zipcode: "63110",
    students: [
                 { name: "ajax", school: 100, age: 7 },
                 { name: "achilles", school: 100, age: 8 },
              ],
    athletics: [ "swimming", "basketball", "football" ]
   }
   {
    _id: 3,
    zipcode: "63109",
    students: [
                 { name: "ajax", school: 100, age: 7 },
                 { name: "achilles", school: 100, age: 8 },
              ],
    athletics: [ "baseball", "basketball", "soccer" ]
   }
   {
    _id: 4,
    zipcode: "63109",
    students: [
                 { name: "barney", school: 102, age: 7 },
                 { name: "ruth", school: 102, age: 16 },
              ]
   }

Zipcode Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation
queries for all documents where the value of the ``zipcode``
field is ``63109``. The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection
returns only the **first** matching element of the ``students``
array where the ``school`` field has a value of ``102``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.schools.find( { zipcode: "63109" },
                    { students: { $elemMatch: { school: 102 } } } )

The operation returns the following documents that have ``zipcode``
equal to ``63109`` and projects the ``students`` array using
:projection:`$elemMatch`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "students" : [ { "name" : "john", "school" : 102, "age" : 10 } ] }
   { "_id" : 3 }
   { "_id" : 4, "students" : [ { "name" : "barney", "school" : 102, "age" : 7 } ] }

- For the document with ``_id`` equal to ``1``, the ``students``
  array contains multiple elements with the ``school`` field
  equal to ``102``. However, the :projection:`$elemMatch`
  projection returns only the first matching element from the
  array.

- The document with ``_id`` equal to ``3`` does not contain the
  ``students`` field in the result since no element in its
  ``students`` array matched the :projection:`$elemMatch`
  condition.

:projection:`$elemMatch` with Multiple Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection can specify criteria on multiple
fields:

The following :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation
queries for all documents where the value of the ``zipcode``
field is ``63109``. The projection includes the **first**
matching element of the ``students`` array where the ``school``
field has a value of ``102`` **and** the ``age`` field is greater
than ``10``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.schools.find( { zipcode: "63109" },
                    { students: { $elemMatch: { school: 102, age: { $gt: 10} } } } )

The operation returns the three documents that have ``zipcode`` equal to ``63109``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "students" : [ { "name" : "jess", "school" : 102, "age" : 11 } ] }
   { "_id" : 3 }
   { "_id" : 4, "students" : [ { "name" : "ruth", "school" : 102, "age" : 16 } ] }

The document with ``_id`` equal to ``3`` does not contain the ``students`` field
since no array element matched the :projection:`$elemMatch` criteria.

The argument to :projection:`$elemMatch` matches elements of the array that
``$elemMatch`` is projecting. If you specify an equality with a field 
name to ``$elemMatch``, it attempts to match objects within the array.
For example, ``$elemMatch`` attempts to match objects, instead of scalar
values, within the array for the following in the projection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.schools.find( { zipcode: "63109" },
                    { athletics: { $elemMatch: { athletics: "basketball" } } })

To match scalar values, use the equality operator along with the scalar 
value that you want to match (``{$eq: <scalar value>}``). For example,
the following :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation queries for all
documents where the value of the ``zipcode`` field is ``63109``. The
projection includes the matching element of the ``athletics`` array
where the value is ``basketball``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.schools.find( { zipcode: "63109" },
                    { athletics: { $elemMatch: { $eq: "basketball" } } })

The operation returns the three documents that have ``zipcode`` equal to
``63109``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
      { _id : 1 },
      { _id: 3, athletics: [ 'basketball' ] },
      { _id : 4 }
   ]

The document with ``_id`` equal to ``3`` is the only document that
matched the :projection:`$elemMatch` criteria.
