=================
Find Slow Queries
=================

MongoDB includes the :ref:`database-profiler`, which can
identify slow queries and help you determine how to improve
query performance.

About This Task
---------------

Performance, Storage, and Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task uses the database profiler to identify slow queries on
a running :program:`mongod` instance. When enabled, the database
profiler can affect performance and disk usage and expose
unencrypted query data.

.. warning::

   Consider the performance, storage, and security implications
   before using the database profiler on a production
   deployment.

Atlas Query Profiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atlas users can take advantage of the Atlas Query Profiler to
identify slow queries with the convenience of visualization
through a scatterplot chart.

For more information, see :ref:`query-profiler`.

Slow Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A slow query is one that takes longer than a specified amount of
time to run. For this task, the slow query threshold is set to
100 milliseconds.

In some use cases, you may require queries run faster. In
others, you may need to raise the threshold to focus only on
those queries that are the slowest.

Choose a slow query threshold that reflects your specific
application and database needs.

Context
~~~~~~~

When enabled, the database profiler monitors queries at a
database-level only. If you need the profiler to monitor slow
queries on multiple databases, run the
:method:`db.setProfilingLevel` method on each database.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The database profiler is not available through
:program:`mongos`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Enable the database profiler.

      To enable the database profiler to monitor slow queries,
      use the :method:`db.setProfilingLevel` method:

      .. io-code-block:: 

         .. input::
            :language: js

            db.setProfilingLevel(1, 100)

         .. output::
            :language: js

            { was: 0, slowms: 1, sampleRate: 1, ok: 1}

      This sets the profiling level to ``1``, which monitors for
      slow queries, and defines a query as slow if it takes
      longer than 100 milliseconds to run.

   .. step:: Check for slow queries.

      To list any slow queries found by the database profiler,
      query the :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>`
      collection for relevant data:

      .. io-code-block:: 

         .. input::
            :language: js

            db.system.profile.find( { },
               {
                  command: 1,
                  millis: 1,
                  docsExamined: 1,
                  keysExamined: 1,
                  nreturned: 1
               }
            ).sort( { ts: -1 } )

         .. output::
            :language: js

            [
               {
                  command: {
                     find: 'people',
                     filter: { age: { '$gt': 35 } },
                     lsid: { id: UUID('ae3e9932-0a78-47ab-b741-01dd3bfb3563') },
                     '$db': 'contacts'
                  },
                  keysExamined: 0,
                  docsExamined: 100000,
                  nreturned: 40,
                  millis: 143
               }
            ]

      The command provides a list of slow queries observed by
      the database profiler. 

      The projection filters the return documents to include
      information that you may find useful in determining what
      caused the query to run slow.

      - If ``keysExamined`` is ``0``, it indicates that an index
        was not used by the query. To solve this, :ref:`create
        an index <manual-create-an-index>` on the collection.

      - If an index was used and ``docsExamined`` is much larger
        than ``nreturned``, it indicates an ineffectual index.
        You may need to update the index or create a new one on
        a field or fields used by the query filter.

      - If ``keysExamined`` is high and ``docsExamined`` is low,
        it indicates effective index use.

   .. step:: Explain the query.

      If the database profiler identifies a query that requires
      further investigation, use the
      :method:`~db.collection.explain` method to analyze the
      query plan and execution statistics.

      For details, see :ref:`manual-explain-slow-queries`.

   .. step:: Disable the database profiler.

      To ensure that the database profiler does not further
      disrupt performance, disable it when it's no longer
      needed:

      .. io-code-block:: 

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.setProfilingLevel(0)

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            { was: 1, slowms: 1, sampleRate: 1, ok: 1}

Examples
--------

Ignore Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To evaluate performance on a collection with an index, you can
set the query to ignore indexes using the :method:`hint( {
$natural: 1 } ) <cursor.hint>` method.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.listingsAndReviews.find( {
      $or: [
         { "address.market": "Berlin" },
         { "review_scores.review_scores_cleanliness": { $lt: 5 } }
      ],
      $where: function () {
         return this.amenities && this.amenities.length > 15;
      } 
   } ).sort( { description: 1 } ).hint( { $natural: 1 } );

You may find this useful in cases where you want to compare how
queries perform with a collection scan to that of an index scan.
