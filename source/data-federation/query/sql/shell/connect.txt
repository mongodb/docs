This page describes how to connect to a {+fdi+} through the `MongoDB Shell <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell>`__ (``mongosh``).

Prerequisites
-------------

- A {+fdi+} that is mapped to one or more data stores.

  .. include:: includes/data-federation/fact-asql-recommended-mongodb-version

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-federation.rst
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Connect` to open the {+fdi+} connection modal.

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Shell`.

   .. step:: Install the MongoDB Shell if you haven't already.

      If you do not have the MongoDB Shell installed:

      a. Select :guilabel:`I do not have the MongoDB Shell installed` inside the connection modal.
      
      #. Select your operating system from the modal dropdown menu.

      #. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system provided in the modal.

      #. *(Optional)* Confirm that your ``mongosh`` installation was successful.

         To check that your installation was successful, in your 
         terminal, run:

         .. code-block:: sh
            :copyable: true

            mongosh --version

         If the installation was successful, ``mongosh`` 
         displays a version.

      If you already have the MongoDB Shell installed:

      a. Select :guilabel:`I have the MongoDB Shell installed` inside the connection modal.

      #. Select ``mongosh`` from the modal dropdown menu.

         .. note::

            The MongoDB Shell, or ``mongosh``, is separate from 
            the ``mongo`` versions in the modal dropdown menu. 

         If you want to ensure that you have ``mongosh`` installed, 
         in your terminal, run:

         .. code-block:: sh
            :copyable: true

            mongosh --version

         If ``mongosh`` is installed, it displays a version.

   .. step:: Select your authentication method.

      Your authentication method depends on how your 
      database access is configured. To learn more about 
      database access, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

      You can choose:
     
      - :guilabel:`Password (SCRAM)`, or
      - :guilabel:`X.509`.

      {+adf+} provides a connection string for your authentication 
      method.

   .. step:: Copy and run your connection string.

      If you selected the :guilabel:`Password (SCRAM)` authentication 
      method, you are prompted for a password for the connecting user.

   .. step:: *(Optional)* Confirm the connection to your {+fdi+}.

      To confirm that you are connected to your {+fdi+}, using 
      ``mongosh``, run:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: true
            
         show dbs

      If you successfully connected to your {+fdi+} that is 
      mapped to a data store, ``mongosh`` displays the names of your 
      virtual databases.

Aggregation Syntax and Short-form Syntax
----------------------------------------

{+asql+} supports an aggregation pipeline stage syntax and a short-form syntax for constructing the SQL queries.
You can use either of these syntaxes to write queries in the MongoDB Shell.

Aggregation Pipeline Stage Syntax
``````````````````````````````````

You can use the ``$sql`` 
:manual:`aggregation </reference/command/aggregate>` pipeline stage to 
write {+asql+} queries. See :ref:`adf-sql-stage` for a list of 
properties you must provide to ``$sql``.

The following example uses ``$sql`` syntax to execute the {+asql+} statement ``select * from Users limit 2``:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: true

   db.aggregate( [ {
       $sql: {
          statement: "SELECT * 
                      FROM users 
                      LIMIT 2", 
          format: "jdbc", 
          dialect: "mongosql"
      } 
   } ] )

.. note::

   {+asql+} uses the dialect ``mongosql``.

.. _short-sql-syntax:

Short-form Syntax
``````````````````

You can use a short-form syntax, ``db.sql``, to supply an 
{+asql+} statement directly.

.. important::

   Short-form syntax is not stable and may change in the future.

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: true
   
   db.sql(`
     SELECT * 
     FROM users 
     LIMIT 2
   `);
