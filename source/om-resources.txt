:ref:`meko-om-arch`
  Review the |onprem| resource architecture.

:ref:`plan-om-resource`

  installation archives from a |k8s-pv| that you create for the |onprem|
  StatefulSet instead of from the Internet.

  that the |k8s-op-short| uses to manage your deployment.

:ref:`configure-kmip-backup-encryption`
