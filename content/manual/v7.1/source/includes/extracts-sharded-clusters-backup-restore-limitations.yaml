   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   :red:`cannot` be part of a backup strategy for 4.2+ sharded clusters
   that have sharded transactions in progress, as backups created with
   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` *do not maintain* the atomicity guarantees
   of transactions across shards.

   For 4.2+ sharded clusters with in-progress sharded transactions, use
   one of the following coordinated backup and restore processes which
   *do maintain* the atomicity guarantees of transactions across shards:

   - `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server>`_,

   - `MongoDB Cloud Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?tck=docs_server>`_, or
   
   - `MongoDB Ops Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager?tck=docs_server>`_.
