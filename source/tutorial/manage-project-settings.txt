View/Modify Project Settings
----------------------------

Project settings apply to all the users in the project
[#user-settings]_. The :guilabel:`Project ID` displayed at the top of
the page is used by the Atlas |api|.

You can set the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Project`

     - Sets your project's name.

       .. note::

          Only a user with ``Owner`` role for the project or the
          ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's organization
          can edit the project name.

   * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

     - Sets your project's time zone. This does not affect the
       timezones set for individual user accounts. [#user-settings]_

   * - :guilabel:`Connect via Peering Only (GCP and Azure)`

     - Allows you to enable or disable connections between MongoDB Atlas dedicated clusters and 
       public |ipaddr| addresses outside of the peered |vpc|/VNet. You can only enable or
       disable this setting when there are no active dedicated GCP or Azure clusters in your
       Project.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.


   * - :guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time`

     - Set which hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
       maintenance on your cluster.

       If you toggle to :guilabel:`On`, click :icon:`pencil-alt` to set
       the :guilabel:`Maintenance Start Time`. |service| displays this
       time in the time zone you set in your :guilabel:`Profile`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-urgent-maintenance.rst

       When maintenance is required, |service|:

       - Displays a banner in your cluster list showing the date and
         time when the maintenance is scheduled.
       
       - Sends a notification email to all users in the project 72 hours
         before the scheduled maintenance.

       With this information, you can choose one of three options:

       1. Do nothing. The maintenance occurs during your scheduled
          maintenance window.
       2. :guilabel:`Begin Maintenance Now`. The scheduled maintenance
          starts immediately. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it in a 
          separate modal.
       3. :guilabel:`Defer Maintenance for One Week`. The scheduled
          maintenance starts during your preferred maintenance window
          one week after the given scheduled maintenance date and
          time. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it
          in a separate modal.
