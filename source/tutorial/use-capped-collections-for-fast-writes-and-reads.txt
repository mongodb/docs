Use Capped Collections for Fast Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`/core/capped-collections` are circular, fixed-size collections
that keep documents well-ordered, even without the use of an
index. This means that capped collections can receive very high-speed
writes and sequential reads.

These collections are particularly useful for keeping log files but are
not limited to that purpose. Use capped collections where appropriate.

Use Natural Order for Fast Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return documents in the order they exist on disk, return sorted
operations using the :operator:`$natural` operator. On a capped
collection, this also returns the documents in the order in which they
were written.

:term:`Natural
order <natural order>` does not use indexes but can be fast for
operations when you want to select the first or last items on
disk.
