Open a Change Stream
--------------------

You can keep track of changes to data in MongoDB, such as changes to a
collection, database, or deployment, by opening a :manual:`Change
Stream</changeStreams/>`. A ``Change Stream`` allows applications to
watch for changes to data and react to those changes. You can open a
``Change Stream`` by calling the :node-api:`Collection.watch()
</Collection.html#watch>`, :node-api:`Db.watch() </Db.html#watch>`, or
:node-api:`MongoClient.watch()</MongoClient.html#watch>`  method.

The ``watch()`` method  optionally takes a :manual:`pipeline
</reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>`, an array of
:manual:`stages </changeStreams/#modify-change-stream-output>`, as the
first parameter to filter the :manual:`change events
</reference/change-events/>` output. Also, ``watch()`` can take an
additional options object as the second parameter. Set the
``fullDocument`` field of the additional options object to the string 
``"updateLookup"`` to receive an event that contains the changes to the
document as well as the entire altered document. Alternatively, you can
set ``fullDocument`` to the string ``"default"`` to only receive the
altered document, but not the changes to the document. 

Process the Change Stream Events
--------------------------------

You can capture events from a ``Change Stream`` instance by using a listener
function. Call the ``watch()`` command to get a ``Change Stream`` instance. Add
your listener function by calling the `EventEmitter.on()
<https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener>`_
method on that instance. Set the value of the first parameter to the
string ``'change'`` and add your :mdn:`callback function
<Glossary/Callback_function>` as the second parameter.  The callback
triggers when a ``change event`` is emitted, providing the next available
document. You can specify logic in the callback to process the event
document when it is received. 

Call the :node-api:`close() </ChangeStream.html#close>` method on the
``Change Stream`` instance to stop processing ``change events``. This method
closes the ``Change Stream`` and frees resources.

Example
-------

The following example opens a ``Change Stream`` on the ``movies``
collection. We create a listener function to receive and print change
events that occur. 

To emit a ``change event``, we perform a change to the collection, such as
insertion with ``insertOne()``. To prevent ``insertOne()`` from
executing before the listener function can register, we create a timer
that uses :mdn:`setTimeout
<Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout>` to wait 1 second. When
you insert a document, the listener receives the corresponding event.

After that, we create a second timer to wait an additional second after
the insertion of the document to close the ``Change Stream`` instance
using ``changeStream.close()``.
