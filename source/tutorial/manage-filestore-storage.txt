This tutorial covers backing up your snapshots on file systems storage.

If you use file system snapshot storage and use multiple |onprem| instances
(including those activated as Backup Daemons), all |onprem| instances
must have the same view of the file system snapshot storage. You can achieve
this through a Network File System (NFS) application or something similar. If
the |onprem| instances do not share the same view of file
system snapshot storage, restores are not possible and |onprem|
cannot remove expired snapshots.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating any file system snapshot stores:

- Ensure a storage volume with sufficient capacity is attached to the |onprem|
  server to store the snapshot files and the oplog MongoDB database.

- :doc:`Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instance(s) 
  </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` to host the oplog stores for this 
  snapshot store.

- If you use multiple |onprem| instances (including those activated as
  additional Backup Daemons), set up a Network File System (NFS) application or
  something similar to ensure the all instances share the same view
  of file system snapshot storage.

Once created, file system stores are listed directly on the Snapshot Storage page in a table. Each row contains the settings for each File System Store.
