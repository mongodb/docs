|service-fullname| or |mms-full|?
---------------------------------

|service| offers a managed and simplified experience. |service| users
have access to a curated selection of configuration and infrastructure
options. The available |service| configuration and infrastructure
options may not provide the flexibility that some users require. For
example, |service| requires |tls| for cluster connectivity and does not
surface options for disabling |tls|. |service| suits users who want
fewer moving parts to manage, enabling developers and database
administrators to be more productive.

|mms-full| offers more control by exposing more configuration options
on the infrastructure of your choice. |mms| users have access to
advanced operations and a higher level of control, but must manage the
full lifecycle of their infrastructure. |mms| is best suited for users
who require a higher level of control over their MongoDB clusters.

For guidance on which MongoDB service best suits the needs of your
organization,
:contact:`contact MongoDB Support </atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`.

Can I bring an existing MongoDB deployment into |service-fullname| for management?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. However, you can upload data from existing MongoDB deployment into
|service-fullname|.

- You can use the :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>` feature
  in |service| to migrate from a source replica set to an |service|
  replica set cluster.

- You can use the :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import-sharded>`
  feature in |service| to migrate from a source sharded cluster to
  an |service| sharded cluster.

- You can use |mongomirror| to migrate data from an existing
  MongoDB replica set into |service-fullname|.

- You can use |mongodump| and |mongorestore| to seed |service-fullname|
  clusters from an existing standalone, replica set, and sharded
  cluster.

To learn more, see :doc:`/import`.

You can also write scripts using official MongoDB supported drivers to
upload data.

Can I migrate between regions?
------------------------------

Yes. You can change one or more regions for a given cluster within the
original cloud service provider for that cluster. Using a
rolling-migration strategy for moving nodes from the original region to
a new region, MongoDB |service| preserves cluster availability.

.. important:: AWS Only

   Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering
   connections are region-specific. Clusters utilizing an existing
   |vpc| peering connection to an |aws| |vpc| in a given |aws| region
   lose access to that peering connection if moved to a different |aws|
   region. The moved cluster may use an existing peering connection in
   the new region.

   .. seealso:: 
   
      :doc:`/security-vpc-peering`.

If you need to migrate data between regions on different cloud service
providers, you can:

- :doc:`Perform live migration </import/live-import>`, or

- :doc:`Migrate using mongomirror </import/mongomirror>`, or

- :doc:`Seed the destination cluster using mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`, or

- :doc:`Restore a backup from the source cluster to the destination cluster </import/mongorestore>`.

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`import-strategies`

Does |service| support cross-region deployments?
------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can specify additional regions for high availability or local
reads when :doc:`creating </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` or
:doc:`scaling </scale-cluster>` a deployment.

|service| *doesn't* support cross-cloud service provider deployments.

What AWS regions does |service| support?
----------------------------------------

|service| supports all |aws| regions other than those in China and
`US GovCloud <https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/>`__. To learn more,
see :doc:`/reference/amazon-aws`.

.. _can-i-pause-or-stop-cluster:

Can I pause or stop my |service| clusters?
------------------------------------------

You can pause an ``M10+`` paid cluster for up to 30 days at a time.
|service| automatically resumes the cluster after 30 days.

.. seealso:: :ref:`pause-cluster`.

.. _can-i-pre-split-chunks:

Can I pre-split chunks in a |service| sharded cluster?
------------------------------------------------------

The :atlasrole:`Atlas admin` database user role has the necessary
privileges to pre-split chunks in an empty sharded collection.

To learn more about sharded cluster chunk creation and management, see
:manual:`Create Chunks in a Sharded Cluster </tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>`.

.. _can-i-deploy-more-than-24-shards:
.. _can-i-deploy-more-than-50-shards:

Can |service-fullname| deploy clusters with more than 50 shards?
----------------------------------------------------------------

While |service-fullname| out of the box allows selection of up to 50
shards, customers interested in more than 50 shards should inquire with
MongoDB. Contact |mdb-support|.

.. _high-availability:

How does |service-fullname| deliver high availability?
------------------------------------------------------

|service| clusters use MongoDB's replication capability to deliver high
availability. All |service| clusters are either replica sets or sharded
clusters where each shard is a replica set. For complete documentation
on MongoDB replica sets and replication, see :manual:`Replication
</replication>`.

|service| uses a rolling upgrade strategy for executing maintenance
or infrastructure operations, such as applying security patches or
scaling up a |service| cluster. The rolling upgrade strategy ensures
that the cluster can process reads and writes for the majority of the
maintenance or infrastructure operation. During the rolling upgrade
procedure:

- |service| applies the changes to each secondary node in the cluster.
- |service| directs the primary node to step down to the secondary
  state and trigger an election of a new primary.
- Once the cluster has a new primary, |service| applies the changes to
  the former primary node.

Applications must hold write operations while the cluster elects a new
primary. The cluster can continue to process
:manual:`secondary read operations </core/read-preference>`
during this period. Elections on |service| clusters typically complete
within a few seconds. Factors such as network latency may extend the
time required for replica set elections to complete, which in turn
affects the amount of time your cluster may operate without a primary.
These factors are dependent on your particular cluster architecture.

.. include:: /includes/fact-retry-writes.rst

For ``M10+`` clusters, |service| provides a
:doc:`Test Failover </tutorial/test-failover>` feature for application
developers to check that their applications are designed to detect and
react appropriately to a replica set election. By designing
applications that can seamlessly handle a replica set election,
developers no longer have to worry about the underlying maintenance
occurring on their clusters.

|service| maintenance operations include OS patches and maintenance
patches for the MongoDB database itself (e.g. v3.6.3 to v3.6.4).
Infrastructure operations include repair operations required to replace
faulty infrastructure, and scheduled infrastructure replacements
such as changing the cluster tier.

Please :contact:`contact MongoDB Support </atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`
if you would like help architecting your application to use
|service-fullname| with optimal availability.

.. _analytics-nodes-overview:

What are Analytics Nodes?
-------------------------

*Available on M10+ clusters.*

Analytics nodes are specialized read-only nodes used to isolate
queries which you do not want to affect your operational workload.
They are useful for handling analytic data such as reporting queries
executed by :abbr:`BI (Business Intelligence)` tools.

Analytics nodes and :ref:`read-only nodes <deploy-read-only-replicas>`
are configured with distinct
:ref:`replica set tags <replica-set-tags>` that allow you to direct
queries to desired node types and regions. For details on the
pre-defined replica set tags implemented by |service|, see
:ref:`Atlas Replica Set Tags <replica-set-tags>`.

You can have up to 50 total nodes on a multi-region cluster.
Within that :manual:`limit </reference/limits/#Number-of-Members-of-a-Replica-Set>`
there's no maximum number of analytics nodes.

Analytics nodes cannot contribute to a cluster's availability because
they cannot participate in :term:`elections <election>`, or become the
:term:`primary` for their cluster.
