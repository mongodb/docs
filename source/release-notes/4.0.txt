Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
---------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

Since version 3.0, MongoDB has not supported the creation of
``MONGODB-CR`` users unless the deployment had been upgraded from a 2.6
or earlier deployment that already had ``MONGODB-CR`` users and had not
upgraded the authentication schema.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.



Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/4.0-compatibility`.
