.. dbcommand:: renameCollection

   Changes the name of an existing collection. Specify collection names
   to :dbcommand:`renameCollection` in the form of a complete
   :term:`namespace` (``<database>.<collection>``).

   Issue the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command against the
   :term:`admin database`.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { renameCollection: "<source_namespace>",
        to: "<target_namespace>",
        dropTarget: <true|false>,
        writeConcern: <document>,
        comment: <any> }

   The command contains the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``renameCollection``
   
        - string
   
        - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to rename. The namespace is a
          combination of the database name and the name of the collection.
   
      * - ``to``
   
        - string
   
        - The new namespace of the collection. If the new namespace specifies a
          different database, the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command copies
          the collection to the new database and drops the source collection.
          See :ref:`restrictions-on-db-names`.
   
      * - ``dropTarget``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. If ``true``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will drop the ``target`` of
          :dbcommand:`renameCollection` prior to renaming the collection. The
          default value is ``false``.
          
          
   
      * - ``writeConcern``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. A document that expresses the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
          for the operation. Omit to use the default write
          concern.
          
          .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-rename-collection.rst

Behavior
--------

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` is **not** compatible with sharded collections.

Existing Target Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` fails if ``target`` is the name of an existing
collection *and* you do not specify ``dropTarget: true``.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

:dbcommand:`renameCollection` has different performance implications depending
on the target :term:`namespace`.

If the target database is the same as the source database,
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` simply changes the namespace. This is a
quick operation.

If the target database differs from the source database,
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` copies all documents from the source
collection to the target collection. Depending on the size of the
collection, this may take longer to complete.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.2

If renaming a collection within the same database, 
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` obtains an exclusive lock on the
source and target collections for the duration of the operation. 
All subsequent operations on the collections must wait until
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` completes. 

Prior to MongoDB 4.2, renaming a collection within the same database
with :dbcommand:`renameCollection` required an exclusive database lock.

If renaming a collection between different databases, 
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` locking behavior depends on the MongoDB
version:

- For MongoDB 4.2.2 and later, :dbcommand:`renameCollection` obtains an
  exclusive (W) lock on the target database, an intent shared (r) lock
  on the source database, and a shared (S) lock on the 
  source collection. Subsequent operations on the target database
  must wait until :dbcommand:`renameCollection` releases the 
  exclusive database lock.

- For MongoDB 4.2.1 and earlier, :dbcommand:`renameCollection` obtains
  an exclusive (W) global lock. Subsequent operations on the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` must wait until :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
  releases the global lock.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

``local`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You cannot rename a collection from a replicated database to the
  ``local`` database, which is not replicated.

- You cannot rename a collection from the ``local`` database, which is
  not replicated, to a replicated database.

Open Cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command will invalidate open cursors
   which interrupts queries that are currently returning data.

Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :doc:`/changeStreams`, the
:method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` command create an
:ref:`change-event-invalidate` for any existing :doc:`/changeStreams`
opened on the source or target collection.

Interaction with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongodump` started with 
:option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` fails if a client issues the
:dbcommand:`renameCollection` command during the 
dump process. See :option:`mongodump.--oplog` for more information.

Example
-------

The following example renames a collection named ``orders`` in the
``test`` database to ``orders2014`` in the ``test`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { renameCollection: "test.orders", to: "test.orders2014" } )

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
:method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` helper for the command to
rename collections within the *same* database. The following is
equivalent to the previous example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test
   db.orders.renameCollection( "orders2014" )

Exceptions
----------

:exception 10026:
   Raised if the ``source`` namespace does not exist.

:exception 10027:
   Raised if the ``target`` namespace exists and ``dropTarget`` is
   either ``false`` or unspecified.

:exception 15967:
   Raised if the ``target`` namespace is an invalid collection
   name.
