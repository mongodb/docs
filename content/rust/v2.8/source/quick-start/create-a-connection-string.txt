Create a Connection String
==========================

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

To connect to an instance or deployment not hosted on Atlas, see
:ref:`Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB <rust-other-ways-to-connect>`.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <rust-quick-start-create-deployment>`,
      log in to your Atlas account and navigate to the :guilabel:`Clusters` 
      page under the :guilabel:`Database` section. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` 
      button for your new deployment.

      If you do not already have a database user configured, MongoDB will
      prompt you to create and configure a new user.

      Click the :guilabel:`Drivers` button under
      :guilabel:`Connect to your application` and select
      "Rust" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.

      Ensure the :guilabel:`View full code sample` option is deselected to
      view only the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your connection string.

      Click the copy icon on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard as shown in the following screenshot:

   .. step:: Update the password placeholder.

      Paste this connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<db_password>`` placeholder with your database user's
      password. The connection string is already populated with your database
      user's username.

      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.
