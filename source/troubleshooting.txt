Troubleshoot Local Atlas Deployment Issues
------------------------------------------

Local Machine Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the {+atlas-cli+} slows down to an unusable state after you create 
multiple local |service| deployments and load data, you might have 
reached the limits of your machine.

If you're working on Docker Desktop for `Windows <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/#resources>`__ 
or `MacOS <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#resources>`__, consider allocating 
more memory.

Docker Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-cli+} uses `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ for
``atlas deployments`` commands.

- For MacOS or Windows, install `Docker Desktop v4.31+ <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4310>`__. 
- For Linux, install `Docker Engine v27.0+ <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/27.0/>`__. 

If your local |service| deployment doesn't work, you might need to 
clean up your Docker environment and start fresh:

.. code-block::

   docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker system prune -a

Failed to Install or Update the AtlasCLI Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the {+atlas-cli+} plugin fails to install or update, make sure that you have 
access to the `GitHub API <https://docs.github.com/en/rest>`__, 
as GitHub API access is required to install or update the {+atlas-cli+} plugin. 

Run Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run into issues and with ``atlas deployments`` commands and need 
support, run the following command to provide detailed diagnostics:

.. code-block:: sh

   atlas deployments diagnostics <deploymentName> --output json > out.json

Command Errors
--------------

Error: missing credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that you either:

- Run ``atlas config init`` and add your API keys to your 
  :ref:`profile <config-toml-location>` or add your API keys to your
  :ref:`environment variables <atlas-cli-env-vars>`. If you created a
  profile with a custom name or are using more than one profile,
  specify the correct profile with the ``--profile`` flag.
- Run ``atlas auth login`` to authenticate using your |service| login
  credentials and an authentication token.

To learn more, see :ref:`connect-atlas-cli`.

atlas: command not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``atlas`` executable might be in a directory that isn't in your
$PATH. You can either add the directory to your $PATH, move the
executable to a directory which is in your $PATH, or run the executable
directly from its location.

400 (request "TENANT_ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY") The attribute pitEnabled is read-only for tenant clusters and cannot be changed by the user.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error might appear if you try to run :ref:`atlas-clusters-create`
with the ``--backup`` argument for a shared {+cluster+}. The
``--backup`` argument is unavailable for clusters smaller than ``M10``.

401 (request "Unauthorized") You are not authorized for this resource.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The credentials you provided aren't valid for the project
specified in your {+atlas-cli+} command. Check your public and private
key strings for accuracy.

If your credentials are stored in a :ref:`configuration file
<config-toml-location>`, make sure that the configuration file is in the
correct location. To learn more, see :ref:`config-toml-location`. If
the {+atlas-cli+} can't find your configuration file and you don't
store credentials in :ref:`environment variables <atlas-cli-env-vars>`,
a ``401`` error will result.

401 (request "Unauthorized") Current user is not authorized to perform this action.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user account or API key that you used to 
:ref:`connect to the {+atlas-cli+} <connect-atlas-cli>`
doesn't have permission to perform the requested action. User accounts
and API keys must have the appropriate :atlas:`user roles </reference/user-roles>`
to run {+atlas-cli+} commands. To assign or change a user's roles, see: 

- :atlas:`Manage Organization Users </access/manage-org-users/>`
- :atlas:`Manage Access to a Project </access/manage-project-access/>`
- :atlas:`API configuration </configure-api-access>`

401 (request "Unauthorized") The currently logged in user does not have the group creator role in organization <org-id>.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error might appear when trying to create a new 
:atlas:`project </tutorial/manage-projects/>`. The user account or API
key that you use to authenticate must have the 
``Organization Project Creator`` role at the 
:atlas:`organization level </tutorial/manage-organizations/>` in order
to create new projects.

403 (request "Forbidden") IP address <ip-address> is not allowed to access this resource.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user's IP address that you use to authenticate is not on
the :atlas:`access list </configure-api-access>` for the requested
project. Add your IP address to the :atlas:`access list 
</configure-api-access>` to run commands.

To learn more, see the following pages:

- For project access lists, see 
  :atlas:`Configure IP Access List Entries </security/ip-access-list/>`.

- For API key access lists, see 
  :atlas:`Get Started with the Atlas Administration API 
  </configure-api-access>`.

To add your IP address to an API key's access list:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Access Manager` page for your project.

      a. If it isn't already displayed, select the organization that
         contains your desired project from the :icon-mms:`office` 
         :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. Select your desired project from the list of projects in the 
         :guilabel:`Projects` page.

      #. Next to the :guilabel:`Projects` menu, expand the
         :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`Options` menu, then click 
         :guilabel:`Project Settings`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Access Manager` in the navigation bar.

   .. step:: Go to the API key's access list.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`API Keys` tab.

      #. Click :icon-mms:`ellipsis` to the right of the |api| Key.
  
      #. Click :guilabel:`Edit Permissions` and click :guilabel:`Next`.
      
   .. step:: Add your IP address to the API key's access list.

      a. Do one of the following tasks in the 
         :guilabel:`API Access List` section:

         - Click :guilabel:`Add Access List Entry` and type an |ipaddr| 
           address.

         - If your current host for accessing |service| will also make 
           |api| requests with this |api| key, click 
           :guilabel:`Use Current IP Address` .

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

404 (request "Not Found") An invalid group ID <group-id> was specified.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project ID entered with the command does not exist. Check your
project ID by navigating to the :guilabel:`Settings` sub-section of the
:guilabel:`Project` section in the |service| left-side navigation.

.. note:: 

   ``group ID`` and ``project ID`` are synonymous in MongoDB cloud services.

Alert Config Not Deleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This error might appear if the {+atlas-cli+} can't delete the alert
configuration specified by the ID. 

podman not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error appears if you try to run an ``atlas deployments`` command
inside our official docker container, ``mongodb/atlas`` in v1.26 or
later. Instead, follow the steps decribed in
:ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-docker`.

You should inspect past containers in your {+cluster+} with the
following command:

.. code-block::

   podman ps -a

Then, remove any that start with ``mongod`` or ``mongot`` with the
following command:

.. code-block::

   podman container rm -f -v <name or ID>

.. tip::

   You can safely uninstall podman if you're on MacOS.

   If you installed podman with homebrew, use this command to uninstall:

   .. code-block::

      brew uninstall podman

Configuration Errors
--------------------

Blank output when reading home directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error might appear if the {+atlas-cli+} can't access your home
directory.

HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH, or USERPROFILE are blank
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error might appear if the {+atlas-cli+} can't access your home
directory.
