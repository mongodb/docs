   :skill: Schema Design Patterns & Antipatterns
   :url: https://learn.mongodb.com/skills?openTab=data%20modeling

Your schema is the architecture of your cluster, including your
:term:`collections <collection>`, :term:`indexes <index>` and
:term:`documents <document>`. Consider schema design early in the 
development process.

Schema Design Patterns
----------------------

You can model your schema based on frequently used design patterns. The 
*Building with Patterns* blog series discusses the following frequently used design patterns.

Schema Suggestions
------------------

|service| offers two ways to detect common
schema design issues and suggests modifications that follow MongoDB's
best practices:

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` provides
  holistic schema recommendations for your cluster by sampling documents
  in your most active collections and collections with slow-running
  queries.

- The :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-dbs>` offers schema
  suggestions for a specific collection by sampling documents in that
  collection.

To learn more about how to apply the suggestions offered in either the
Performance Advisor or Data Explorer, refer to the following pages:

   * - Schema Improvement
     - Reason for Suggestion

   * - :ref:`embedded-documents-arrays-anti-pattern`
     - You are running too many :pipeline:`$lookup` operations on
       your data. Take advantage of MongoDB's rich schema model to
       embed related data in a single collection.

   * - :ref:`unbounded-arrays-anti-pattern`
     - Your documents contain array fields with many elements,
       which can degrade query performance.

   * - :ref:`indexes-anti-pattern`
     - You have unnecessary indexes in your collection, which can
       consume disk space and degrade write performance.

   * - :ref:`reduce-document-size-anti-pattern`
     - You have excessively large documents, which can degrade
       the performance of your most frequent queries.

   * - :ref:`too-many-namespaces-anti-pattern`
     - You have an exceedingly high number of collections in a
       database, which can result in unnecessary disk space usage.

   * - :ref:`regex-to-search`
     - You are executing queries that rely on inefficient regex 
       matching. Take advantage of :ref:`{+fts+} queries 
       <searching-ref>` that use the :pipeline:`$search` aggregation 
       pipeline stage.

Limitations of Schema Suggestions
---------------------------------

- Schema suggestions for a collection are partly driven by a random
  sampling of documents from that collection. Because this sampling is
  performed each time your schema is analyzed, you may see different
  suggestions at different times for the same collection.

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` monitors slow
  queries to recognize certain schema issues, namely too many
  :pipeline:`$lookup` operations and not utilizing an index for
  case-sensitive regex queries. If a cluster does not consistently
  receive long-running queries, the Performance Advisor may not suggest
  all potential improvements for that cluster, or may not show all
  reasons why an improvement is being suggested.

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` analyzes
  the 20 most active collections based on the output of the
  :dbcommand:`top` command. To see suggestions for a specific
  collection, view that collection in the
  :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-dbs>`.

- Neither :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` nor
  :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` provide schema suggestions for
  time series collections.
