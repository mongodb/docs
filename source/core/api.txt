Public |api| Principles
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: twocols

The |mms| Public |api| follows the |rest| architecture principles to
expose internal resources that provide programmatic access to |mms|'s
features.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/api-principles-pricing.rst

The |api| has the following features:

|json| entities
  All entities are expressed in |json|.

Key-based access
  Each |mms| user or application needing to connect to |mms|
  must
  :doc:`generate an API key </tutorial/configure-public-api-access>`
  before accessing the |mms| |api|.

Digest authentication
  To ensure that your :opsmgr:`public API key </reference/glossary/#std-term-Public-API-key>` is never sent over the
  network, |api| requests are authenticated using
  `HTTP Digest Authentication`_.

Browsable interface
  Using a consistent linking mechanism, you can browse the entire API
  by starting at the root resource and following links to related
  resources.

User Access Control
  Each |mms| user's |api| capabilities match the permissions that
  their :doc:`/reference/user-roles` grant.

  .. example::

     A user with the :authrole:`Project Read Only` role cannot modify
     any resource within that project whether through the |mms| UI or
     the |api|.

|api| Network Access List
  The |mms| |api| supports a per-user
  :ref:`API Access List <access-list-for-api-operations>` for restricting
  |api| access to specific |ipaddr| or |cidr| addresses. For |mms|
  users with a non-empty |api| access list, all |api| access must
  originate from an |ipaddr| address in the access list. An empty |api|
  access list grants access to all |api| endpoints from any |ipaddr|
  address, except those that explicitly require an address in an 
  access list.

.. COMMENT: For Ops Manager, the above sentence about |https| may not
   apply. It depends on their server configuration.

.. _HTTP Digest Authentication: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication

|http| Methods
--------------

All resources support a subset of these common |http| Methods:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Method
    - Purpose

  * - ``GET``
    - Retrieve the |json| representation of a resource.

  * - ``POST``
    - Create a new resource using the provided |json| representation.

  * - ``PUT``
    - Replace a resource with the provided |json| representation.

  * - ``PATCH``
    - Update the specified fields in a resource using the provided
      |json| representation.

  * - ``DELETE``
    - Remove a resource.

  * - ``HEAD``
    - Retrieve the response header without the |json| representation
      of the resource.

|json|
------

All entities are represented in |json|. The following rules for
requests and conventions of responses apply:

Request Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apply the Correct Content Type Header
  When sending |json| to the server via ``POST`` or ``PUT``, make sure
  to specify the correct content type request header:
  ``Content-Type: application/json``

Set Dates as |iso8601| Strings
  When sending dates to the server (as query parameters or fields in
  ``POST`` or ``PATCH`` request entities), use dates formatted
  according to the |iso8601| standard. If you don't specify a time
  zone, |mms| assumes |utc|. Include a time zone designator to avoid
  any ambiguity.

  .. example::

     - September 27, 2018 is expressed as ``2018-09-27``.

     - September 27, 2018 at 4:00 PM EDT is expressed (with time zone)
       as ``2018-09-27T16:00-04:00``.

  In some cases, a timestamp is returned as a |json| representation of
  a `BSON timestamp`_, most notably in the backup resources. This
  representation of a |bson| timestamp provides a |json| document as
  an object with two fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Field
       - Definition
     * - ``date``
       - Seconds since the UNIX Epoch
     * - ``increment``
       - An incrementing 32-bit integer ordinal for operations within
         a given second.

  .. example::

     The third operation at September 27, 2018 at 4:00 PM EDT is expressed (with time zone) as

     .. code-block:: json

        { date: 2018-09-27T16:00-04:00, increment: 3 }


Response Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rejects Invalid Fields
  Invalid fields are *rejected* rather than *ignored*.

  .. example::

     You attempt to create a new entity and misspell one of the
     fields, or if you attempt to update an existing entity and
     include a field that cannot be modified, the |mms| responds with
     an |http| 400 status code and an error message stating which
     field was invalid.

Returns Dates as |iso8601| Strings
  All dates are returned as |iso8601|\-formatted strings designated
  in |utc|.

Labels Field to Disambiguate Units
  Fields that contain numeric values in a particular unit are named so
  as to disambiguate the unit being used.

  .. example::

     A host's uptime is returned in millseconds, so the name of the
     host entity field is ``uptimeMsec``.

Returns Default Values for Fields without Other Values
  Fields that do not have a current value are returned with an
  appropriate default value.

  .. example::

     |mms| does not have any statistics for a newly discovered host,
     so any statistics-related fields have a value of zero.

  Fields that do not have a sensible default value are omitted from
  the entity.

  .. example::

     A host that is not using authentication omits the ``username``
     field from the returned entity.

Returns Fields in Alphabetical Order
  The fields in the |json| documents that the |application| returns are
  in alphabetical order. The order could change. Do not depend on the
  order of the fields.

.. _BSON timestamp: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/bson-types/#timestamps

.. _api-linking:

Linking
-------

Each resource includes one or more links to sub-resources and/or related resources.

.. example::

   A host has a link to the project it belongs to, the replica set it
   belongs to, and so on.

Links are placed in the ``links`` field of an entity, which is an
array of link relation objects. Each link relation has two fields:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Field
    - Definition

  * - ``rel``
    - Name (or type) of the relation. Many of these are
      considered Extension Relation Types and are prefixed by
      ``http://mms.mongodb.com``.

  * - ``href``
    - Target |url|.

All entities include at least one link relation called ``self``, which
is simply its own |url|. When an entity is part of a list (i.e., when
requesting all hosts in a project), then it only includes the ``self``
link relation.

.. example::

   This is a portion of a ``host`` resource with a few links:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:

      {
        "rel": "http://mms.mongodb.com/project",
        "href": "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx"
        "id": "xxx",
        "projectId": "yyy",
        "hostname": "mongodb.example.com",
        "port": 27017,
        "links": [
          {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "https://<ops-manager-host>/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx/hosts/yyy"
          },
          {
            "rel": "http://mms.mongodb.com/project",
            "href": "https://<ops-manager-host>/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx"
          }
        ]
      }

To learn more, see the `Web Linking Specification <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`_.

.. note::

   Although the
   `Web Linking Specification <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`_
   describes a format for including links in the |http| response
   headers, it is not required. To make the |api| easily browsable, it
   includes the links in the response body rather than in the response
   headers.

.. _api-lists:

Lists
-----

Some resources return a list of entities.

.. example::

   You can request a list of all **hosts** in a **project**.

When a list of entities is expected in a response, the results are
returned in batches bounded by two query parameters:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Field
    - Definition

  * - ``pageNum``
    - Page number (1-based). Defaults to 1 if not specified.

  * - ``itemsPerPage``
    - Number of items to return per page, up to a maximum of 500.
      Defaults to 100 if not specified.

The response entity contains three fields:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Field
    - Definition

  * - ``totalCount``
    - Total number of items in the entire result set.

      For example, if a project has a total of 57 hosts, and you make a request
      with ``pageNum=6`` and ``itemsPerPage=10``, then
      ``totalCount`` is **57**.

  * - ``results``
    - Result set, which is an array of entity documents.

  * - ``links``
    - Contains one to three link relations:

      - ``previous`` for the previous page of results
        (omitted for the first page);
      - ``next`` for the next page of results
        (omitted for the last page);
      - ``self`` for the current page (always present).

If you make a request for a list of entities and there are no results,
then the |api| responds with an |http| 200 status code and an empty
``results`` array. It does *not* respond with a 404 in this case,
since the list of entities may not be empty at some point in the
future.

If you had requested a list of entities in a context that does not
exist (i.e., the list of hosts for a non-existent project), then this
results in a an |http| 404 response status.

.. example::

   This is an |http| response for the second page of 10 hosts in a
   project with a total of 57 hosts:

   .. code-block:: json
      :linenos:

      {

        "totalCount": 57,
        "results": [
          {
            "id": "yyy",
            "projectId": "xxx",
            // additional host properties...
          },
          // additional host documents...
        ],
        "links": [
          {
            "rel" : "self",
            "href" : "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx/hosts?pageNum=2&itemsPerPage=10"
          },
          {
            "rel": "previous",
            "href": "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx/hosts?itemsPerPage=10&pageNum=1"
          },
          {
            "rel": "next",
            "href": "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/projects/xxx/hosts?itemsPerPage=10&pageNum=3"
          }
        ]
      }

.. _api-envelope:

Envelopes
---------

Some clients may not be able to access the |http| response headers
and/or status code. In that case, you can request that the response
include an ``envelope``, which is simply an extra layer of information
in the |json| document that contains any relevant details that would
normally be in the response headers.

By default, the |api| does *not* include the response in an envelope.
To request one, simply add the query parameter ``envelope=true``.

For responses that contain a single entity, the envelope contains two
fields:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Field
    - Definition

  * - ``status``
    - |http| status code.

  * - ``content``
    - Requested entity.

For responses that contain a list of entities, there is already an
envelope that wraps the results, so specifying ``envelope=true`` as a
query parameter in this case only adds the ``status`` field to the
existing envelope.

Pretty Printing
---------------

By default, extraneous whitespace is stripped from the |json| that
|mms| returns. To ask for pretty-printed |json|, simply append the
``pretty=true`` query parameter to any request:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl --user '{USERNAME}:{APIKEY}' --digest \
   --header 'Accept: application/json' \
   --include \
   --request GET "{opsManagerHost}:{Port}/api/public/v1.0?pretty=true"

.. note::

   All the examples in this document show pretty-printed |json| for
   clarity, although some example |url|\s *may not contain this
   additional query parameter*.

Response Codes
--------------

Responses utilize the standard |http| response codes, including:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 5 20 75
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Code
    - Meaning
    - Notes

  * - 200
    - OK
    - The request was successful. This is the typical response to a
      successful ``GET`` request.

  * - 201
    - Created
    - A new resource was created. This is the typical response to a
      successful ``POST`` request.

  * - 202
    - Accepted
    - A request for an asynchronous operation was accepted.

  * - 400
    - Bad Request
    - Something was wrong with the client request.

  * - 401
    - Unauthorized
    - Authentication is required but was not present in the request.
      Typically this means that the digest authentication information
      was omitted from the request, the provided credentials are
      incorrect, or the user associated with the given |api| key is
      not allowed to access the requested resource.

  * - 403
    - Forbidden
    - Access to the specified resource is not permitted.

  * - 404
    - Not Found
    - The requested resource does not exist.

  * - 405
    - Method Not Allowed
    - The |http| method is not supported for the specified resource.
      Keep in mind that each resource may only support a subset of
      |http| methods.

      For example, you are not allowed to ``DELETE`` the
      :doc:`root </reference/api/root>` resource.

  * - 409
    - Conflict
    - This is typically the response to a request to create or modify
      a property of an entity that is unique when an existing entity
      already exists with the same value for that property.

      For example, if you attempt to
      :doc:`create a project </reference/api/groups/create-one-group>`
      with the same name as an existing project, the request fails.

  * - 5xx
    - Various server errors
    - Something unexpected went wrong. Try again later and consider
      notifying |mms| Support.

Errors
------

When a request results in an error, the response body contains a |json|
document with additional details about what went wrong. The document
contains five fields:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 15 10 75
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Field
    - Data Type
    - Definition

  * - ``detail``
    - string
    - Human-readable description of the |api| request error.

  * - ``error``
    - integer
    - |http| :rfc:`status code <2616#section-6.1.1>`.

  * - ``errorCode``
    - string
    - Named constant representing the |api| request error as shown in
      :ref:`api-error-codes`.

  * - ``parameters``
    - array of strings
    - List of parameters passed in the |api| request.

  * - ``reason``
    - string
    - |http| :rfc:`status code definition <2616#section-6.1.1>`.

.. example::

   |mms| returns this response body for an incorrectly formatted
   request:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
      :linenos:

      {
        "detail" : "Cannot find resource /api/public/v1.0/softwareComponents/version.",
        "error" : 404,
        "errorCode" : "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
        "parameters" : [ "/api/public/v1.0/softwareComponents/version" ],
        "reason" : "Not Found"
      }

To review the list of codes, see :doc:`/reference/api-error-codes`.

Authentication
--------------

As previously mentioned, the |mms| |api| uses |http| Digest
Authentication. The details of digest authentication are beyond the
scope of this document, but it essentially requires a username and a
password which are hashed using a unique server-generated value called
a **nonce**. The username is the username of a registered |mms|
account, and the password is a :opsmgr:`public API key </reference/glossary/#std-term-Public-API-key>` associated
with that account.

Keep the following points in mind:

- The server-generated nonce is used by the client to hash the
  username and password before sending them back to the server to
  authenticate a request. The nonce is only valid for a short amount
  of time as per the digest authentication specification. This is to
  prevent replay attacks, so you cannot cache a nonce and use it
  forever.

- Some resource methods require even more security and are additionally
  protected by :ref:`access lists <access-list-for-api-operations>`
  that allow access to the resource only from the |ipaddr| addresses
  listed. Each user configures their own access list of |ipaddr|
  addresses that allow access to the resource.

- The |application| has a concept of **roles**, which allow more
  fine-grained control of the operations a user is allowed to perform.
  The |api| resources also enforce the same authorization rules, so
  the resources and methods that can be accessed by an |api| key are
  governed by the roles granted to the associated user.

  .. example::

     To ``DELETE`` a host, the user that owns the |api| key used to
     make the request must be a :authrole:`Project Monitoring Admin`
     or :authrole:`Project Owner` in the project to which the host
     belongs.

- Many resources are tied to a project (former known as a *group*),
  as evidenced by |url|\s of the following form:

  .. code-block:: shell

     /api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/

  For these resources, the user tied to the |api| key must be a
  member of the project *or* must be assigned to one of the
  ``GLOBAL`` roles. Otherwise |application| responds with an |http|
  401 error.

.. _api-automation:

Automation
----------

The :doc:`/reference/api/automation-config` and
:doc:`/reference/api/automation-status` resources provide endpoints
that let you modify a project's deployment and retrieve deployment
status. You can modify a deployment by sending a new
:doc:`automation configuration </reference/cluster-configuration>` to
|mms|. The automation configuration is where you describe and
configure the MongoDB processes to be deployed. |mms| refers to this
as the deployment's "goal state." When you submit a new automation
configuration through the |api|, the {+aagent+}s adjust the
current state of the system to match the goal state.

.. important::

   There is no protection in the |api| to prevent concurrent
   modifications. If two administrators both start with a
   configuration based on the current version, make their own
   modifications, and then submit their modifications, the later
   modification wins.

Additional Information
----------------------

See :doc:`/reference/api` for a complete reference
of all resources available in the |mms| Public |api|.
