.. pipeline:: $currentOp

   Returns a stream of documents containing information on active
   and/or dormant operations as well as inactive sessions that are
   holding locks as part of a transaction. The stage returns a document
   for each operation or session. To run :pipeline:`$currentOp`, use
   the :method:`db.aggregate()` helper on the ``admin`` database.

   The :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage is preferred over the
   :dbcommand:`currentOp` command and its :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   helper :method:`db.currentOp()`. Because :dbcommand:`currentOp`
   command and :method:`db.currentOp()` helper returns the results in a
   single document, the total size of the :dbcommand:`currentOp` result
   set is subject to the maximum 16MB BSON size limit for documents.
   The :pipeline:`$currentOp` stage returns a cursor over a stream of
   documents, each of which reports a single operation. Each operation
   document is subject to the 16MB BSON limit, but unlike the
   :dbcommand:`currentOp` command, there is no limit on the overall
   size of the result set.

   :pipeline:`$currentOp` also enables you to perform arbitrary
   transformations of the results as the documents pass through the
   pipeline.

   :pipeline:`$currentOp` takes an options document as its operand:

   .. versionchanged:: 4.2

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $currentOp: { allUsers: <boolean>, idleConnections: <boolean>, idleCursors: <boolean>, idleSessions: <boolean>, localOps: <boolean> } }

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Option
        - Description

      * - ``allUsers``

        - Boolean. If set to ``false``, :pipeline:`$currentOp` will
          only report on operations/idle connections/idle cursors/idle
          sessions belonging to the user who ran the command. If set to
          ``true``, :pipeline:`$currentOp` will report operations
          belonging to all users.

          .. note::

             For standalone and replica sets that enforce access control,
             ``inprog`` privilege is required if ``allUsers: true``.
   
             For sharded clusters that enforce access control, the ``inprog``
             privilege is required to run :pipeline:`$currentOp`.
             
          Defaults to ``false``.

      * - ``idleConnections``
        - Boolean. If set to ``false``, :pipeline:`$currentOp` will
          only report active operations. If set to ``true``, all
          operations including idle connections will be returned.

          Defaults to ``false``.

      * - ``idleCursors``

        - Boolean. 

          If set to ``true``, :pipeline:`$currentOp` will report on
          cursors that are "idle"; i.e. open but not currently active
          in a :dbcommand:`getMore` operation.

          Information on idle cursors have the :data:`~$currentOp.type`
          set to ``"idleCursor"``.

          Information on cursors currently active in a
          :dbcommand:`getMore` operation information have the
          :data:`~$currentOp.type` set to ``"op"`` and
          :data:`~$currentOp.op` set to ``getmore``.

          Defaults to ``false``.

          .. versionadded:: 4.2

      * - ``idleSessions``

        - Boolean. If set to ``true``, then in addition to reporting on
          the active/dormant operations, :pipeline:`$currentOp` returns
          information on inactive sessions that are holding locks as part
          of a transaction. Each inactive session will appear as a
          separate document in the ``$currentOp`` stream.

          The document for a session includes information on the
          session id in the :data:`~$currentOp.lsid` field and the
          transaction in the :data:`~$currentOp.transaction` field.

          Starting in MongoDB 4.2, information on idle sessions have
          the :data:`~$currentOp.type` set to ``"idleSession"``.

          If set to ``false``, :pipeline:`$currentOp` will not report on
          inactive sessions.

          Defaults to ``true``.

          .. versionadded:: 4.0

      * - ``localOps``

        - Boolean. If set to ``true`` for an aggregation running on
          :binary:`~bin.mongos`, :pipeline:`$currentOp` reports only
          those operations running locally on that
          :binary:`~bin.mongos`. If ``false``, then the
          :pipeline:`$currentOp` will instead report operations running
          on the shards.

          The ``localOps`` parameter has no effect for
          :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregations running on
          :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

          Defaults to ``false``.

          .. versionadded:: 4.0

   Omitting any of the above parameters will cause $currentOp to use
   that parameter's default value. Specify an empty document, as shown
   below, to use the default values of all parameters.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $currentOp: { } }

Constraints
-----------

- :pipeline:`$currentOp` must be the first stage in the pipeline.

- Pipelines that start with :pipeline:`$currentOp` can only be run on
  the ``admin`` database.

- On a standalone or replica set with authentication enabled, the
  ``inprog`` privilege is required to run :pipeline:`$currentOp` if
  the ``allUsers`` parameter is set to `true`.

- On a sharded cluster, the ``inprog`` privilege is required to run
  all :pipeline:`$currentOp` pipelines.

- :pipeline:`$currentOp` is not allowed in :doc:`transactions
  </core/transactions>`.


Example
-------

The following example runs the :pipeline:`$currentOp` operation in the
first stage and filters the results of that operation in the second
stage. Specifically, the first stage returns documents for all active
operations as well as inactive sessions that are holding locks as part
of a transaction. The second stage filters for just those documents
related to inactive sessions that are holding locks as part of a
transaction.

.. tip::

   For standalone and replica sets that enforce access control,
   ``inprog`` privilege is required if ``allUsers: true``.
   
   For sharded clusters that enforce access control, the ``inprog``
   privilege is required to run :pipeline:`$currentOp`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("admin").aggregate( [
      { $currentOp : { allUsers: true, idleSessions: true } },
      { $match : { active: false, transaction : { $exists: true } } }
   ] )

Starting in version 4.2, you can use :data:`$currentOp.type` to specify
an equivalent filter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.aggregate( [ 
      { $currentOp : { allUsers: true, idleSessions: true } },
      { $match : { type: "idleSession" } }
   ] )

Both operations return documents of the form:

      "host" : "example.mongodb.com:27017",

Each output document may contain a subset of the following fields as
relevant for the operation:

.. data:: $currentOp.type

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

   The type of operation. Values are either:

   - ``op``
   - ``idleSession``
   - ``idleCursor``

   If the :data:`$currentOp.type` is ``op``, :data:`$currentOp.op`
   provides details on the specific operation.

.. data:: $currentOp.host

   The name of the host against which the operation is run.

.. data:: $currentOp.shard

   The name of the shard where the operation is running.

   Only present for sharded clusters.

   An identifier for the connection where the specific operation
   originated.

.. data:: $currentOp.client

   The IP address (or hostname) and the ephemeral port of the client
   connection where the operation originates.

   For multi-document transactions, :data:`$currentOp.client` stores
   information about the most recent client to run an operation inside
   the transaction.

   *For standalones and replica sets only*

.. data:: $currentOp.client_s

   The IP address (or hostname) and the ephemeral port of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` where the operation originates.

   *For sharded clusters only*

.. data:: $currentOp.clientMetadata

   Additional information on the client.

   For multi-document transactions, :data:`$currentOp.client` stores
   information about the most recent client to run an operation inside
   the transaction.

.. data:: $currentOp.appName

   A boolean value specifying whether the operation has started. Value
   is ``true`` if the operation has started or ``false`` if the
   operation is idle, such as an idle connection, an inactive session, or
   an internal thread that is currently idle. An operation can be
   active even if the operation has yielded to another operation.

.. data:: $currentOp.currentOpTime

   The start time of the operation.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

.. data:: $currentOp.effectiveUsers

   the :data:`effectiveUser(s)<$currentOp.effectiveUsers>` for the
   operation. The user impersonator document contains the ``user`` name
   and the authentication ``db``. In general, the impersonating user is
   the ``__system`` user; e.g.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      "userImpersonators" : [
         {

.. data:: $currentOp.command

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/command-field-currentOp.rst

.. data:: $currentOp.cursor

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

   A document that contains the cursor information for ``idleCursor``
   and ``getmore`` operations; i.e. where :data:`~currentOp.type` is
   ``idleCursor`` or :data:`~currentOp.op` is ``getmore``.

   If reporting on a ``getmore`` operation before the ``getmore`` has
   accessed its cursor information, the :data:`~currentOp.cursor` field
   is not available.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.cursorId

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The id of the cursor.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.createdDate

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.lastAccessDate

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The date and time when the cursor was last used.
      
      If the cursor is actively in use (i.e. :data:`~currentOp.op` is
      ``getmore`` and the :data:`~currentOp.type` is not
      ``idleCursor``), then :data:`~$currentOp.cursor.lastAccessDate`
      reports either the time the previous ``getmore`` ended
      or the time the cursor was created if this is the first
      ``getmore``.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.nDocsReturned

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The cumulative number of documents returned by the cursor.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.nBatchesReturned

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The curmulative number of batches returned by the cursor.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.noCursorTimeout

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The flag that indicates that the cursor will not timeout when idle;
      i.e. if the cursor has the ``noTimeout`` option set.

      - If true, the cursor does not time out when idle.

      - If false, the cursor will time out when idle.

      .. seealso:: :method:`cursor.addOption()`

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.tailable

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The flag that indicates if the cursor is a :doc:`tailable cursor
      </core/tailable-cursors>` for a capped collection. Tailable cursors
      remain open after the client exhausts the results in the initial
      cursor.

      .. seealso::

         - :dbcommand:`find`
         - :method:`cursor.tailable()`
         - :method:`cursor.addOption()`

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.awaitData

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The flag that indicates whether the :doc:`tailable cursor
      </core/tailable-cursors>` should temporarily block a
      :dbcommand:`getMore` command on the cursor while waiting for new
      data rather than returning no data.

      For non-tailable cursors, the value is always false.

      .. seealso::

         - :dbcommand:`find`
         - :method:`cursor.tailable()`
         - :method:`cursor.addOption()`

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.originatingCommand

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The ``originatingCommand`` field contains the full command object
      (e.g. ``find`` or ``aggregate``) which originally created the
      cursor.

      .. note::

         Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB now returns
         ``originatingCommand`` field as a nested field in the new
         ``cursor`` field. In previous versions, the
         ``originatingCommand`` was a top-level field for the associated
         ``"getmore"`` document.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.planSummary

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      A string that specifies whether the cursor uses a collection scan
      (``COLLSCAN``) or an index scan (``IXSCAN { ... }``).

      The ``IXSCAN`` also includes the specification document of the index
      used.

      Not available when running with ``localOps: true`` on
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` or when reporting on ``idleCursors``.

   .. data:: $currentOp.cursor.operationUsingCursorId

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      The ``opid`` of the operation using the cursor.

      Only present if the cursor is not idle.

.. data:: $currentOp.planSummary

   A string that specifies whether the cursor uses a collection scan
   (``COLLSCAN``) or an index scan (``IXSCAN { ... }``).

   Not available when running with ``localOps: true`` on
   :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

.. data:: $currentOp.numYields

   :data:`~$currentOp.numYields` is a counter that reports the number of times the
   operation has yielded to allow other operations to complete.

   Typically, operations yield when they need access to data that
   MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete quickly
   while MongoDB reads in data for the yielding operation.

.. data:: $currentOp.locks

   The :data:`~$currentOp.locks` document reports the type and mode of
   locks the operation currently holds. The possible lock types are as
   follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-types.rst

   The possible modes are as follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

.. data:: $currentOp.waitingForLock

   Returns a boolean value. :data:`~$currentOp.waitingForLock` is ``true`` if the
   operation is waiting for a lock and ``false`` if the operation has
   the required lock.

.. data:: $currentOp.msg

   The :data:`~$currentOp.msg` provides a message that describes the status and
   progress of the operation. In the case of indexing or mapReduce
   operations, the field reports the completion percentage.

.. data:: $currentOp.progress

   Reports on the progress of mapReduce or indexing operations. The
   :data:`~$currentOp.progress` fields corresponds to the completion percentage in
   the :data:`~$currentOp.msg` field. The :data:`~$currentOp.progress` specifies the following
   information:

   .. data:: $currentOp.progress.done

      Reports the number of work items completed.

   .. data:: $currentOp.progress.total

      Reports the total number of work items.

.. data:: $currentOp.killPending

   Returns ``true`` if the operation is currently flagged for
   termination.  When the operation encounters its next safe termination point, the
   operation will terminate.

.. data:: $currentOp.lockStats

   For each lock type and mode (see :data:`$currentOp.locks` for
   descriptions of lock types and modes), returns the following
   information:

   .. data:: $currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount

      Number of times the operation acquired the lock in the specified
      mode.

   .. data:: $currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount

      Number of times the operation had to wait for the
      :data:`~$currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount` lock acquisitions
      because the locks were held in a conflicting mode.
      :data:`~$currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` is less than or
      equal to :data:`~$currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount`.

   .. data:: $currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      Cumulative time in microseconds that the operation had to wait to
      acquire the locks.

      :data:`~$currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros` divided by
      :data:`~$currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` gives an
      approximate average wait time for the particular lock mode.

   .. data:: $currentOp.lockStats.deadlockCount

      Number of times the operation encountered deadlocks while waiting
      for lock acquisitions.
