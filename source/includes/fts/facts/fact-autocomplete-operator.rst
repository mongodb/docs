The ``autocomplete`` operator performs a search 
for a word or phrase that contains a sequence of characters from an 
incomplete input string. The fields that you intend to query with the 
``autocomplete`` operator must be indexed with the autocomplete data type 
in the collection's index definition. To learn how to configure your index for 
autocompletion, see :ref:`How to Index Fields for Autocompletion <bson-data-types-autocomplete>`.
