You can connect to your cluster in a variety of ways. This tutorial 
describes how to connect to your cluster using the 
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and :driver:`PyMongo driver </python/>`.

.. note::

   You must have a MongoDB user setup on your cluster to access your 
   deployment. For security purposes, |service| requires clients to 
   authenticate as MongoDB users to access clusters. 

.. _download-install:

Download and Install Utility
----------------------------

The following steps show you how to download and install the 
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver. 
Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to connect to 
your cluster:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: driver
       name: Driver (Python)
       content: |

         Tools Required
         --------------

         To complete this tutorial you must have:

         - A terminal.

         - `Python <https://www.python.org>`__.

         - The `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package
           installer. This comes prepackaged with the Python
           download.

         - The :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver.

         - A text editor.

         Install the PyMongo Driver
         --------------------------

         MongoDB drivers allow you to communicate with your MongoDB
         database programatically.
         
         For this tutorial, we will walk through setting up and using
         the Python MongoDB driver, called :guilabel:`PyMongo`. If you
         are interested in working with a different driver, refer to
         the :driver:`MongoDB Driver documentation </>`.

         .. admonition:: Prerequisites
            :class: note

            - To install :guilabel:`PyMongo`, you must have Python
              installed. Visit the
              `Python Downloads Page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
              and download the latest version of Python for your
              operating system.

            - You will also need the
              `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package
              installer. Python 2 ``>=2.7.9`` and Python 3
              ``>=3.4`` downloaded from https://python.org come with
              ``pip`` already installed. If you need to install ``pip``
              manually, refer to the `pip installation page
              <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__ for
              instructions.

         Once you have Python and ``pip`` installed:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-pymongo-test.rst

     - id: shell
       name: Mongo Shell
       content: |

         Tools Required
         --------------

         To complete this tutorial you must have:

         - A terminal

         - The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell

         Download and Install the Shell
         ------------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

         The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is an interactive
         command line interface to MongoDB. You can use the ``mongo``
         shell to insert and interact with data on your |service|
         cluster.

         |service| provides an easy way to download and install the
         ``mongo`` shell. To download and install the ``mongo`` shell:

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-shell-install.rst

.. _connect-to-your-cluster:

Connect to Your Atlas Cluster
-----------------------------

The following steps show you how to connect to your cluster using the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` Shell and PyMongo driver. Select the appropriate
tab based on how you would like to connect to your cluster:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: driver
       name: Driver (Python)
       content: |

         *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

         You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from
         |service| to connect to the cluster using the PyMongo driver.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-connect.rst

     - id: shell
       name: Mongo Shell
       content: |

         *Estimated completion time: 3 minutes* 

         Now that you have installed the ``mongo`` shell, you
         can use the shell to connect to your |service| cluster.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-shell-connect.rst
