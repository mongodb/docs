=====================================
Use Second Person and Imperative Mood
=====================================

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You
talk to users directly by using *second person*, addressing the user as
*you*. Second person promotes a friendly tone.

-  Use second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject
   *you* is understood) and active voice to eliminate wordiness and
   confusion about who or what initiates an action, especially in
   procedural steps.

   .. tip::

      All of the guidelines in this list, and most of the guidelines in
      the style guide, use second person, imperative mood, and active
      voice.

-  Use second person to avoid the use of gender-specific, third-person
   pronouns such as *he*, *she*, *his*, and *hers*. If you must use
   third person, use the pronouns *they* and *their*, but ensure that
   the noun that the pronoun refers to is plural.

-  Use first-person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These
   pronouns emphasize the writer or MongoDB rather than the user, so
   before you use them, consider whether second person or imperative
   mood would be more "user friendly."

   - Use *we recommend* rather than *it's recommended* or *MongoDB
     recommends*.
   - You can use *we* in the place of *MongoDB* if necessary.

-  Use the first-person singular pronoun *I* only in the question part
   of FAQs and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing
   their own actions or opinions.

-  Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. You can
   switch person in blog posts that use first-person singular but then
   switch to second person for instructional steps.

Avoid the Subjunctive Mood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subjunctive mood expresses doubt. *That doesn’t engender trust from
readers about our content!* Avoid words like “should” and “could”; they
imply uncertainty.
