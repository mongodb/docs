Overview
--------

Follow this tutorial to learn how to use a
**change data capture (CDC) handler** to replicate data with the {+connector+}.
A CDC handler is an application that translates CDC events into MongoDB
write operations. Use a CDC handler when you must reproduce the changes
in one datastore into another datastore.

In this tutorial, you configure and run MongoDB Kafka source and sink
connectors to make two MongoDB collections contain the same documents using
CDC. The source connector writes change stream data from the original
collection to a Kafka topic and the sink connector writes the Kafka topic
data to the target MongoDB collection.

If you want to learn more about how CDC handlers work, see the
:ref:`<sink-fundamentals-cdc-handler>` guide.

Replicate Data with a CDC Handler
---------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Complete the Tutorial Setup

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/setup.rst

   .. step:: Start Interactive Shells

      Start two interactive shells on the Docker container in separate
      windows. In the tutorial, you can use the shells to run and observe
      different tasks.

      Run the following command from a terminal to start an interactive shell.

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      We will refer to this interactive shell as **CDCShell1** throughout this tutorial.

      Run the following command in a second terminal to start an interactive shell:

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      We will refer to this interactive shell as **CDCShell2** throughout this tutorial.

      Arrange the two windows on your screen to keep both of them visible to
      see real-time updates.

      Use **CDCShell1** to configure your connectors and monitor your Kafka
      topic. Use **CDCShell2** to perform write operations in MongoDB.

   .. step:: Configure the Source Connector

      In **CDCShell1**, configure a source connector to read from the
      ``CDCTutorial.Source`` MongoDB namespace and write to the
      ``CDCTutorial.Source`` Kafka topic.

      Create a configuration file called ``cdc-source.json`` using the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         nano cdc-source.json

      Paste the following configuration information into the file and save
      your changes:

      .. literalinclude :: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/cdc-source.json
         :language: json

      Run the following command in **CDCShell1** to start the source connector
      using the configuration file you created:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cx cdc-source.json

      .. note::

         The ``cx`` command is a custom script included in the tutorial
         development environment. This script runs the following
         equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new
         connector:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @cdc-source.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n"

      Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the
      connectors:

      .. code-block:: bash

         status

      If your source connector started successfully, you should see the
      following output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/output/status.out
         :language: text
         :copyable: false

   .. step:: Configure the Sink Connector

      In **CDCShell1**, configure a sink connector to copy data from the
      ``CDCTutorial.Source`` Kafka topic to ``CDCTutorial.Destination``
      MongoDB namespace.

      Create a configuration file called ``cdc-sink.json`` using the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         nano cdc-sink.json

      Paste the following configuration information into the file and save
      your changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/cdc-sink.json 
         :language: json

      Run the following command in the shell to start the sink connector
      using the configuration file you created:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cx cdc-sink.json

      Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the
      connectors:

      .. code-block:: bash

         status

      If your sink connector started successfully, you should see the
      following output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/output/status-2.out
         :language: text
         :copyable: false

   .. step:: Monitor the Kafka Topic

      In **CDCShell1**, monitor the Kafka topic for incoming events. Run the
      following command to start the ``kafkacat`` application which outputs
      data published to the topic:

      .. code-block:: bash

         kc CDCTutorial.Source

      .. note::

         The ``kc`` command is a custom script included in the tutorial
         development environment that calls the ``kafkacat`` application
         with options to connect to Kafka and format the output of the
         specified topic.

      Once started, you should see the following output that indicates there
      is currently no data to read:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         % Reached end of topic CDCTutorial.Source [0] at offset 0

   .. step:: Write Data into the Source and Watch the Data Flow

      In **CDCShell2**, connect to MongoDB using ``mongosh``, the MongoDB
      shell by running the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongosh "mongodb://mongo1"

      After you connect successfully, you should see the following
      MongoDB shell prompt:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false

         rs0 [direct: primary] test>

      At the prompt, type the following commands to insert a new document
      into the ``CDCTutorial.Source`` MongoDB namespace:

      .. code-block:: json

         use CDCTutorial
         db.Source.insertOne({ proclaim: "Hello World!" });

      Once MongoDB completes the insert command, you should receive an
      acknowledgment that resembles the following text:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
           acknowledged: true,
           insertedId: ObjectId("600b38ad...")
         }

      The source connector picks up the change and publishes it to the
      Kafka topic. You should see the following topic message in your
      **CDCShell1** window:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/output/document.json 
         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      The sink connector picks up the Kafka message and sinks the data
      into MongoDB. You can retrieve the document from the
      ``CDCTutorial.Destination`` namespace in MongoDB by running the
      following command in the MongoDB shell you started in **CDCShell2**:

      .. code-block:: json

         db.Destination.find()

      You should see the following document returned as the result:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         [
           {
             _id: ObjectId("600b38a..."),
             proclaim: 'Hello World'
           }
         ]

   .. step:: (Optional) Generate Additional Changes

      Try removing documents from the ``CDCTutorial.Source`` namespace
      by running the following command from the MongoDB shell:

      .. code-block:: json

         db.Source.deleteMany({})

      You should see the following topic message in your **CDCShell1**
      window:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/cdc-handler/output/document-2.json 
         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      Run the following command to retrieve the current number of documents
      in the collection:

      .. code-block:: json

         db.Destination.count()

      This returns the following output, indicating the collection is empty:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         0

      Run the following command to exit the MongoDB shell:

      .. code-block:: none

         exit

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you set up a source connector to capture changes to a
MongoDB collection and send them to Apache Kafka. You also configured a
sink connector with a MongoDB CDC Handler to move the data from Apache
Kafka to a MongoDB collection.
