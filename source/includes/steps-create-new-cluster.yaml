  Begin the cluster configuration process by choosing one of three
  cluster types: Starter, Single-Region, or Multi-Region. Each panel
  leads to a configuration page where you can customize your cluster
  to your specifications.

  Starter Clusters
    Starter clusters include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers. These
    low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are learning MongoDB
    or developing small proof-of-concept applications. You can begin your
    project with a starter cluster and upgrade to a production-ready tier
    at a future time.

  Single-Region Clusters
    Single-Region clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The ``M10``
    and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments and low-traffic
    applications, while higher tiers can handle large datasets and high-traffic
    applications. Single-Region clusters are deployed into a single
    geographical region, which reduces monthly costs but also reduces resilience
    in case of a regional network outage.

  Multi-Region Clusters
    Multi-Region clusters are deployed into multiple geographical regions,
    providing high availability and low latency for applications which are
    served worldwide. To deploy a :ref:`global cluster <global-clusters>`,
    toggle the :guilabel:`Global Clusters` switch to :guilabel:`On`.

  Select your preferred cluster preset and click :guilabel:`Create a Cluster`
  to customize the cluster configuration prior to deployment. If you prefer
  to configure your cluster with no preset options, click :guilabel:`Advanced
  Configuration Options` in the lower-right corner of the screen.

title: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.
ref: config-cloud-provider-region
level: 3
content: |
  The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
  options for the available cluster tiers, network latency for clients
  accessing your cluster, the geographic location of the nodes in your
  cluster, and the :doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`.

  For details, see
  :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.

  From the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` section, you can also
  configure :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.
---
title: Select the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier`.
ref:  config-cluster-tier
level: 3
content: |
  The selected tier dictates the memory, storage, and |iops|
  specification for each data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the
  cluster.
