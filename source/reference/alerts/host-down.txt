=========
Host Down
=========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

At time ``T``, the Monitoring Agent on host ``X`` had not detected a :program:`mongod`
process running on host ``Y`` port ``Z`` for ``A`` minutes.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The :program:`mongod` process could not be reached because of a network issue.

- The :program:`mongod` process is not running.

- The host is powered off.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Verify network communication between the host running the Monitoring Agent and the
  host that is listed as down. One way to do this is through the :program:`mongo` shell:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     mongo <hostname:port>

  If connecting from the :program:`mongo` shell fails, try a basic ping
  test:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ping <hostname>

- Verify the :program:`mongod` process is running:

  If the process was installed from ``deb`` or ``rpm`` package, query the
  service manager for the status:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo service mongod status

  Alternatively, you can use ``ps``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     ps aux | grep mongo

Notes
-----

The ``Host Down`` alert should not be used to detect all occurrences of a
host rebooting. The alert is triggered only if the host is seen as down at
the instant that the Monitoring Agent runs the check. The interval between
checks can vary from 1 to 3 minutes.
