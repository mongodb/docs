The ``readConcern`` option allows you to control the consistency and
isolation properties of the data read from replica sets and replica set
shards.

Through the effective use of :doc:`write concerns
</reference/write-concern>` and read concerns, you can adjust the level
of consistency and availability guarantees as appropriate, such as
waiting for stronger consistency guarantees, or loosening consistency
requirements to provide higher availability.


MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 3.2 or later support specifying
read concern.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, replica sets and sharded clusters support
setting a global default read concern. Operations which do not 
specify an explicit read concern inherit the global default 
read concern settings. See :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` for 
more information.

.. _read-concern-levels:

Read Concern Levels
-------------------

The following read concern levels are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - :readconcern:`"local"`

     - The query returns data from the instance with no guarantee that
       the data has been written to a majority of the replica set
       members (i.e. may be rolled back).

       Default for:
          - reads against primary

          - reads against secondaries if the reads are
            associated with :ref:`causally consistent sessions <sessions>`. 

            .. note::

               Causally consistent client sessions only guarantee
               causal consistency if the associated read operations use
               :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern and the
               associated write operations use
               :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern.

       **Availability:** Read concern :readconcern:`local` is available
       for use with or without causally consistent sessions and
       transactions.

       For more information, see the :readconcern:`"local"` reference
       page.

   * - :readconcern:`"available"`

     - The query returns data from the instance with no guarantee
       that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set
       members (i.e. may be rolled back).

       **Default for:** reads against secondaries if the reads are :red:`not`
       associated with :ref:`causally consistent sessions <sessions>`.

       **Availability:** Read concern :readconcern:`available` is
       :red:`unavailable for use` with causally consistent sessions and
       transactions.

       For sharded clusters, :readconcern:`"available"` read concern
       provides the lowest latency reads possible among the various
       read concerns. However, this comes at the expense of consistency
       as :readconcern:`"available"` read concern can return
       :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` when reading from
       a sharded collection. To avoid the risk of returning orphaned
       documents when reading from sharded collections, use a different
       read concern such as read concern
       :readconcern:`"local"`. 

       For more information, see the :readconcern:`"available"`
       reference page.

       .. versionadded:: 3.6

   * - :readconcern:`"majority"`

     - The query returns the data that has been acknowledged by a
       majority of the replica set members. The documents returned by
       the read operation are durable, even in the event of failure.

       To fulfill read concern "majority", the replica set member
       returns data from its in-memory view of the data at the
       majority-commit point. As such, read concern
       :readconcern:`"majority"` is comparable in performance
       cost to other read concerns.

       Availability:
          - Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for use
            with or without causally consistent sessions and transactions.
            
          - You can disable read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` for
            a deployment with a three-member primary-secondary-arbiter
            (PSA) architecture; however, this has implications for
            change streams (in MongoDB 4.0 and earlier only) and
            transactions on sharded clusters. For more information, see
            :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.
       
       **Requirements:** To use :term:`read concern` level of
       :readconcern:`"majority"`, replica sets must use
       :ref:`WiredTiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.
 
       .. note::

          For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
          </core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides
          its guarantees only if the transaction commits with
          :ref:`write concern "majority" <transactions-write-concern>`.
          Otherwise, the :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern
          provides no guarantees about the data read in transactions.

       For more information, see the :readconcern:`"majority"`
       reference page.

   * - :readconcern:`"linearizable"`

     - The query returns data that reflects all successful 
       majority-acknowledged writes that completed prior to the start
       of the read operation. The query may wait for concurrently
       executing writes to propagate to a majority of replica
       set members before returning results.

       If a majority of your replica set members crash and restart after
       the read operation, documents returned by the read operation are
       durable if :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` is set to
       the default state of ``true``.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst


       Availability:
          - Read concern :readconcern:`"linearizable"` is
            :red:`unavailable for use` with causally consistent
            sessions and transactions.
            
          - You can specify linearizable read concern for read
            operations on the :replstate:`primary <PRIMARY>` only.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-linearizable-agg.rst

       
       **Requirements:** Linearizable read concern guarantees only
       apply if read operations specify a query filter that uniquely
       identifies a single document.

       .. tip::

          Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in
          case a majority of data bearing members are unavailable.
          ``maxTimeMS`` ensures that the operation does not block
          indefinitely and instead ensures that the operation returns
          an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

       For more information, see the :readconcern:`"linearizable"`
       reference page.

   * - :readconcern:`"snapshot"`

     - | If the transaction is not part of a :ref:`causally consistent
         session <sessions>`, upon transaction commit with write
         concern :writeconcern:`"majority"`, the transaction operations
         are guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of
         majority-committed data.

       | If the transaction is part of a :ref:`causally consistent
         session <sessions>`, upon transaction commit with write
         concern :writeconcern:`"majority"`, the transaction operations
         are guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of
         majority-committed data that provides causal consistency with
         the operation immediately preceding the transaction start.

       Availability:
           - Read concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"` is only available
             for use with multi-document transactions.
             
           - For transactions on a sharded cluster, if any operation in
             the transaction involves a shard that has :ref:`disabled
             read concern "majority" <disable-read-concern-majority>`,
             you cannot use read concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"` for
             the transaction. You can only use read concern
             :readconcern:`"local"` or :readconcern:`"majority"` for the
             transaction.

``readConcern`` Support
-----------------------

.. _read-concern-option:

Read Concern Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For operations not in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, you can specify a ``readConcern`` level as an
option to commands and methods that support read concern:

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <level> }

To specify the read concern level for the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
method :method:`db.collection.find()`, use the
:method:`cursor.readConcern()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find().readConcern(<level>)

Transactions and Available Read Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`, you set
the read concern at the transaction level, not at the individual
operation level. The operations in the transaction will use the
transaction-level read concern. Any read concern set at the collection
and database level is ignored inside the transaction. If the
transaction-level read concern is explicitly specified, the client
level read concern is also ignored inside the transaction.

.. important::

   Do not explicitly set the read concern for the individual
   operations. To set the read concern for transactions, see
   :ref:`transaction-options`.

You can set the read concern at the transaction start:

- For multi-document transaction, the following read concern levels are
  available:

  - :readconcern:`"local"`

  - :readconcern:`"majority"`

  - :readconcern:`"snapshot"`

- Write commands that are part of a :doc:`multi-document transactions
  </core/transactions>` can support the transaction-level read concern.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-create-collections-read-concern.rst

If unspecified at the transaction start, transactions use the
session-level read concern or, if that is unset, the client-level read
concern.

For more information, see :ref:`Transaction Read Concern
<transactions-read-concern>`.


Causally Consistent Sessions and Available Read Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For operations in a :ref:`causally consistent session
<causal-consistency>`, :readconcern:`"local"` and
:readconcern:`"majority"` levels are available. However, to guarantee
causal consistency, you must use :readconcern:`"majority"`. For
details, see :ref:`causal-consistency`.

If a multi-document transaction is associated with a causally
consistent session, :readconcern:`"snapshot"` is also available for the
the transaction.

.. _read-concern-operations:

Operations That Support Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operations support read concern:

.. important::

   To set read concern for operations in a transaction, you set the
   read concern at the transaction level, not at the individual
   operation level. Do not explicitly set the read concern for the
   individual operations in a transaction. For more information, see

.. [#snapshot]

   Read concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"` is available only for
   multi-document transactions, and for transactions, you set the read
   concern at the transaction level. The operations that support
   :readconcern:`"snapshot"` correspond to the CRUD operations
   available in transactions. For more information, see
   :ref:`transactions-read-concern`.

Read Concern not Supported on ``local`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`local database <replica-set-local-database>` does not support
read concerns. MongoDB silently ignores any configured read
concern for an operation on a collection in the local database.

Considerations
--------------

Read Your Own Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-own-writes.rst

Real Time Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Performance Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike :readconcern:`"majority"`, :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read
concern confirms with secondary members that the read operation is
reading from a primary that is capable of confirming writes with
:writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" } <"majority">` write concern.
[#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ As such, reads with linearizable read
concern may be significantly slower than reads with
:readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read concerns.

Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a
majority of data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS`` ensures
that the operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures that
the operation returns an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )

.. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]

   .. include:: /includes/footnote-two-primaries-edge-cases.rst

.. _afterClusterTime:

Read Operations and ``afterClusterTime``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.6

MongoDB 3.6 introduces support for :ref:`causally consistent sessions
<sessions>`. For read operations associated with causally consistent
session, MongoDB 3.6 introduces the ``afterClusterTime`` read concern
option to be set automatically by the drivers for operations associated
with causally consistent sessions.

.. important::

   Do not manually set ``afterClusterTime`` for a read operation.
   MongoDB drivers set this value automatically for operations
   associated with causally consistent sessions. However, you can
   advance the operation time and the cluster time for the session,
   such as to be consistent with the operations of another client
   session. For an example, see :ref:`causal-consistency-examples`.

To satisfy a read request with an ``afterClusterTime`` value of ``T``,
a :binary:`~bin.mongod` must perform the request after its oplog
reaches time ``T``. If its oplog has not reached time ``T``, the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` must wait to service the request.

Read operations with a specified ``afterClusterTime`` return data that
meet both the :ref:`read concern level <read-concern-levels>`
requirement and the specified ``afterClusterTime`` requirement.

For read operations not associated with causally consistent sessions,
``afterClusterTime`` is unset.

Read Concern Provenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB tracks read concern ``provenance``,
which indicates the source of a particular read concern. You may see
``provenance`` shown in the
:serverstatus:`getLastError <metrics.getLastError>` metrics, read
concern error objects, and MongoDB logs.

The following table shows the possible read concern ``provenance``
values and their significance:
