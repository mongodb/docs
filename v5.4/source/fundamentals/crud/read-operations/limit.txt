Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to limit the number of results returned
from read operations with the MongoDB Kotlin driver.

Use ``limit()`` to cap the number of documents that a read operation returns.
This instance method designates the maximum number of
documents that a read operation can return. If there are not enough documents
to reach the specified limit, it can return a smaller number.
If you use ``limit()`` with the ``skip()`` instance method, the skip applies
first and the limit only applies to the documents left over after
the skip. For more information on the ``skip()`` method, see our 
:doc:`guide on Skipping Returned Documents </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/skip/>`. 

The following examples demonstrate, respectively, how to insert data into
a collection, how to use ``limit()`` to restrict the number of returned documents,
and how to combine ``limit()`` with ``skip()`` to further narrow the results returned from a query.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections feature examples that update this sample document: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": 1, "title": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 }
    { "_id": 2, "title": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462  }
    { "_id": 3, "title": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088  }
    { "_id": 4, "title": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104  }
    { "_id": 5, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918  }
    { "_id": 6, "title": "A Dance with Dragons", "author": "Martin", "length": 1104  }

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/LimitTest.snippet.data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

Specify a Limit
---------------

The next example queries the collection to return the top three
longest books. It first matches all the documents with the query, then sorts on the
``length`` field to return books with longer lengths before
books with shorter lengths. Lastly, it limits the return value to ``3`` documents, 
and returns the following three documents, sorted by length:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/LimitTest.snippet.specify-limit.kt
      :language:  kotlin
      :emphasize-lines: 3

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

        Book(id=2, title=Les Misérables, author=Hugo, length=1462)
        Book(id=6, title=A Dance with Dragons, author=Martin, length=1104)
        Book(id=4, title=Infinite Jest, author=Wallace, length=1104)    

.. tip::

   The order in which you call ``limit()`` and ``sort()`` does not matter
   because the find command always applies the sort first and the
   limit after it. The following two calls are equivalent:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/LimitTest.snippet.equivalent.kt
    :language: kotlin

Combining Skip and Limit
------------------------

To see the next three longest books, append the ``skip()`` method to your
``find()`` call. The integer argument passed to ``skip()`` will determine
how many documents the find operation returns. This operation returns the 
documents that describe the fourth through sixth longest books:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/LimitTest.snippet.skip-limit.kt
      :language:  kotlin
      :emphasize-lines: 3, 4

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

        Book(id=3, title=Atlas Shrugged, author=Rand, length=1088)
        Book(id=5, title=Cryptonomicon, author=Stephenson, length=918)
        Book(id=1, title=The Brothers Karamazov, author=Dostoyevsky, length=824)

You can combine ``skip()`` and ``limit()`` in this way to implement paging for your
collection, returning only small subsets of the collection at one time.

.. note::

  In order to ensure stable sorts across multiple queries, you must sort
  using a unique key (such as ``_id``). Otherwise, a call to ``skip()``
  and ``limit()`` may produce unpredictable results when combined with
  ``sort()``.

  For example, consider the following data:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

     { type: "computer", data: "1", serial_no: 235235 }
     { type: "computer", data: "2", serial_no: 235237 }
     { type: "computer", data: "3", serial_no: 235239 }
     { type: "computer", data: "4", serial_no: 235241 }

  If you sorted by ``type`` alone, ``sort()`` does not guarantee the same order
  upon return. Appending ``skip()`` and ``limit()`` to the ``sort()``
  could return different documents for different queries. In this case, sorting
  by ``data`` or ``serial_no`` would guarantee a stable sort, as both are unique keys.
