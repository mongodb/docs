=======================
Find Multiple Documents
=======================

You can query for multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``find()``
method on a ``MongoCollection`` object. Pass a query filter to the
``find()`` method to query for and return documents that match the filter in
the collection. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB returns all the
documents in the collection.

For more information on querying MongoDB with the Kotlin driver, see our
:doc:`guide on Querying Documents </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/retrieve/>`.

You can also chain methods to the ``find()`` method such as ``sort()`` which
organizes the matched documents in a specified order and
``projection()`` which configures the included fields in the
returned documents.

For more information on the ``sort()`` method, see our
:doc:`guide on Sorting </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort/>`.
For more information on the ``projection()`` method, see our
:doc:`guide on Projections </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/project/>`

The ``find()`` method returns an instance of ``FindFlow``, a class
that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results.

``FindFlow`` also obtains methods from its delegate interface ``Flow`` from the
Kotlin Coroutines library.
You can call the ``collect()`` method to iterate through the fetched results.
You can also call terminal methods, such as ``firstOrNull()`` to return either 
the first document or ``null`` if there are no results, or ``first()`` to return 
the first document in the collection. If no documents match the query, 
calling ``first()`` throws a ``NoSuchElementException`` exception.

For more information on accessing data from a flow with the Kotlin driver, see our
:doc:`guide on Accessing Data From a Flow </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/flow/>`.

Example
-------

The following snippet finds and prints all documents that match a query on
the ``movies`` collection. It uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed to the ``find()`` method. The ``lt()``
  filter matches only movies with a runtime of less than 15 minutes.

- A **sort** that organizes returned documents in descending order by
  title ("Z" before "A").

- A **projection** that includes the objects in the ``title`` and ``imdb``
  fields and excludes the ``_id`` field using the helper method
  ``excludeId()``.
