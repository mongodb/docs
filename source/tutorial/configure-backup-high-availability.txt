Backups depend upon which
:manual:`version of MongoDB your database is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
one version earlier. For example, with MongoDB 5.0, the FCV can be
``4.4`` or ``5.0``. Backup changed with the MongoDB 4.2. Backup configuration and execution changed between FCV 4.0 and FCV 4.2.

      The |application| manages backups. Deploy sufficient |onprem| hosts with a load balancer to meet your backup needs.

      To learn how to deploy |onprem| with high availability, see
