You can use candlestick charts to visualize how a numeric data
source changes over time. A candlestick chart consists of vertical
columns, or "candles," that represent a range of your data source's 
opening and closing values over a period of time. If the closing value 
is higher or lower than the opening value, the column fills a certain 
color to indicate either a positive or negative change. Each column also
might extend in either direction to show the highest and lowest values
during the time period.

By observing the columns in your chart across consecutive periods of time,
you can identify patterns in your data and make informed predictions.

:ref:`candlestick-chart-use-cases`. To learn about all column chart types,

Candlestick Chart Encoding Channels
-----------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - X Axis
     - The :guilabel:`category` encoding channel for your date field. 

       This channel creates a segment for each time period along the X axis 
       based on the grouping that you select. By default, |charts| enables 
       :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>` to group date data into specific 
       time periods. You can choose from the following bins:

       .. hlist::
          :columns: 2

          * Year
          * Month
          * Week of Year
          * Date of the Month
          * Day of the Week
          * Hour
          * Minute
          * Second
        
       For certain bins, you can enable the :guilabel:`Periodic`
       setting to visualize the aggregated results for the time period
       across your data. To learn more, see :ref:`Bin, Sort, and Limit Your Data 
       <periodic-setting>`.

   * - Y Axis
     - The :guilabel:`value` encoding channels for your numeric data. 
       |charts-short| requires the following values:
       
       - :guilabel:`High`, the highest value during each time period.
       - :guilabel:`Open`, the value at the start of each time period.
       - :guilabel:`Close`, the value at the end of each time period.
       - :guilabel:`Low`, the lowest value during each time period.
        
       To define these values:

       - If you have one field that contains your numeric data, drag the same 
         field onto each of the channels. |charts-short| automatically calculates the 
         high, open, close, and low values to build the chart. 
       - If you have separate fields that represent the high, open, close, and low 
         values for your data, drag each field onto their respective channel 
         to build the chart.

.. _candlestick-chart-use-cases:

Use Cases
---------

Candlestick charts are useful for visualizing :manual:`time series data
</core/timeseries-collections/>` when you want to analyze a numeric
measurement that changes over time. This type of chart is commonly used in 
financial analysis to track the price of assets such as stocks, 
commodities, or currencies. However, you can use candlestick charts for 
various types of data to suit your specific needs.

Consider the following examples:

- A trading firm tracks the stock price of a specific company by hour
  to make a trading decision.
- A weather company tracks rainfall, snowfall, and temperature by day
  to predict next week's forecast.
- A store owner tracks the cost of a specific item by month to determine 
  the best time to restock inventory.

Customization Options
---------------------

The following customization options are specific to candlestick
charts. To see all available customization options, see
:ref:`customize-charts`.

Customize Candlestick Color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the colors that correspond to a positive 
or negative change in your chart:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Customize` tab for your chart.
#. In the :guilabel:`General` section, enable the :guilabel:`Custom Color Palette`.
#. In the dropdown next to :guilabel:`Positive` or :guilabel:`Negative`, 
   use the color picker to select your desired color. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`color-palette-customization`.

Adjust X-Axis Label Angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _candlestick-ref-example:

Example
-------

The following chart visualizes the price of Bitcoin in US dollars
as it changes every minute. The chart uses a :manual:`time series 
collection </core/timeseries-collections/#time-series-collections>`
called ``ticker``, where each document in the collection 
represents a specific financial asset at a point in time. Each 
document includes information about the asset's ticker symbol, 
price, and time.

.. tip:: 
 
   To show the exact data values in a tooltip, hover over the body of 
   a column in the chart.

The :guilabel:`X Axis` category channel, represented by the ``ticker.time`` 
field, bins the numeric data by minute. The :guilabel:`value` 
encoding channels, represented by the ``ticker.price`` field, aggregate
the high, open, close, and low prices during each minute to create the 
vertical columns in the chart.

The chart also uses :ref:`query filters <filter-embedded-charts>`
on the ``ticker.symbol`` and ``ticker.time`` fields to include
only results with the ``BTC-USD`` symbol and limit the chart to an 
hour-long subset of the data.

When the asset's closing price is higher than its opening price 
during a given minute, the column fills green to indicate a 
positive change. When its closing price is lower than its opening price, 
the column fills red to indicate a negative change. Each column also 
might extend in either direction to show the highest and lowest prices 
during each minute. Based on your analysis of the chart, you might make
a decision to purchase, hold, or sell the asset.
