.. method:: Mongo.watch( pipeline, options )

   *For replica sets and sharded clusters only*

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

      Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) set to
      ``"4.0"`` or greater. For more information on fCV, see
      :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

   Opens a :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` for a replica
   set or a sharded cluster to report on all its non-``system``
   collections across its databases, with the exception of the
   ``admin``, ``local``, and the ``config`` databases.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-Mongo.watch-param.rst

   The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-Mongo.watch-options.rst

   :returns:
      A :term:`cursor` over the change event documents.
      See :doc:`/reference/change-events` for examples of change
      event documents.

Availability
------------

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`Mongo.watch()` is available for replica sets and sharded
clusters:

- For a replica set, you can issue :method:`Mongo.watch()` on any
  data-bearing member.

- For a sharded cluster, you must issue :method:`Mongo.watch()` on a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only use :method:`Mongo.watch()` with the :ref:`Wired Tiger
storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Read Concern ``majority`` Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-rc-majority-4.2.rst

Behavior
--------

- :method:`Mongo.watch()` only notifies on data changes that have
  persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`find` and :authaction:`changeStream` privilege actions on
:ref:`all non-systems collections across all
databases<resource-all-but-system-collections>`.. That is, a user must
have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants the following :ref:`privilege
<privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

The built-in :authrole:`read` role provides the appropriate
privileges.

Example
-------

The following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell opens a
change stream cursor on a replica set. The returned cursor reports on
data changes to all the non-``system`` collections across all databases
except for the ``admin``, ``local``, and the ``config`` databases.

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getMongo().watch()

Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isExhausted()` method to ensure the loop only exits
if the change stream cursor is closed *and* there are no objects
remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isExhausted()){
      if (watchCursor.hasNext()){
         printjson(watchCursor.next());
      }
   }

:ref:`change-stream-output`.
