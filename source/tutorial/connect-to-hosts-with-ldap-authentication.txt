Configure LDAP Authentication Between Hosts and Agents
======================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can configure hosts to authenticate Monitoring Agents and Backup
Agents using LDAP. You must configure LDAP authentication separately for
the Monitoring Agent and for the Backup Agent. You can configure LDAP
authentication when adding a host or syncing a backup, or later by editing
the host or the backup configuration.

Prerequisite
------------

The MongoDB deployment must run LDAP, and LDAP must include a user that is
configured with the correct privileges for the Monitoring and Backup
agents.
