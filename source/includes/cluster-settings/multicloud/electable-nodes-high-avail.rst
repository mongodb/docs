If you add regions with electable nodes, you:

- increase data availability and
- reduce the impact of data center outages.

You may set different regions from one cloud provider or choose
different cloud providers.

|service| sets the node in the first row of the :guilabel:`Electable nodes` table as the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

|service| prioritizes nodes in this region for primary eligibility.
Other nodes rank in the order that they appear.
