The following sections describe :manual:`sharding </sharding>`
behavior and how to enable sharding for :ref:`global-clusters`.

.. _global-writes-collections:

Sharding Collections for Global Writes
--------------------------------------

Unsharded collections must meet the following compatibility
requirements *prior to sharding* to utilize |global-write| when
sharded:

- Every document in the collection **must** include a ``location``
  field.

- The value of the ``location`` field **must** be either an
  |iso3166-1a2| country code (``"US"``, ``"DE"``, ``"IN"``) *or* a
  supported |iso3166-2| subdivision code (``"US-DC"``, ``"DE-BE"``,
  ``"IN-DL"``). Documents that do not match this criteria can't be routed
  to any shard in the cluster. To view the complete list of currently
  supported country or subdivision codes, visit
  https://cloud.mongodb.com/static/atlas/country_iso_codes.txt.

For collections that meet the stated requirements, you *must* shard
the collection using the following pattern:

.. code-block:: json

   { "location" : 1, "<secondary_field>" : 1 }

A shard key on the ``location`` field alone may result in bottlenecks,
especially for workloads where a subset of countries or subdivisions
receive the majority of write operations. |service| |global-write|
requires a :manual:`compound shard key </core/index-compound>` to
facilitate efficient distribution of sharded data across the cluster.
|service| |global-write-cluster| shard keys share the same restrictions
as MongoDB shard keys. For example, the secondary shard key field
*cannot* be an array.

   To learn more about:

   - How to choose a secondary shard key field and the effect of shard
     key choice on data distribution, see
     :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-selection>`.

   - What shard key limitations are, see
     :ref:`Shard Key Limitations <limits-shard-keys>`.

.. important:: Changing the Shard Key

   After sharding, what you can modify depends upon the version of
   MongoDB that you run:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 30 30
      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - MongoDB Version
        - Modify Shard Key Keys
        - Modify Shard Key Values

      * - MongoDB 4.0
        - No
        - No

      * - MongoDB 4.2
        - No
        - Yes

      * - MongoDB 4.4
        - Yes, add fields to Key using :ref:`Data Explorer 
          <data-explorer-docs>` only
        - Yes

      * - MongoDB 5.0
        - Yes, add fields to Key using :ref:`Data Explorer 
          <data-explorer-docs>` only
        - Yes

The |service| :ref:`data-explorer` supports creating sharded
collections with specific validations for |global-write|.

.. seealso::

   To learn more, see
   :ref:`de-shard-collection-for-global-writes`.

You can also use {+mongosh+} to execute the
:method:`sh.shardCollection() <sh.shardCollection>`. After sharding
the collection, you must use the |service| :ref:`data-explorer`
to enable |global-write| for that collection.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about sharding collections via the Data Explorer, see
   :ref:`de-shard-collection-for-global-writes`.

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |service| encounters an error while sharding a collection for global
writes, a message appears in the banner at the top of the screen.

.. figure:: /images/sharding-error1.png
   :alt: Screenshot of an Atlas sharding error alert
   :figwidth: 550px

1. Click :guilabel:`See Details` to learn about the error and the 
   namespace where the error occured. A modal window appears with the 
   complete error message and a :guilabel:`Fix Now` button:

   .. figure:: /images/sharding-error2.png
      :alt: Screenshot of an Atlas sharding error modal window
      :figwidth: 550px

#. Click the :guilabel:`Close` and navigate to the collection in Data   
   Explorer. You can also click the :guilabel:`Fix Now` button to go to 
   Data Explorer for that |service| cluster.
   
#. Click the :guilabel:`Global Writes` tab for the collection mentioned 
   in the error message. You will see an error similar to the following:

   .. figure:: /images/sharding-error3.png
      :alt: Screenshot of an Atlas sharding error in Data Explorer
      :figwidth: 550px

#. Click :guilabel:`Unmanage Collection` to cancel the global writes 
   sharding operation. You must have the :authrole:`Project Data Access 
   Admin` role to cancel the sharding operation.
   
After making any necessary changes to the collection as indicated by 
the error message, you can start the sharding process again.

Possible errors include:

An index already exists on the custom shard key.
  If the field chosen as the second part of the compound shard key is
  already indexed, the sharding operation may fail.

The shard key field is not present.
  All documents in the collection must contain both the shard key
  fields. This error occurs only in versions earlier than MongoDB 4.4.

The collection is already sharded.
  If the collection has already been manually sharded, the operation
  fails.

The collection has a custom default collation.
  A :manual:`custom default collation </reference/collation/>` on the
  collection may cause a sharding error.

.. _global-writes-initial-chunks:

Hashed Sharding Options  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shard keys use :manual:`hashed sharding </core/hashed-sharding/>` and 
pre-split data for even distribution. This is only available on 
|service| clusters running MongoDB 4.4 and above.

If you enable the use of hashed index shard keys by selecting 
:guilabel:`Use hashed index as the shard key` in the :ref:`User 
Interface <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>` or by setting 
``isCustomShardKeyHashed`` through the :doc:`API 
</reference/api/global-clusters-add-namespace>`, 
|service| distributes the sharded data evenly by hashing the second 
field of the shard key. 

You can optionally select :guilabel:`Pre-split data for even 
distribution` in the |service| :ref:`User Interface 
<de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>` or set ``presplitHashedZone`` 
using the :doc:`API </reference/api/global-clusters-add-namespace>` to 
specify whether to perform initial chunk creation and distribution for 
an empty or non-existing collection based on the defined zones and zone 
ranges for the collection. 

When creating a sharded collection using a compound hashed shard key 
for |global-write-cluster|\s, |service| creates at least 1 chunk per 
location `code <https://cloud.mongodb.com/static/atlas/country_iso_codes.txt>`__ 
and attempts to distribute chunks evenly across shards in the cluster. 
By default, |service| creates one chunk per location code. 

You can also specify the minimum number of chunks to create initially 
when sharding an empty collection with a :manual:`hashed shard key 
</core/hashed-sharding/>` using the |service| :guilabel:`Data Explorer` 
:ref:`User Interface <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>` or by 
setting ``numInitialChunks`` parameter through the :doc:`API 
</reference/api/global-clusters-add-namespace>`. 

.. note:: 

   If you specify the number of chunks per shard, |service| creates at 
   least the minimum number of chunks that you specified, with the same 
   number of chunks per location code. If you specify the minimum 
   number of chunks, |service| sets up zoned sharding quickly, 
   especially if you already know how to geographically distribute your 
   data before sharding.

.. _global-writes-write-operations:

|global-write-cluster| Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each document in a write operation, MongoDB
uses the ``location`` field of the shard key (if included) to determine the zone to
which to route the data. MongoDB selects a shard associated to that
zone as the target for writing the document, facilitating
geographically isolated and segmented data storage.

.. warning::
   
   If a shard key is not included in the write operation,
   or a shard key is included but the ``location`` field is not present,
   the write operation will succeed,
   but the resulting documents will not to be distributed.


MongoDB can only guarantee this behavior for inserted documents that
meet the criteria defined in :ref:`global-writes-collections`.
Specifically, MongoDB can route a document whose ``location`` field
doesn't conform to |iso3166-1a2| *or* |iso3166-2| to any shard in the
cluster.

.. _global-writes-read-operations:

|global-write-cluster| Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB query routing depends on whether the read operation includes
the full shard key **and** that the ``location`` value corresponds to a
supported |iso3166-1a2| country code (``"US"``, ``"DE"``, ``"IN"``)
*or* a supported |iso3166-2| subdivision code (``"US-DC"``,
``"DE-BE"``, ``"IN-DL"``).

- For queries that do include the full shard key and whose ``location``
  value meets the requirements for |global-write|, MongoDB targets the
  read operation to the zone which maps to the ``location`` value or
  values specified in the query.

- For read operations that don't include the ``location`` value , or if
  the ``location`` value doesn't correspond to a supported
  |iso3166-1a2| country code or |iso3166-2| subdivision code, MongoDB
  must broadcast the read operation to every zone in the cluster.

- For |global-write| zones which have :guilabel:`Read-only` nodes in
  geographically distant regions, clients in those regions can query
  the local :guilabel:`Read-only` node for that zone by specifying the
  full shard key as part of the query *and* issuing the read
  operation with a :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`
  of :readmode:`nearest`.

.. important::

   Secondary reads may return stale data depending on the level
   of replication lag between the secondary node and the primary.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about:

   - MongoDB read preference, see
     :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`.

   - MongoDB query routing, see
     :manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>`.

Sharding Collections without Global Writes
------------------------------------------

|global-write| clusters support the same
:manual:`Ranged </core/ranged-sharding>` and
:manual:`Hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` sharding strategies
as a standard |service| sharded cluster. For sharded collections whose
shard keys and document schema do not support |global-write|,
MongoDB distributes the sharded data evenly across the available shards
in the cluster with respect to the chosen
:manual:`shard key </core/sharding-shard-key/>`. Consider using a
separate sharded cluster for data that can't take advantage of
|global-write|.

You can't modify a collection to support |global-write| after
sharding. We recommend that you choose a shard key that will
allow you to use |global-write| for a collection the future.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about |global-write| sharding requirements, see
   :ref:`global-writes-collections`.

Unsharded Collections in Global Write Clusters
----------------------------------------------

|global-write-clusters| provide the same support for unsharded
collections as a standard |service| sharded cluster. For each database
in the cluster, MongoDB stores its unsharded collections on a
:term:`primary shard`. Use :method:`sh.status() <sh.status>` from the
{+mongosh+} to determine the primary shard for the database.
