   :class: note

   To perform any of the following actions, you must have the
   :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

View Who Can Access a Project
-----------------------------

To view which users, teams, or |api| Keys can access a project:

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-project-access.rst

View User Invitations
---------------------

The :guilabel:`Users` tab lists any outstanding invitations to
users to join the project and any requests from users who want to join
the project. A user can request to join a project when they first
register for |service|.

Individual users are ordered by status. They appear in the following
sequence:

1. Users currently in your project.
#. Users with pending invitations to join your project.
#. Users requesting to join your project.

|service| displays the :guilabel:`Name` of
users who have not accepted their invitation as
:guilabel:`Pending User` and their role as *--invite sent--*.

To cancel an invitation, click :icon:`trash-alt` to the right of the
user's name.

Remove Users or Teams from a Project
------------------------------------

.. important::

   Projects must have at least one user or team. You cannot delete the
   last member (be it a user or team) from the project. You must
   instead :ref:`close the project
   <how-do-i-remove-my-company-project>`.

   You also cannot delete the last :authrole:`Project Owner` remaining
   in the project. You must first assign the role to at least one
   other user before deleting the original user.

To remove a user or team from a project:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-users-remove.rst
