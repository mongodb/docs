.. warning::
   On some systems, providing a password in a connection string with 
   the ``--cluster0`` or ``--cluster1`` options may make the password 
   visible to system status programs, such as ``ps``, that may be invoked 
   by other users.

   Consider using the :option:`--config` option to specify a 
   configuration file containing the password instead.
