Link User Identities - Web SDK
==============================

Overview
--------

Atlas App Services provides :ref:`multiple ways <authentication-providers>` for users
to log into your application. Because each method of authentication corresponds
to a unique user identity, App Services lets you merge multiple identities
belonging to a single user into one user identity.

Example
-------

Consider an application that enables users to authenticate via
:ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>`. When that user decides to create a full account with an SSO
provider or email/password authentication, you need some way of persisting the
user's original anonymous identity with their new permanent identity.

You can link identities using the ``linkCredentials()`` method  
of the ``User`` object of a logged-in User.
