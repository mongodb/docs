Install On Prem MMS for Development and Testing
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS On Prem is a package that lets you run the MongoDB Management Service
(MMS) on site. MMS monitors and backs up your MongoDB infrastructure.

On Prem MMS uses the components described in
:doc:`/core/system-overview`. In a test deployment, you can run an
entire On Prem MMS deployment on a single system as in the
:ref:`on-prem-minimal-deployment-diagram` diagram. You will deploy a
replica set for testing on a separate system.

The minimal deployment is for testing and development purposes
only. Running on a single server is *not** suitable for production
deployments.
