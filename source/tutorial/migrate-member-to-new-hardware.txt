============================================
Migrate a Replica Set Member to a New Server
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can migrate the member of a :term:`replica set` to a new server. To do
so, you add a member to the replica set on the new server and then shut
down the existing member on the old server. The following is a high-level
overview of the procedure:

1. Provision the new server.

2. Add an extra member to the replica set.

3. Shut down old member of the replica set.

4. Un-manage the old member (Optional).

Considerations
--------------

Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a new replica set member, the member must perform an
:term:`initial sync`. If your database is large, initial sync can take a
long time to complete. For more information on initial sync, see
:manua:`Replica Set Data Synchronization </core/replica-set-sync`.

Migrating Multiple Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are moving multiple members to new servers, migrate each member
separately to keep the replica set running for :doc:`high availability
</core/replica-set-high-availability>`.

Procedure
---------

Perform this procedure separately for each member of a replica set to be
migrated.
