.. _|idref|-documentKey:

Document that contains the ``_id`` value of the document created or 
modified by the :ref:`CRUD <crud>` operation.

For sharded collections, this field also displays the full shard key
for the document. The ``_id`` field is not repeated if it is already a
part of the shard key.
