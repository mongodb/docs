Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions
that affect how you model data can affect application performance and
database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-modeling` for a full high
level overview of data modeling in MongoDB.

This document describes a data model that uses :ref:`embedded
<data-modeling-embedding>` documents to describe relationships between
connected data.

Pattern
-------

Consider the following example that maps patron and address
relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of embedding over
referencing if you need to view one data entity in context of the
other. In this one-to-one relationship between ``patron`` and
``address`` data, the ``address`` belongs to the ``patron``.

In the normalized data model, the ``address`` contains a reference to
the ``parent``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: "joe",
      name: "Joe Bookreader"
   }

   {
      patron_id: "joe",
      street: "123 Fake Street",
      city: "Faketon",
      state: "MA"
      zip: 12345
   }

If the ``address`` data is frequently retrieved with the ``name``
information, then with referencing, your application needs to issue
multiple queries to resolve the reference. The better data model would
be to embed the ``address`` data in the ``patron`` data, as in the
following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: "joe",
      name: "Joe Bookreader",
      address: {
                 street: "123 Fake Street",
                 city: "Faketon",
                 state: "MA"
                 zip: 12345
               }
   }

With the embedded data model, your application can retrieve the
complete patron information with one query.
