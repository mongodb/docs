Back up a Deployment

You can back up your MongoDB deployment to a local MongoDB database or
a cloud-hosted MongoDB database.

.. cond:: cloud

   Considerations
   --------------

   |mms| builds snapshots using the
   :manual:`latest patch release of MongoDB </reference/versioning>`.

   .. example::

      Consider a deployment where the current MongoDB version is
      4.0.20.

      If you back up a database running MongoDB 4.0.15, |mms| creates
      the snapshot using MongoDB 4.0.20, the current version. |mms|
      displays that snapshot as MongoDB 4.0.20 in the console.

      MongoDB guarantees all patch release versions to be compatible.
      You can use the snapshots built with 4.0.20 to restore to your
      4.0.15 instances, if needed.

Prerequisites
-------------

Unique Names for Deployment Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your deployment items have unique names before creating backups.

.. include:: /includes/important-unique-names-deployment-items.rst

Replica Set Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Replica Set must:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB version 2.6 or later.

      - Have an active :term:`primary` node.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB Enterprise with an |fcv| of 4.2 or later.

      - Have an active :term:`primary` node.

Sharded Cluster Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Sharded Cluster must:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - Be monitored by |mms| including at least one |mongos| in the
        cluster.

      - Run MongoDB version 2.6 or later.

      - Have all :term:`config servers <config server>` running. The
        config server |mongod| processes must be started with either
        the ``--configsvr`` command line option or the
        ``{ "clusterRole": "configsvr" }`` setting in the ``mongod``
        configuration file.

      - Complete the balancing round in less than one hour.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB Enterprise with an |fcv| of 4.2 or later on all
        nodes including the config server.

      - Have an active :term:`primary` node of each shard and the
        config server.

MongoDB FCV 4.2 Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All |fcv| 4.2 databases must fulfill the appropriate
:ref:`backup considerations <4.2-backup-considerations>`.

Data Protection Plan

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      You can choose to back up all databases and collections in your
      MongoDB deployment or specific ones.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-backup.rst

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      You can back up your entire MongoDB deployment.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/create-backup-wt.rst
