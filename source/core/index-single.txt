Single Field Indexes
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a
:term:`collection` of :term:`documents <document>`. By default, all collections
have an index on the :ref:`_id field <index-type-id>`, and
applications and users may add additional indexes to support important
queries and operations.

MongoDB supports indexes that contain either a single field *or*
multiple fields depending on the operations that this index-type supports. This
document describes indexes that contain a single field. Consider the
following illustration of a single field index.

.. include:: /images/index-ascending.rst

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/index-compound` for information about indexes
   that include multiple fields, and :doc:`/core/indexes-introduction`
   for a higher level introduction to indexing in MongoDB.

Example
-------

Given the following document in the ``friends`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId(...),
     "name" : "Alice"
     "age" : 27
   }

The following command creates an index on the ``name`` field:

.. code-block:: sh

   db.friends.ensureIndex( { "name" : 1 } )

Cases
-----

.. index:: _id index
.. index:: _id
.. index:: index; _id
.. index:: index types; primary key
.. _index-type-id:

``_id`` Field Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB creates the ``_id`` index, which is an ascending :ref:`unique
index <index-type-unique>` on the ``_id`` field, for all collections when
the collection is created. You cannot remove the index on the ``_id``
field.

Think of the ``_id`` field as the :term:`primary key` for a collection.
Every document *must* have a unique ``_id`` field. You may store any
unique value in the ``_id`` field. The default value of ``_id`` is an
:term:`ObjectId` which is generated when the client inserts the document. An
:term:`ObjectId` is a 12-byte unique identifier suitable for use
as the value of an ``_id`` field.

.. note::

   In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field
   to prevent errors.  This is most-often done by using a standard
   auto-generated :term:`ObjectId`.

   Before version 2.2, :term:`capped collections <capped collection>`
   did not have an ``_id`` field. In version 2.2 and newer, capped
   collections do have an ``_id`` field, except those in the ``local``
   :term:`database`. See :ref:`Capped Collections Recommendations
   and Restrictions <capped-collections-recommendations-and-restrictions>`
   for more information.

.. index:: index; embedded fields
.. _index-embedded-fields:

Indexes on Embedded Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can create indexes on fields embedded in sub-documents, just as you
can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields
differ from :ref:`indexes on sub-documents <index-sub-documents>`,
which include the full content up to the maximum :limit:`index size
<Index Key>` of the sub-document in the index. Instead, indexes on
embedded fields allow you to use a "dot notation," to introspect into
sub-documents.

Consider a collection named ``people`` that holds documents that resemble
the following example document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"_id": ObjectId(...)
    "name": "John Doe"
    "address": {
           "street": "Main"
           "zipcode": "53511"
           "state": "WI"
           }
   }

You can create an index on the ``address.zipcode`` field, using the
following specification:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { "address.zipcode": 1 } )

.. index:: index; subdocuments
.. _index-subdocuments:
.. _index-sub-documents:
.. _index-subdocument:
.. _index-sub-document:

Indexes on Subdocuments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can also create indexes on subdocuments.

For example, the ``factories`` collection contains documents that
contain a ``metro`` field, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: ObjectId(...),
     metro: {
              city: "New York",
              state: "NY"
            },
     name: "Giant Factory"
   }

The ``metro`` field is a subdocument, containing the embedded fields
``city`` and ``state``. The following command creates an index on the ``metro``
field as a whole:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.factories.ensureIndex( { metro: 1 } )

The following query can use the index on the ``metro`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.factories.find( { metro: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )

This query returns the above document. When performing equality matches
on subdocuments, field order matters and the subdocuments must match
exactly. For example, the following query does not match the above
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.factories.find( { metro: { state: "NY", city: "New York" } } )

See :ref:`query-subdocuments` for more information regarding querying
on subdocuments.
