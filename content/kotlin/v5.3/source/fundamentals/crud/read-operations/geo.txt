Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to query **geospatial data** by using
the {+driver-short+}. You can also learn about different geospatial data
formats supported by MongoDB.

Geospatial data is data that represents a geographical location on
the surface of the Earth. Examples of geospatial data include:

- Locations of movie theaters
- Borders of countries
- Routes of bicycle rides
- Dog exercise areas in New York City

Coordinates on Earth
--------------------

To store and query your geospatial data in MongoDB, use **GeoJSON**. GeoJSON is
a data format created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 

Here is the location of MongoDB headquarters in GeoJSON:

.. code-block:: json

   "location" : {
      "type": "point",
      "coordinates": [-73.986805, 40.7620853]
   }

For definitive information on GeoJSON, see the
`official IETF specification <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`__.

GeoJSON Positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A position represents a single place on Earth and is given as an array
containing two or three number values: 

- Longitude in the first position (required)
- Latitude in the second position (required)
- Elevation in the third position (optional)

.. important:: Longitude then Latitude

   GeoJSON orders coordinates as longitude first and latitude second. This may
   be surprising as geographic coordinate system conventions generally list
   latitude first and longitude second. Make sure to check what format any other
   tools you are working with use. Popular tools such as OpenStreetMap and Google
   Maps list coordinates as latitude first and longitude second.

GeoJSON Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your GeoJSON object's type determines its geometric shape. Geometric shapes are
made up of positions.

Here are some common GeoJSON types and how you can specify them with positions:

- ``Point``: Single position. This could represent the location of a
  `sculpture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Picasso>`__.
- ``LineString``: Array of two or more positions, thus forming a series of line
  segments. This could represent
  `the route of the Great Wall of China <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GreatWallChina4.png>`__. 
- ``Polygon``: Array of positions in which the first and last
  position are the same, enclosing some space. This could represent 
  `the land within Vatican City <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vatican_City_map_EN.png>`__.

To learn more about the shapes you can use in MongoDB, see
:manual:`GeoJSON </reference/geojson/>` in the Server manual.

Index
~~~~~

To query data stored in the GeoJSON format, add the field containing
GeoJSON data to a ``2dsphere`` index. The following snippet creates a
``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field by using the
``Indexes`` builder:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.geo2dsphere-index.kt
   :language: kotlin

To learn more about the ``Indexes`` builder, see the 
:ref:`indexes-builders` guide.

Coordinates on a 2D Plane
-------------------------

You can store geospatial data using ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates on 
a two-dimensional Euclidean plane. We refer to coordinates on a two-dimensional
plane as *legacy coordinate pairs*.

Legacy coordinate pairs have the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   { "location" : [ x, y ] }

The field value contains an array of two values in which the first represents 
the ``x`` axis value and the second represents the ``y`` axis value.

Index
~~~~~

To query data stored as legacy coordinate pairs, you must add the field containing
legacy coordinate pairs to  a ``2d`` index. The following snippet creates a
``2d`` index on the ``coordinates`` field by using the ``Indexes`` builder:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.geo2d-index.kt
   :language: kotlin

To learn more about the ``Indexes`` builder, see the 
:ref:`indexes-builders` guide.
   
For more information on legacy coordinate pairs, see the
:manual:`Legacy Coordinate Pairs
</geospatial-queries/#legacy-coordinate-pairs>` section of the
Geospatial Queries guide in the Server manual.

.. tip:: Supported Operators

   Spherical (``2dsphere``) and flat (``2d``) indexes support some, but
   not all, of the same query operators. To view a full list of operators
   and their index compatibility, see the :manual:`Geospatial Query
   Operators </geospatial-queries/#geospatial-query-operators>` section
   of the Geospatial Queries guide in the Server manual.

Geospatial Queries
------------------

Geospatial queries consist of a query operator and GeoJSON shapes as query
parameters.

Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query your geospatial data, use one of the following query operators: 

- ``$near``
- ``$geoWithin``
- ``$nearSphere``
- ``$geoIntersects`` *requires a 2dsphere index*

You can specify these query operators in the MongoDB Kotlin driver with the
``near()``, ``geoWithin()``, ``nearSphere()``, and ``geoIntersects()`` utility
methods of the ``Filters`` builder class.

To learn more about geospatial query operators, see the :manual:`Geospatial Query
Operators </geospatial-queries/#geospatial-query-operators>` section
of the Geospatial Queries guide in the Server manual.

To learn more about the ``Filters`` builder, see the 
:ref:`filters-builders` guide.  

Query Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a shape to use in a geospatial query, use the ``Position``,
``Point``, ``LineString``, and ``Polygon`` classes from the {+driver-short+}.

To learn more about the GeoJSON shape classes, see the
`GeoJSON package <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/geojson/package-summary.html>`__
API Documentation.

Geospatial Query Examples
-------------------------

The following examples use the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset. You can learn how
to  set up your own free-tier Atlas cluster and how to load the sample dataset
in the :ref:`kotlin-quickstart` guide.

The examples use the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database
from the sample dataset. 

The examples in this section require the following imports:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Point
   import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Polygon
   import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Position
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.near
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.geoWithin
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.fields
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.include
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.excludeId

The sample documents are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.theater-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

The result documents are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.results-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``theaters`` collection already contains a ``2dsphere`` index on the 
``"${Theater::location.name}.${Theater.Location::geo.name}"`` field.

Query by Proximity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for and return documents from nearest to farthest from a point, use
the ``near()`` static utility method of the ``Filters`` builder class. The
``near()`` method constructs a query with the ``$near`` query operator. 

The following example queries for movie theaters between ``10000`` and
``5000`` meters from the Great Lawn of Central Park:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.proximity-query.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console
   
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Bronx)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=New York)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=New York)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Long Island City)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=New York)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Secaucus)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Jersey City)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Elmhurst)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Flushing)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Flushing)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Flushing)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Elmhurst)))

.. tip::

   MongoDB uses the :manual:`same reference system </reference/glossary/#std-term-WGS84>`
   as GPS satellites to calculate geometries over the Earth.

To learn more about the ``$near`` operator, see the 
:manual:`$near </reference/operator/query/near/>` reference in the
Server manual.

Query Within a Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for geospatial data within a specified shape use the ``geoWithin()``
static utility method of the ``Filters`` builder class. The ``geoWithin()``
method constructs a query with the ``$geoWithin`` query operator. 

The following example searches for movie theaters in a section of Long Island.

.. _example_range_query:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/GeoTest.snippet.query-range.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Baldwin))))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Levittown)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Westbury)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Mount Vernon)))
      TheaterResults(location=Location(address=Address(city=Massapequa)))

The following figure shows the polygon defined by the
``longIslandTriangle`` variable and dots representing the locations of
the movie theaters returned by our query.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/geo_geometry.png

To learn more about the ``$geoWithin`` operator, see the
:manual:`$geoWithin </reference/operator/query/geoWithin/>` reference in
the Server manual.
