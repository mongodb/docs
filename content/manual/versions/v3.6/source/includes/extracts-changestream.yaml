ref: changestream-resume
content: |

   Unlike the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
   change stream cursor after an error. The MongoDB drivers make *one*
   attempt to automatically resume a change stream cursor after certain
   errors.


   |watchmethod| uses information stored in the oplog to produce the
   change event description and generate a resume token associated to
   that operation. If the operation identified by the resume token
   passed to the ``resumeAfter`` option has already dropped off the
   :term:`oplog`, |watchmethod| cannot resume the change stream.

   See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for more information on
   resuming a change stream.

ref: changestream-full-document-lookup
content: |
   By default, the :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` returns
   specific field changes/deltas for update operations. You can also
   configure the change stream to look up and return the current
   majority-committed version of the changed document. Depending on other
   write operations that may have occurred between the update and the
   lookup, the returned document may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update.

   Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
   and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
   change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
   BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
   cursor and returns an error.

ref: changestream-remove-shard
content: |

   If the deployment is a sharded cluster, a shard removal may cause an
   open change stream cursor to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not be fully resumable.

ref: changestream-remove-shard-with-link
content: |

   A shard removal may cause an open :doc:`change stream cursor
   </changeStreams>` to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not be fully resumable.

ref: changestream-invalid-events
content: |

  You cannot resume a change stream after an :ref:`invalidate event
  <change-event-invalidate>` (for example, a collection drop or rename)
  closes the stream.

---
ref: changestream-cursor-open
content: |

   The :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` remains open until
   one of the following occurs:

   - The cursor is explicitly closed.

   - An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs; for
     example, a collection drop or rename.

   - The connection to the MongoDB deployment is closed.

ref: _changestream-access-control-core

  For deployments enforcing :ref:`authentication <authentication>` and 
  :ref:`authorization <authorization>`, authenticate as a user
  with the :authaction:`changeStream` and :authaction:`find`
  privilege actions on the collection against which you want to 
  open a change stream.

  The :authrole:`read` :ref:`built-in role <built-in-roles>` includes
  the required privileges to support opening a change stream
  against a collection. Any built-in role or 
  :ref:`user-defined role <user-defined-roles>` that
  inherits the :authrole:`read` role can also support opening
  change streams against a collection.

  Alternatively, use :method:`db.createRole` to create a user-defined
  role that grants the :authaction:`changeStream` and :authaction:`find` 
  privilege actions on the
  :ref:`target collection <resource-specific-db-collection>`.
  See :ref:`user-defined-roles` for more complete documentation.

  To associate a built-in role or user-defined role to an existing user, 
  use the :method:`db.grantRolesToUser()` or
  :method:`db.updateUser()` methods. You can also specify 
  the role when creating a new user using :method:`db.createUser()`.
