`MongoDB Enterprise
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`_
supports proxying authentication requests to a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-ldap.rst

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Enterprise supports simple and SASL binding to Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers via ``saslauthd`` and operating system
libraries:

- MongoDB Enterprise for Linux can bind to an LDAP server either via
  ``saslauthd`` or through the operating system libraries.

- MongoDB Enterprise for Windows can bind to an LDAP server through
  the operating system libraries.

To learn how to set up LDAP and SASL, see :manual:`LDAP Proxy Authentication </core/security-ldap>`
and :manual:`LDAP Authorization </core/security-ldap-external>` sections
in the MongoDB manual.
