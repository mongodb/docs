Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate to MongoDB by
using the **authentication mechanisms** available in
{+mdb-server+}. Authentication mechanisms are processes by which
the driver and server confirm the identity of a client to ensure
security before connecting.

.. tip:: Connecting to MongoDB

   To learn how to establish a connection to your MongoDB
   deployment, see the :ref:`<cpp-get-started>`
   guide.

MongoDB Edition Compatibility
-----------------------------

The following table lists the authentication mechanisms supported
by MongoDB and the {+mdb-server+} editions that each mechanism is
compatible with. Click the name of a mechanism to learn more about
how to use it with your application.

Error Handling
--------------

You can handle authentication errors by catching
``mongocxx::exception`` errors. Inspect the error message string
by using the ``what()`` method, as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-auth-err
   :end-before: // end-auth-err

For more information, see `Operation Exceptions
<{+api+}/topic-mongocxx-examples-operation-exceptions.html>`__ in
the API documentation.
