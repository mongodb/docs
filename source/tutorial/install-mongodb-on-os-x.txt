Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _osx-prereq:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the Homebrew ``brew`` package installed on your OSX host 
*and* you have previously tapped the official 
`MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_, 
skip the prerequisites and go to the :ref:`install` step.

Install XCode
`````````````

Apple's XCode includes command-line tools that are required
by ``brew``, and is available for free on the App Store. Make sure
you are running the latest version.

Install Homebrew
````````````````

OSX does not include the Homebrew ``brew`` package by default.
Install ``brew`` using the 
`official instructions <https://brew.sh/#install>`_.

Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap
````````````````````````````

Issue the following from the terminal to
tap the official 
`MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

   brew tap mongodb/brew 

.. _install:

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install MongoDB |edition| Edition using the
third-party ``brew`` package manager.

From a terminal, issue the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

.. tip::

   If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
   you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError. To resolve, see
   :ref:`troubleshooting-checksumerror`.

In addition to the :doc:`binaries </reference/program>`, the install
creates:

- the :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
  (:file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)

- the :setting:`log directory path <systemLog.path>` (``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``)

- the :setting:`data directory path <storage.dbPath>` (``/usr/local/var/mongodb``)

.. _run-with-homebrew:

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

Follow these steps to run MongoDB |edition| Edition. These instructions
assume that you are using the default settings.

You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using ``brew``, or you can run
MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run
MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system
``ulimit`` values automatically (see
:ref:`ulimit settings <ulimit-settings>` for more information).

- To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **as a
  macOS service**, issue the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

     brew services start mongodb-community@{+version+}

  To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a macOS service, use the
  following command as needed:

  .. code-block:: sh

     brew services stop mongodb-community@{+version+}

- To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **manually
  as a background process**, issue the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

  To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a background process,
  connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the :program:`mongo`
  shell, and issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command as needed.

Both methods use the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` file created
during the install. You can add your own MongoDB
:doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` to
this file as well.

.. note:: macOS Prevents ``mongod`` From Opening


   macOS may prevent ``mongod`` from running after installation. If
   you receive a security error when starting ``mongod``
   indicating that the developer could not be identified or verified,
   do the following to grant ``mongod`` access to run:

   - Open *System Preferences*
   - Select the *Security and Privacy* pane.
   - Under the *General* tab, click the button to the right of the
     message about ``mongod``, labelled either :guilabel:`Open Anyway`
     or :guilabel:`Allow Anyway` depending on your version of macOS.

To verify that MongoDB is running, search for ``mongod`` in your
running processes:

.. code-block:: sh

   ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

You can also view the log file to see the current status of your
``mongod`` process: ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log``.

Connect and Use MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

.. note:: macOS Prevents ``mongo`` From Opening


   macOS may prevent ``mongo`` from running after installation. If
   you receive a security error when starting ``mongo``
   indicating that the developer could not be identified or verified,
   do the following to grant ``mongo`` access to run:

   - Open *System Preferences*
   - Select the *Security and Privacy* pane.
   - Under the *General* tab, click the button to the right of the
     message about ``mongo``, labelled either :guilabel:`Open Anyway`
     or :guilabel:`Allow Anyway` depending on your version of macOS.

Troubleshooting ChecksumMismatchError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError resembling the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   Error: An exception occurred within a child process:

     ChecksumMismatchError: SHA256 mismatch

   Expected: c7214ee7bda3cf9566e8776a8978706d9827c1b09017e17b66a5a4e0c0731e1f

   To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.

To fix:

#. Remove the downloaded :file:`.tgz` archive.

#. Retap the formula.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew untap mongodb/brew && brew tap mongodb/brew

#. Retry the install.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}
