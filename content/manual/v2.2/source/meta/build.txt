==================================
MongoDB Documentation Build System
==================================

This document contains more direct instructions for building the
MongoDB documentation.

Getting Started
---------------

Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Documentation project depends on the following tools:

- Python
- Git
- Inkscape (Image generation.)
- LaTeX/PDF LaTeX (typically texlive; for building PDFs)
- `Giza <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/giza>`_

OS X
````

Install Sphinx, Docutils, and their dependencies with ``easy_install``
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   easy_install giza

Feel free to use ``pip`` rather than ``easy_install`` to install
python packages.

To generate the images used in the documentation, `download and
install Inkscape <http://inkscape.org/download/>`_.

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install a TeX
   distribution (for building the PDF.) If you do not have a LaTeX
   installation, use `MacTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/>`_. This
   is **only** required to build PDFs.

Arch Linux
``````````

Install packages from the system repositories with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   pacman -S inkscape python2-pip

Then install the following Python packages:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip2 install giza

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install the
   following packages from the system repository:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pacman -S texlive-bin texlive-core texlive-latexextra

Debian/Ubuntu
`````````````

Install the required system packages with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install inkscape python-pip

Then install the following Python packages:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install giza

.. optional::

   To generate PDFs for the full production build, install the
   following packages from the system repository:

   .. code-block:: sh

      apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-recommended

Setup and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git://github.com/mongodb/docs.git

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The MongoDB documentation build system is entirely accessible via
``make`` targets. For example, to build an HTML version of the
documentation issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   make html

You can find the build output in ``build/<branch>/html``, where
``<branch>`` is the name of the current branch.

In addition to the ``html`` target, the build system provides the
following targets:

``publish``
   Builds and integrates all output for the production build. Build
   output is in ``build/public/<branch>/``. When you run ``publish``
   in the ``master``, the build will generate some output in
   ``build/public/``.

``push``; ``stage``
   Uploads the production build to the production or staging web
   servers. Depends on ``publish``. Requires access production or
   staging environment.

``push-all``; ``stage-all``
   Uploads the entire content of ``build/public/`` to the web
   servers. Depends on ``publish``. Not used in common practice.

``push-with-delete``; ``stage-with-delete``
   Modifies the action of ``push`` and ``stage`` to remove remote file
   that don't exist in the local build. Use with caution.

``html``; ``latex``; ``dirhtml``; ``epub``; ``texinfo``; ``man``; ``json``
   These are standard targets derived from the default Sphinx
   Makefile, with adjusted dependencies. Additionally, for all of
   these targets you can append ``-nitpick`` to increase Sphinx's
   verbosity, or ``-clean`` to remove all Sphinx build artifacts.

   ``latex`` performs several additional post-processing steps on
   ``.tex`` output generated by Sphinx. This target will also compile
   PDFs using ``pdflatex``.

   ``html`` and ``man`` also generates a ``.tar.gz`` file of the build
   outputs for inclusion in the final releases.
