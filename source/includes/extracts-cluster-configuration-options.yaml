  To configure additional cluster options, toggle
  :guilabel:`Select Multi-Region, Workload Isolation, and Replication Options (M10+ clusters)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`. Use these options to add cluster nodes in
  different geographic regions with different workload priorities,
  and direct application queries to the appropriate cluster nodes.


  .. admonition:: AWS Only
     :class: note

     If this is the first ``M10+`` dedicated paid cluster for the
     selected region or regions *and* you plan on creating one or more
     |vpc| peering connections, please review the documentation
     on :doc:`VPC Peering Connections </security-vpc-peering>` before
     continuing.

  The following options are available when configuring cross-region
  clusters:

  :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`
     .. include:: /includes/fact-electable-nodes-high-avail.rst

     Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to add a new row for region
     selection and select the region from the dropdown. Specify the
     desired number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region. The total
     number of electable nodes across all regions in the cluster must
     be 3, 5, or 7.

     .. admonition:: Backup Data Center Location
        :class: note

        If this is the first cluster in the project *and* you
        intend to enable
        :ref:`{+old-backup+}s <create-cluster-backups>`,
        |service| selects the backup data center location for the
        project based on the geographical location of the
        cluster's :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region. To learn more
        about how |service| creates the backup data center, see
        :doc:`Fully Managed Backup Service </backup-restore-cluster>`.

     When selecting a :guilabel:`Region`, regions marked as
     :guilabel:`Recommended` provide higher availability compared to
     other regions. For more information, see:

     - :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`.

     Each node in the selected regions can participate in replica set
     :term:`elections <election>`, and can become the :term:`primary`
     as long as the majority of nodes in the replica set are available.

     You can improve the replication factor of single-region clusters
     by increasing the number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for your
     :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region. You do not have to add
     additional regions to modify the replication factor of your
     :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

     To remove a region, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon next to that
     region. You cannot remove the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

     |service| provides checks for whether your selected cross-regional
     configuration provides availability during partial or whole
     regional outages. To ensure availability during a full region
     outage, you need at least one node in three different regions. To
     ensure availability during a partial region outage, you must have
     at least 3 electable nodes in a :guilabel:`Recommended` region
     *or* at least 3 electable nodes across at least 2 regions.

  :guilabel:`Read-only nodes for optimal local reads`
     Use read-only nodes to optimize local reads in
     the nodes' respective service areas.

     Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to select a region in which to
     deploy read-only nodes. Specify the desired number of
     :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region.

     Read-only nodes cannot provide high availability because they
     cannot participate in :term:`elections <election>`, or become the
     :term:`primary` for their cluster. Read-only nodes have
     :ref:`distinct replica set tags <replica-set-tags>`
     that allow you to direct queries to desired regions.

     To remove a read-only region, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon
     next to that region.

  :guilabel:`Analytics nodes for workload isolation`
     .. include:: /includes/fact-create-cluster-analytics-nodes.rst

     Analytics nodes cannot participate in
     :term:`elections <election>` or become the :term:`primary` for
     their cluster.

     To remove an analytics node, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon
     next to that region.

  data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the cluster.

  |service| categorizes the cluster tiers as follows:

  :guilabel:`Shared Clusters`
    Sandbox replica set clusters for getting started with MongoDB.
    These clusters deploy to a shared environment with access to a
    subset of |service| features and functionality. For complete
    documentation on shared cluster limits and restrictions,
    see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

    |service| provides an option to deploy
    one ``M0`` Free Tier replica set per project. You can
    :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an
    ``M2+`` paid cluster at any time.

    ``M2`` and ``M5`` are low-cost shared starter cluster tiers.
    These cluster tiers provide the following additional features and
    functionality compared to ``M0`` cluster tiers:

    - :ref:`Backups <m2-m5-snapshots>` for your cluster data.

    - Increased storage.

    - :doc:`API access </api>`.

    .. note::

       |service| deploys MongoDB 4.0 for all cluster tiers in the
       :guilabel:`Shared Clusters` tier. However, Shared Clusters do not support
       all functionality in MongoDB 4.0. See :ref:`atlas-free-tier`
       for details.

    |service| supports shared cluster deployment in a subset of
    Cloud Providers and Regions. |service| greys out any
    shared cluster tier not supported by the selected
    cloud service provider and region. For a complete list of
    regions that support shared cluster deployments, see:

    - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
    - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
    - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Clusters (for development and low-traffic applications)`
    Cluster tiers that support development environments and low-traffic
    applications.

    These cluster tiers support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
    provide full access to |service| features and functionality.

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Clusters (for production and high-traffic applications)`
    Clusters that support production environments with high traffic
    applications and large datasets.

    These cluster tiers support replica set and sharded cluster
    deployments with full access to |service| features and
    functionality.

    Some cluster tiers have variants, denoted by the |angle| character.
    When you select these cluster tiers, |service| lists the variants
    and tags each cluster tier to distinguish their key characteristics.

    .. note::

       Changing the cluster tier for a production cluster will
       require downtime if you are scaling up a tenant cluster (M0, M2, M5)

       |service| has a 4 TB disk capacity limit on all replica sets and
       shards, regardless of the cluster tier. To expand total cluster
       storage beyond 4 TB, enable :ref:`sharding
       <cluster-option-sharding>`.

       For clusters with :guilabel:`Auto-Expand Storage` enabled,

     :header-rows: 1

     * - Backup Option
       - Description

     * - :doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/overview`

       - |service| takes incremental snapshots of data in your cluster
         and allows you to :doc:`restore </backup/legacy-backup/restore>` from stored
         snapshots or from a selected point in time within the last 24
         hours. You can also
         :doc:`query a {+old-backup+} snapshot </backup/legacy-backup/backup-query>`.

         Each project has *one* backup data center location dictated by
         the *first* backup-enabled cluster created in that project. See
         :ref:`continuous-snapshot-storage-location` for more

   connection string options.

   .. list-table::

      * - Analytics
        - |bic| reads from analytics nodes.
        - ``secondary``
        - ``nodeType:ANALYTICS``

   The ``nodeType`` read preference tag dictates the type of node |bic|
   connects to. The possible values for this option are as follows:

   - ``ELECTABLE`` restricts |bic-short| to the :term:`primary` and
     electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

   - ``READ-ONLY`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
     non-electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

   - ``ANALYTICS`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
     :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`.

     .. tip::

        When using a ``readPreference`` of ``"analytics"``,
        |service| places |bic| on the same hardware
        as the analytics nodes from which |bic| reads.

        By isolating electable data-bearing nodes from the
        |bic|, electable nodes do not compete for resources
        with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability
        and performance.

   For high traffic production environments, connecting to the
   :guilabel:`Secondary Node(s)` or :guilabel:`Analytics Node(s)` may
   be preferable to connecting to the :guilabel:`Primary Node`.

   For clusters with one or more
   :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`, select
   :guilabel:`Analytics Node` to isolate |bic| queries from
   your operational workload and read from dedicated, read-only
   analytics nodes. With this option, electable nodes do not compete
   for resources with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability and
   performance.

   The BI Connector generates a relational schema by
   :bic:`sampling data </schema/cached-sampling/>` from MongoDB. The
   following sampling settings are configurable:

     You must configure the |service| project for Encryption at Rest
     using your Key Management before enabling the feature for your
     |service| clusters. To learn more,
     see :ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

     |service| supports the following Encryption at Rest providers:

     - :ref:`AWS Key Management Services <security-aws-kms>`
     - :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`

  .. important::

     If you want to switch from one Encryption at Rest provider on your
     cluster to another, you must first disable Encryption at Rest for
     your cluster, then re-enable it with your desired Encryption at
     Rest provider. See :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`.

  |service| encrypts all cluster storage and snapshot volumes,
  ensuring the security of all cluster data at rest
  (Encryption at Rest). |service|
  :authrole:`Project Owners <project Owner>` can configure
  an additional layer of encryption on their data at rest using the
  MongoDB
  :manual:`Encrypted Storage Engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
  and their |service|-compatible Encryption at Rest provider.

  To enable |service| Encryption at Rest for this cluster,
  toggle :guilabel:`Encryption At Rest with WiredTiger Encrypted Storage Engine (M10 and up)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  |service| Encryption at Rest using your Key Management supports
  ``M10`` or greater replica set clusters backed by
  :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` or
  :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` only.  Support for clusters deployed
  on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is in development. |service| Encryption
  at Rest supports encrypting :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` **only**.
  You cannot enable Encryption at Rest on a cluster using
  :ref:`legacy-backup`.

  |service| clusters using Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
  incur an increase to their hourly run cost. For more information on
  |service| billing for advanced security features, see
  :ref:`advanced-security`.

  .. important::

     If |service| cannot access the |service| project key management
     provider or the encryption key used to encrypt a cluster, then
     that cluster becomes inaccessible and unrecoverable. Exercise
     extreme caution before modifying, deleting, or disabling an
     encryption key or key management provider credentials used by

  You can configure the following :binary:`~bin.mongod` runtime options
  on ``M10+`` paid tier clusters:

  :guilabel:`Set Oplog Size` [1]_
    Modify the :term:`oplog` size of the cluster. For sharded
    cluster deployments, this modifies the oplog size of each
    shard in the cluster. This option corresponds to modifying
    the :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB <replication.oplogSizeMB>`
    configuration file option for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the
    cluster.

    To modify the oplog size:

    1. Log into |service|.
    #. For your desired cluster, click :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`
       from the :icon:`ellipsis-h` menu.
    #. Click :guilabel:`Additional Settings`.
    #. Set the oplog to the desired size.
    #. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.

    You can check the oplog size by connecting to your cluster
    via the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and authenticating as a user
    with the :authrole:`Atlas admin` role. Run the
    :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo() <rs.printReplicationInfo>`
    method to view the current oplog size and time.

    .. warning::

       Reducing the size of the oplog requires removing data from the
       oplog. |service| cannot access or restore any oplog
       entries removed as a result of oplog reduction. Consider the
       ramifications of this data loss before reducing the oplog.

  :guilabel:`Enforce Index Key Limit`
    Enable or disable enforcement of the 1024-byte index key limit.
    Documents can only be updated or inserted if, for all
    indexed fields on the target collection, the corresponding index
    entries do not exceed 1024 bytes. If disabled,
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes documents that breach the limit
    but does *not* index them. This option corresponds to
    modifying the
    :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong <param.failIndexKeyTooLong>`
    parameter via the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

    .. include:: /includes/fact-javascriptEnabled-description.rst

    .. include:: /includes/admonitions/changed-javascript-enabled-mongos.rst

  :guilabel:`Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version` [1]_
    Sets the minimum TLS version the cluster accepts for incoming
    connections. This option corresponds to configuring the
    :setting:`net.ssl.disabledProtocols` configuration file option
    for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

    .. admonition:: TLS 1.0 Deprecation
       :class: note

       For users considering this option as a method for enabling the
       deprecated Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 protocol version, please read
       :ref:`faq-tls-1.0-deprecation` before proceeding. |service|
       deprecation of TLS 1.0 improves your security of data-in-transit
       and aligns with industry best practices. Enabling TLS 1.0 for any
       |service| cluster carries security risks. Consider enabling TLS
       1.0 only for as long as required to update your application stack
       to support TLS 1.1 or later.

  :guilabel:`Require Indexes for All Queries`
    Enable or disable the execution of queries that require a collection
    scan to return results. This option corresponds to modifying the
    :parameter:`notablescan <param.notablescan>` parameter via the
    :dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in
    the cluster.

  .. [1] |service| performs uses a rolling deployment process
     to apply modifications to these options. For sharded clusters,
     this involves a rolling restart of all shards and the config
     server replica set. To learn more about how |service| supports
     high availability during maintenance operations, see
     :ref:`high-availability`.
