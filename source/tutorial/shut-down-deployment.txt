Shut Down MongoDB Processes
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can shut down an entire :term:`sharded cluster`, entire :term:`replica
set`, or a single :term:`standalone instance <standalone>`. The procedure
terminates all the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes involved.

The procedure does **not** remove the processes from |mms| Monitoring.
|mms| continues to monitor the processes and display their statuses. To
remove processes from Monitoring, see
:doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
