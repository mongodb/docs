While replica sets are the recommended solution for production, a
replica set can support only 12 members in total. If your deployment
requires more than 12 members, youâ€™ll need to use :doc:`master-slave
</core/master-slave>` replication. Master-slave replication lacks the
automatic failover capabilities.
