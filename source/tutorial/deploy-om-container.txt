Considerations for |onprem| Deployments over HTTPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure your deployed |onprem| resource to run over |https|,
rather than |http|. A full description of TLS, PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure) certificates, and Certificate Authority is beyond the
scope of this tutorial. This tutorial assumes prior knowledge of TLS/SSL
as well as access to valid certificates.

When running over |https|, |onprem| runs on port ``8443`` by default.

Procedure
---------

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want your |onprem|
instance to run over |http| or |https|:

      - id: http
        name: HTTP
        content: |
