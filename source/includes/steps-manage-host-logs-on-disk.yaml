  settings:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 10 50 10
     :stub-columns: 1
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Field
       - Necessity
       - Action
       - Default

     * - :guilabel:`Rotate Logs`
       - Required
       - |mms| rotates its logs if you set this toggle to
         :guilabel:`On`. Set to :guilabel:`Off` if you don't want |mms|
         to rotate its logs.
       - ``Off``

     * - :guilabel:`Size Threshold (MB)`
       - Required
       - |mms| rotates log files that exceed this maximum log file
         size.
       - ``1000``

     * - :guilabel:`Time Threshold (Hours)`
       - Required
       - |mms| rotates logs that exceed this duration.
       - ``24``

     * - :guilabel:`Max Uncompressed Files`
       - Optional
       - Log files can remain uncompressed until they exceed this
         number of files. |mms| compresses the oldest log files first.
         |mms| doesn't compress log files if you leave this text box
         empty.
       - ``0``

     * - :guilabel:`Max Percent of Disk`
       - Optional
       - Log files can take up to this percent of disk space on your
         MongoDB host's log volume. Ops Manager deletes the oldest log
         files once they exceed this disk threshold.
       - ``2%``

     * - :guilabel:`Total Number of Files`
       - Optional
       - Total number of log files. If a number is not specified, the
         total number of log files defaults to ``0`` and is determined
         by other :guilabel:`Rotate Logs` settings.
       - ``0``


  When you are done, click :guilabel:`Save`.
