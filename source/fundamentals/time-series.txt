Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use and interact with **time series collections** in
MongoDB using the {+driver-long+}.

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over
a period of time. Time series data consists of any data collected over
time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Example
     - Measurement
     - Metadata

   * - Sales Data
     - Revenue
     - Company

   * - Infection Rates
     - Amount of People Infected
     - Location

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

.. important::

   Time series collections require MongoDB 5.0 or later.

To create a time series collection, pass the following parameters to the
``CreateCollection()`` method:

- Name of the new collection to create
- ``CreateCollectionOptions`` object that contains a ``TimeSeriesOptions`` object

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/TimeSeries.cs
   :start-after: begin-time-series
   :end-before: end-time-series
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

To check if you successfully created the collection, use the ``ListCollections()`` or
``ListCollectionsAsync()`` method as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/TimeSeries.cs
   :start-after: begin-list-collections
   :end-before: end-list-collections
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

Your output will look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "name": "september2021",
      "type": "timeseries",
      "options": {
         "timeseries": {
            "timeField": "temperature",
            "granularity": "seconds",
            "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600
         }
      },
      "info": {
         "readOnly": false
      }
   }
   ...

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

To query a time series collection, follow the conventions for retrieving and aggregating
data. For more information about these conventions, see the :ref:`csharp-retrieve` and
:ref:`csharp-aggregation` guides.
