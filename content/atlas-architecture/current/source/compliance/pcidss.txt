The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an
information security standard developed by the `PCI Standards Security
Council <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/about_us/>`__ that applies
to all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. PCI
DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements
designed to protect payment account data.

Under PCI DSS:

- **Cardholder Data (CHD)** is payment card information that an entity
  stores, processes, or transmits in its systems.
- **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)** refers to the systems and
  networks that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, as well as
  systems that directly connect to or support the CDE.
- MongoDB is a **Service Provider**, meaning an entity that stores,
  processes, or transmits cardholder data (CHD) on behalf of another
  entity, or can impact the security of the cardholder data environment
  (CDE).

We understand that PCI DSS compliance is a shared responsibility between
MongoDB, you, and your end customers. The following sections describe
{+service-full+} and {+atlas-gov+} features that can support your
compliance with PCI DSS.

.. important::

   MongoDB Cloud is a PCI DSS certified service provider as of November
   2025. To learn more about MongoDB's PCI DSS validation, including
   information on contractual agreements, see:

   - `MongoDB Trust Center - Atlas PCI DSS <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/trust/pci-dss>`__
   - `MongoDB Trust Center - Atlas for Government PCI DSS <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/trust/pci-dss-atlas-for-government>`__

   To obtain the MongoDB Cloud PCI Attestation of Compliance (AOC):

   - Existing customers can request a copy through the `Customer Trust
     Portal <https://trust.mongodb.com/>`__
   - Prospective customers can request access by contacting the
     :website:`MongoDB Sales team </company/contact>`

   The MongoDB PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix is a formal mapping of PCI
   DSS controls to the responsible party (MongoDB, the customer, or
   both). To obtain the Responsibility Matrix: 
   
   - Existing customers can request a copy through the `Customer
     Trust Portal <https://trust.mongodb.com/>`__
   - Prospective customers can request access by contacting the
     :website:`MongoDB Sales team </company/contact>`

Available Database Environments
-------------------------------

When you architect systems that handle cardholder data, you can choose
between two MongoDB database environments based on your compliance
requirements:

- **{+service-full+}** is our commercial fully managed database
  solution. Choose {+service-full+} when you want a fully-managed,
  globally available database solution that is PCI DSS validated.

- **{+atlas-gov+}** is a separate, dedicated environment of
  {+service-full+} built specifically for U.S. government requirements.
  It is PCI DSS validated and FedRAMP Moderate authorized. Choose
  {+atlas-gov+} when you want a dedicated, isolated environment that
  meets multiple USA-centric compliance standards, including PCI DSS.

.. note::

   Recommendations on this page focus on standard {+service+} solutions.
   To learn more about {+atlas-gov+} features and capabilities related
   to the same topics, see our :atlas:`{+atlas-gov+} documentation
   </government>`.

Protecting Cardholder Data 
--------------------------

Data Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PCI DSS requires entities to protect {+chd+} with strong cryptography
during transmission over open, public networks (Requirement 4).

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`:
  Ensure data encryption in transit (TLS), at rest (AES-256, BYOK, CMK,
  KMS, TDE), and in use (CSFLE, Queryable Encryption).

You can also use :ref:`{+arps+} <atlas-resource-policies-overview>` to
impose a minimum |tls| version or require a specific |tls| cipher suite
configuration for {+cluster+} connections.

Database Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PCI DSS requires entities to restrict access to system components and
cardholder data by Business Need to Know (Requirement 7). 

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`arch-center-authentication-recs`:
  Control access to your {+service+} databases by implementing secure
  identity management with authentication mechanisms such as Federated
  Authentication with |idps|, |aws| |iam| role authentication,
  multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more.

- :ref:`arch-center-authorization-recs`:
  Ensure that only authorized personnel can access {+chd+} based on
  their specific job functions and responsibilities by implementing
  secure access management with role-based access control (RBAC). 

Network Security Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PCI DSS requires entities to install and maintain network security
controls to control traffic within an entity's own networks, and also to
protect resources from exposure to untrusted networks (Requirement 1). 

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`arch-center-network-security`:
  Safeguard network access to {+service+} clusters and protect
  {+ephi+} during transmission with encryption in transit, IP access
  lists, firewall configurations, private endpoints, and network
  isolation.

You can also use :ref:`{+arps+} <atlas-resource-policies-overview>` to
enforce the following network security standards: 

- Prohibit the use of the wildcard IP (``0.0.0.0/0``) to enforce
  stricter network controls.
- Prohibit traffic through public networks by requiring that the IP
  access list remain empty or by preventing additions to an existing IP
  access list.
- Prevent modifications to |vpc| peering and private endpoint
  connections across cloud providers.

Auditing, Monitoring, and Logging System Activity
-------------------------------------------------

PCI DSS requires entities to log and monitor all access to system
components and {+chd+} (Requirement 10).

The following MongoDB {+atlas-arch-center+} articles describe
{+service+} features that support compliance in this area:

- :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`: Monitor, record, and review
  database events such as user authentication attempts and permission
  adjustments.

- :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`: Track cluster health,
  performance, and operational metrics, and configure alerts that can
  surface anomalous activity relevant to {+chd+}.
