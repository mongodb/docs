Introduction
------------

**{+driver-short+}** is a `PyMongo <http://pymongo.readthedocs.io/>`__ extension
containing tools for loading `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org>`__ query
result-sets as  `Apache Arrow <http://arrow.apache.org>`_ tables,
`NumPy <https://numpy.org>`__ arrays, and `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__
or `Polars <https://pola.rs/>`__ DataFrames.
{+driver-short+} is the recommended way to materialize MongoDB query result-sets as
contiguous-in-memory typed arrays suited for in-memory analytical processing
