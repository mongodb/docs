  page, find the trigger that you want to resume in the list of
  triggers. Suspended triggers are marked with a :guilabel:`Status` of
  :guilabel:`Suspended`.

title: Restart the Trigger
ref: restart-the-trigger
content: |
  Click :guilabel:`Restart` in the trigger's :guilabel:`Actions` column.

  You can choose to restart the trigger with a change stream
  :manual:`resume token </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>` or
  open a new change stream. Indicate whether or not to use a resume
  token and then click :guilabel:`Resume Database Trigger`.

  .. admonition:: Resume Tokens
     :class: note

     If you use a :manual:`resume token
     </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>`, Atlas attempts to resume
     the trigger's underlying change stream at the event immediately
     following the last change event it processed. If successful, the
     trigger processes any events that occurred while it was suspended.

     If you do not use a resume token, the trigger begins listening for
     new events but will not fire for any events that occurred while it
     was suspended.
