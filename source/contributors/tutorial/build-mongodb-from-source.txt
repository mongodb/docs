Build MongoDB From Source
=========================

As you make changes, you will need to build the server and
:ref:`run the appropriate test suites <testing-the-mongodb-server>`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   As of MongoDB 3.0, the MongoDB tools, except for ``mongosniff`` and
   ``mongoperf``, are now written in Go and have their own build
   process. For these tools written in Go, you must build them
   separately from the server. See :ref:`building-tools-from-source`
   for build instructions.

Though the exact dependencies and semantics differ by operating system,
building the server from source has the same basic steps.

Dependencies & Installation
---------------------------

To build MongoDB, you will need:

- C++11 to build 3.0.x branches or later.

- A modern C++ compiler. One of the following is required.

  - GCC 4.8.2 or newer
  - Clang 3.4 (or Apple XCode 5.1.1 Clang) or newer
  - Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 or newer

- Python 2.7
- SCons 2.3

MongoDB uses `SCons <http://www.scons.org/>`_ to build the Server and
the shell. While it is unnecessary to know all the intricacies
of SCons, glancing over the documentation may be helpful. SCons is
unlikely to come preinstalled on your system, so make sure to install
it using your preferred package manager.

.. note::

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

      MongoDB uses a customized built-in version of ``tcmalloc`` to
      achieve significant performance gains. Building with
      ``--use-system-tcmalloc`` produces binaries that lack these
      performance gains.

Other basic requirements, independent of system, are to install `Git
<http://git-scm.com/>`_ and a recent 2.7.x version of `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`_.

Compiler Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

To build MongoDB you must use one of the following minimum compiler
versions:

- Windows: Visual Studio 2013 (i.e. MSVC12) Update 4

- Linux: GCC 4.8.2

- OS X: Clang 3.4 of XCode 5

System Specific Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Further requirements are system-dependent
and for both SCons and running the tests:

- On Linux, you will need to install a compiler ``gcc`` or ``clang``, as
  well as ``glibc`` headers which are usually included in a package
  named ``glibc-devel``.

  - On Debian and Ubuntu systems, you must install the ``libssl-dev``
    package to compile with SSL support.

  - On Red Hat and CentOS systems, you must install the
    ``openssl-devel`` package to compile with SSL support.

- On Mac OS X, you will need to install ``XCode``, specifically the
  command line tools.

- On Windows, you will need to install ``Visual Studio 2013`` or later.
  When running on Windows machines, it is recommended to install either
  `pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ or `ActivePython
  <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_ if you wish to
  do parallel builds.

  If using Visual Studio 2013 Express and you receive scons error
  regarding the unavailability of atomic types, you may need to install
  `Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package
  <http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=29>`_.

- On FreeBSD, the included compiler (``gcc`` or ``clang``) should
  suffice, but you will need to install ``devel/libexecinfo`` from ports
  or via `pkgng <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html>`_.

- On OpenBSD 5.4 or later, you will need to install ``gcc`` from ports
  (``lang/gcc``) or by using `pkg_add
  <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&sektion=1>`_ You
  will also need to install ``devel/libexecinfo``.

  When you run SCons, you will also need to pass additional
  arguments to ``scons`` to use the compiler from ports instead of the
  system compiler, i.e. ``--cc=egcc --cxx=eg++``.

Building With SCons
-------------------

Building the server executables consists of passing SCons a target; for
example, when we build the MongoDB database server executable:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons mongod

On Windows, this will instead be ``scons mongod.exe``.

Other executables you may need to build include :program:`mongos` or :program:`mongo`, depending
on what you are working on.
You can pass SCons multiple targets in a list if necessary:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons mongod mongo mongos

Alternatively, you may build everything, which includes
:program:`mongo`, :program:`mongod`, :program:`mongos`, and
all the C++ unit tests:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons all

All of these commands should be run from the root of the MongoDB repository.

.. note::

   If you are building an older version of MongoDB with a newer compiler,
   such as MongoDB 2.6 with Clang 3.5 on Mac OS X 10.10, you may need to
   include the ``--disable-warnings-as-errors`` option to your SCons
   invocation, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      scons all --disable-warnings-as-errors

   This ensures that novel warnings in newer compilers do not prevent you
   from building older versions of MongoDB.

While certain top level build artifacts (like :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos`) get copied to the top of the source tree during a
build, other files like the C++ unit tests are generated underneath a
subdirectory called ``build``. The ``build`` directory is created at the
top level of the source tree the first time you build anything.

Building can take a while, depending on which targets you are
building and the capabilities of your computer. Without getting into
all the intricacies of SCons, here are some flags to get you started:

- ``--help``
     This options provides help on both the intrinsic and local options. Read this.

- ``-j <N>`` This option controls the number of parallel jobs SCons will
  use. Depending on what the local hardware is, you probably want to set
  this from anything between 1 and 32. Keep in mind that this isn't just
  compilation, but also linking. Having 32 concurrent linking jobs
  running can make your machine pretty sluggish. Find a number that
  works for you, such as the number of cpus. When running on Windows
  machines, it is recommended to install either `pywin32
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ or `ActivePython
  <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_ if you wish to
  do parallel builds.

- ``--ssl``
     This option builds MongoDB with SSL support.  OpenSSL libraries and headers are required.  Note that you may also need to supply custom include and lib paths, if OpenSSL is not installed in a default location, or if you are building on Windows.  For example, on Windows, you might use: ``CPPPATH="d:\lib\ssl\include" LIBPATH="d:\lib\ssl\lib"``

The following table lists some SCons aliases that are helpful with testing:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Alias
     - Effect

   * - all
     - Builds everything (core and all tests)

   * - dbtest
     - Builds the ``dbtest`` program.

   * - lint
     - Runs the code linter

   * - msi
     - Builds the Windows MSI installer.

   * - core
     - Builds :program:`mongod`, :program:`mongos`, and the :program:`mongo` shell.

   * - install

     - Installs to the directory used with the ``--prefix`` option, or
       to ``/usr/local`` if no ``--prefix`` was specified.

   * - unittests
     
     - Builds the unit tests. The preferred way to run the unit tests
       is either with :ref:`resmoke.py <test-using-resmoke>` or by
       running the unit test executables. For examples, see
       :ref:`run-unit-tests`.

Windows Specific Instructions
-----------------------------

Install Git from http://git-scm.com. When you install git, choose
:guiLabel:`Checkout Windows-style commit Unix-style line endings`. This
will set the git option ``core.autocrlf`` to ``true``. To verify the
setting after installation, run the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

    git config --get core.autocrlf

SCons requires Python 2.7.x. On Windows, `ActiveState Python Community
Edition <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_ is
recommended to support parallel builds. Install either the 64-bit (x64)
or 32-bit (x86) version depending on the machine architecture.

To install SCons 2.3.4 with ActiveState Python Community Edition,
download the zip distribution of SCons, not the self-extracting exe
installer labelled Windows. You must use the zip file, because
self-extracting installer cannot find the 64-bit install of ActiveState
Python. Unpack the SCons zip file, and if Python is installed at the
default path, use the following command:

.. code-block:: none

   c:\python27\python.exe setup.py install

MongoDB version 3.0.x and up requires VS 2013.

Building with Visual Studio 2013
--------------------------------

To build with SCons, first start a ``VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command
Prompt``, and within this command shell environment, run the SCons
commands listed above.

In a typical Visual Studio installation, the batch file to set up the VS
2013 environment has the following path:

.. code-block:: none

    %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\vc\bin\amd64\vcvars64.bat

It is also available in the ``Visual Studio Tools`` folder in the Start
Menu.

If using Visual Studio 2013 Express and you receive scons error
regarding the unavailability of atomic types, you may need to install
`Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package
<http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=29>`_.
