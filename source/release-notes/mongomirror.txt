``mongomirror`` 0.13.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features and improvements:

- Updates Go version and other dependencies.
- Updates supported platforms.

This release also removes support for RHEL 6.2 and Ubuntu 14.04.

``mongomirror`` 0.13.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features and improvements:

- Allows migrating to MongoDB 6.0.
- Prevents migrating source replica sets that contain data in :manual:`time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>`.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue that caused delayed writes on restart.

Features and improvements:

- Updates signing tool to GaraSign.
- Updates the ``appName`` for ``mongomirror``'s source clusters 
  and destination clusters to be different so that they can 
  be distinguished in the telemetry.

This release also removes support for Debian 8.1, 
PPC64LE Ubuntu 16.04, and PPC64LE Ubuntu 18.04.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue with handling timeseries databases.
- Ignores the :term:`oplog` entry with the ``startRangeDeletion`` 
  identifier on the ``admin.system.version`` collection.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue where ``mongomirror`` would allow you to cut over to a
  MongoDB 4.2 destination cluster before the cluster was ready. The fix
  ensures that ``mongomirror`` waits for the index builds to complete on
  all cluster nodes during an initial sync before moving to oplog tailing
  and allowing you to start the cutover process.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue where ``mongomirror`` would ignore valid indexes as
  though they were duplicates due to ignoring options during index
  comparison.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features and improvements:

- Improves the retryability of transient connection issues.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features and improvements:

- Clarifies the error message that ``mongomirror`` returns when a
  collection exists on both the source and target 
  {+database-deployment+}.

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue where ``mongomirror`` returns the following error when 
  it attempts to build an index for a namespace that is not present 
  during an initial sync:

  .. code-block:: sh

     Failed to record index build progress: namespace `` does not have a collection progressor

``mongomirror`` 0.12.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes an issue handling large amounts of predated oplog entries.
- Fixes a bug where initial sync would fail if the last oplog entry applied
  during initial sync was a transaction operation.
- Fixes an issue where ``mongomirror`` detected resharding incorrectly, which
  caused false positives when checking the status of a reshard operation.

``mongomirror`` 0.12.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes:

- Fixes a connection issue introduced in ``mongomirror`` 0.12.0.
- Fixes a bug where only one legacy index option is removed if two or
  more legacy index options exist for a collection on the source database.
