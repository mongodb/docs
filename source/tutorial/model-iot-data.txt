The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that are
connected to the internet. Many of these devices, like sensors, generate
data.

To store and retrieve this data efficiently, you can use the bucket
pattern.

The Bucket Pattern
------------------

A common method to organize IoT data is to group the data
into buckets. Bucketing organizes specific groups of data to help:

- Discover historical trends,
- Forecast future trends, and
- Optimize storage usage.

Common parameters to group data by are:

- time
- data source (if you have multiple data sets)
- customer
- type of data (for example, transaction type in financial data)

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`time series collections
   <manual-timeseries-collection>` are the recommended collection type
   for time series data. Do **not** use the bucket pattern in
   conjunction with time series collections as this can degrade
   performance.

Consider a collection that stores temperature data obtained from a
sensor. The sensor records the temperature every minute and
stores the data in a collection called ``temperatures``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // temperatures collection

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "sensor_id": 12345,
     "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
     "temperature": 40
   }
   {
     "_id": 2,
     "sensor_id": 12345,
     "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:01:00.000Z"),
     "temperature": 40
   }
   {
     "_id": 3,
     "sensor_id": 12345,
     "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:02:00.000Z"),
     "temperature": 41
   }
   ...

This approach does not scale well in terms of data and index size. For
example, if the application requires indexes on the ``sensor_id`` and
``timestamp`` fields, every incoming reading from the sensor would need
to be indexed to improve performance.

You can leverage the document model to bucket the data into documents
that hold the measurements for a particular timespan. Consider
the following updated schema which buckets the readings taken
every minute into hour-long groups:

.. _bucket-example-doc:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": 1,
     "sensor_id": 12345,
     "start_date": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
     "end_date": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:59:59.000Z"),
     "measurements": [
       {
         "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:00:00.000Z"),
         "temperature": 40
       },
       {
         "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:01:00.000Z"),
         "temperature": 40
       },
       ...
       {
         "timestamp": ISODate("2019-01-31T10:42:00.000Z"),
         "temperature": 42
       }
     ],
     "transaction_count": 42,
     "sum_temperature": 1783
   }

This updated schema improves scalability and mirrors how the application
actually uses the data. A user likely wouldn't query for a specific
temperature reading. Instead, a user would likely query for temperature
behavior over the course of an hour or day. The Bucket pattern helps
facilitate those queries by grouping the data into uniform time periods.

Combine the Computed and Bucket Patterns
````````````````````````````````````````

The :ref:`example document <bucket-example-doc>` contains two computed
fields: ``transaction_count`` and ``sum_temperature``. If the
application frequently needs to retrieve the sum of temperatures for a
given hour, computing a running total of the sum can help save
application resources. This Computed Pattern approach eliminates the
need to calculate the sum each time the data is requested.

The pre-aggregated ``sum_temperature`` and ``transaction_count`` values
enable further computations such as the average temperature
(``sum_temperature`` / ``transaction_count``) for a particular bucket.
It is much more likely that users will query the application for
the average temperature between 2:00 and 3:00 PM rather than querying
for the specific temperature at 2:03 PM. Bucketing and pre-computing
certain values allows the application to more readily provide that
information.

Time Representations in MongoDB
-------------------------------

MongoDB :ref:`stores times in UTC <document-bson-type-date>` by default,
and converts any local time representations into this form.
Applications that must operate or report on some unmodified local time
value may store the time zone alongside the UTC timestamp, and compute
the original local time in their application logic.

Example
-------

In the MongoDB shell, you can store both the current date and the
current client's offset from UTC.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var now = new Date();
   db.data.insertOne( { date: now,
                   offset: now.getTimezoneOffset() } );

You can reconstruct the original local time by applying the saved
offset:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var record = db.data.findOne();
   var localNow = new Date( record.date.getTime() -  ( record.offset * 60000 ) );
