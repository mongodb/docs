Review Alert Conditions
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: twocols

This page describes the conditions for which you can trigger alerts
related to your {+database-deployments+}. You specify conditions and 
thresholds when :doc:`configuring alerts </configure-alerts>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-free-shared-alerts.rst

Host Alerts
-----------

The conditions in this section apply if you select :guilabel:`Host` as
the alert target when configuring the alert. You can apply the
condition to all hosts or to specific type of host, such as
:term:`primaries <primary>` or
:term:`config servers <config server>`.

Advisor
~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host has index suggestions

   Sends an alert if :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`
   has index suggestions for the host.

   If the :ref:`query targeting ratio <query-targeting-resolution>` for
   a host is high for a period of 10 minutes, Performance Advisor 
   checks the host for inefficient queries and possible indexes to 
   improve performance. If Performance Advisor determines that the host 
   benefits from one or more indexes, this alert triggers and directs 
   you to create the suggested indexes.

   This alert is only available for ``M10+`` clusters, and is enabled
   by default for ``M10+`` clusters that have
   :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` enabled. This alert
   does not trigger for clusters where Performance Advisor is disabled.

Asserts
~~~~~~~

The following alert conditions measure the rate of asserts for a
MongoDB process, as collected from the MongoDB ``serverStatus``
command's :serverstatus:`asserts` document. You can view asserts
through :doc:`cluster monitoring </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

.. alert:: Asserts: Regular is

   Sends an alert if the rate of regular asserts meets the specified
   threshold.

   Sends an alert if the rate of warnings meets the specified
   threshold.

   threshold. Message asserts are internal server errors. Stack traces
   are logged for these.

System and Disk Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   constant rate to provide a guaranteed level of performance. These
   credits can be used for additional CPU performance. When the credit
   balance is exhausted, only the guaranteed baseline of CPU
   performance is provided, and the amount of excess is shown as steal
   percent.

   .. note::

      |service| triggers this alert only for AWS EC2 clusters that
      support :aws:`Burstable Performance </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`.

Host Down
~~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host is Down
   
   Sends an alert if |service| is unable to reach a host for several
   minutes.

   .. important::

      You should only configure this alert if you depend on secondary
      reads. For more information on secondary reads, see
      :ref:`replica-set-tags` and :ref:`replica-set-read-preference`.

   This alert is generally triggered by one of the following
   conditions:

   - The cluster has experienced a failure and is being auto-healed.
   - The cluster could not be reached because of a network issue.

   |service-fullname| checks that the downtime did not occur because of
   your actions, such as :manual:`rolling index builds
   </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>`. If |service-fullname| confirms
   that the downtime was not intentional, |service-fullname| attempts to replace
   the affected node. If failures occur, |service| clusters maintain node
   availability for both reads and writes as long as a majority of nodes are
   running. To learn more, see :ref:`How does MongoDB Atlas deliver high
   availability? <high-availability>`.
