   At the operating system shell prompt restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   as a standalone instance.

   .. tabs::

           name: Configuration File
           content: |

              If you are using a configuration file, make the following
              configuration updates:

              - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.

              - Change the :setting:`net.port` to a different port.
                Make a note of the original port setting as a comment.
                
              - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
                ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

              - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
                :term:`config server` member, you must also:

                - Comment out the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option.

                - Set parameter :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks`
                  (also available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
                  ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

              For example, if performing maintenance on a shard/config
              server replica set member for maintenance, the updated
              configuration file will include content like the
              following example:

              .. code-block:: yaml

                 net:
                    bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>
                    port: 27218
                 #   port: 27018

                 #sharding:
                 #   clusterRole: shardsvr
                 setParameter:
                    skipShardingConfigurationChecks: true
                    disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh: true

         - id: command-line
           name: Command-line Options
           content: |

              If using command-line options, make the following
              configuration updates to restart:

              - Remove :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`.

              - Modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` to a different port.

              - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
                ``true`` in the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
                --setParameter>` option.

              - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
                :term:`config server` member, you must also:

                - Remove :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>` if a
                  shard member and :option:`--configsvr <mongod
                  --configsvr>` if a config server member.
  
                - Set parameter
                  :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks` (also
                  available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
                  ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

  
              For example, to restart a replica set member that is not part of a sharded cluster:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongod --port 27218 --dbpath /srv/mongodb --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true

              For example, to restart a shard/config server replica set member for maintenance:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongod --port 27218 --dbpath /srv/mongodb --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --setParameter skipShardingConfigurationChecks=true --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true

   Always start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the same user, even when
   restarting a replica set member as a standalone instance.

  While the member is a standalone, use :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to
  perform maintenance:
action:
  language: sh
  code: mongo --port 27218
post: |
   .. important::

      While the member is a standalone, no writes are replicated to
      this member nor are writes on this member replicated to the other
      members of the replica set.

      Ensure that any writes on this standalone do not conflict with
      oplog writes that will be applied to the member when it rejoins
      the replica set.

title: Restart ``mongod`` as a member of the replica set.
stepnum: 4

  After performing all maintenance tasks, use the following procedure
  to restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a member of the replica set
  on its usual port.
action:
  - pre: |
      From :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, shut down the standalone
      server after completing the maintenance:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       use admin
       db.shutdownServer()
  - pre: |
 
      Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a replica set
      member with its original configuration; that is, undo the
      configuration changes made when starting as a standalone.

      .. tip::

         Be sure to remove the ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
         parameter.
         
         For shard or config server members, be sure to remove the
         :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks` parameter.

      When it has started, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the
      restarted instance.

  - pre: |
      The secondary takes time to :doc:`catch up to the primary
      </core/replica-set-sync>`. From :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use the
      following command to verify that the member has caught up from the
      :replstate:`RECOVERING` state to the :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.
    language: javascript
    code: rs.status()

title: Perform maintenance on the primary last.
stepnum: 5
ref: maintenance-on-primary
content: |

   a. To perform maintenance on the primary after completing
      maintenance tasks on all secondaries, connect
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary and use
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and allow one of
      the secondaries to be elected the new primary. Specify a 300
      second waiting period to prevent the member from being elected
      primary again for five minutes:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown(300)

      After the primary steps down, the replica set will :ref:`elect a
      new primary <replica-set-elections>`.

   b. Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a standalone instance, making
      the following configuration updates.

   .. tabs::

              If you are using a configuration file, make the following
              configuration updates:

              - Comment out the :setting:`replication.replSetName` option.

              - Change the :setting:`net.port` to a different port.
                Make a note of the original port setting as a comment.

              - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
                ``true`` in the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
                --setParameter>` option.


              - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
                :term:`config server` member, you must also:

                - Comment out the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option.

                - Set parameter :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks`
                  (also available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
                  ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

              For example, if performing maintenance on a shard/config
              server replica set member for maintenance, the updated
              configuration file will include content like the
              following example:

              .. code-block:: yaml

                 net:

                 #   replSetName: shardA
                 #sharding:
                 #   clusterRole: shardsvr
                 setParameter:
                    skipShardingConfigurationChecks: true

              If using command-line options, make the following
              configuration updates:

              - Remove :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`.

              - Modify :option:`--port <mongod --port>` to a different port.

              - Set parameter ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh`` to
                ``true`` in the :option:`--setParameter <mongod
                --setParameter>` option.

              - If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`shard` or
                :term:`config server` member, you must also:

                - Remove :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>` if a
                  shard member and :option:`--configsvr <mongod
                  --configsvr>` if a config server member.
  
                - Set parameter
                  :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks` (also
                  available for MongoDB 3.6.3+, 3.4.11+, 3.2.19+) to
                  ``true`` in the :setting:`setParameter` section.

  
              For example, to restart a replica set member that is not part of a sharded cluster:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongod --port 27218 --dbpath /srv/mongodb --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true

              For example, to restart a shard/config server replica set member for maintenance:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongod --port 27218 --dbpath /srv/mongodb --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --setParameter skipShardingConfigurationChecks=true --setParameter disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh=true

              .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   c. Perform maintentance task on the now standalone.

      .. important::

         While the member is a standalone, no writes are replicated to
         this member nor are writes on this member replicated to the other
         members of the replica set.

         Ensure that any writes on this standalone do not conflict with
         oplog writes that will be applied to the member when it rejoins
         the replica set.
   
   d. After performing all maintenance tasks, restart the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a replica set member with its
      original configuration; that is, undo the configuration changes made
      when starting as a standalone.

      .. tip::

         Be sure to remove the ``disableLogicalSessionCacheRefresh``
         parameter.

         For shard or config server members, be sure to remove the
         :parameter:`skipShardingConfigurationChecks` parameter.
