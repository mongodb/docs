Definition
----------

.. expression:: exists

   The ``exists`` operator tests if a path to a specified indexed field
   name exists in a document. If the specified field exists but is not
   indexed, the document is not included with the result set.
   ``exists`` is often used as part of a :ref:`compound <compound-ref>`
   query in conjunction with other search clauses.

.. _exists-syntax:

Syntax
------

``exists`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
       "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
       "exists": {
         "path": "<field-to-test-for>",
         "score": <options>
       }
     }
   }

.. _exists-options:

Options
-------

``exists`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 60 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Required?

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Indexed field to search.
     - yes

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - Score to assign to matching search results. To learn more
       about the options to modify the default score, see 
       :ref:`scoring-ref`.
     - no

.. _exists-query-score:

Scoring Behavior 
----------------

|fts| assigns a :ref:`scoring-constant` score of ``1`` for all the
documents in the result set. You can customize the default |fts| score
using the ``score`` options. To learn more about modifying the default
score returned by |fts|, see :ref:`scoring-options`.

Examples
--------

You can try the following examples in the {+playground+} or your
cluster. 

.. _exists-eg-collection:

Sample Collection 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use a collection called ``fruit`` that contains
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   },
   { "_id" : 3,
     "type": "apple",
     "description" : "Apple pie and apple cobbler are popular apple-based desserts."
   },
   { "_id" : 4,
     "description" : "Types of citrus fruit include lemons, oranges, and grapefruit.",
     "quantities" : {
       "lemons": 200,
       "oranges": 240,
       "grapefruit": 160
     }
   }

.. _exists-eg-index:

Sample Index 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``fruit`` collection has a default :ref:`dynamic
<static-dynamic-mappings>` |fts| index that uses the default
:ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer. The ``standard``
analyzer lower-cases all words and disregards common stop words
(``"the", "a", "and",`` etc).

.. _exists-eg-queries:

Sample Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following queries demonstrate the ``exists`` operator in |fts|
queries.

Basic Example
`````````````

The following example searches for documents which include a field
named ``type``. 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "exists": {
           "path": "type"
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the first three documents of the collection.
The document with ``_id: 4`` is not included because it does not have a
``type`` field.

Embedded Example
````````````````

Use dot notation to search for embedded fields. The following example
searches for documents which have a field named ``lemons`` embedded
within a field named ``quantities``. 

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 
   
   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.fruit.aggregate([
        {
          "$search": {
            "exists": {
              "path": "quantities.lemons"
            }
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id" : 4,
        "description" : "Types of citrus fruit include lemons, oranges, and grapefruit.",
        "quantities" : {
          "lemons": 200,
          "oranges": 240,
          "grapefruit": 160
        }
      }

Compound Example
````````````````

The following example uses ``exists`` as part of a
:ref:`compound <compound-ref>` query. 

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 
   
   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.fruit.aggregate([
        {
          $search: {
            "compound": {
              "must": [
                {
                  "exists": {
                    "path": "type"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "text": {
                    "query": "apple",
                    "path": "type"
                  }
                }],
              "should": {
                "text": {
                  "query": "fuji",
                  "path": "description"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:
      :visible: false

      {
        "_id" : 1,
        "type" : "apple",
        "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
      }
      {
        "_id" : 3,
        "type" : "apple",
        "description" : "Apple pie and apple cobbler are popular apple-based desserts."
      }

Both documents have a ``type`` field, and both include the search term
``apple``. The document with ``_id: 1`` is returned first because it
satisfies the :data:`should` clause.
