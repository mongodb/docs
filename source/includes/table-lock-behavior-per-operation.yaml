op1: Issue a query
lock1: Read lock
op2: Get more data from a :term:`cursor`
lock2: Read lock
op3: Insert data
lock3: Write lock
op4: Remove data
lock4: Write lock
op5: Update data
lock5: Write lock
op6: :term:`Map-reduce <map-reduce>`
lock6: |
       Read lock and write lock, unless operations are specified as
       non-atomic. Portions of map-reduce jobs can run concurrently.
op7: Create an index
lock7: |
       Building an index in the foreground, which is the default, locks
       the database for extended periods of time.
op8: |
   :method:`db.eval()`

   .. deprecated:: 3.0

lock8: |
       Write lock. The :method:`db.eval()` method takes a global write
       lock while evaluating the JavaScript function. 
       To avoid taking this global write lock, you can
       use the :dbcommand:`eval` command with ``nolock: true``.

op9: |
  :dbcommand:`eval`

  .. deprecated:: 3.0

lock9: |
       Write lock. By default, :dbcommand:`eval` command takes a global
       write lock while evaluating the JavaScript function. If used
       with ``nolock: true``, the :dbcommand:`eval`
       command does *not* take a global write lock while evaluating
       the JavaScript function. However, the logic within the
       JavaScript function may take write locks for write operations.

op10: :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()`
lock10: Read lock
