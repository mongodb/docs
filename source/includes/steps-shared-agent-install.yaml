     If the agent will connect to MMS via a proxy server, you must specify
     the server in the ``http_proxy`` environment variable. To specify the
     server, use the ``export`` command, as in the following example:
   language: sh
   code: |
     export http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:9000"

   To connect through a proxy, you must install the agent from a
   ``.tar.gz`` file, *not* from a ``.deb`` or ``.rpm`` file.
