Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform **compound operations** with
the MongoDB Kotlin driver. 

Compound operations consist of a read and write operation performed as one
**atomic operation**. An atomic operation is an operation which either completes
entirely, or does not complete at all. Atomic operations cannot partially complete.

Atomic operations can help you avoid **race conditions** in your code. A
race condition occurs when your code's behavior is dependent on the order of
uncontrollable events.

MongoDB supports the following compound operations:

- Find and update one document
- Find and replace one document
- Find and delete one document

If you need to perform more complex tasks atomically, such as reading and
writing to more than one document, use **transactions**. Transactions are a
feature of MongoDB and other databases that lets you define an arbitrary
sequence of database commands as an atomic operation.  

For more information on atomic operations and atomicity, see 
:manual:`the MongoDB manual entry for atomicity and transactions </core/write-operations-atomicity/>`.

For more information on transactions, see
:manual:`the MongoDB manual entry for transactions </core/transactions/>`.

How to Use Compound Operations
------------------------------

This section shows how to use each compound operation with the MongoDB Kotlin Driver.

The following examples use a collection containing these two sample documents.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    {"_id": 1, "food": "donut", "color": "green"}
    {"_id": 2, "food": "pear", "color": "yellow"}

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.compound-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note:: Before or After the Write?

   By default, each compound operation returns your found document in the state
   before your write operation. You can retrieve your found document in the
   state after your write operation by using the options class corresponding to
   your compound operation. You can see an example of this configuration in the 
   :ref:`Find and Replace example below <kotlin-find-and-replace-example>`.

Find and Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find and update one document, use the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method of the
``MongoCollection`` class. The ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method returns your found
document or ``null`` if no documents match your query.

Example
^^^^^^^

The following example uses the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method to find a
document with the ``color`` field set to ``"green"`` and  update the
``food`` field in that document to ``"pizza"``. 

The example also uses a ``FindOneAndUpdateOptions`` instance to specify the
following options:

- Specify an upsert, which inserts the document specified by the query filter if no documents match the query.
- Set a maximum execution time of 5 seconds for this operation on the MongoDB
  instance. If the operation takes longer, the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method
  will throw a ``MongoExecutionTimeoutException``.  

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.find-one-update.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      FoodOrder(id=1, food=donut, color=green)

For more information on the ``Projections`` class, see our
:doc:`guide on the Projections builder </fundamentals/builders/projections/>`.

For more information on the upsert operation, see our 
:doc:`guide on upserts </fundamentals/crud/write-operations/upsert/>`.

- `MongoExecutionTimeoutException <{+core-api+}/MongoExecutionTimeoutException.html>`__

.. _kotlin-find-and-replace-example:

Find and Replace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find and replace one document, use the ``findOneAndReplace()`` method of the
``MongoCollection`` class. The ``findOneAndReplace()`` method returns your found
document or ``null`` if no documents match your query.

Example
^^^^^^^

The following example uses the ``findOneAndReplace()`` method to find a
document with the ``color`` field set to ``"green"`` and  replace it
with the following document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {"music": "classical", "color": "green"}

The example also uses a ``FindOneAndReplaceOptions`` instance to specify that
the returned document should be in the state after our replace operation.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.find-one-replace.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      Music(id=1, music=classical, color=green)

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `findOneAndReplace() <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/find-one-and-replace.html>`__
- `FindOneAndReplaceOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/FindOneAndReplaceOptions.html>`__

Find and Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find and delete one document, use the ``findOneAndDelete()`` method of the
``MongoCollection`` class. The ``findOneAndDelete()`` method returns your found
document or ``null`` if no documents match your query.

Example
^^^^^^^

The following example uses the ``findOneAndDelete()`` method to find and
delete the document with the largest value in the ``_id`` field.

The example uses a ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` instance to specify a
descending sort on the ``_id`` field.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.find-one-delete.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language: console

      FoodOrder(id=2, food=pear, color=yellow)

For more information on the ``Sorts`` class, see our
:doc:`guide on the Sorts builder </fundamentals/builders/sort/>`.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `findOneAndDelete() <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/find-one-and-delete.html>`__
- `FindOneAndDeleteOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/FindOneAndDeleteOptions.html>`__

Avoiding a Race Condition
-------------------------

In this section we explore two examples. The first example contains a
race condition, the second example uses a compound operation to
avoid the race condition present in the first example.

For both examples, let's imagine that we run a hotel with one room and that we
have a small Kotlin program to help us checkout this room to a guest.  

The following document in MongoDB represents the room:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    {"_id": 1, "guest": null, "room": "Blue Room", "reserved": false}

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.room-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

Example With Race Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say our app uses this ``bookARoomUnsafe`` method to checkout our room to
a guest:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.unsafe.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 3,14

Imagine two separate guests, Jan and Pat, try to book the room with this method
at the same time.

Jan sees this output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   You got the Blue Room, Jan

And Pat sees this output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   You got the Blue Room, Pat

When we look at our database, we see the following: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    {"_id": 1, "guest": "Jan", "room": "Blue Room", "reserved": false}

Pat will be unhappy. When Pat shows up to our hotel, Jan will be
occupying her room. What went wrong?

Here is the sequence of events that happened from the perspective of our MongoDB
instance:

#. Find and return an empty room for Jan.
#. Find and return an empty room for Pat.
#. Update the room to booked for Pat.
#. Update the room to booked for Jan.

Notice that for a brief moment Pat had reserved the room, but as Jan's update
operation was the last to execute our document has ``"Jan"`` as the guest. 

Example Without Race Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's use a compound operation to avoid the race condition and
always give our users the correct message. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CompoundTest.snippet.safe.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 7

Imagine two separate guests, Jan and Pat, try to book the room with this method
at the same time.

Jan sees this output:

.. code-block:: console
   :copyable: false

   You got the Blue Room, Jan

And Pat sees this output:

.. code-block:: console
   :copyable: false

   Sorry, we are booked, Pat

When we look at our database, we see the following: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    {"_id": 1, "guest": "Jan", "room": "Blue Room", "reserved": false}
 
Pat got the correct message. While she might be sad she didn't get the
reservation, at least she knows not to travel to our hotel.

Here is the sequence of events that happened from the perspective of our MongoDB
instance:

#. Find an empty room for Jan and reserve it.
#. Try to find an empty room for Pat and reserve it.
#. When there are not any rooms left, return ``null``. 

.. important:: Write Lock

   Your MongoDB instance places a write lock on the document you are modifying
   for the duration of your compound operation. 

For information on the ``Updates`` class, see our
:doc:`guide on the Updates builder </fundamentals/builders/updates/>`.

For more information of the ``Filters`` class, see our
:doc:`guide on the Filters builder </fundamentals/builders/filters/>`.

For more information on the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method, see 
the API Documentation for the `MongoCollection class <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/index.html>`__.
