:manual:`Aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` transform
your documents into an aggregated set of results. In |charts|,
aggregation pipelines are commonly used to visualize new fields created
from calculated results of pre-existing fields, but also have many other
applications.

To create an aggregation pipeline:

1. In the :guilabel:`Query` bar, input an aggregation pipeline. Your
   pipeline must be in square brackets.

#. (Optional) Select :guilabel:`Format` to arrange the query as 
   follows: 

   -  Split the query across multiple lines
   -  Indent the query as per JSON conventions

#. (Conditional) If you selected the :guilabel:`Format` option, click 
   :guilabel:`Close` when you finish. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to execute your pipeline.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following chart shows total sale amounts from an office supply
company, categorized by store location. The chart uses the
following aggregation pipeline in the :guilabel:`Query` bar:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     {
       $unwind: "$items"
     },
     {
       $addFields: {
         saleAmount: {
           $multiply: [ "$items.price", "$items.quantity" ]
         }
       }
     }
   ]

This aggregation pipeline processes the collection data using
the following order:

1. The :pipeline:`$unwind` stage unwinds the ``items`` array and
   outputs a new document for each item in the array. Each element
   in the ``items`` array contains a single item sold during a
   transaction.

#. The :pipeline:`$addFields` stage adds a new field to the
   documents called ``saleAmount``. The :expression:`$multiply`
   expression sets the value of ``saleAmount`` to the product of
   ``items.price`` and ``items.quantity``. You can see this
   new field highlighted in the following screenshot:

Once the data has been processed using the pipeline, the
chart displays the :guilabel:`Sum` of all
``saleAmounts`` categorized by store location.

Address Aggregation Pipeline Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your aggregation is invalid, |charts-short| displays the
:icon-fa4:`exclamation-triangle` icon in the :guilabel:`Query` bar.

Click the :guilabel:`Query` bar if it is not already displayed to view
error details. |charts-short| displays error details for:

- Client-side errors, such as malformed JSON, and
- Server-side errors, such as invalid :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query
  Language)` or unsupported pipeline stages.

   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Example Aggregation Pipeline Error

Review the error details, then adjust your aggregation pipeline
accordingly.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- |charts-short| doesn't support the :pipeline:`$lookup` operator in aggregation 
  queries. However, you can use this operator in Data Source pipelines. 
  To learn more about how to use pipelines to pre-process data before 
  it reaches the Chart Builder, see :ref:`data-sources-pipeline`.

- |charts-short| supports the :expression:`$function` operator only when 
  you define the function body in a single line and 
  wrap it in double quotes. To use this operator in your aggregation 
  queries, you must use the following syntax:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       $function: {
         body: "function(arg1, arg2, ...) { ... }",
         args: <array expression>,
         lang: "js"
       }
     }
