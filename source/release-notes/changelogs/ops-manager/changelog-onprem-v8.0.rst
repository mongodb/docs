Improvements
`````````````

- Updates the {+mdbagent+} to :ref:`108.0.2.8729-1 <mongodb-108.0.2.8729-1>`.

  to dynamically modify the number of iterations for the hashing algorithm.
- Adds the following fields to the :ref:`snapshot APIs <snapshots-api>`:
  ``machineId``, ``name``, ``completedTime``, ``fcv``, and ``replicaState``.

Bug Fixes
```````````

Fixes the following issues:

- User invite API didn't respect the :setting:`mms.user.bypassInviteForExistingUsers` settings.
- Deployments from deleted groups caused MongoDB version validation to fail and prevented the |onprem| upgrade.
- Arbiter nodes caused the :guilabel:`Edit Namespace filter` option in the UI to not be visible.
- Topology change requests couldn't be processed when backup wasn't enabled.
- The {+mdbagent+} couldn't download the correct |bic-full| versions on certain platforms.
- When deploying |onprem| in hybrid mode, ``.tmp`` files could be left behind unintentionally.
- The {+mdbagent+} could incorrectly report that goal state was reached
  while encountering a transient error.
