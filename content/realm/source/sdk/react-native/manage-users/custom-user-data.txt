You can read arbitrary data about your application users, known as
custom user data, directly within your React Native application. For example,
you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or local
timezone.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can work with custom user data from your React Native app,
you must enable it in your App Services App. To learn more,
refer to :ref:`Enable Custom User Data <enable-custom-user-data-procedure>`.

Read Custom User Data
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/custom-data-may-be-stale.rst

If you have not recently updated your custom user data, use the user object's :js-sdk:`customData
<Realm.User.html#customData>` field. The ``customData`` field is read only.

If you have updated your custom user data within the last 30 minutes,
use :js-sdk:`User.refreshCustomData() <Realm.User.html#refreshCustomData>`.

.. _react-native-write-custom-user-data:

Write Custom User Data
----------------------

You can write to a user's custom user data with :ref:`MongoDB Data Access <react-native-mongodb-data-access>`.

Your write operations must include the :js-sdk:`User.id <Realm.User.html#id>`
in the **User ID Field** you set when configuring custom user data in the App backend.
If you don't include the user ID in the User ID Field, the data that you write
will not be linked to the user's custom user data.
