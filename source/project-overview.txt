The project overview is a landing page for your |service| project that
displays modules that contain common |service| actions. The
overview makes it easy to find resources and manage your
{+database-deployments+} from the |service| home page.

To navigate to the project overview, click :guilabel:`Overview` in the
sidebar in |service|. If |service| doesn't display an
:guilabel:`Overview` option, you must first 
:ref:`enable the overview <enable-project-overview>` for your
project. If you disable the project overview, |service| displays
:guilabel:`Clusters` as the project landing page.

Project Overview Content
------------------------

Some of the modules that the project overview displays include but are 
not limited to:

Application Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application development module provides resources to connect to 
your {+database-deployments+} with the official MongoDB libraries.
If you've already connected to an app with a driver, |service| displays
recent connections in this module.

.. note::

   If you don't see your app listed, set the :manual:`appName 
   </reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.appName>`
   in your connection string to match your {+database-deployment+} name
   and connect to your deployment. It may take up to one hour after
   connection for your app to show on the project overview.
   
   For example, if your {+cluster+} is named ``myCluster``, you would add ``&appName=myCluster`` as
   shown in the following connection string:

   .. code-block::

      mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@myCluster.abc12.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=myCluster


Required Access
---------------

To enable or disable the project overview, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` access to |service|.

.. _enable-project-overview:

Enable the Project Overview
---------------------------

|service| enables the overview by default. You can reenable the
overview if you previously disabled it.

Follow these steps to enable the project overview. 
After you enable the overview, the :guilabel:`Overview` option
displays in the sidebar for all users in the project.

.. include:: /includes/steps-enable-project-overview.rst


.. _disable-project-overview:

Disable the Project Overview
----------------------------

Follow these steps to disable the project overview. After you disable 
the overview, the following changes apply for all users in the project:

- The :guilabel:`Overview` option doesn't display in the 
  sidebar for this project.
- :guilabel:`Clusters` becomes the project landing page.
