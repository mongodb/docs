Overview
--------

In order for |mms| to monitor, deploy, or back up a MongoDB deployment
that uses SSL, you must enable SSL for the |mms| group. The SSL settings
apply to **all** deployments managed by |mms|.

.. only:: onprem

   Starting with |onprem| 1.8, |mms| automatically configures the
   Monitoring and Backup agents to connect to the managed deployment over SSL
   when you activate SSL for the |mms| group. You no longer need to
   manually configure the agents' SSL settings.
   
   If you are not using automation for a deployment, you can still
   configure the monitoring and backup agents manually. See:
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ssl` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ssl` for more information.

For information on other group-wide settings, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-group`.

Procedures
----------

.. warning::

   For MongoDB 2.6 and below, you must use the MongoDB Enterprise
   Edition, which includes SSL, or add a custom build with SSL enabled.
   To configure the available MongoDB versions, see:
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version`.

Ensure Existing Deployments are Using SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to enable SSL for |a-mms| group that includes MongoDB
deployments, use the following procedure to ensure that the MongoDB
deployments are configured to use SSL:

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-existing-deployment.rst

Enable SSL for the Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can manage both SSL and non-SSL MongoDB deployments in the same group.

.. only:: onprem

   .. important::

      *Prior to* |onprem| version 2.0.3, if you enable SSL, all MongoDB
      deployments in the group that are managed by |mms| must use SSL.
