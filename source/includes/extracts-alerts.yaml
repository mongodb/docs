  For each :doc:`group </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>` or
  :doc:`global </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` alert you create, you must
  set a target and a condition or metric. The *target* points to what changed:
  the |mms| component. If your *condition* becomes true or a *metric* meets
  your set threshold, |mms| triggers an alert.

     * - Backup Agent has too many conf call failures
       - The cluster topology known to monitoring does not match the backup
         configuration from :term:`conf calls <conf call>` the Backup Agent
         makes. 

         The number of attempts meets the threshold you specified in
         :setting:`maximumFailedConfCalls
         <mms.alerts.BackupAgentConfCallFailure.maximumFailedConfCalls>`
         setting.

     * - Backup could not be assigned to a backup daemon

       - A backup job fails to bind to a Backup Daemon. 

         .. example::

            Reasons that a job might fail to bind include, but are not limited
            to:

            - No :term:`primary` is found for the backed-up replica set. At
              the time the binding occurred, the Monitoring Agent did not
              detect a primary. Ensure that the replica set is healthy.
     
            - Not enough space is available on any Backup Daemon.

            In both cases, resolve the issue and then :doc:`restart the
            initial sync of the backup </tutorial/enable-backup>`.

            As an alternative, you can manually bind jobs to daemons through
            the :guilabel:`Admin` interface. See :ref:`jobs-page` for more
            information.

         .. note:: :doc:`Global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` only

     * - Backup has reached a high number of retries

       - Sends an alert if the same task fails repeatedly. This could happen,
         for example, during maintenance. :ref:`Check the corresponding job
         log <jobs-page>` for an error message explaining the problem.

         Contact MongoDB Support if you need help interpreting the error message.

         .. note:: :doc:`Global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` only

     * - Backup is in an unexpected state

       - Something unexpected happened and the Backup state for the replica
         set is ``broken``. You must resync the backed-up replica set, as
         described in the :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup` procedure.

         In case of a :alert:`Backup is in an unexpected state` alert,
         :ref:`check the corresponding job log <jobs-page>` for an error message
         explaining the problem. Contact MongoDB Support if you need help
         interpreting the error message.

         .. note:: :doc:`Global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` only

     * - Replica set has a late snapshot

       - A snapshot has failed to complete before the next snapshot is
         scheduled to begin. :ref:`Check the job log <jobs-page>` in the |mms|
         Admin interface for any errors.

         .. note:: :doc:`Global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` only

     * - Sync slice transfer has not progressed in...

       - An :term:`initial sync` has started but then subsequently stalled.
         Issues that can cause this, include, but are not limited to:

         - processes that are down (agents, ingest, backing databases)
         - network issues
         - incorrect authentication credentials

         .. note:: :doc:`Global alert </tutorial/manage-global-alerts>` only

     * - Backup job is busy for...

       - One backup job has been working for more hours within a 24-hour
         period than your specified threshold.

         Different backup jobs share :term:`Backup Daemons <Backup Daemon>` or
         :term:`snapshot stores <snapshot store>`. Backup job execution time
         can vary. Long running backup jobs can cause the remaining jobs to
         fall behind or fail. Set this metric to how long you expect backups
         should take to complete in your deployment.

         You should :ref:`check the corresponding job log <jobs-page>` for error
         messages. Contact MongoDB Support if you need help interpreting the
         error message.

     * - Host is exposed to the public Internet

       - The host is exposed to the public Internet. When configured, |mms|
         tries to make a socket connection to your hosts. If |mms| is able to
         connect, |mms| triggers the alert because the host is not behind a
         firewall and does not have authentication enabled.
           
         |mms| runs this check once each day.

         This is a weak security validation and should not replace other
         auditing or intrusion detection system procedures.

     * - Host is down
       - |mms| does not receive a ping from a host for more than 9 minutes.
         Under normal operation, the Monitoring Agent connects to each
         monitored host about once per minute. |mms| waits 9 minutes before
         triggering the alert to minimize false positives, as would occur
         during a host restart.

         If the host continues to be unreachable, the Monitoring Agent
         eventually reduces ping frequency to every 5 minutes for a
         :program:`mongod` and every 20 minutes for a :program:`mongos`. If a
         :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` again becomes reachable, |mms|
         recognizes the process within 5 minutes.

         .. note::
            If you need to trigger the Monitoring Agent to check immediately,
            you can restart the agent.

         If |mms| Automation does not manage a :program:`mongos` process and
         that process remains unreachable for 30 days, |mms| removes the
         process from the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab. However, if you restart
         the :program:`mongos` process, |mms| detects it within 2 minutes.

         To resolve this alert, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/host-down`.
