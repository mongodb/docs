Connection Guide
================

This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment using the Node.js driver.

--------------
Connection URI
--------------

The **connection URI** is the set of instructions that the driver uses to
connect to a MongoDB deployment. It instructs the driver on how it should
connect to MongoDB and how it should behave while connected. The following
example shows each part of the connection URI:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/connection_string_parts.png


In this example, for the protocol, we use ``mongodb+srv`` which specifies the
:manual:`DNS Seedlist Connection Format
</reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`. This indicates
that the hostname following it corresponds to the DNS SRV record of your
MongoDB instance or deployment. If your instance or deployment does not have a
DNS SRV record, use ``mongodb`` to specify the :manual:`Standard Connection
Format </reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format>`.

.. note::

   If your deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, follow the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide <driver-connection?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

The next part of the connection string contains your username and password
if you are using password-based authentication. Replace the value of ``user``
with your username and ``pass`` with your password. If you are using an
authentication mechanism that does not require a username and password, omit
this part of the connection URI.

The next part of the connection string specifies the hostname or IP address and
port of your MongoDB instance. In the example above, we use ``sample-hostname``
as the hostname and ``27017`` as the port. Replace these values to point to
your MongoDB instance.

The last part of the connection string contains connection and authentication
options as parameters. In the example above, we set two connection options:
``poolSize=20`` and ``w=majority``. For more information on connection
options, skip to the :ref:`connection-options` section.

The code below shows how you can use the sample connection URI in a client to
connect to MongoDB.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/connection/srv.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent: 4

------------------------
Connect to a Replica Set
------------------------

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that
store the same set of data. This configuration of instances provides data
redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname and port numbers
of each instance, separated by a comma, and the replica set name as the value
of the ``replicaSet`` parameter in the connection string.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRs

.. note::

   Although it is possible to connect to a replica set deployment by
   providing only a single host, you should provide the driver with the
   full list to ensure that it is able to connect even if one host fails.

Connection Options
------------------

This section explains several common MongoDB connection and authentication
options. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection
URI to specify the behavior of the client.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - **validateOptions**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to error when the method parameters contain an
       unknown or incorrect option. If ``false``, the driver produces warnings
       only.

   * - **poolSize**
     - integer
     - ``5``
     - Specifies the maximum size of the instance connection pool.

   * - **minSize**

     - ``0``
     - Specifies the minimum size of the instance connection pool.

   * - **family**
     - number
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the version of the Internet Protocol (IP). The valid values
       are: ``4``, ``6``, ``0``, or ``null``. The ``0`` and ``null`` settings
       attempt to connect with IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 upon failure.

   * - **noDelay**
     - boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether to use the TCP socket no-delay option. For more
       information, see the documentation for `Node.js socket.setNoDelay
       <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/net.html#net_socket_setnodelay_nodelay>`_.

   * - **keepAlive**
     - boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether to enable ``keepAlive`` on the TCP socket. For more
       information, see the documentation for `Node.js socket.setKeepAlive
       <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/net.html#net_socket_setkeepalive_enable_initialdelay>`_.

   * - **keepAliveInitialDelay**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before initiating
       ``keepAlive`` on the TCP socket. For more information, see the
       documentation for `Node.js socket.setKeepAlive
       <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/net.html#net_socket_setkeepalive_enable_initialdelay>`_.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before timeout on a TCP
       connection.

   * - **socketTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``360000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before timeout on a TCP
       socket.

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the write concern. For more information on values, see the
       server documentation on the
       :manual:`w Option </reference/write-concern/#w-option>`.

   * - **forceServerObjectId**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to force the server to assign ``_id`` values to
       documents instead of the driver.

   * - **serializeFunctions**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to serialize functions on any object passed to the
       server.

   * - **ignoreUndefined**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether the BSON serializer should ignore undefined fields.

   * - **raw**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to return document results as raw BSON buffers.

   * - **promoteLongs**
     - boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether to convert ``Long`` values to a number if they fit
       inside 53 bits of resolution.

   * - **promoteBuffers**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to promote Binary BSON values to native Node.js
       ``Buffer`` type data.

   * - **promoteValues**
     - boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether to promote BSON values to Node.js native types when
       possible. When set to false, it uses wrapper types to present
       BSON values.

   * - **pkFactory**
     - object
     - ``null``
     - Specifies a primary key factory object that generates custom ``_id``
       keys.

   * - **promiseLibrary**
     - object
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the Promise library class the application uses (e.g. Bluebird).
       This library must be compatible with ES6.

   * - **loggerLevel**
     - string
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the logger level used by the driver. Valid choices are:
       ``error``, ``warn``, ``info``, and ``debug``.

   * - **logger**
     - object
     - ``null``
     - Specifies a custom logger for the client to use.

   * - **tls**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       connection with the instance. This is automatically set to ``true``
       when using a DNS seedlist (SRV) in the connection string. You can
       override this behavor by setting the value to ``false``.

For a complete list of options, see the :node-api:`MongoClient
<MongoClient.html>` API reference page.
