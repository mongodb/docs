  As you make changes, |service| displays the updated costs. You can change the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 35 65
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Option

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Instance Size`

       - You can change combination of memory, storage, and IOPS (speed) of
         your cluster's existing servers.

     * - :guilabel:`Replication Factor`

       - Changing the number of members in your cluster's :term:`replica set`
         increases or decreases the number of copies of your database. See
         :manual:`Replication </replication>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want a sharded cluster?`

       - Sharded clusters use horizontal scaling to expand throughput and
         storage size. Sharded clusters consist of multiple shards, each a
         replica set. Each replica set consists of the number of servers
         specified by the replication factor. For more information on sharded
         clusters, see :manual:`Sharding </sharding>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Number of Shards`

       - This field appears only if you have a sharded cluster. You can
         increase or decrease the number of shards. You cannot have fewer than
         two shards.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want to enable backup?`

       - If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at regular
         intervals and retains them according to your group's :ref:`retention
         policy <retention-policy>`. You can restore a backup to the same
         cluster or any cluster in your group that has the same topology.
