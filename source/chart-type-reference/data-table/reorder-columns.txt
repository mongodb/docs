Users with the author and owner :ref:`roles <dashboard-roles>`
on tables can reorder table columns in the :doc:`Chart
Builder </build-charts>`.

Behavior
--------

When you reorder table columns and save the
chart, |charts| saves the specified order as part of the chart
definition. All |charts-short| users will see the new column order.

Pinned Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you reorder a :guilabel:`Group` column in a table that has 
:ref:`pinned columns <pin-columns>`, the following behaviors apply:

- If the column to the right of the destination is pinned, 
  the reordered column is pinned. 
- If the column to the left of the destination is unpinned,
  the reordered column is unpinned.

Procedure
---------

To reorder table columns, click and drag column headers to the
desired order.

.. note::

   Table :ref:`authors and owners <dashboard-roles>` can also
   reorder columns by modifying the order of the respective column
   :ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>`. |charts| renders data
   table columns in the same order you specify the column encoding
   channels. To modify the order of the encoding channels, drag and
   drop one field on top of another to swap their order.

Considerations
--------------

- You can only reorder columns within their respective table sections,
  being :guilabel:`Groups` or :guilabel:`Values`.

- You cannot reorder :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns`.
