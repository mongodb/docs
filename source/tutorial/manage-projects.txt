   Groups are now projects.

In |mms|, MongoDB deployments are associated with projects.

You can create multiple projects in an organization. Each project has
its own Monitoring, Backup and {+aagent+}s associated with the
project. Projects within the same organization share the same billing
settings.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

For a project, the {+magent+} must be able to connect to all
hosts it monitors. If you have multiple MongoDB deployments in distinct
environments and cannot monitor all deployments with a single agent
(for instance, if your environments are separated by firewalls), you
will need to add new projects.

You can also use multiple projects and agents if you want to separately
monitor different MongoDB deployments that run in the same environment.

.. _create-project:

Create One Project
------------------

.. important::

   - To create a project for an organization, you must be either an
     :authrole:`Organization Owner` or an :authrole:`Organization
     Project Creator`.

   - When you create a project, you are added as an
     :authrole:`Project Owner`
     of the project.

   - When you create a project, |mms| automatically assigns a set of
     default :doc:`alert configurations </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`
     to the project.

   .. _move-project:

   Move One Project from One Organization to Another
   -------------------------------------------------

   .. important::

      - To move a project between Organizations, you must have the
        :authrole:`Organization Owner` on the source and target
        Organization.

      - When you move the Project, |mms| removes users that don't
        belong to the target Organization.

.. _delete-project:

Delete One Project
------------------

.. cond:: cloud

   .. important::

      Deleting a project removes all the project's artifacts, including
      all monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the project in
      selection lists.

      You can delete a project if:

      - You have the  :authrole:`Project Owner` access for the project.

      - The project has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to
        removing the project, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. cond:: onprem

   Please contact your |mms| administrator to delete a project
   from your |mms| account.

   If you have administrative privileges, you can delete a project
   through system administration. Click :guilabel:`Admin`, then
   :guilabel:`General`, and then :guilabel:`Projects`.
