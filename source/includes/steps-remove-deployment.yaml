  When you stop |mms| from managing your deployment, you must select
  one of the following options:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70

     * - :guilabel:`Unmanage this item in Cloud Manager but continue
         to monitor`
       - Removes the process from management only. You can no longer
         control the process through |mms|, but |mms| continues to
         display its status and track its metrics.

     * - :guilabel:`Completely remove from Cloud Manager`
       - Removes the processes from both management and monitoring.
         |mms| no longer displays the process. All backups are
         terminated and all backup snapshots are deleted.
