SNMP is an Internet standard protocol that uses generic data formats
to aggregate data about different running services.

MongoDB provides SNMP as an Enterprise feature. When run as an
SNMP subagent, MongoDB sends SNMP data to an SNMP master. The
data sent by MongoDB resembles the information returned by the
:dbcommand:`serverStatus` command.

For testing purposes only, MongoDB Enterprise may act as its own
SNMP master. This saves the administrator the trouble of setting up
a full SNMP environment. Do not run MongoDB as an SNMP master in a
production deployment.

usage instructions. See also :doc:`/tutorial/troubleshoot-snmp`
