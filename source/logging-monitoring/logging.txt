Overview
--------

.. What is on this page?

In this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure a logger in the
MongoDB Java driver.

.. What do any new terms mean?

.. Not applicable. We are treating definition of logger as understood.

.. What can you expect to see on this page?

You will learn how to:

- Set up a logger using the Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J)
- Configure the log level of your logger

This guide shows how to record events in the driver.
To learn how to use information about the activity of the
driver in your application, see the :ref:`java-monitoring` guide.

Set Up a Logger
---------------

This section gives background on the dependencies necessary to set up a
logger and provides an example logger setup.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Java driver uses the Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J).
SLF4J allows you to specify your logging framework of choice at deployment time.
For more information about SLF4J,
`see the SLF4J documentation <http://www.slf4j.org/>`__.

Setting up a logger is optional. When you start your application the MongoDB
Java driver looks for the ``slf4j-api`` artifact in your classpath. If the driver
can't find the ``slf4j-api`` artifact, the driver logs the following warning with
``java.util.logging`` and disables all further logging:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   WARNING: SLF4J not found on the classpath.  Logging is disabled for the 'org.mongodb.driver' component

To set up a logger, you must include the following in your project.

* The ``slf4j-api`` artifact
* A logging framework
* A **binding**

.. note::

    For the most popular logging frameworks, there is often a single binding
    artifact that lists the ``slf4j-api`` and the logging framework as
    dependencies. This means that you can set up a logger by adding one artifact
    to your project's dependency list. You will see this in the example below.

A binding is a piece of code that connects the ``slf4j-api`` artifact with a
logging framework. The following example shows how to bind the ``slf4j-api`` artifact
to the two most popular logging frameworks, Log4j2 and Logback.

Example - Set Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to set up your logger. Click the
tab corresponding to the logging framework you would like to use in your project.

.. tip:: Dependency Versions

   The following versions listed are illustrative rather than a
   source of truth. You should check the official documentation for SLF4J and
   your logging framework of choice for guaranteed up-to-date version
   information.

   * `SLF4J documentation <http://www.slf4j.org/>`__
   * `Logback documentation <https://logback.qos.ch/>`__
   * `Log4j2 documentation <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/>`__

      .. note:: Default Log Level

         The default log level of Logback is DEBUG. To learn how to change your
         Logback logger's log level, see the
         :ref:`example in the Configure Your Logger section of this page <configure-log-level>`.

      For more information about Logback, see the
      `Logback manual <https://logback.qos.ch/manual/>`__.

   .. tab:: Log4j2

         import org.slf4j.Logger;
         import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

         ...

         Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("MyApp");
         logger.error("Logging an Error");

      You should see output that resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         12:35:00.438 [main] ERROR <my package path> - Logging an Error

      .. note:: Default Log Level

         The default log level of Log4J2 is ERROR. This means that running
         standard operations in the MongoDB Java driver will not produce output
         from Log4J2 without configuration. To learn how to change your Log4J2
         logger's log level, see the
         :ref:`example in the Configure Your Logger section of this page <configure-log-level>`.

      For more information about Log4j2, see the
      `Log4j2 manual <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/>`__.

Configure Your Logger
---------------------

To configure your logger, you must use the configuration system of the logging
framework bound to SLF4J.

In the following example we show how you can use your logging framework's
configuration system to set your logger's **log level**.

A logger's log level specifies a lower bound for how urgent a message must be
for the logger to output that message.

Example - Configure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to configure your logger's log level to INFO.
Select the tab corresponding to the logging framework you are using in your
project.

.. _configure-log-level:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Logback
      :tabid: Logback-binding

      Specify Logback configurations in a file named ``logback.xml``.
      You don't need to create your ``logback.xml`` file in a specific
      location, but you must be able to access it from your classpath.

      The Logback framework defines the following log levels. The
      following lists the log levels, ordered from most urgent to least
      urgent:

      - ERROR
      - WARN
      - INFO
      - DEBUG
      - TRACE

      Set your ``logback.xml`` file to the following.

      .. code-block:: xml

         <configuration>
            <appender name="CONSOLE"
                      class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
               <encoder>
                  <pattern>
                        %-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{30} - %msg%n
                  </pattern>
               </encoder>
            </appender>
            <root level="INFO">
               <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
            </root>
         </configuration>

      To test that your logger configuration was successful, run the following
      code.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.rst

      You should see output that resembles the following.

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         ...
         1317 [cluster-ClusterId{value='<your cluster id>', description='null'}-<your connection uri>] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.cluster - Discovered replica set primary <your connection uri>
         1568 [main] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.connection - Opened connection [connectionId{localValue:7, serverValue:<server value>}] to <your connection uri>

      For more information about configuring Logback, see the
      `the Logback Manual <https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html>`__.

      .. tabs::

   .. tab:: Log4j2
      :tabid: Log4j2-binding

      Specify Log4j2 configurations in a file named ``log4j2.xml``.
      You don't need to create your ``log4j2.xml`` file in a specific
      location, but you must be able to access it from your classpath.

      The Log4j2 framework defines the following log levels. The following lists the
      log levels, ordered from most urgent to least urgent:

      - FATAL
      - ERROR
      - WARN
      - INFO
      - DEBUG
      - TRACE
      - ALL

      Set your ``log4j2.xml`` file to the following.

      .. code-block:: xml

         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <Configuration status="INFO">
            <Appenders>
               <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
                     <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
               </Console>
            </Appenders>
            <Loggers>
               <Root level="INFO">
                     <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
               </Root>
            </Loggers>
         </Configuration>

      To test that your logger configuration was successful, run the following
      code.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.rst

      You should see output that resembles the following.

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         ...
         10:14:57.633 [cluster-ClusterId{value=<your cluster id>, description='null'}-<your connection uri>] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.cluster - Discovered replica set primary <your connection uri>
         10:14:57.790 [main] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.connection - Opened connection [connectionId{localValue:7, serverValue:<your server value>}] to <your connection uri>

      For more information about configuring Log4j2, see the official
      `Log4j2 configuration guide
      <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html>`__.

Logger Names
------------

Your logger uses logger names to help organize different logging events. Logger
names are strings that form a hierarchy. A logger is an ancestor of another logger if
its name followed by a ``"."`` is a prefix of the other logger's name. For example,
``"grandparent"`` is an ancestor of ``"grandparent.parent"`` which is an
ancestor of ``"grandparent.parent.child"``.

For a concrete example, this is what a logger hierarchy looks like in code.

.. code-block:: java

   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

   ...

   Logger logger_parent = LoggerFactory.getLogger("parent");
   Logger logger_child = LoggerFactory.getLogger("parent.child");

A logger inherits the properties of its ancestor logger and can define
its own. You can think of this as similar to class inheritance in Java.

The MongoDB Java driver defines the following logger names to organize different
logging events in the driver. Here are the logger names defined in the driver
and the logging events they correspond to.

* ``org.mongodb.driver.authenticator`` : authentication
* ``org.mongodb.driver.client`` : events related to ``MongoClient`` instances
* ``org.mongodb.driver.cluster`` : monitoring of MongoDB deployments
* ``org.mongodb.driver.connection`` : connections and connection pools
* ``org.mongodb.driver.connection.tls`` : TLS/SSL
* ``org.mongodb.driver.operation`` : operations, including logging related to automatic retries
* ``org.mongodb.driver.protocol`` : commands sent to and replies received from MongoDB deployments
* ``org.mongodb.driver.uri`` : connection string parsing
* ``org.mongodb.driver.management`` : JMX (Java Management Extensions)

Example - Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to change the log level for a specific driver logger.
We set the root logger to OFF and the ``org.mongodb.driver.connection`` logger to
INFO. This will cause the application to only log messages related to connecting
to a MongoDB instance.

Select the tab corresponding to the logging framework you are using in your
project.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Logback
      :tabid: Logback-binding

      Set your ``logback.xml`` file to the following.

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 10

         <configuration>
            <appender name="CONSOLE"
                      class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
               <encoder>
                  <pattern>
                        %-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{30} - %msg%n
                  </pattern>
               </encoder>
            </appender>
            <logger name="org.mongodb.driver.connection" level="INFO" additivity="true"/>
            <root level="OFF">
               <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
            </root>
         </configuration>

      To test that your logger configuration was successful, run the following
      code.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/logging.rst

      You should see output that resembles the following.

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         ...
         829  [cluster-rtt-ClusterId{value='<some value>', description='null'}-<your connection URI>] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.connection - Opened connection [connectionId{localValue:2, serverValue:<your server value>}] to <your connection uri>
         977  [main] INFO  org.mongodb.driver.connection - Opened connection [connectionId{localValue:7, serverValue:<your server value>}] to <your connection uri>

      `official Logback configuration guide <https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#syntax>`__.

      .. tabs::

   .. tab:: Log4j2
      :tabid: Log4j2-binding

      Set your ``log4j2.xml`` file to the following.

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 9

         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <Configuration status="INFO">
            <Appenders>
               <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
                     <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
               </Console>
            </Appenders>
            <Loggers>
               <Logger name="org.mongodb.driver.connection" level="INFO"/>
               <Root level="OFF">
