===================================
Retrieve Distinct Values of a Field
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a list of distinct values for a field across a
collection by calling the ``distinct()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
object. Pass the document field name as the first parameter and the class
you want to cast the results to as the second parameter as shown below:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("countries", String.class);

You can specify a field on the document or one within an **embedded document**
using **dot notation**. The following method call returns each distinct
value of the ``wins`` field in the ``awards`` embedded document:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("awards.wins", Integer.class);

You can optionally pass a query filter to the method to limit
the set of documents from which your MongoDB instance retrieves distinct values as
follows:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("type", Filters.eq("languages", "French"), String.class);

The ``distinct()`` method returns an object that implements the
``DistinctIterable`` interface. This interface contains methods to access,
organize, and traverse the results. It also inherits methods from its parent
interface, ``MongoIterable``, such as ``first()`` which returns the first
result and ``cursor()`` which returns an instance of a ``MongoCursor``.


Example
-------

The following snippet retrieves a list of distinct values for the ``year``
document field from the ``movies`` collection. It uses a query filter to
match movies that include "Carl Franklin" as one of the values in the
``directors`` array.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Distinct.java
   :language: java

When you run the example, you should see output that reports each distinct
year for all the movies that Carl Franklin was included as a director,
which resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   1992
   1995
   1998
   ...
