For example, a secondary might stop replicating due to a network outage between itself and the primary.

The node that can complete :writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` writes is the current primary, and the other node is a former primary that has not yet recognized its demotion, typically due to a :term:`network partition`. When this occurs, clients that connect to the former primary may observe stale data despite having requested read preference :readmode:`primary`, and new writes to the former primary will eventually roll back."
