.. method:: db.collection.findOne(query,projection)

   :param document query: Optional. A :term:`document` that specifies the :term:`query`
                          using the JSON-like syntax and :doc:`query operators
                          </reference/operators>`.
   :param document projection:

          Optional. Controls the fields to return, or the
          :term:`projection`. The ``projection`` argument will
          resemble the following prototype:

          .. code-block:: javascript

              { field1: boolean, field2: boolean ... }

          The ``boolean`` can take the following include or exclude
          values:

          - ``1`` or ``true`` to include. The
            :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method always includes
            the :term:`_id` field even if the field is not explicitly
            stated to return in the :term:`projection` parameter.

          - ``0`` or ``false`` to exclude.

          The ``projection`` cannot contain both include and exclude
          specifications except for the exclusion of the ``_id`` field.

          Omit the ``projection`` parameter to return **all** the fields in
          the matching documents.

   :returns: One document that satisfies the query specified as the
             argument to this method. If the ``projection`` argument is
             specified, the returned document contains only the
             ``projection`` fields, and the ``_id`` field if you do not
             explicitly exclude the ``_id`` field.

   Returns only one document that satisfies the specified query. If
   multiple documents satisfy the query, this method returns the first
   document according to the :term:`natural order` which reflects the
   order of documents on the disc. In :term:`capped collections
   <capped collection>`, natural order is the same as insertion order.
