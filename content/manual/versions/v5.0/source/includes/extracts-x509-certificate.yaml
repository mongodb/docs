   Client certificates must have the following properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
     for both the client and the server.

   - Client certificates must contain the following fields:

     .. code-block:: none

        keyUsage = digitalSignature
        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

   - Each unique MongoDB user must have a unique certificate.

   - A client x.509 certificate's subject, which contains the
     Distinguished Name (``DN``), must **differ** from the subjects of
     :ref:`member x.509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>`.

     .. important::  
    
        If a client x.509 certificate's subject matches the ``O``, ``OU``, and 
        ``DC`` attributes of the :ref:`x509-member-certificate` (or
        :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`, if set) exactly, the client 
        connection is accepted, full permissions are granted, and a warning 
        message appears in the log. 
        
        Only :ref:`cluster member x509 certificates <x509-member-certificate>` 
        should use the same ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` attribute combinations.


     If the MongoDB deployment has :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` 
     set, the client x.509 certificate's subject must not match that value.

     If the MongoDB deployment has
     :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` set, the client x.509 
     certificate's subject must also differ from that value.

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

   Member certificates which you use to verify membership to a sharded
   cluster or a replica set (:setting:`net.tls.clusterFile`, if
   specified, and :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile`), must have the
   following properties:

   - A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
     certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

   - The Distinguished Name (``DN``), found in the member certificate's
     ``subject``, must specify a non-empty value for *at least one* of
     the following attributes:

     - the Organization (``O``)
     - the Organizational Unit (``OU``)
     - the Domain Component (``DC``)

   - The Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit
     attributes (``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) must
     match those from both the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` and
     :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` certificates for the other
     cluster members (or the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`
     value, if set).

     To match, the certificate must match all specifications of these
     attributes, even the non-specification of these attributes. The
     order of the attributes does not matter.

     In the following example, the two ``DN``\'s contain matching
     specifications for ``O``, ``OU`` as well as the non-specification
     of the ``DC`` attribute.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        C=US, ST=CA, O=MongoDB, OU=Dept1, CN=host2

     However, the following two ``DN``\'s contain a mismatch for the
     ``OU`` attribute since one contains two ``OU`` specifications and
     the other, only one specification.

     .. code-block:: none

        CN=host1,OU=Dept1,OU=Sales,O=MongoDB
        CN=host2,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB

   - In multi-cluster deployments, each cluster must use a different X.509
     member certificate.  Each certificate **must** have unique values
     on the ``O``, ``OU``, and ``DC`` Distinguished Name (DN) fields.

     If two clusters have certificates with the same DN values, a
     compromised server on one cluster can authenticate as a
     member of the other.

   - Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
     Name (``SAN``) entries must match the server hostname for other cluster
     members. Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when comparing ``SAN``\s, MongoDB can 
     compare either DNS names or IP addresses. In previous versions, MongoDB 
     only compares DNS names.

     For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the
     following subjects:

     .. code-block:: bash

        subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
        subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US

   - If the certificate used as the ``certificateKeyFile`` includes 
     ``extendedKeyUsage``, the value must include both
     ``clientAuth`` ("TLS Web Client Authentication") and ``serverAuth``
     ("TLS Web Server Authentication").

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth, serverAuth

   - If the certificate used as the ``clusterFile`` includes 
     ``extendedKeyUsage``, the value must include ``clientAuth``.

     .. code-block:: none

        extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

   - The x.509 certificate must *not* be expired.

ref: x509-member-auth-configuration

   You can use TLS for internal authentication between each member of
   your replica set (each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance) or sharded
   cluster (each :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance).

   To use TLS for internal authentication, use the following settings:

   - :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode` or :option:`--clusterAuthMode
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` set to ``x509``

   - :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` or :option:`--tlsClusterFile
     <mongod --clusterAuthMode>`

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :option:`mongos <mongos
   --tlsCertificateKeyFile>` instances use their certificate key file to
   prove their identity to clients, but it can also be used for
   membership authentication. If you do not specify a cluster file,
   members use their certificate key files for membership authentication.
   Specify the certificate key file with :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` or
   :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>`.

   To use the :setting:`certificate key file
   <net.tls.certificateKeyFile>` for both client authentication and
   membership authentication, the certificate must either:

   - Omit ``extendedKeyUsage`` or
   - Specify ``extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth``

...
