Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements
in your connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster
- MongoDB username
- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

.. tip::

   Follow the :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection?tck=docs_driver_python>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`{+stable-api+} page
<pymongo-stable-api>`.

The following code shows how to use {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code also uses the ``server_api`` option to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

   :language: python

Local Deployments
-----------------

To connect to a local MongoDB deployment, use ``localhost`` as the hostname. By
default, the ``mongod`` process runs on port 27017, though you can customize this for
your deployment.

The following code shows how to use {+driver-short+} to connect to a local MongoDB
deployment:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient
   
   uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
   client = MongoClient(uri)

Replica Sets
------------

To connect to a replica set, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and 
port numbers of the replica-set members in your connection string.

The following code shows how to use {+driver-short+} to connect to a replica set
that contains three hosts:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient
   
   client = MongoClient("mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017")

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can 
specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct {+driver-short+} to 
perform automatic discovery to find the others. To instruct the driver to perform
automatic discovery, perform one of the following actions:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet`` parameter.
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter.
- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the 
MongoDB replica set ``sampleRS``, which is running on port ``27017`` of three different
hosts, including ``host1``:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient

   uri = "mongodb://host1:27017/?replicaSet=sampleRS"
   client = MongoClient(uri)

{+driver-short+} evenly load balances operations across deployments that are reachable
within the client's ``localThresholdMS`` value. To learn more about how {+driver-short+} load
balances operations across multiple MongoDB deployments, see the
:ref:`pymongo-server-selection` guide.

.. note::

   The ``MongoClient`` constructor is *non-blocking*.
   When you connect to a replica set, the constructor returns immediately while the
   client uses background threads to connect to the replica set.
   
   If you construct a ``MongoClient`` and immediately print the string representation
   of its ``nodes`` attribute, the list might be empty while the client connects to
   the replica-set members.

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize a replica set, you must connect directly to a single member. To do so,
set the ``directConnection`` connection
option to ``True``. You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoClient`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

         from pymongo import MongoClient

         uri = ("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?"
                "directConnection=true")
         client = MongoClient(uri)
