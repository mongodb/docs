Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a database command by using the
{+driver-short+}. You can use database commands to perform a variety of
administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics,
initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   We recommend using driver methods instead of executing database
   commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()``
   method inside the shell is the preferred method to issue database
   commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell and
   drivers.

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, specify the command and any relevant
parameters in a document, then pass the document to the ``runCommand()`` method.

The following code shows how you can use the ``runCommand()``
method to run the ``dbStats`` command, which returns statistics from a specified
MongoDB database:

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/Command.snippet.command-usage-example.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "db": "sample_mflix",
        "collections": 5,
        "views": 0,
        "objects": 75595,
        "avgObjSize": 692.1003770090614,
        "dataSize": 52319328,
        "storageSize": 29831168,
        "numExtents": 0,
        "indexes": 9,
        "indexSize": 14430208,
        "fileSize": 0,
        "nsSizeMB": 0,
        "ok": 1
      }

For a full list of database commands and corresponding parameters, see
the :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` guide.

Command Options
---------------

You can specify optional command behavior for the ``runCommand()`` method by
including a ``readPreference`` parameter. The following example shows how to
specify a read preference and pass it as an option to the ``runCommand()``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.kt
   :start-after: start-read-preference
   :end-before: end-read-preference
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:

For more information on read preference options, see :manual:`Read Preference
</core/read-preference/>` in the Server manual. 

.. note::
   
   The ``runCommand()`` method ignores the read preference setting you may have set 
   on your ``database`` object. If you don't specify a read preference, this method 
   uses the ``primary`` read preference.

Response
--------

The ``runCommand()`` method returns a ``Document`` object that contains
the response from the database after the command has been executed. Each
database command performs a different function, so the response content
can vary across commands. However, every response contains documents
with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - <command result>
     - Provides fields specific to the database command. For example,
       ``count`` returns the ``n`` field and ``explain`` returns the
       ``queryPlanner`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Indicates whether the command has succeeded (``1``)
       or failed (``0``).

   * - ``operationTime``
     - Indicates the logical time of the operation. MongoDB uses the
       logical time to order operations. 
       To learn more about logical time, see our 
       :website:`blog post about the Global Logical Clock </blog/post/transactions-background-part-4-the-global-logical-clock>`.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - Provides a document that returns the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for ordering operations.

       The document contains the following fields:

       - ``clusterTime``: The timestamp of the highest known cluster time for the member
       - ``signature``: A document that contains the hash of the cluster time and the ID
         of the key used to sign the cluster time
