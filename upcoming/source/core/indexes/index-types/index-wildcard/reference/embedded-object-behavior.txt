Wildcard indexes have specific behavior when indexing embedded object
and array fields:

- If the field is an object, the wildcard index descends into
  the object and indexes its contents. The wildcard index continues
  descending into any additional embedded documents it encounters.

- If the field is an array, the wildcard index traverses the array
  and indexes each element:

  - If the element is an object, the wildcard index descends into the
    object to index its contents.
    
  - If the element is an array (that is, an array which is embedded
    directly within the parent array), the wildcard index does not
    traverse the embedded array, but indexes the *entire* array as a
    single value.

- For all other fields, the index stores the **primitive value**. A
  primitive value is a non-object, non-array value.

The wildcard index continues traversing any additional embedded objects
or arrays until it reaches a primitive value. It then indexes the
primitive value, along with the full path to that field.

Wildcard Indexes on Embedded Objects
------------------------------------

When a wildcard index encounters an embedded object, it descends into
the object and indexes its contents. For example, consider this
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertOne( {
      account: {
         username: "SuperAdmin01",
         contact: {
            phone: "123-456-7890",
            email: "xyz@example.com"
         },
         access: {
            group: "admin"
         }
      }
   } )

A wildcard index that includes the ``account`` field descends into the
``account`` object to traverse and index its contents:

- For each subfield which is itself an object (for example,
  ``account.contact`` and ``account.access``), the index descends into
  the object and records its contents.

- For all other subfields, the index records the primitive value into
  the index.

Given the sample document, the wildcard index adds the following records
to the index:

- ``"account.username" : "SuperAdmin01"`` 
- ``"account.contact.phone" : "123-456-7890"``
- ``"account.contact.email" : "xyz@example.com"``
- ``"account.access.group" : "admin"``

.. _wildcard-index-nested-arrays:

Wildcard Indexes on Arrays
--------------------------

When a wildcard index encounters an array, it traverses the array to
index its elements. If the array element is itself an array (an embedded
array), the index records the *entire* embedded array as a value
instead of traversing its contents.

For example, consider this document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fleet.insertOne( {
      "ship": {
         "coordinates" : [
            [-5, 10],
            [-7, 8]
         ],
         "type": "Cargo Ship",
         "captains": [
            {
               "name": "Francis Drake",
               "crew": [ "first mate", "carpenter" ]
            }
         ]
      }
  } )

A wildcard index which includes the ``ship`` field descends into the
object to traverse and index its contents:

- For each element which is an array:

  - If the element is itself an array (as in an embedded array), the
    index records the *entire* array as a value.

  - If the element is an object, the index descends into the object to
    traverse and index its contents.

  - If the element is a primitive value, the index records that value.

- For non-array, non-object fields, the index records the primitive
  value into the index.

Given the sample document, the wildcard index adds the following records
to the index:

- ``"ship.coordinates" : [-5, 10]`` 
- ``"ship.coordinates" : [-7, 8]`` 
- ``"ship.type" : "Cargo Ship"``
- ``"ship.captains.name" : "Francis Drake"``
- ``"ship.captains.crew" : "first mate"``
- ``"ship.captains.crew" : "carpenter"``

.. _wildcard-query-support-explicit-array-indices:

Queries with Explicit Array Indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wildcard indexes do not record the array position of any given element
in an array during indexing. However, MongoDB may still use the wildcard
index to fulfill a query that includes a field path with one or more
explicit array indices.

For example, consider this document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fleet.insertOne( {
      "ship": {
         "coordinates" : [
            [-5, 10],
            [-7, 8]
         ],
         "type": "Cargo Ship",
         "captains": [
            {
               "name": "Francis Drake",
               "crew": [ "first mate", "carpenter" ]
            }
         ]
      }
  } )

Create a wildcard index that includes the ``ship`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fleet.createIndex( { "ship.$**": 1 } )

The index records for ``ship.coordinates`` and ``ship.captains`` do not
include the array position for each element. Wildcard indexes ignore
array element positions when recording the element into the index.
However, wildcard indexes can still support queries that include
explicit array indices.

MongoDB can use the wildcard index to fulfill this query:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.fleet.find( { "ship.captains.0.name": "Francis Drake" } )

The query returns the sample document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: ObjectId("6350537db1fac2ee2e957efc"),
       ship: {
         coordinates: [ [ -5, 10 ], [ -7, 8 ] ],
         type: 'Cargo Ship',
         captains: [
           { name: 'Francis Drake', crew: [ 'first mate', 'carpenter' ] }
         ]
       }
     }
   ]

MongoDB **cannot** use the wildcard index to fulfill this query:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.fleet.find( { "ship.coordinates.0.1": 10 } )

The ``ship.coordinates`` field contains embedded arrays. Wildcard
indexes do not record individual values of embedded arrays. Instead,
they record the entire embedded array. As a result, the wildcard index
cannot support a match on an embedded array value, and MongoDB fulfills
the query with a collection scan.

Array Index Limitation
``````````````````````

MongoDB can only use a wildcard index to fulfill a given field path in
the query if the path contains 8 or fewer explicit array indices. If the
field path contains more than 8 explicit indices, to fulfill the query,
MongoDB either:

- Selects another eligible index.
- Performs a collection scan.

Wildcard indexes themselves do not have limits on the depth to which
they traverse a document while indexing it. The limitation only applies
to queries which explicitly specify exact array indices.
