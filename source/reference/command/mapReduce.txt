.. dbcommand:: mapReduce

   The :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command allows you to run
   map-reduce-style aggregations over a collection.

   :option map: A JavaScript function that performs the "map" step of
                the map-reduce operation. This function references the
                current input document and calls the
                ``emit(key,value)`` method that supplies values to
                the reduce function. Map functions may call
                ``emit()``, once, more than once, or not at all
                depending on the type of aggregation.

   :option reduce: A JavaScript function that performs the "reduce"
                   step of the MapReduce operation. The reduce
                   function receives an array of emitted values from
                   the map function, and returns a single
                   value. Because it's possible to invoke the reduce
                   function more than once for the same key, the
                   structure of the object returned by function must
                   be identical to the structure of the emitted
                   function.

   :option out: Specifies the location of the out of the reduce stage
                of the operation. Specify a string to write the output
                of the Map/Reduce job to a collection with that
                name. The map-reduce operation will replace the
                content of the specified collection in the current
                database by default. See below for additional options.

   :option query: Optional. A query object, like the query used by the
                  :method:`db.collection.find()` method. Use this to
                  filter to limit the number of documents
                  enter the map phase of the aggregation.

   :option sort: Optional. Sorts the input objects using this key. This
                 option is useful for optimizing the
                 job. Common uses include sorting by the emit
                 key so that there are fewer reduces.

   :option limit: Optional. Species a maximum number of objects to
                  return from the collection.

   :option finalize: Optional. Specifies an optional "finalize"
                     function to run on a result, following
                     the reduce stage, to modify or control
                     the output of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
                     operation.

   :option scope: Optional. Place a :term:`document` as the contents of
                  this field, to place fields into the global
                  javascript scope.

   :option Boolean jsMode: Optional. The ``jsMode`` option defaults to
                           ``false``.

   :option Boolean verbose: Optional. The ``verbose`` option provides
                            statistics on job execution times.

   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` only require ``map`` and ``reduce`` options,
   all other fields are optional. You must write all ``map`` and
   ``reduce`` functions in JavaScript.

   The ``out`` field of the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, provides a
   number of additional configuration options that you may use to
   control how MongoDB returns data from the map-reduce job. Consider
   the following 4 output possibilities.

   .. versionadded: 1.8

   :param replace: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out:
                   { replace: collectionName } }``) where the output
                   of the map-reduce overwrites the contents of the
                   collection specified (i.e. ``collectionName``) if
                   there is any data in that collection. This is the
                   default behavior if you only specify a collection
                   name in the ``out`` field.

   :param merge: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out: {
                 merge: collectionName } }``) where the
                 map-reduce operation writes output to an
                 existing collection
                 (i.e. ``collectionName``,) and only
                 overwrites existing documents when a new
                 document has the same key as an "old"
                 document in this collection.

   :param reduce: Optional. This operation behaves as the ``merge``
                  option above, except that when an existing
                  document has the same key as a new
                  document, ``reduce`` function from the
                  map reduce job will run on both values and
                  MongoDB writes the result of this function
                  to the new collection. The specification
                  takes the form of ``{ out: { reduce:
                  collectionName } }``, where
                  ``collectionName`` is the name of the
                  results collection.

   :param inline: Optional. Indicate the inline option (i.e. ``{ out:
                  { inline: 1 } }``) to perform the map
                  reduce job in ram and return the results at
                  the end of the function. This option is
                  only possible when the entire result set
                  will fit within the :ref:`maximum size of a
                  BSON document <limit-bson-document-size>`.
                  When performing map-reduce jobs on
                  secondary members of replica sets, this is
                  the only available option.

   :param db: Optional. The name of the database that you want the
              map-reduce operation to write its output. By default
              this will be the same database as the input collection.

   :param sharded: Optional. If ``true``, *and* the output mode writes to a
                   collection, and the output database has sharding
                   enabled, the map-reduce operation will shard the
                   results collection according to the ``_id`` field.

      Also, the ":wiki:`MapReduce` page, provides a greater overview
      of MongoDB's map-reduce functionality. Consider the
      ":wiki:`Simple application <Aggregation>`" support for basic
      aggregation operations and ":doc:`/applications/aggregation`"
      for a more flexible approach to data aggregation in MongoDB.
