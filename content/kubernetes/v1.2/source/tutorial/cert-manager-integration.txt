Renewing Certificates
---------------------

cert-manager will renew certificates under the following circumstances:

- The certificate expires according to its ``spec.duration`` and 
  ``spec.renewBefore`` fields.
- You delete the secret holding a certificate. In this case, 
  cert-manager recreates the secret according to the configuration 
  in your certificate custom resource.
- You alter the configuration of the certificate custom resource.
  In this case, cert-manager recreates the secret that contains the 
  certificate when it detects the changes to its configuration.
