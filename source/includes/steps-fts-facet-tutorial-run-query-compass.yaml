title: "Run an |fts| facet query that groups the genre and year fields
       into buckets."
content: |
  The query uses the following ``searchMeta`` operator clauses:
  
  .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

  To run this query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the following 
     pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the dropdown and adding
     the query for that stage. Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add 
     additional stages.

     .. include:: /includes/fts-tutorial/facet/tutorial.rst

  If you enabled :guilabel:`Auto Preview`, |compass| displays the 
  following documents next to the ``$searchMeta`` pipeline stage:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     {
        count: { lowerBound: 23026 },
        facet: {
          genresFacet: {
            buckets: [
              { _id: "Drama", count: 13527 },
              { _id: "Comedy", count: 6922 },
              { _id: "Romance", count: 3615 },
              { _id: "Crime", count: 2649 },
              { _id: "Thriller", count: 2603 },
              { _id: "Action", count: 2505 },
              { _id: "Documentary", count: 2041 },
              { _id: "Adventure", count: 2016 },

              { _id: "Biography", count: 1373 }
            ]
          },
          yearFacet: {
            buckets: [
              { _id: 1910, count: 23 },
              { _id: 1920, count: 89 },
              { _id: 1930, count: 308 }
