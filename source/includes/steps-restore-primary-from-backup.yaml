title: Obtain backup MongoDB Database files.
stepnum: 1
ref: obtain-backup-files
content: |
  The backup files may come from a :doc:`file system snapshot
  </tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots>`. The |mms-home|
  produces MongoDB database files for :mms-docs:`stored snapshots
  </tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>` and :mms-docs:`point in time
  snapshots </tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot/>`.
  For :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`,
  see also the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Backup overview </core/backup-overview>`.

title: "Start a :program:`mongod` using data files from the backup as the data path."
stepnum: 2
ref: start
pre: |
  Start a :program:`mongod` instance for a new single-node replica set.
  Specify the path to the backup data files with ``--dbpath`` option
  and the replica set name with the ``--replSet`` option. 
  For :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS) <csrs>`,
  include the :option:`--configsvr` option.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --dbpath /data/db --replSet <replName>

title: Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the ``mongod`` instance.
stepnum: 3
source:
  file: steps-deploy-replica-set.yaml
  ref: open-shell
---
title: Initiate the new replica set.
stepnum: 4
ref: initiate
pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.initiate()` on *one and only one* member of the replica set:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    rs.initiate( {
       _id : <replName>,
       members: [ { _id : 0, host : <host:port> } ]
    })
post: |
  MongoDB initiates a set that consists of the current member and that
  uses the default replica set configuration.
