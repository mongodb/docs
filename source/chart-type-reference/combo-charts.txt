Combo charts offer a combined :ref:`column <column-bar-chart-ref>` and 
:ref:`line <line-area-chart-ref>` view.

Combo Chart Encoding Channels
-----------------------------

Combo charts provide the following
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - X Axis
     - In the :guilabel:`category` axis encoding channel, a column is 
       rendered for each unique value from this field.

   * - Columns
     - - The fields that you use in this channel build the columns in 
         this chart.      

       - The :guilabel:`aggregation` axis encoding channel dictates
         which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to
         perform. This ultimately dictates the size of each column.

       .. note::

          You can map multiple fields to this channel to create 
          a multi-series chart. However, unlike other charts, you can't 
          create a multi-series chart with the :guilabel:`Series` 
          channel on combo charts. To learn more, see
          :ref:`Multiple Field Mappings <multiple-field-mappings>`.

   * - Lines
     - - The fields that you use in this channel build one or more 
         lines on this chart.      

       - The :guilabel:`aggregation` axis encoding channel dictates
         which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to
         perform.

Combo Chart Types
-----------------

Combo charts provide the following sub-types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Sub-Type Name
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Grouped <grouped-combo-ref-example>`
     - |charts| groups data by the category specified in the
       :guilabel:`category` :ref:`encoding channel
       <encoding-channels>`, and plots a column for each value
       in the :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel.

   * - :ref:`Stacked <stacked-combo-ref-example>`
     - |charts| creates a column for each distinct value in the
       :guilabel:`category` :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>`
       field, and splits each column into segments based on the
       the :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel.

Use Cases
---------

- Combo charts bring together the useful aspects of both :ref:`column 
  <column-bar-chart-ref>` and :ref:`line <line-area-chart-ref>` charts 
  into a single chart.

Customization Options
---------------------

The following customization options are specific to combo
charts. To see all available customization options, see
:ref:`customize-charts`.

.. note::

   If the columns and lines in your combo use different scales, 
   consider a :ref:`secondary-y-axis`. This option appears on the 
   :guilabel:`Customize` pane in the :guilabel:`Fields` section for any 
   fields mapped to the :guilabel:`Lines` channel. Fields mapped to the 
   :guilabel:`Columns` channel appear only on the primary axis.

.. _label-angle-option:

Adjust X-Axis Label Angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/customization/adjust-x-axis-label-angle.rst

Set Distinct Dash Style per Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On combo charts, you can opt to display each series in the chart with a 
distinct dash style. This option can help make your chart more 
accessible by distinguishing between series beyond color.

.. include:: /includes/customization/set-distinct-dash-style-per-series.rst

.. _line-smoothing-option:

Smooth Lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/customization/smooth-lines.rst

.. _markers-option:

Show or Hide Data Markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On combo charts, you can dictate whether |charts-short| displays
visible data markers that represent individual data points along the 
line. Enabling this option makes it easier to see exactly where your 
data points lie along a line. Hovering over these markers shows the 
exact data values in a tooltip, making it easier to view precise 
measurements.

Examples
--------

.. _grouped-combo-ref-example:

Grouped Combo Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following grouped combo chart shows the number of award 
nominations, wins, and metascores by director.

The :guilabel:`X Axis` category of ``director`` creates a group
for each director in the data set, and each group is split by the
:guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel fields of ``nominations`` and 
``wins``. The :guilabel:`Lines` encoding channel field of 
``metacritic`` displays as a line:

.. figure:: /images/charts/combo-chart-grouped.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Grouped Combo Chart Reference

.. _stacked-combo-ref-example:

Stacked Combo Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following stacked combo chart shows the number of award 
nominations, wins, and metascores by director.

The :guilabel:`X Axis` category of ``director`` creates a column for 
each director in the data set, :ref:`limited <charts-limit-data>` to 
only the top 10 as sorted by the aggregated sum of ``awards.wins`` from 
:guilabel:`Columns`. The :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel fields of 
``nominations`` and ``wins`` segment each column. The :guilabel:`Lines` 
encoding channel field of ``metacritic`` displays as a line:

Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for combo charts is 5000 
documents.
