You can automatically restore a backup for a |mms| deployment to an 
|service| deployment.

Restore Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`prerequisites <restore-prereq>`, consider the
following requirements and limitations when restoring from a |mms|
deployment.

- You must have the :cloudmgr:`Project Backup Admin </reference/user-roles/#Project-Backup-Admin>` 
  role for the Cloud Manager project that contains the source 
  {+database-deployments+} and the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for 
  the |service| projects that contain the target 
  {+database-deployments+}.
- If the ``DefaultRWConcern`` value on the source snapshot differs
  from the ``DefaultRWConcern`` value on the target 
  {+database-deployment+}, |service| overrides the value on the source 
  snapshot with the value on the target {+database-deployment+}. If 
  there is no value configured for the ``DefaultRWConcern`` on the 
  target {+database-deployment+}, |service| keeps the value of 
  ``DefaultRWConcern`` from the snapshot without explicit 
  configuration. This may differ from the default value for that 
  MongoDB version.

Sharded {+Clusters+}
````````````````````

- If you are restoring from a sharded {+cluster+}, the source and
  target {+clusters+} must have the same number of shards.

- |service| can't restore a sharded cluster snapshot to a replica set.

- This feature is unavailable for ``M0`` {+clusters+} and {+Flex-Clusters+}.

- You can only restore a |mms| snapshot to a |service| cluster if
  either both deployments run the same version of MongoDB server, 
  or the |service| deployment runs one version higher than the |mms| 
  deployment.

Restore a Cloud Manager Snapshot to |service|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning-available.rst

Before you restore a snapshot from a |mms| 
deployment to an |service| deployment, ensure that the hosts for 
your |service| deployment have sufficient storage space for the 
restored databases, plus additional space for dataset growth. Use 
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
to find the current database size.

Also, the instance types of the nodes in the |service| 
deployment must have at least as much memory and throughput capacity 
as the nodes in the |mms| deployment.
