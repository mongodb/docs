If the server running a :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` fails, and
if you :doc:`run multiple Backup Daemons </tutorial/configure-backup-high-availability>`,
then an administrator with the :authrole:`Global Owner`
or :ref:`global backup admin role <global-backup-admin-role>` :doc:`role </reference/user-roles>`
can move all the daemon's jobs to another Backup Daemon. The new
daemon takes over the responsibility to back up the associated
:manual:`shards </sharding>` and :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

When you move jobs, the destination daemon reconstructs the data using
a snapshot and the :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` from the :ref:`backup-database`.
Reconstruction of data takes time, depending on the size of the
databases on the source.

During the time it takes to reconstruct the data and reassign the
backups to the new Backup Daemon:

- |mms| does not take new snapshots of the jobs that are moving until
  the move is complete. Jobs that are not moving are not affected.

- |mms| *does* save incoming oplog data. Once the jobs are on the new
  Backup Daemon's server, |mms| takes the missed snapshots at the
  regular snapshot intervals.

- Restores of previous snapshots are still available.

- |mms| can produce restore artifacts using existing snapshots with
  :term:`point-in-time restore` for :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
  or :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. 

Procedure
---------

With administrative privileges, you can move jobs between Backup
daemons using the following procedure:
