Self-managed X.509 certificates, also known as mutual TLS or mTLS, 
provide database users access to the {+database-deployments+} in your 
project. Database users are separate from |service| users. Database 
users have access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users have 
access to the |service| application itself.

Considerations
--------------

If you :ref:`enable LDAP authorization 
<ldaps-authentication-authorization>`, you can't connect to your
{+database-deployments+} with users that authenticate with an
|service|-managed X.509 certificate.

After you enable |ldap| authorization, you *can* connect to your
{+database-deployments+} with users that authenticate with an
self-managed X.509 certificate. However, the user's Common Name 
in their X.509 certificate must match the Distinguished Name of a user 
who is authorized to access your database with LDAP.

You can have both users that authenticate with self-managed
certificates and users that authenticate with |service|\-managed X.509
certificates in the same database.

Required Access
---------------

To manage database users, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to |service|.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use self-managed X.509 certificates, you must have a Public Key
Infrastructure to integrate with |service-fullname|.
