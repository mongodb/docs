Restore from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|backup| lets you restore data from a point within the last 24-hour
period. |mms| creates a backup that includes all operations up to the point
in time you select. The point in time is an upper *exclusive* bound: if
you select a timestamp of 12:00, then the last operation in the restore
will be no later than 11:59:59.

To restore from a point in time, see the procedure for the resource you
are restoring:
