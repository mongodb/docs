When you create the ``AtlasFederatedAuth`` custom resource, |ak8so|
uses the :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Federated Authentication API Resource
<federated-authentication>` to :ref:`update <ak8so-create-update-process>`
the organization configuration for the federation.
In the organization configuration, you specify federation settings
for your |service| organization such as :ref:`organization
<atlas-manage-fed-org-map>` and :ref:`role mappings
<atlas-manage-fed-auth-roles>`.
