Example
-------

The following example illustrates a ``rename`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "rename",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      },
      "to": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "people"
      }
   }

A ``rename`` event leads to an
:ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` for change streams opened
against its ``ns`` collection or ``to`` collection.
