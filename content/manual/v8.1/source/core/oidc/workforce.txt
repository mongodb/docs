Workforce Identity Federation uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) to enable human 
users to authenticate and get authorized using an external identity provider 
(IdP). You can use Workforce Identity Federation to enhance security and 
simplify user management. 

Use Cases
---------

With Workforce Identity Federation, you can:

- Manage your workforce access to MongoDB deployments through your existing 
  IdP.
- Enforce security policies such as password complexity, credential rotation, 
  and multi-factor authentication within your IdP.
- Grant access for a group of users or a single user.

Behavior
--------

You must use MongoDB Enterprise and have MongoDB 7.0.11 or later.

Get Started
-----------

To configure and use Workforce Identity Federation, you must perform the 
following tasks:

1. :ref:`workforce-external-provider`

   Register your OIDC application with an IdP that supports the OIDC standard, 
   such as Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, or Ping Identity.

#. :ref:`configure-oidc`

   Configure your MongoDB server to use Workforce Identity Federation with 
   OIDC.

#. :ref:`database-user-workforce`

   Specify privileges for workforce identity principals by adding roles to 
   MongoDB (for OIDC, external authorization, or both) or adding database users 
   to MongoDB (for database-managed authorization).
