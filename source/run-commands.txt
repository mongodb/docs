Run Commands in ``mongosh``

For documentation of basic MongoDB operations in ``mongosh``, see:

- :doc:`/run-agg-pipelines`

- :doc:`/reference/methods`

Terminate a Running Command
---------------------------

To terminate a running command or query in ``mongosh``,
press ``Ctrl + C``.

``Ctrl + C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
terminate the process on the MongoDB server. This behavior
differs from the :method:`db.killOp()` method, which terminates
commands on the server.

Command Exceptions
------------------

In scenarios where the output of a command includes ``{ ok: 0 }``,
``mongosh`` throws an exception and does not return the raw output from
the server.

.. note::

   In the legacy ``mongo`` shell, when a command's output included ``{
   ok: 0 }``, the behavior differs between commands. ``mongosh``
   provides consistent behavior by always throwing an exception in these
   scenarios.

Clear the ``mongosh`` Console
-----------------------------

The ``cls`` command clears the console. You can also clear the console
with ``Ctrl + L`` and ``console.clear()``.
