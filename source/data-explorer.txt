The :guilabel:`Data Explorer` provides the ability to:

- View databases, collections, and indexes in your cluster.

- Create and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

- Insert/edit/delete documents.

- Create and run aggregation pipelines to process your data.

:guilabel:`Data Explorer` reads from the primary unless the primary is
unavailable. If the primary is unavailable, :guilabel:`Data Explorer`
reads from a non-hidden, non-delayed secondary member.
