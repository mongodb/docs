msgid ":term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use elections to determine which set member will become :term:`primary`. Elections occur after initiating a replica set, and also any time the primary becomes unavailable. The primary is the only member in the set that can accept write operations. If a primary becomes unavailable, elections allow the set to recover normal operations without manual intervention. Elections are part of the :ref:`failover process <replica-set-failover-administration>`."
