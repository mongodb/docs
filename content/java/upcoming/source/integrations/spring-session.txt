   Get Started with Spring Session MongoDB </integrations/spring-session/spring-session-get-started>

Overview
--------

**{+spring-session+}** is a library that allows Spring-based applications
to store HTTP session data in MongoDB. This integration between Spring Session and MongoDB
provides reliable and scalable sessions for applications that
run on multiple servers or containers, because any instance can access the same
session data. When using MongoDB for session storage, you can maintain sessions after
your application restarts and share sessions across a cluster with minimal configuration.

Spring Session 4.0 introduces the first MongoDB-maintained release of the Spring Session
MongoDB integration. When working with the integration, you can now receive direct support
from the MongoDB engineers who develop the {+driver-long+}. This change ensures that Spring
Session MongoDB aligns with the latest {+driver-short+} releases and API improvements.

Getting Started
---------------

You can use the MongoDB-maintained Spring Session integration in your application
by creating a new Spring Boot application, or by updating an existing application
that uses an earlier version of {+spring-session+}.

Create a New Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn how to create a Spring Boot application that uses Spring Session
MongoDB to manage user session information, follow the :ref:`spring-session-get-started`
tutorial.

Migrate Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an existing application that uses the {+spring-session+} integration maintained by Spring,
migrate to the MongoDB-maintained integration by performing the following updates:

- Update your Maven artifact from ``org.springframework.session:spring-session-data-mongodb`` to ``org.mongodb:mongo-spring-session``.
  To learn more about the new artifact, see `mongodb-spring-session <https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-spring-session/overview>`__
  in Maven Central.
- Change the API namespace from ``org.springframework.session.data.mongo`` to ``org.mongodb.spring.session``. Ensure
  that your import statements use the new namespace.
- Because Jackson 2 support is now deprecated, update your application to use 
  ``JacksonMongoSessionConverter``. This is the Jackson 3 session converter.
