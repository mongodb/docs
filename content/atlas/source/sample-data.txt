|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
{+database-deployments+}. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
:ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For descriptions of each of the available datasets, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

You can also generate synthetic data that aligns to your real data's
schema. To learn more, see :ref:`synthetic-data`.

To import your own data, see :ref:`import-strategies`.

Load Sample Data
----------------

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To load sample data, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/org-owners-add-project.rst

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
an |service| {+database-deployment+} to load data into. To learn more, 
see :ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

You can load sample data into your |service| {+database-deployment+} from the {+atlas-cli+} or the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>`.

.. tip::

   You can use the local deployment steps to load data 
   into a MongoDB Community or Enterprise cluster.

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to load
sample data:
  
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-load.rst

      After you run the command to load sample data, you can use
      the following {+atlas-cli+} commands to monitor the status of the
      sample data load job:

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-describe-and-watch.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. tabs::
        
         .. tab:: Clusters View
            :tabid: clusters-view

            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from
            the :guilabel:`Clusters` view:
         
            .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-clusters.rst

         .. tab:: Collections View
            :tabid: collections-view

            .. important::
         
               You can load sample data through the
               :guilabel:`Collection View` only if you have 
               :guilabel:`Data Explorer` :ref:`enabled 
               <disable-data-explorer>` and you don't have 
               any data already in your collection.
         
            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from the :guilabel:`Collections View`:
      
            .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-de.rst

   .. tab:: Local Deployment
      :tabid: local

      To load sample data into your local deployment: 

      .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-local.rst
        
.. _available-sample-datasets:

Available Sample Datasets
-------------------------

The following table shows the sample datasets available for |service| 
{+database-deployments+}. Click a sample dataset to learn more about it.

For instructions on loading this sample data into your |service|
{+database-deployment+}, see :ref:`load-sample-data`.

Sample Data Namespaces
----------------------

When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
namespaces on your {+database-deployment+}:

.. warning::

   If any of these namespaces already exist on your 
   {+database-deployment+} when you attempt to load the sample data, 
   the operation will fail and no sample data will be loaded into your 
   {+database-deployment+}.

Tutorials Using Sample Data
---------------------------

|service| Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`atlas-getting-started` tutorial walks through setting up
an |service| {+cluster+} and populating that {+cluster+} with sample 
data.

MongoDB Charts Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` tutorials guide you through
visualizing sample data provided by |service|:

:charts:`Visualizing Order Data </tutorial/order-data/order-data-tutorial-overview/>`
  Visualize the :ref:`sample-supplies`, which contains sales order data
  from a mock office supply company.

:charts:`Visualizing Movie Details </tutorial/movie-details/movie-details-tutorial-overview/>`
  Visualize the :ref:`sample-mflix`, which contains data on movies and
  movie theaters.
