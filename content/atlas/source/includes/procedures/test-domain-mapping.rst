.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: In a private browser window, navigate to the |service|
      log in page.

   .. step:: Enter a username (usually an email address) with your
      verified domain.

      .. example::

         If your verified domain is ``mongodb.com``, use an email
         address of the form ``username@mongodb.com``.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Next`. If you mapped your domain
      correctly, you'll be redirected to your |idp| to authenticate.
      Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to
      |service|.

      .. note::

         You can bypass the |service| log in page by navigating 
         directly to your |idp| :guilabel:`Login URL`.
