.. versionadded:: 5.0

.. group:: $derivative

Returns the average rate of change within the specified :ref:`window
<setWindowFields-window>`, which is calculated using the:

- First and last documents in the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage
  :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>`.

- Numerator, which is set to the result of subtracting the numeric
  :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` value for the first
  document from the :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` value
  for the last document.

- Denominator, which is set to the result of subtracting the
  :ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field value for the first
  document from the :ref:`sortBy <setWindowFields-sortBy>` field value
  for the last document.

:group:`$derivative` is only available in the
:pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage. You must specify a :ref:`window
<setWindowFields-window>` in the :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage when
using :group:`$derivative`.

:group:`$derivative` syntax:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {
      $derivative: {
         input: <expression>,
         unit: <time unit>
      }
   } 

:group:`$derivative` takes a document with these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :ref:`input <derivative-input>`

     - .. _derivative-input:
     
       Specifies the :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` to
       evaluate. The expression must evaluate to a number.

   * - :ref:`unit <derivative-unit>`

     - .. _derivative-unit:
       
       .. include:: /includes/outputUnit-behavior.rst

Behavior
--------

You must specify a :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` in the
:pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage when using :group:`$derivative`.

Example
-------

Create a ``deliveryFleet`` collection that contains odometer
readings for delivery trucks recorded at 30 second intervals:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.deliveryFleet.insertMany( [
      { truckID: "1", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:10:30Z" ), miles: 1295.1 },
      { truckID: "1", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:11:00Z" ), miles: 1295.63 },
      { truckID: "1", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:11:30Z" ), miles: 1296.25 },
      { truckID: "1", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:12:00Z" ), miles: 1296.76 },
      { truckID: "2", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:10:30Z" ), miles: 10234.1 },
      { truckID: "2", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:11:00Z" ), miles: 10234.33 },
      { truckID: "2", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:11:30Z" ), miles: 10234.73 },
      { truckID: "2", timeStamp: new Date( "2020-05-18T14:12:00Z" ), miles: 10235.13 }
   ] )

This example uses :group:`$derivative` in the
:pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage to obtain the average speed in miles
per hour for each truck, and the :pipeline:`$match` stage to filter the
results to trucks whose speed exceeded 50 miles per hour:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.deliveryFleet.aggregate( [
      {
         $setWindowFields: {
            partitionBy: "$truckID",
            sortBy: { timeStamp: 1 },
            output: {
               truckAverageSpeed: {
                  $derivative: {
                     input: "$miles",
                     unit: "hour"
                  },
                  window: {
                     range: [ -30, 0 ],
                     unit: "second"
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      },
      {
         $match: {
            truckAverageSpeed: {
               $gt: 50
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

In the example:

- The :pipeline:`$setWindowFields` stage obtains the average speed in
  miles per hour for each truck:

  - ``partitionBy: "$truckID"`` :ref:`partitions
    <setWindowFields-partitionBy>` the documents in the collection by
    ``truckID``.

  - ``sortBy: { timeStamp: 1 }`` :ref:`sorts
    <setWindowFields-sortBy>` the documents in each partition by
    ``timeStamp`` in ascending order (``1``), so the earliest
    odometer reading is first.

  - ``output`` sets the ``miles`` derivative value in a new
    field called ``truckAverageSpeed`` using :group:`$derivative` that
    is run in a :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` window.

    - The :ref:`input <derivative-input>` expression is set to
      ``"$miles"``, which is used in the numerator for the derivative
      calculation.

    - The :group:`$derivative` :ref:`unit <derivative-unit>` is set to
      ``"hour"`` for the ``timeStamp`` field, which is used in the
      denominator for the derivative calculation.

    - The :ref:`window <setWindowFields-window>` contains the
      :ref:`range <setWindowFields-range>` between a lower limit of
      ``-30`` seconds (the previous 30 seconds from the current
      document in the output) and ``0`` seconds (matches the current
      document's ``timeStamp`` value in the output). This means
      :group:`$derivative` returns the average speed for each truck in
      miles per hour in the 30 second window.

- The :pipeline:`$match` stage uses the greater than operator
  :expression:`$gt` to filter the results to trucks whose speed exceeded
  50 miles per hour.

In the following example output, the speed for truck 1 is shown in the
``truckAverageSpeed`` field. The speed for truck 2 is not shown because
truck 2 did not exceed 50 miles per hour.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : ObjectId("60cb8a7e833dfeadc8e6285c"), "truckID" : "1",
     "timeStamp" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:11:00Z"), "miles" : 1295.63,
     "truckAverageSpeed" : 63.60000000002401 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("60cb8a7e833dfeadc8e6285d"), "truckID" : "1",
     "timeStamp" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:11:30Z"), "miles" : 1296.25,
     "truckAverageSpeed" : 74.3999999999869 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("60cb8a7e833dfeadc8e6285e"), "truckID" : "1",
     "timeStamp" : ISODate("2020-05-18T14:12:00Z"), "miles" : 1296.76,
     "truckAverageSpeed" : 61.199999999998916 }
