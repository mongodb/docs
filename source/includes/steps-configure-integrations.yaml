title: "Configure the third-party integrations you want to enable."
content: |

  Click :guilabel:`Configure` for the third-party service you wish to
  modify. You can set one or more of the following:

  .. include:: /includes/list-tables/integration-configurations.rst

  .. note::

     If this table didn't show a European integration point for
     service, |service| doesn't support one. At this time, only
     `OpsGenie <https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/european-service-region/>`__
     and
     `DataDog <https://www.datadoghq.com/about/latest-news/press-releases/eu-region-germany/>`__
     offer separate European integration points.
