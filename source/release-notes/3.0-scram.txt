   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
   MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

   If you have user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``, you must
   upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism
   (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you upgrade to version
   4.0.

   The command listed in this procedure is only available in MongoDB
   3.0 through MongoDB 3.6.

Considerations
--------------

Backwards Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-scram-irreversible.rst

.. _considerations-scram-sha-1-drivers:

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade the authentication model, you must have a user in the
``admin`` database with the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

Timing
~~~~~~

*Applicable only if you are upgrading from 2.6 to 3.0*

- Once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to version 3.0, allow your
  MongoDB deployment to run for a day or two before following this
  procedure. This allows 3.0 some time to "burn in" and decreases the
  likelihood of downgrades occurring after the user privilege model
  upgrade. The user authentication and access control will continue to
  work as it did in 2.6.

- If you decide to upgrade the user authentication model immediately
  instead of waiting the recommended "burn in" period, then for sharded
  clusters, you must wait at least 10 seconds after upgrading the
  sharded clusters to run the authentication upgrade command.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a replica set, it is only necessary to run the upgrade process on
the :term:`primary` as the changes will automatically replicate to
the secondaries.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a sharded cluster, connect to one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run the
upgrade procedure to upgrade the cluster's authentication data. By
default, the procedure will upgrade the authentication data of the
shards as well.

To override this behavior, run ``authSchemaUpgrade`` with the
``upgradeShards: false`` option. If you choose to
override, you must run the upgrade procedure on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
first, and then run the procedure on the :term:`primary` members of
each shard.

For a sharded cluster, do **not** run the upgrade process directly
against the :doc:`config servers
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`. Instead, perform the upgrade
process using one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to interact with the
config database.

Upgrade Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded, you must upgrade all drivers used by applications that
will connect to upgraded database instances to version that support
SCRAM. The minimum driver versions that support SCRAM are:

.. |driver-compatibility-heading| replace:: Version

.. include:: /includes/list-table-3.0-driver-compatibility.rst

See the :driver:`MongoDB Drivers Page </>` for links to
download upgraded drivers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before upgrading the authentication model, your binaries must be at
least version 3.0. 

For sharded clusters, ensure that **all** cluster components are at
least 3.0.

To upgrade, see :doc:`upgrade MongoDB binaries to 3.0
</release-notes/3.0-upgrade>`.

Upgrade 2.6 ``MONGODB-CR`` User Credentials to SCRAM User Credentials
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-scram-irreversible.rst

.. important::

   To use SCRAM, a driver upgrade is **necessary** if your current
   driver version does not support SCRAM. See :ref:`required driver
   versions <considerations-scram-sha-1-drivers>` for details.

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-upgrade-mongodb-cr-to-scram.rst

Result
------

After this procedure is complete, all users in the database will have
SCRAM credentials, and any subsequently-created users will also have
this type of credentials.
