.. pipeline:: $sort

   Sorts all input documents and returns them to the pipeline in sorted
   order.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``$sort``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$sort` stage has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { <field1>: <sort order>, <field2>: <sort order> ... } }

:pipeline:`$sort` takes a document that specifies the field(s) to
sort by and the respective sort order. ``<sort order>`` can have one
of the following values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Value
     - Description

   * - ``1``
     - Sort ascending.

   * - ``-1``
     - Sort descending.

   * - ``{ $meta: "textScore" }``
     - Sort by the computed ``textScore`` metadata in descending
          order. See :ref:`sort-pipeline-metadata` for an example.

If sorting on multiple fields, sort order is evaluated from left to
right. For example, in the form above, documents are first sorted by
``<field1>``. Then documents with the same ``<field1>`` values are
further sorted by ``<field2>``.

.. _sort-aggregation-consistent-sorting:

Sort Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-sort-consistency.rst

Consider the following ``restaurant`` collection:

.. code-block:: js

   db.restaurants.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Central Park Cafe", "borough" : "Manhattan"},
      { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Rock A Feller Bar and Grill", "borough" : "Queens"},
      { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Empire State Pub", "borough" : "Brooklyn"},
      { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Stan's Pizzaria", "borough" : "Manhattan"},
      { "_id" : 5, "name" : "Jane's Deli", "borough" : "Brooklyn"},
   ] )

The following command uses the :pipeline:`$sort` stage to sort on
the ``borough`` field:

.. code-block:: js

   db.restaurants.aggregate(
      [
        { $sort : { borough : 1 } }
      ]
   )

In this example, sort order may be inconsistent, since the ``borough``
field contains duplicate values for both ``Manhattan`` and ``Brooklyn``.
Documents are returned in alphabetical order by ``borough``, but the
order of those documents with duplicate values for ``borough`` might not
the be the same across multiple executions of the same sort. For
example, here are the results from two different executions of the
above command:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Empire State Pub", "borough" : "Brooklyn" }
   { "_id" : 5, "name" : "Jane's Deli", "borough" : "Brooklyn" }
   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Central Park Cafe", "borough" : "Manhattan" }
   { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Stan's Pizzaria", "borough" : "Manhattan" }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Rock A Feller Bar and Grill", "borough" : "Queens" }

   { "_id" : 5, "name" : "Jane's Deli", "borough" : "Brooklyn" }
   { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Empire State Pub", "borough" : "Brooklyn" }
   { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Stan's Pizzaria", "borough" : "Manhattan" }
   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Central Park Cafe", "borough" : "Manhattan" }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Rock A Feller Bar and Grill", "borough" : "Queens" }

While the values for ``borough`` are still sorted in alphabetical order,
the order of the documents containing duplicate values for ``borough``
(i.e. ``Manhattan`` and ``Brooklyn``) is not the same.

To achieve a *consistent sort*, add a field which contains exclusively
unique values to the sort. The following command uses the
:pipeline:`$sort` stage to sort on both the ``borough`` field and the
``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: js

   db.restaurants.aggregate(
      [
        { $sort : { borough : 1, _id: 1 } }
      ]
   )

Since the ``_id`` field is always guaranteed to contain exclusively
unique values, the returned sort order will always be the same across
multiple executions of the same sort.

Examples
--------

.. _sort-pipeline-asc-desc:

Ascending/Descending Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the field or fields to sort by, set the sort order to ``1`` or ``-1`` to
specify an ascending or descending sort respectively, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
      [
        { $sort : { age : -1, posts: 1 } }
      ]
   )

This operation sorts the documents in the ``users`` collection,
in descending order according by the ``age`` field and then in
ascending order according to the value in the ``posts`` field.

.. _bson_sort_order:

.. include:: /includes/fact-sort-order.rst

For details on the comparison/sort order for specific types, see
:ref:`bson-types-comparison-order`.

.. _sort-pipeline-metadata:

Text Score Metadata Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/text-search-legacy-atlas-section.rst

For a pipeline that includes :query:`$text`, you can sort by
descending relevance score using the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore"
} <$meta>` expression. In the ``{ <sort-key> }`` document, set the
:expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` expression to an arbitrary
field name. The field name is ignored by the query system. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $text: { $search: "operating" } } },
        { $sort: { score: { $meta: "textScore" }, posts: -1 } }
      ]
   )

This operation uses the ``$text`` operator to match the documents,
and then sorts first by the ``"textScore"`` metadata in descending
order, and then by the ``posts`` field in descending order. The
``score`` field name in the sort document is ignored by the query
system. In this pipeline, the ``"textScore"`` metadata is not included
in the projection and is not returned as part of the matching
documents. See :expression:`$meta` for more information.

``$sort`` Operator and Memory
-----------------------------

.. _sort-limit-sequence:

``$sort`` + ``$limit`` Memory Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-agg-sort-limit.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-optimizations-subject-to-change.rst

.. _sort-memory-limit:

``$sort`` and Memory Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$sort`` is subject to the 100 megabyte memory usage limit, but is 
able to write temporary files to disk if additional space is required.

.. include:: /includes/fact-allowDiskUseByDefault.rst

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits`

``$sort`` Operator and Performance
----------------------------------

The :pipeline:`$sort` operator can take advantage of an index if it's
used in the first stage of a pipeline or if it's only preceeded by a
:pipeline:`$match` stage.

When you use the :pipeline:`$sort` on a sharded cluster, each shard
sorts its result documents using an index where available. Then the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` or one of the shards performs a streamed merge
sort.
