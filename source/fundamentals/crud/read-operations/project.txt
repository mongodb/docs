Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to control which fields appear in
documents returned from read operations with the MongoDB Java driver.

Many read requests require only a subset of fields in a document.
For example, when logging a user in you might only need their username, and
not all of their profile information. By default, queries in MongoDB return
all fields in matching documents. You can use a **projection** to return
only the data you need.

A projection is a document that instructs MongoDB which fields of a
document to return. Use the :ref:`Projections <projections-builders>` class
to construct a projection document.

Behavior
--------

Projections work in two ways:

- Explicitly including fields. This has the side-effect of implicitly
  excluding all unspecified fields.

- Implicitly excluding fields. This has the side-effect of implicitly
  including all unspecified fields.

These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive: if you
explicitly include fields, you cannot explicitly exclude fields, and
vice versa.

.. important::

   The ``_id`` field is **not** subject to these mechanics. You must
   explicitly exclude the ``_id`` field if you do not want it returned.
   You can exclude the ``_id`` field even if you have specified certain
   fields to include.

Explanation
-----------

Consider the following collection containing documents that describe
varieties of fruit:

.. code-block:: json

     { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },

In the following query, pass the projection to return the ``name``
field of each document:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   // return all documents with *only* the name field
   Bson filter = Filters.empty();
   Bson projection = Projections.fields(Projections.include("name"));
   collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));

The projection document specifies that the read operation result should
*include* the ``name`` field of each returned document. As a result, this
projection implicitly excludes the ``qty`` and ``rating`` fields. Chaining
this projection to ``find()`` with an empty query filter yields the
following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "name": "apples" }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas" }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges" }
   { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados" }

Despite the fact that this projection only explicitly included the
``name`` field, the query returned the ``_id`` field as well.

The ``_id`` field is a special case: it is always included in every query
result unless explicitly excluded. That's because the ``_id`` field is a
unique identifier for each document, a property that can be useful when
constructing queries.

A ``movies`` collection is a good example of why this property is useful:
because remakes and even separate works sometimes reuse movie titles,
you need a unique ``_id`` value to refer to any specific movie.

The ``_id`` is the only exception to the mutually exclusive include-exclude
behavior in projections: you *can* explicitly exclude the ``_id`` field
even when explicitly including other fields if you do not want ``_id``
to be present in returned documents.

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   // return all documents with only the name field
   Bson filter = Filters.empty();
   Bson projection = Projections.fields(Projections.include("name"), Projections.excludeId());
   collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));

The projection document specifies that the read operation result should
*include* the ``name`` field of each returned document, and specifies to
*exclude* the ``_id`` field. As a result, this projection implicitly
excludes the ``qty`` and ``rating`` fields. Chaining this projection to
``find()`` with an empty query filter yields the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "name": "apples" }
   { "name": "bananas" }
   { "name": "oranges" }
   { "name": "avocados" }

You can also specify multiple fields to include in your projection.

.. tip::

   The order in which you specify the fields in the projection does not
   alter the order in which they are returned.

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   Bson filter = Filters.empty();
   Bson projection = Projections.fields(Projections.include("name", "rating"), Projections.excludeId());
   collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));

This example that identifies two fields to include in the projection yields
the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

     { "name": "apples", "rating": 3 }
     { "name": "bananas", "rating": 1 }
     { "name": "oranges", "rating": 2 }
     { "name": "avocados", "rating": 5 }
