In addition to encrypting your data at rest in |service| with the customer-managed 
keys (CMK) that you create, own, and manage in your |aws| |kms|, you can add another layer 
of security by configuring all traffic to your |aws| |kms| to use {+aws-pl+}.

This page describes how to
set up {+aws-pl+} in your |aws| |kms| to ensure that all traffic between
|service| and your |aws| |kms| takes place over |aws|\'s private network
interfaces. 

Considerations 
--------------

Before you enable Encryption at Rest using |aws| |kms| over PrivateLink,
review the following use cases, benefits, limitations, and prerequisites.

Use Case 
~~~~~~~~

Suppose your |service| deployment is on a single cloud service provider.
You now have a requirement that all access to your |aws| |kms| occurs over your
cloud provider's private networking infrastructure. This page walks you
through the steps to enable private endpoint connections for your
|service| project. 

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

You can configure
Encryption at Rest with |aws| |kms| over private networking. This configuration allows all
traffic to your |aws| |kms| to pass through a set of private endpoints and avoids
exposing your |aws| |kms| to the public internet or public IP addresses. This configuration also
eliminates the need to maintain allowed IP addresses while enhancing
data security by keeping all |aws| |kms| traffic within |aws|'s private
network.  

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* |service| supports Encryption at Rest using |aws| |kms| over
  private networking only for single-cloud deployments. 

* |service| supports Encryption at Rest using |aws| |kms| over
  private networking only for projects in the ``ACTIVE`` state.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |aws| |kms| for a MongoDB
project, you must:

Procedures 
----------

.. _aws-kms-pvt-enable-project:

Enable Role-Based Access for Your Encryption Key for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-rba-encryption-for-project.rst

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: api
   
      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-rba-encryption-api.rst

After you enable role-based access for your encryption key for your project, 
enable private endpoint connections for your project by following 
:ref:`aws-kms-enable-pvt-endpoint`. 

.. _aws-kms-pvt-switch-project:

Switch to Role-Based Access for Your Encryption Key for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|aws| requires the use of |iam| *roles* instead of |iam| 
*users* for managing access to |aws| |kms| encryption keys within |service|. 
If you initially configured your project to use |iam| *user* credentials to access 
|aws| |kms| keys, switch to role-based access using the following procedure.

.. include:: /includes/fact-switching-access-to-encryption-keys.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-migrate-rba-encryption-for-project.rst

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: api
   
      To update your encryption key management with the 
      {+atlas-admin-api+}, use the same steps outlined in the 
      :ref:`above procedure <aws-kms-enable-project>`.

.. _aws-kms-enable-pvt-endpoint:

Enable and Set up Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable private networking and set up a private
endpoint in your |aws| |kms|, you must do the following: 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-aws-enable-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-aws-enable-private-endpoint-connections.rst

After you enable customer key management for your project and set up private endpoints, 
enable customer key management for each |service| {+cluster+} in your project by following 
:ref:`aws-pvt-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest`.    

.. _aws-pvt-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`aws-kms-pvt-enable-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| {+cluster+} that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for {+clusters+} in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the
:ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you create the {+cluster+}. 

For existing {+clusters+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps-cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Disable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable |cmk| for a project, you must first :ref:`remove
<aws-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints associated 
with the project, regardless of their state. |service| displays an error if
you attempt to disable |cmk| for a project that is associated with
active private endpoints. 

After you remove all private endpoints for a project, you must disable
customer key management on each {+cluster+} in the project before you 
disable the feature for the project.

.. warning::

   Do *not* disable or delete any |aws| |kms| keys that any {+cluster+} in your
   |service| project uses before you have disabled customer key
   management within the |service| project. If |service| can't access
   an |aws| |kms| key, any data that the key encrypted becomes inaccessible.

.. _aws-kms-create-pvt-endpoint:

Create New Endpoints for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you enable and set up private endpoint connections for your
project, you can add additional endpoints at anytime from the
{+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-aws-create-private-endpoints-ui.rst

   .. tab:: API 
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-aws-create-private-endpoints-api.rst

.. _aws-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint:

Reject or Remove Private Endpoint Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove private endpoint connections from the {+atlas-ui+} and
the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`AWS KMS`

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-delete-ear-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: API 
      :tabid: api

      To successfully remove a private endpoint, send a ``DELETE`` request to
      the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint
      </requestEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpointDeletion>` and specify the ID of
      the project and of the private endpoint that you want to delete. You can 
      retrieve the ID of the private endpoint that you want to delete by sending 
      a ``GET`` request to the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-atlas-op:`Return One Private 
      Endpoint Service for One Provider 
      </Private-Endpoint-Services/operation/getPrivateEndpointService>` endpoint.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json
      
            curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
            --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin       API
            --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --include \
            --request DELETE "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AWS/      privateEndpoints/{endpointId}" \ 
            --data '
              {
                "cloudProvider": "AWS",
                "regions": [
                  "string"
                ]
              }'

      When you use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to delete a private endpoint, the
      private endpoint transitions to the ``DELETING`` status while |service|
      deletes the private endpoint.

      If you remove or reject an active private endpoint from the |aws| UI,
      |service| automatically attempts to recreate a new private endpoint in
      the same region. 

      While |service| attempts to create a new private endpoint, the status of
      the private endpoint that you rejected or removed transitions to
      ``PENDING_RECREATION`` and the new endpoint that |service| attempts to
      create is in ``INITIATING`` state. You must approve the new private
      endpoint after it is created. 

.. _aws-view-pvt-endpoints:

View Private Endpoints and their Statuses 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the private endpoints in the various regions and their
statuses from the {+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`AWS KMS`

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-advanced.rst

         .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-ear-pvt-endpoints-mgmnt-page.rst

   .. tab:: API 
      :tabid: api

      You can view the private endpoint and their statuses from the
      {+atlas-admin-api+} by sending a ``GET`` request to the
      {+atlas-admin-api+} ``encryptionAtRest`` 
      :oas-atlas-op:`get all </getEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpointsForCloudProvider>` 
      endpoint or :oas-atlas-op:`get one </getEncryptionAtRestPrivateEndpoint>` 
      endpoint, for which you must specify the ID of the private endpoint
      in the path. 

      .. example:: Return All Private Endpoints for One Project

         .. code-block:: 
            :copyable: true

            curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
            --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin API
            --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --include \
            --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AWS/privateEndpoints/"      

Each private endpoint can be in one of the following statuses:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/aws-pvt-endpoint-statuses.rst

.. _aws-disable-pvt-endpoint:

Disable Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable private endpoint connections for a project, you must first
:ref:`remove <aws-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints, 
associated with the project, regardless of their state. |service|
doesn't disable private endpoint connections for a project if the
project is associated with active private endpoints.

After you remove all private endpoints for a project, you can disable
private endpoint connections for the project by using the {+atlas-ui+}
and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`AWS KMS`

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-disable-ear-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: API 
      :tabid: api


      To disable a private endpoint connection, send a 
      ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint
      </updateEncryptionAtRest>` with the ``requirePrivateNetworking`` boolean
      flag value set to ``false``.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: shell 
            :emphasize-lines: 9

            {
              "awsKms": {
                "accessKeyID": "019dd98d94b4bb778e7552e4",
                "customerMasterKeyID": "string",
                "enabled": true,
                "region": "US_EAST_1",
                "roleId": "32b6e34b3d91647abb20e7b8",
                "secretAccessKey": "string"
                "requirePrivateNetworking": false
              }
            }
