|service| lets you export your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots to an |aws| 
|s3| bucket. 

How |service| Exports Snapshots 
-------------------------------

You can  manually export individual snapshots or set up an export 
policy for automatic export of your snapshots. For automatic exports, 
you must specify a frequency in your export policy. |service|  
automatically exports any snapshot that matches this frequency. 

|service| exports snapshots for collections one at a time. As the 
export progresses, you may see partial results in your |s3| bucket. 
|service| queues any new job if |service| is currently exporting 5 or 
more replica sets. For sharded clusters, |service| always exports the 
snapshots of all the shards simultaneously, regardless of the number 
of shards. 

Files |service| Uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uploads an empty file to ``/exported_snapshots/.permissioncheck`` 
when you:

- Add a new |aws| |s3| export bucket
- Start an export

After |service| finishes exporting, |service| uploads a metadata file 
named ``.complete`` and a metadata file named ``metadata.json`` for 
each collection. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: .complete File 
      :tabid: complete

      |service| uploads the metadata file named ``.complete`` in the 
      following path on your |s3| bucket: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag to ``true`` via the 
         :ref:`modify-cloud-backup-policy` API. |service| replaces any 
         spaces with underscores (``_``) and removes any 
         :aws:`characters that might require special handling 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The ``.complete`` metadata file is in |json| format and contains 
      the following fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field

             |service| organization.

         * - ``orgName``
           - Name of the |service| organization. 

         * - ``groupId``

             |service| cluster.

         * - ``clusterName``
           - Name of the |service| project.

         * - ``snapshotInitiationDate``
           - Date when snapshot was taken.

         * - ``totalFiles``
           - Total number of files uploaded to the |s3| bucket.

         * - ``labels``
           - Labels of the cluster whose snapshot was exported.

         * - ``customData``
           - Custom data, if any, that you specified when creating the 
             export job.

              ]
            }

   .. tab:: metadata.json File 
      :tabid: metadata

      |service| uploads the ``metadata.json`` file for each collection 
      in the following path on your |s3| bucket: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/metadata.json

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag via the 
         :ref:`modify-cloud-backup-policy` API to true. |service| 
         replaces any spaces with underscores (``_``) and removes any 
         :aws:`characters that might require special handling 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The metadata file is in |json| format and contains the following 
      fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``collectionName``
           - Human-readable label that identifies the collection.

         * - ``indexes``
           - List of all the indexes on the collection in the format 
             returned by :manual:`db.collection.getIndexes 
             </reference/method/db.collection.getIndexes/#output>` 
             command. 

         * - ``options``
           - Configuration options defined on the collection. To learn 
             more about the options, see :manual:`db.createCollection() 
             </reference/method/db.createCollection/>` command.

         * - ``type``

             This field is not returned for a standard collection.

         * - ``uuid``
           - Collection's UUID. To learn more about UUID, see 
             :manual:`UUID </reference/method/UUID/>`.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: false 

            {
              "options":{
                "viewOn":"othercol",

            {
              "indexes": [
                {
                  "v":{"$numberInt":"2"},
                  "key":{
                    "_id":{"$numberInt":"1"}

              "collectionName":"somecol"
            }

If an export job fails: 

- |service| doesn't automatically try to export again.
- |service| doesn't remove any partial data in your |s3| bucket.

Exported Data Format
--------------------

|service| uploads the contents of your database to |s3| in ``.json.gz`` 
format with documents in extended |json| format within. The path 
to the files on |s3| is: 

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   /exported_snapshots/<orgName>/<projectName>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/<shardName>.<increment>.json.gz

Where: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 35 65

   * - ``<orgName>``
     - Name of your |service| organization.

   * - ``<projectName>``
     - Name of your |service| project.

   * - ``<clusterName>``
     - Name of your |service| cluster.

   * - ``<initiationDateOfSnapshot>``
     - Date when snapshot was taken.

   * - ``<timestamp>``
     - Timestamp when the export job was created.

   * - ``<dbName>``
     - Name of the database in the |service| cluster.

   * - ``<collectionName>``
     - Name of the |service| collection.

   * - ``<shardName>``
     - Name of the replica set.

   * - ``<increment>``
     - Count that is incremented as chunks are uploaded. Starts at 
       ``0``.

Limitations 
-----------

The following limitations apply:

- You can only export to |aws| |s3| buckets.
- You can't export :ref:`fallback snapshots <cps-failback-snapshots>`.
- You can have only one active export per snapshot. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To export your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots to an |aws| |s3| bucket, you 
will need the following:

1. ``M10`` or higher |service| cluster with {+Cloud-Backup+} 
   :ref:`enabled <backup-cloud-provider>`.
#. |aws| `IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ 
   with ``STS:AssumeRole`` that grants |service| access to your |aws| 
   resources. To learn more about configuring |aws| access for 
   |service|, see :ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`.
#. |aws| `IAM role policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html>`__ 
   that grants |service| write access or the ``S3:PutObject`` and 
   ``S3:GetBucketLocation`` permissions to your |aws| resources. To 
   learn more about configuring write access to |aws| resources, see 
   :ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`.

Export Management 
-----------------

Use the following APIs to: 

- Manage export policy including :doc:`modifying 
  </reference/api/cloud-backup/schedule/modify-one-schedule>` and 
  :doc:`retrieving 
  </reference/api/cloud-backup/schedule/get-all-schedules/>` snapshot 
  policy for :ref:`exporting <cps-backup-snapshot-export>`.
- :ref:`Manage <snapshot-export-buckets>` export buckets including 
  :ref:`creating <create-backup-export-bucket>`, :ref:`retrieving 
  <get-all-backup-export-bucket>`, and :ref:`deleting 
  <delete-one-backup-export-bucket>` export buckets.
- :ref:`Manage <snapshot-export-jobs>` export jobs including 
  :ref:`creating <cps-backup-snapshot-export-create>` and 
  :ref:`retrieving <cps-backup-snapshot-export-get-all>` export jobs.
