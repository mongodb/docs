An organization can contain multiple projects. Under this hierarchy structure, you can:

- Use the same billing settings across all projects in your
  organization.

- Use the same alert settings across all projects in your organization.

- View all projects within an organization.

- Bulk assign users to projects with teams.

.. _create-organization:

Create an Organization
----------------------

.. note::

   When you create an organization, you are added as an
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` for the organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-organization.rst


Once you create the organization, you can add projects, users, and 
set the billing information for all projects within the organization.

.. _cm-session-timeout:

Configure Session Timeouts
--------------------------

Organization Owners can configure the absolute and idle session timeouts for all users of 
an organization to comply with security and certification policies.

The **absolute session timeout** specifies the maximum duration a user can remain 
logged in to the |mms| UI without re-authenticating. The **idle session timeout**
specifies the maximum duration a user can remain inactive before |mms| logs them out.

.. note::

   This feature is in Public Preview. The feature and the corresponding documentation might change at any time during the Preview period. To learn more, see `Preview Features <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/preview-features/>`__.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If a user belongs to multiple organizations, their session inherits the shortest 
  idle and absolute timeouts from across all of them. For example, a user's session 
  combines the shortest absolute timeout from one organization with the shortest 
  idle timeout from another. To view the timeouts that apply to you, 
  see the :ref:`Personalization page <edit-user-account>`. 
- Two minutes before an idle session expires, |mms| displays a message allowing 
  the user to continue the session.
- Timeout configurations apply only to the |mms| UI. They do not affect:

  - account access through API keys or service accounts.
  - sessions where users log in to developer tools like Compass, the Relational Migrator, 
    or the Atlas CLI using their |mms| credentials. A fixed 12-hour session 
    timeout applies instead of the custom values.
  - sessions where users log in through Charts and Atlas App Services directly.
  - MongoDB SSO-linked services such as MongoDB University and the Support Portal. 
    These services use a 12-hour session timeout.

  .. important::

     For the tools and services listed above, sessions might still expire in less than 
     12 hours if your main |mms| web session ends.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Navigate to the Organization Settings page.

      .. include:: /includes/nav/list-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Set the absolute and idle session timeouts.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Configure Session Timeout` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Specify the absolute and idle session timeouts.

         The absolute session timeout must be greater than or equal to the idle 
         session timeout.

         For |mms|, limits include:

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 25 25 25
            :header-rows: 1
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Session Timeout
              - Default
              - Minimum
              - Maximum

            * - Absolute
              - 12 hours
              - 1 hour
              - 12 hours

            * - Idle
              - None
              - 5 minutes
              - Absolute session timeout

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 


.. _leave-organization:

Leave an Organization
---------------------

.. important::

   You can't leave an organization if you are the last :authrole:`Organization Owner` for that organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/leave-organization.rst

.. _delete-organization:

Delete an Organization
----------------------

.. important::

   To delete an organization, you must have
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

   You cannot delete an organization that has active projects. You must
   delete the organization's projects before you can delete the
   organization.
