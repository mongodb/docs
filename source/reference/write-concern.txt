Write Concern Reference

Overview

.. include:: /includes/introduction-write-concern.rst

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/write-concern` for an introduction to write
   concern in MongoDB.

Available Write Concern
-----------------------

To provide write concern, :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` issue
the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command after a write operation and
receive a document with information about the last operation. This
document's ``err`` field contains either:

- ``null``, which indicates the write operations have completed
  successfully, or

- a description of the last error encountered.

The definition of a "successful write" depends on the arguments
specified to :dbcommand:`getLastError`, or in replica sets, the
configuration of
:data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults`.
When deciding the level of write
concern for your application, see the introduction to
:doc:`/core/write-concern`.

The :dbcommand:`getLastError` command has the following options to
configure write concern requirements:

- ``j`` or "journal" option

  This option confirms that the :program:`mongod` instance has written
  the data to the on-disk journal and ensures data is not lost if the
  :program:`mongod` instance shuts down unexpectedly. Set to ``true`` to
  enable, as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, j: "true" } )

  If you set :data:`journal` to true, and the :program:`mongod` does
  not have journaling enabled, as with :setting:`nojournal`, then
  :dbcommand:`getLastError` will provide basic receipt acknowledgment,
  and will include a ``jnote`` field in its return document.

- ``w`` option

  This option provides the ability to disable write concern entirely
  *as well as* specifies the write concern operations for
  :term:`replica sets <replica set>`. See :doc:`Write Concern
  Considerations </core/write-concern>` for an introduction to the
  fundamental concepts of write concern. By default, the ``w`` option
  is set to ``1``, which provides basic receipt acknowledgment on a
  single :program:`mongod` instance or on the :term:`primary` in a
  replica set.

  The ``w`` option takes the following values:

  - ``0``:

    Disables basic acknowledgment of write operations, but returns
    information about socket exceptions and networking errors to the
    application.

    .. note::

       If you disable basic write operation acknowledgment but require
       journal commit acknowledgment, the journal commit prevails, and
       the driver will require that :program:`mongod` will
       acknowledge the write operation.

  - ``1``:

    Provides acknowledgment of write operations on a standalone
    :program:`mongod` or the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

  - *A number greater than 1*:

    Guarantees that write operations have propagated successfully to
    the specified number of replica set members including the primary.
    If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the number of set
    members that hold data, MongoDB waits for the non-existent members
    to become available, which means MongoDB blocks indefinitely.

  - ``majority``:

    Confirms that write operations have propagated to the majority of
    configured replica set: a majority of the set's configured members
    must acknowledge the write operation before it succeeds. This
    allows you to avoid hard coding assumptions about the size of your
    replica set into your application.

    .. include:: /includes/fact-master-slave-majority.rst

  - *A tag set*:

    By specifying a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`
    you can have fine-grained control over which replica
    set members must acknowledge a write operation to satisfy the required
    level of write concern.

:dbcommand:`getLastError` also supports a ``wtimeout`` setting which
allows clients to specify a timeout for the write concern: if you
don't specify ``wtimeout``, or if you give it a value of ``0``, and the :program:`mongod` cannot fulfill
the write concern the :dbcommand:`getLastError` will block,
potentially forever.

For more information on write concern and replica sets, see
:ref:`Write Concern for Replica Sets <replica-set-write-concern>` for
more information.

In sharded clusters, :program:`mongos` instances will pass write
concern on to the shard :program:`mongod` instances.
