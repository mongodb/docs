--------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-fts-index.rst

Delete an |fts| Index Using the |fts| API
-----------------------------------------

To delete an |fts| index through the |api|, send a ``DELETE`` request 
with the ``ID`` of the |fts| index that you wish to delete to the 
``fts/indexes/`` :oas-atlas-op:`endpoint 
</deleteAtlasSearchIndex>`. To learn more about the 
syntax and parameters for this endpoint, see 
:oas-atlas-op:`Delete One </deleteAtlasSearchIndex>`.

.. _ref-delete-index-programmatically:

Delete an |fts| Index Programmatically
--------------------------------------

You can delete an |fts| index programmatically by using
{+mongosh+} or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>` 
in your preferred language. 

.. note:: 

   You can't use the {+mongosh+} command or driver helper methods to
   delete |fts| indexes on ``M0``, ``M2``, or ``M5`` |service|
   {+clusters+}. To create and manage |fts| indexes using {+mongosh+} or
   the driver, upgrade to a dedicated {+cluster+} tier. 

You must have at least the 
:atlasrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` role or ``readWrite`` access to
the database that contains the indexes. To learn more, 
see :ref:`atlas-user-privileges` or :ref:`atlas-specific-privileges`.
