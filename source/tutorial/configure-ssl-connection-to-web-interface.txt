Overview
--------

You can encrypt connections from the Monitoring and Backup Agents to
|onprem| and from website clients to the |onprem| web interface. You can
encrypt connections in either of two ways:

- Set up an HTTPs proxy in front of |onprem|.

- Run the |application| over HTTPS, as described here.

By default, |onprem| uses port ``8443`` for HTTPS access.

Run the |application| Over HTTPS
--------------------------------

To run the |application| over HTTPS, you can configure |onprem| with the
server's certificate and private key.
