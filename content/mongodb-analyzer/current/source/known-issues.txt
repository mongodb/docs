Known Issues
============

We are consistently working to improve the {+product-short+}, but we have
identified certain issues with its current functionality. If you
identify an issue that is not on this page, see the
:ref:`mongodb-analyzer-issues-and-help` page for
instructions on how to get help or report the issue.

Error List Window on macOS
--------------------------

Visual Studio for macOS does not have the :guilabel:`Error List` window feature. If
you are using the {+product-short+} in Visual Studio for macOS, you will not
be able to see output from the {+product-short+}, such as {+query-api+}
translations, in one location.

Partial Support for Atlas Search Builders
-----------------------------------------

The {+product-short+} provides only partial support for ``Search`` builder
methods and other Atlas Search features. The {+product-short+} cannot analyze
code that uses any of the following features:

- The ``Compound()`` method
- The ``Range()`` method
- The ``Equals()`` method with number parameters or parameters of type
  ``ObjectId`` or ``DateTime``
- The ``Facet()`` method
- The ``GeoShape()`` method
- The ``GeoWithin()`` method
- The ``MoreLikeThis()`` method
- Calling the ``Near()`` method with a parameter of type ``DateTime``
- Calling the ``Wildcard()`` method with multiple field definitions
- Calling ``Search`` builder methods with parameters of type ``SearchRange``,
  ``SearchFuzzyOptions``, or ``SearchScoreDefinition``
- The ``SearchMeta()`` method
- The ``SearchPath`` builder
