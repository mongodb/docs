================================================
Configure Windows ``netsh`` Firewall for MongoDB
================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Windows Firewall is configured on the cli, using ``netsh``. Here
are some example firewall rules for MongoDB traffic -

.. code-block:: netsh

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod port 27017" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=27017

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod shard port 27018" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=27018


To delete the firewall rule allowing :program:`mongod` traffic:

.. code-block:: netsh

   netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open mongod port 27017" protocol=tcp localport=27017

   netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open mongod shard port 27018" protocol=tcp localport=27018

Alternatively, you can enable a program as opposed to opening a port:

.. code-block:: sh

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allowing mongod" dir=in action=allow program=" C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe"

or for a mongod shard server:

.. code-block:: sh

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allowing mongos" dir=in action=allow program=" C:\mongodb\bin\mongos.exe"

To list/view the Windows Firewall rules:

.. code-block:: sh

   netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all

To reset the Windows Firewall rules:

.. code-block:: sh

   netsh advfirewall reset

To save administration, you can export or import firewall (from
different servers) rules very easily on Windows:

.. code-block:: sh

   netsh advfirewall export "C:\temp\MongoDBfw.wfw"

   netsh advfirewall import "C:\temp\MongoDBfw.wfw"

It is also possible to configure the Windows Firewall through a
GUI, however, this is not within scope for this tutorial.
