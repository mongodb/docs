Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-long+}, the
official driver for asynchronous stream processing. Download
the driver by following the :ref:`scala-install` guide, then set up a
runnable project by following the :ref:`scala-quickstart` guide.

To access MongoDB by using Java instead of Scala, use the `Java Sync
Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/>`__ or
the asynchronous `Java Reactive Streams Driver
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/java/reactive-streams-driver/current/>`__.
