Replica Set Member States
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Members of replica sets have states that reflect the startup process, basic
operations, and potential error states.

.. include:: /includes/replica-states.rst

States
------

Core States
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. replstate:: PRIMARY

   Members in :replstate:`PRIMARY` state accept write operations. A replica set has only
   one primary at a time. A :replstate:`SECONDARY` member becomes primary
   after an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. Members in the :replstate:`PRIMARY`
   state are eligible to vote.

.. replstate:: SECONDARY

   Members in :replstate:`SECONDARY` state replicate the primary's data set
   and can be configured to accept read operations. Secondaries are eligible to vote in
   elections, and may be elected to the :replstate:`PRIMARY` state if the
   primary becomes unavailable.

.. replstate:: ARBITER

   Members in :replstate:`ARBITER` state do not replicate data or accept write operations.
   They are eligible to vote, and exist solely to break a tie during
   elections. Replica sets should only have a member in the :replstate:`ARBITER` state
   if the set would otherwise have an even number of members, and could suffer
   from tied elections. Like primaries, there should only be at most one arbiter
   in any replica set.

See :doc:`/core/replica-set-members` for more information on core states.

Initialization States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. replstate:: STARTUP

   Each member of a replica set starts up in :replstate:`STARTUP`
   state. :program:`mongod` then loads that member's replica set configuration,
   and transitions the member's state to :replstate:`STARTUP2`. Members in
   :replstate:`STARTUP` are not eligible to vote.

.. replstate:: STARTUP2

   Each member of a replica set enters the :replstate:`STARTUP2` state as
   soon as :program:`mongod` finishes loading that member's
   configuration. While in the :replstate:`STARTUP2` state, the member
   creates threads to handle internal replication operations. Members are in the
   :replstate:`STARTUP2` state for a short period of time before entering the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.
   Members in the :replstate:`STARTUP2` state are not eligible to vote.

.. replstate:: RECOVERING

   A member of a replica set enters :replstate:`RECOVERING` state when
   it is not ready to accept reads. The :replstate:`RECOVERING` state
   can occur during normal operation, and doesn't necessarily reflect
   an error condition.  Members in the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state
   are eligible to vote in elections, but is not eligible to enter the
   :replstate:`PRIMARY` state.

   During startup, members transition through :replstate:`RECOVERING` after
   :replstate:`STARTUP2` and before becoming :replstate:`SECONDARY`.

   During normal operation, if a :term:`secondary` falls behind the
   other members of the replica set, it may need to :doc:`resync
   </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>` with the
   rest of the set. While resyncing, the member enters the
   :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

   Whenever the replica set replaces a :term:`primary` in an
   election, the old primary's data collection may contain documents
   that did not have time to replicate to the :term:`secondary`
   members. In this case the member rolls back those writes. During
   :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`, the member will have
   :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

   On secondaries, the :dbcommand:`compact` and
   :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` commands force the secondary to enter
   :replstate:`RECOVERING` state. This prevents clients from reading
   during those operations.

Error States
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Members in any error state can't vote.

.. replstate:: FATAL

   Members that encounter an unrecoverable error enter the :replstate:`FATAL`
   state. Members in this state requires administrator intervention.

.. replstate:: UNKNOWN

   Members that have never communicated status information to the replica
   set are in the :replstate:`UNKNOWN` state.

.. replstate:: DOWN

   Members that lose their connection to the replica set enter the
   :replstate:`DOWN` state.

.. replstate:: SHUNNED

   Members that are removed from the replica set enter the :replstate:`SHUNNED`
   state. 
   When in `SHUNNED` state the logs will mark this event as 
   `replSet REMOVED` message entry

.. replstate:: ROLLBACK

   When a :replstate:`SECONDARY` rolls back a write operation after
   transitioning from :replstate:`PRIMARY`, it enters the
   :replstate:`ROLLBACK` state. See
   :doc:`/core/replica-set-rollbacks`.
