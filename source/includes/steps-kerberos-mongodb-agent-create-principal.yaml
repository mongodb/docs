  An |upn| is formatted in two parts so the service can be uniquely
  identified across the Kerberos realm:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Component

       - Description

     * - Service name

       - The name of one service a host is providing to the Kerberos
         realm, such as ``pop``, ``snmp``, or ``ftp``.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-snmp-alerts-deprecated.rst

     * - Kerberos realm 

       - A set of managed hosts and services that share the same 
         Kerberos database.

         .. note:: 

            By Kerberos naming convention, the ``<KERBEROS_REALM>``
            must be in all ``UPPERCASE``.

  .. example::

     In a Kerberos realm set as ``EXAMPLE.COM``, the {+mdbagent+}
     would set its |upn| to: ``mongodb-agent@EXAMPLE.COM``

  Generate a `keytab
  <https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/basic/keytab_def.html>`_
  file (``*.keytab``) for the {+mdbagent+} |upn| and copy it to the
  host that runs the {+mdbagent+}. Ensure that the operating system
  user that runs the {+mdbagent+} is the same operating system user
  that owns the ``keytab`` file.
