Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-long+}, the official
MongoDB driver for synchronous {+language+} applications. Download the driver by using
`Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, or set up a
runnable project by following our Quick Start guide.

.. tip:: Kotlin Coroutine Driver

   If your {+language+} application requires asynchronous processing, use the
   :driver:`Coroutine Driver </kotlin/coroutine/current>`, which uses coroutines for
   server-side applications.
