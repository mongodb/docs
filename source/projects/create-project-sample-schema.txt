   :description: Create a project using a sample schema in Relational Migrator to test migration jobs without a relational database, with options for Docker or PostgreSQL setup.

You can create a project using a pre-defined sample schema. The sample schema allows 
you to try Relational Migrator even if you don't have a relational database to
connect to. If you want to run a migration job for your sample project you can deploy 
a Docker image containing the schema and data.

- (Optional) Host a Docker PostgreSQL instance or load data to the ``Northwind`` database.

- Create a project with the ``Use a sample schema`` project option.

- Select the database, schema, and tables that are part of the migration.

About this Task
---------------

Creating a project with a sample schema is the quickest and easiest way 
to test drive Relational Migrator.

.. include:: /includes/project-initial-mappings-att.rst

Before you Begin
----------------

Before you can run migration jobs from the sample schema you must either:

1. Download `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ to pull and host a provided 
   PostgreSQL database container. This container comes preloaded with the sample 
   schema presented in Relational Migrator.

2. Download and execute the 
   `Northwind.sql <https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/blob/master/northwind.sql>`__ 
   database setup script on an existing PostgreSQL instance. This script loads 
   the sample schema.

Steps
-----

The following steps guide you through the process of connecting to a Docker container 
with the intent of migrating data with migration jobs. This is not a requirement, you can 
create a project without running migration jobs. If you do not plan on running migration jobs, 
skip step one.

1. (Optional) From a terminal window, run the following Docker command to launch 
   a PostgreSQL relational database instance:

   .. code-block::

      docker run -p 5432:5432 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator-sample-database

   The connection credentials for this database instance are:

   - Username: ``postgres``

   - Password: ``postgres``

   - Port: ``5432``

   .. warning::

     The PostgreSQL database is for demo uses only and should not be used for 
     production purposes.

#. In Relational Migrator, click :guilabel:`New Project` at the top-right of the 
   Relational Migrator home screen.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Create sample` button.

#. From the :guilabel:`Select tables` screen, indicate the tables you want to 
   migrate, and click :guilabel:`Next`. 

   The following table explains the different ways you can select tables to migrate: 

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 25 75

      * - Target
        - Action

      * - All tables within a database
        - Click the check mark for the target database.

      * -  All tables within a schema
        - Expand the target database and click the check mark for the target schema.

      * - Specific tables within a schema
        - Expand the target database and schema. Select the target tables individually.
    
      * - Specific table names
        - Use the :guilabel:`Filter` bar above the :guilabel:`Relational Schema` list.

#. Choose a :guilabel:`Global casing` option for collection names. 
   
   This option affects the names of your collections created from the
   tables in your relational database:

   - :guilabel:`Keep Original`: Keep the original casing used in your relational
     database table name.

   - :guilabel:`Override with Global Casing`: Override the original table name
     with a global casing convention.

     - ``camelCase``
     - ``TitleCase``
     - ``kebab-case``
     - ``snake_case``
     - ``UPPER_SNAKE_CASE``

#. Choose an :guilabel:`Initial mappings` option for your MongoDB schema.

   .. include:: /includes/project-initial-mappings.rst

#. Enter a name for your project.

#. Click :guilabel:`Done`.
