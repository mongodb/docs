Core Processes
--------------

The core components in the MongoDB package are: :binary:`~bin.mongod`,
the core database process; :binary:`~bin.mongos` the controller and query
router for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`; and
:binary:`~bin.mongo` the interactive MongoDB Shell.

   mongod
   mongos
   mongo

Windows Services
----------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` describe the
options available for configuring MongoDB when running as a Windows
Service. The :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` binaries
provide a superset of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
options.

   mongos.exe

Binary Import and Export Tools
------------------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongodump` provides a method for creating :term:`BSON`
dump files from the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, while
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` makes it possible to restore these
dumps. :binary:`~bin.bsondump` converts BSON dump files into
:term:`JSON`. The :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` utility provides the ability
to stream :term:`oplog` entries outside of normal replication.

Data Import and Export Tools
----------------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongoimport` provides a method for taking data in :term:`JSON`,
:term:`CSV`, or :term:`TSV` and importing it into a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance. :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` provides a method to export data from
a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance into JSON, CSV, or TSV.

.. note::

   The conversion between BSON and other formats lacks full
   type fidelity. Therefore you cannot use :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` for round-trip import and export operations.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   mongoimport
   mongoexport

Diagnostic Tools
----------------

:binary:`~bin.mongostat`, :binary:`~bin.mongotop`, and :binary:`~bin.mongosniff`
provide diagnostic information related to the current operation of a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. note::

   Because :binary:`~bin.mongosniff` depends on :term:`libpcap
   <pcap>`, most distributions of MongoDB do *not* include
   :binary:`~bin.mongosniff`.

.. toctree::

   mongotop
   mongosniff

GridFS
------

:binary:`~bin.mongofiles` provides a command-line interact to a MongoDB
:term:`GridFS` storage system.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mongofiles
