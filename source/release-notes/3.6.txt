   * - :pipeline:`$currentOp`

     - Returns a stream of documents containing information
       on active and/or dormant operations on a :program:`mongod`
       instance. Uses the new aggregation helper
       :method:`db.aggregate()`.

   * - :pipeline:`$listSessions`

     - Lists server sessions in the ``system.sessions`` collection in the
       ``config`` database. Uses the new aggregation helper
       :method:`db.aggregate()`.

   * - :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`

     - Lists server sessions cached in memory by the server.

   * - :expression:`$dateToParts`
     - Returns a document containing the constituent parts of a date.


New Aggregation Helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds a helper, :method:`db.aggregate()`, to perform
aggregations that do not rely on an underlying collection, such
as those that start with :pipeline:`$currentOp` or
:pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

New Aggregation Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:variable:`REMOVE` allows for the conditional exclusion of a field.

New Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method support the following new options:

- ``hint`` option to specify the index to use.

  .. note::

     The ``hint`` does not apply to :pipeline:`$lookup` and
     :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages.

- ``comment`` option to help trace the operation through the database
  profiler, currentOp, and logs.

Support for Time Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds support for time zones to :doc:`aggregation date
operators </reference/operator/aggregation-date>`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Aggregation Compatibility Changes <aggregate-compatibility>`


Array Update Operator Enhancements
----------------------------------

.. _3.6-arrayFilters:

``arrayFilters``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands and methods can accept an ``arrayFilters``
parameter to specify which elements to modify in an array field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Commands
     - Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
     - | :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`
       | :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`

   * - :dbcommand:`update`
     - | :method:`db.collection.updateOne()`
       | :method:`db.collection.updateMany()`
       | :method:`db.collection.update()`

   * -

     - | :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()` for :ref:`updateOne and
          updateMany operations <bulkwrite-write-operations-updateOneMany>`

       | :method:`Bulk.find.arrayFilters()` for ``Bulk()`` operation
         methods :method:`~Bulk.find.updateOne()` and
         :method:`~Bulk.find.update()`.

Multi-Element Array Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds the following new positional operators for update
operations on arrays and nested arrays:

- The all positional :update:`$[]` operator updates all elements in
  an array.

- The filtered positional :update:`$[\<identifier\>]` operator updates
  all elements in an array that match the :ref:`3.6-arrayFilters`
  criteria.

Negative Array Index Position for ``push``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :update:`$position` modifier for the :update:`push` update operator
can accept a negative array index value to indicate a position starting
from the end of the array.

.. _3.6-drivers:

3.6 Compatible Drivers
----------------------

The following drivers are feature compatible with MongoDB 3.6:

.. include:: /includes/3.6-drivers.rst

DNS-constructed Seedlist ``mongodb+srv``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the standard connection format, the 3.6 drivers support
a DNS-constructed seedlist. For more information, see
:ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.

.. _3.6-change-streams:

Change Streams
--------------

MongoDB 3.6 supports opening change streams against replica sets and
sharded clusters with replica set shards.

Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the complexity and risk of tailing the :term:`oplog`.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes
on a collection and respond to those changes.

You can open a change stream from any 3.6-series driver using the
:method:`db.collection.watch()` method. See the documentation for
your preferred driver for complete instructions on usage.

See :ref:`changeStreams` for more information.

.. important::

   To use change streams, ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be set to
   "3.6". For more information, see :ref:`view-fcv` and
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

.. _3.6-client-sessions:

Client Sessions
---------------

Causal Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide causal consistency, MongoDB 3.6 enables :ref:`causal
consistency <causal-consistency>` in :ref:`client sessions <sessions>`. A
causally consistent client session denotes that the associated sequence of
read and *acknowledged* write operations have a causal relationship
that is reflected by their ordering. Client applications must ensure
that only one thread at a time executes these operations in a client session.

Applications can start a :ref:`client session <sessions>` and associate operations
with a specific session.  Applications must ensure that only one
thread at a time executes these operations in a client session.

.. important::

   To use client sessions:

   - Clients require :ref:`MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 3.6 <3.6-drivers>`.

   - ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be "3.6". For more
     information, see :ref:`view-fcv` and
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

.. _3.6-retryable-writes:

Retryable Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For retryable writes:

   - Clients require :ref:`MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 3.6 <3.6-drivers>`.

   - ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be "3.6". For more
     information, see :ref:`view-fcv` and
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :ref:`certain acknowledged write
operations <retryable-ops>` on replica sets and sharded clusters are
"retryable" to provide handling of transient network errors or replica
set elections.

With retryable writes, MongoDB drivers automatically retries these
operations upon encountering network errors or encountering a
:ref:`replica set failover <replication-auto-failover>` during which
time the replica set has no primary. To enable retryable writes for the
3.6 drivers, see :urioption:`retryWrites`.

As the retry attempt is made only once, the retryable feature can help
address transient network errors but not persistent network errors.

For more information on retryable writes, see :ref:`retryable-writes`.

``mongo`` Shell Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds the new command-line option :option:`--retryWrites` to
the :program:`mongo` shell. The option enables
:ref:`3.6-retryable-writes` in the
:program:`mongo` shell.

The following new methods have been added to the ``Mongo()`` connection
object in the :program:`mongo` shell:

- :method:`Mongo.isCausalConsistency()`

- :method:`Mongo.startSession()`

- Various :method:`Session` methods

- Various :method:`SessionOptions` methods

Server Sessions
---------------

MongoDB's server sessions, or logical sessions, are the underlying
framework used by :ref:`client sessions <3.6-client-sessions>` to
support :ref:`causal-consistency` and :ref:`retryable writes
<retryable-writes>`.

.. important::

   Applications use :ref:`client sessions <3.6-client-sessions>` to
   interface with server sessions.

Server sessions are available for standalone :program:`mongod`
instances, replica sets, and sharded clusters.

Server Session Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6, MongoDB drivers associate all operations with a server
session, with the exception of unacknowledged writes. If the deployment
enforces authentication/authorization, server sessions are associated
with the authenticated users.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-commands.rst

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The following new parameters are available for server sessions:

- :parameter:`logicalSessionRefreshMinutes`

- :parameter:`localLogicalSessionTimeoutMinutes`

- :parameter:`maxAcceptableLogicalClockDriftSecs`

Aggregation Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support server sessions, MongoDB 3.6 adds the following new
aggregation pipeline stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$listSessions`

     - Lists the server sessions in the ``system.sessions`` collection in the
       ``config`` database.

   * - :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`

     - Lists the server sessions cached in memory by the server. Uses
       the new aggregation helper :method:`db.aggregate()`.

General
~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns information on the number of
:ref:`server-status-logicalSessions`.

.. _3.6-server-sessions-command-options:

Command Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-options.rst


JSON Schema
-----------

MongoDB 3.6 adds the :query:`$jsonSchema` operator to support
:doc:`document validation </core/document-validation>` using JSON
Schema. For details, see :query:`$jsonSchema`.

To use :query:`$jsonSchema`, ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be
set to "3.6".

.. seealso:: :ref:`3.6-compatibility-enabled`

Replica Sets
------------

- Deprecate replica set protocol version 0 (``pv0``). For more
  information on the replica set protocol versions, see
  :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`.

- Added the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command to dynamically
  resize a replica set member's oplog. Available for instances running
  the WiredTiger storage engine.

- Added the
  :ref:`catchUpTakeoverDelayMillis <repl-conf-catchup-takeover-delay>`
  configuration option, dictating the amount of time a node waits to
  run for election after determining that it is ahead of the current
  :term:`primary`.

- For replica sets that use the protocol version 1 (``pv1``), arbiters
  will vote no in elections if they detect a healthy primary of equal
  or greater priority to the candidate. For more information on replica
  set protocol versions, see
  :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`.

- Added the :parameter:`oplogInitialFindMaxSeconds` parameter to adjust
  how long a member of a :term:`replica set` should wait for its
  :dbcommand:`find` command to finish during :ref:`data synchronization
  <replica-set-sync>`.

- Added the :parameter:`waitForSecondaryBeforeNoopWriteMS` parameter to
  specify how long a secondary must wait if the ``afterClusterTime`` is
  greater than the last applied time from the oplog.

- Added support for running the following during a replica set member's
  :term:`initial sync`:

  - :dbcommand:`renameCollection`

  - :dbcommand:`convertToCapped`

  - :pipeline:`$out` stages in aggregation pipelines
  
  - :term:`Map-reduce <map-reduce>` jobs that output to a new collection

Sharded Clusters
----------------

- Added :parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxConnecting` parameter
  for :program:`mongos` to control the rate at which :program:`mongos`
  adds connections to a :program:`mongod` instance.

- Added :parameter:`orphanCleanupDelaySecs` that determines the minimum
  delay before a migrated chunk is deleted from the source shard.

- The ``config.system.sessions`` collection in the ``config`` database
  may now be sharded.

General Enhancements
--------------------

MongoDB Compass Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Server download is packaged with a platform-specific
:doc:`installation script </reference/program/install_compass>` for
:ref:`MongoDB Compass Community Edition <compass-index>`. This
script installs MongoDB Compass as part of the MongoDB Server
installation process.

Collection Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collections have an immutable :ref:`unique identifier
<collections-uuids>`. The ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be set
to ``"3.6"``.

.. seealso:: :ref:`3.6-compatibility-enabled`

New Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds the following new query operators:

- The new :query:`$jsonSchema` operator matches documents that validate
  against the given JSON Schema. To use :query:`$jsonSchema`,
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` must be set to "3.6".

- The :query:`$expr` allows the use of aggregation expressions within
  the query language.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`3.6-compatibility-enabled`

Removed Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 removes the deprecated ``$pushAll`` update operator. For more
information, see :ref:`3.6-pushall-compatibility`.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

- An index can cover a query on fields within nested documents.

- Multikey indexes can cover queries over non-array keys if the index
  tracks which fields make it multikey.

- When creating an index, you cannot specify ``*`` as the name of the
  index. See :ref:`3.6-index-asterisk`.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

- Added the following options to the :dbcommand:`listDatabases` command:

  - ``nameOnly`` to return only the database names (which
    does not require database locks) instead of returning both the
    database names and size information (which does require database
    locks).

  - ``filter`` to return databases that match the
    specified match criteria on the outputs.

- Modified behavior of the :dbcommand:`validate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.validate()` method such that only for ``full``
  validation does the WiredTiger storage engine force a checkpoint,
  flush all in-memory data to disk, then verify the on-disk data. See
  also :ref:`3.6-validate-compatibility`.

- The ``<database>.system.profile`` entry for :dbcommand:`update` and
  :dbcommand:`delete` contains the entire update/delete document applied
  to the named collection.

- :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` waits until all collections drops in the
  database have propagated to a majority of the replica set members.

- For commands run on replica sets and sharded clusters, the response
  documents include the ``operationTime`` and ``$clusterTime``. See
  :method:`db.runCommand` and :method:`db.adminCommand`.

Wire Protocol and Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MongoDB 3.6 introduces a new :doc:`wire protocol
  </reference/mongodb-wire-protocol>` opcode called :ref:`wire-op-msg`.
  This opcode's message format is extensible and designed to subsume
  the functionality of other opcodes.

- Added support for the ``zlib`` compressor for
  ``--networkMessageCompressors`` option (or
  :setting:`net.compression.compressors` setting if using the
  configuration file). ``--networkMessageCompressors`` option (or
  :setting:`net.compression.compressors` setting) enables network
  compression for communication among :program:`mongod`,
  :program:`mongos`, :program:`mongo` shell, and drivers that support
  the ``OP_COMPRESSED`` message format.

- Enables ``snappy`` network compression for communication, by default,
  among :program:`mongod`, :program:`mongos`, and :program:`mongo`
  shell.

Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :readconcern:`"available"` read concern is available. For
  unsharded collections (including collections in a standalone
  deployment or a replica set deployment), :readconcern:`"local"` and
  :readconcern:`"available"` read concerns behave identically. For
  sharded clusters, :readconcern:`"available"` provides greater
  tolerance for partitions but may return orphan documents if the shard
  is undergoing chunk migrations.

  .. seealso:: :parameter:`orphanCleanupDelaySecs`

- :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern is always enabled and
  deprecates/obsoletes the use of :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern`
  and :setting:`replication.enableMajorityReadConcern`.

FTDC
~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 adds support for Diagnostics Capture (also known as ``FTDC``) in
:program:`mongos`. In previous versions, the feature is available for
:program:`mongod` only. See :ref:`param-ftdc`.

.. note:: FTDC is enabled by default.

Additional Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 includes the following enhancements:

- Added support for specifying full Unix domain socket paths with
  :option:`--bind_ip`.

- :program:`mongod` now offers a :option:`--timeZoneInfo` option. Use this
  option to specify the path to your system time zone database. The default
  configuration file included with Linux and macOS packages sets this to
  ``/usr/share/zoneinfo``.

- Date operations now accept consistent date ranges across all supported
  operating systems. You may safely work with years in the range ``0``
  through ``9999``.

- The new :parameter:`honorSystemUmask` startup option for
  :program:`mongod` causes new files created by MongoDB to have
  the read/write permissions specified by the `umask
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask>`_ of the user who runs the
  :program:`mongod` process. Only available on Linux and macOS systems.

- The :limit:`maxWriteBatchSize <Write Command Batch Limit Size>` limit
  of a database, which indicates the maximum number of write operations
  permitted in a write batch, raises from ``1,000`` to ``100,000``.

- The :dbcommand:`planCacheListPlans` database command produces the same
  output as the :method:`PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()` shell method. The
  output from both operations now includes a timestamp for when
  the plans were generated.

- The new :parameter:`KeysRotationIntervalSec` server parameter
  specifies the number of seconds for which an `HMAC signing key
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code>`_
  is valid before rotating to the next one.
