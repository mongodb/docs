Accessible Addresses and Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |mms| application must be able to connect to users and |mms| agents
over or Secure HTTP (HTTPS). |mms| agents must be able to connect to
MongoDB client MongoDB databases.

Though |mms| only requires open HTTP(S) and MongoDB network ports to
connect with users and to databases, what ports are opened on a
firewall depend upon what capabilities are enabled: encryption,
authentication and monitoring.

This page defines which systems need to connect to which ports on other
systems.

.. important:: 
   To run |mms| without an Internet connection, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-local-mode/` to ensure you have all of the
   necessary binaries to run |mms| without an Internet connection.

Ports Required to Use |mms|
```````````````````````````

* Both |mms| users and |mms| agents must be able to connect to |mms|
  application over HTTP(S). See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-ports/` to set a
  non-default port for |mms|.
* |mms| must be able to connect to the backing MongoDB databases
  running ``mongod``.
* For each |mms| project, |mms| agents must be able to connect to all
  client MongoDB processes (``mongod`` or ``mongos``).
* The |mms| application must also be able to send email to |mms| users.

To use |mms|, open the following ports to the specified servers. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15,10,10,15,35,15

   * - Service
     - Default Port
     - Transport
     - Direction
     - Purpose
     - Uses SSL?
     
   * - HTTP
     - 8080
     - TCP
     - Inbound
     - Web connection to |mms| from users and |mms| agents.
     - No

   * - HTTPS
     - 8443
     - TCP
     - Inbound
     - Web connection to |mms| from users and |mms| agents.
     - Yes

   * - HTTP(S)
     - 8090
     - TCP
     - Inbound
     - Provides a health-check endpoint for monitoring |mms|
       through a monitoring service like Zabbix or Nagios. This is
       disabled by default. 

       To enable it, see :ref:`enable-debug-endpoints`. When enabled,
       you can access the endpoint at:
       
       .. code-block:: http

          http://<opsmanagerhost>:8090/health

       The API endpoint provides the ability to check connections
       from the HTTP Service to the 
       :ref:`Ops Manager Application Database <mms-application-database>` 
       and the :ref:`Backup Snapshot Storage <mms-backup-blockstore-database>`.

       A successful response returns the following:

       .. code-block:: json

         {
           "mms_db": "OK",
           "backup_db": "OK"
         }
     - Optional

   * - MongoDB
     - 27000 - 28000

     - Connect to MongoDB application, backup and client databases.
     - Optional

   * - SMTP

     - No

   * - SMTPS

     - Outbound
     - Send emails from |mms|.
     - Yes

Ports Needed to Administer |mms|
````````````````````````````````

Most |mms| administration can be performed through the user interface.
Some procedures require access to the operating system. To permit your
administrators to access your |mms| and MongoDB servers, open the
following ports to those servers.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15,10,10,15,35,15

   * - Service
     - Default Port

     - Windows System administration.
     - No

Ports Needed to Integrate |mms| with SNMP
`````````````````````````````````````````

To send and receive SNMP messages to and from your MongoDB deployments
must open the following ports between |mms| and your SNMP Manager.
