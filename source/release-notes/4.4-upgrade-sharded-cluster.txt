Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process
checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| sharded cluster must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|. 

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|, connect to each
shard replica set member and each config server replica set member
and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.2" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.2" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shards and config servers, ensure that no replica set member is in
:replstate:`ROLLBACK` or :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Back up the ``config`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.
