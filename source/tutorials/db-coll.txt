MongoDB organizes data in a hierarchical structure. A MongoDB deployment
contains one or more databases, and each database contains one or more
collections. In each collection, MongoDB stores data as documents that
contain field-and-value pairs.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must include the following import statements in your program to run the
code examples in this guide:

.. code-block:: scala

   import org.mongodb.scala._
   import org.mongodb.scala.model.Filters._

.. include:: /includes/obs-note.rst

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

First, connect to a running MongoDB deployment.

The following code connects to a standalone MongoDB deployment running
on ``localhost`` on port ``27017``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val mongoClient = MongoClient()

To learn more about connecting to MongoDB deployments,
see the :ref:`scala-connect` tutorial.

Access a Database
-----------------

Once you have a ``MongoClient`` instance connected to a MongoDB
deployment, use the ```getDatabase()`` method to access a database.

Pass the name of the database as a parameter to the ``getDatabase()``
method. If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates it when
you insert any data into the database.

The following example accesses the ``test`` database:

.. code-block:: scala

   val database: MongoDatabase = mongoClient.getDatabase("test")

.. note::

   ``MongoDatabase`` instances are immutable. To learn more, see the
   :ref:`Immutability <scala-immutability>` section of this guide.

Access a Collection
-------------------

After you create a ``MongoDatabase`` instance, use the
``getCollection()`` method to access a collection from within that
database.

Pass the name of the collection as a parameter to the ``getCollection()``
method.

Using the ``database`` instance created in the preceding section, the
following code accesses the collection named ``myTestCollection``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val coll: MongoCollection[Document] = database.getCollection("myTestCollection")

.. note::
   
   ``MongoCollection`` instances are immutable. To learn more, see the
   :ref:`Immutability <scala-immutability>` section of this guide.

If a collection with that name does not exist, MongoDB creates it when
you first insert data into that collection.

You can also directly create a collection with various options, such
as setting the maximum size or creating documentation validation rules.

Create a Collection
-------------------

The driver provides the ``createCollection()`` method to
directly create a collection. When you create a
collection, you can specify various collection options, such as a
maximum size or documentation validation rules, with the
``CreateCollectionOptions`` class.

If you are not specifying any options, you do not need to directly
create the collection since MongoDB automatically creates new
collections when you first insert data.

Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a capped collection limited to 1
megabyte:

.. code-block:: scala

   database.createCollection("cappedCollection", CreateCollectionOptions().capped(true).sizeInBytes(0x100000))
           .printResults()

To learn more about capped collections, see :manual:`Capped Collections
</core/capped-collections/>` in the Server manual.

Document Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB allows you to validate documents during
updates and inserts. Validation rules are specified on a collection
level by using the ``ValidationOptions`` class, which takes a
filter document that specifies the validation rules or expressions.

The following example creates a collection with schema validation:

.. code-block:: scala

   ValidationOptions collOptions = ValidationOptions().validator(
           Filters.or(Filters.exists("email"), Filters.exists("phone")))
   
   database.createCollection("contacts", CreateCollectionOptions().validationOptions(collOptions))
           .printResults()

To learn more about document validation, see :manual:`Schema Validation
</core/schema-validation/>` in the Server manual.

Get A List of Collections
-------------------------

You can get a list of the collections in a database by using the
``MongoDatabase.listCollectionNames()`` method:

.. code-block:: scala

   database.listCollectionNames().printResults()

Drop a Collection
-----------------

You can drop a collection and delete all of the data in the collection
by using the ``MongoCollection.drop()`` method:

.. code-block:: scala

   val collection: MongoCollection[Document] = database.getCollection("contacts")
   collection.drop().printResults()

.. _scala-immutability:

Immutability
------------

``MongoDatabase`` and ``MongoCollection`` instances are immutable. To
create new instances from existing instances that have different
properties, such as different :manual:`read concerns
</reference/read-concern/>`, :manual:`read preferences
</reference/read-preference/>`, and :manual:`write concerns
</reference/write-concern/>`, the ``MongoDatabase`` and
``MongoCollection`` class provides the following methods:

- ``MongoDatabase.withReadConcern()``
- ``MongoDatabase.withReadPreference()``
- ``MongoDatabase.withWriteConcern()``
- ``MongoCollection.withReadConcern()``
- ``MongoCollection.withReadPreference()``
- ``MongoCollection.withWriteConcern()``

.. TODO To learn more, see the :ref:`scala-read-operations` and
.. :ref:`scala-write-ops` tutorials.

CodecRegistry
-------------

An overload of the ``getCollection()`` method allows you to specify a
different class for representing BSON documents. For example, you
might want to use the strict and type-safe ``BsonDocument`` class to
model your documents when performing CRUD operations:

.. code-block:: scala

   import org.mongodb.scala.bson._
   
   val collection: MongoCollection[BsonDocument] = database.getCollection[BsonDocument]("mycoll")
   
   // insert a document
   val document = BsonDocument("{x: 1}")
   collection.insertOne(document).printResults()
   
   document.append("x", BsonInt32(2)).append("y", BsonInt32(3))
   
   // replace a document
   collection.replaceOne(Filters.equal("_id", document.get("_id")), document)
             .printResults()
   
   // find documents
   collection.find().printResults()

There are two requirements that any class must meet to be used in
this way:

- ``Codec`` instance for the class must be registered in the
  ``CodecRegistry`` for the ``MongoCollection``.

- ``Codec`` instance must be one that encodes and decodes a full BSON
  document, and not just, for example, a single BSON value like an
  ``Int32``.

By default, a ``MongoCollection`` is configured with ``Codec`` instances
for four classes:

- ``Document`` (Scala ``BsonDocument`` wrapper)
- ``BsonDocument``
- ``Document`` (Java driver's loosely typed ``Document`` class)
- ``BasicDBObject``

Applications are free to register ``Codec`` implementations
for other classes by customizing the ``CodecRegistry``. New
``CodecRegistry`` instances are configurable at the following levels:

- In a ``MongoClient`` within ``MongoClientSettings``
- In a ``MongoDatabase`` within its ``withCodecRegistry`` method
- In a ``MongoCollection`` within its ``withCodecRegistry`` method

Consider the case of encoding and decoding instances of the ``UUID``
class. The driver by default encodes instances of ``UUID`` by using a
byte ordering that is not compatible with other MongoDB drivers, and
changing the default would be dangerous.

It is possible for new applications that require interoperability across
multiple drivers to be able to change that default, and they can do that
by specifying a ``CodecRegistry``

.. code-block:: scala

   // replaces the default UuidCodec with one that uses the new standard UUID representation
   import org.bson.UuidRepresentation
   import org.bson.codecs.UuidCodec
   import org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecRegistries
   
   val codecRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(
     CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(new UuidCodec(UuidRepresentation.STANDARD)),
     MongoClient.DEFAULT_CODEC_REGISTRY)
   
   // globally
   val settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
                   .codecRegistry(codecRegistry).build()
   val client = MongoClient(settings)
   
   // or at the database level
   val database = client.getDatabase("mydb")
                        .withCodecRegistry(codecRegistry)
   
   // or at the collection level
   val collection = database.getCollection("mycoll")
                            .withCodecRegistry(codecRegistry)
