.. dbcommand:: logout

   .. deprecated:: 5.0

   Attempting to use the :dbcommand:`logout` command will write an 
   error message to the log once per logout attempt.
   
   This command will be removed in a future release.   

   The :dbcommand:`logout` command terminates the current
   authenticated session:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { logout: 1 }

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Example
-------

.. |operation-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`logout`
.. include:: /includes/note-logout-namespace.rst

.. example::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-change-database-context.rst

   When you have set the database context and ``db`` object, you
   can use the |operation-name| to log out of database as in the
   following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { logout: 1 } )
