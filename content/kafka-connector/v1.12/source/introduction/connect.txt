Overview
--------

Learn how to connect the {+connector+} to MongoDB using a 
**connection Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**. A connection URI is a 
string that contains the following information:

- The address of your MongoDB deployment *required* 
- Connection settings *optional*
- Authentication settings *optional*
- Authentication credentials *optional*

The following is an example of a connection URI for a MongoDB replica set:

.. code-block:: text

   mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl   

To learn more about the connection URI format, see
:manual:`Connection String URI Format </reference/connection-string/>` in the MongoDB Manual.

How to Connect
--------------

Specify a connection URI with the following configuration option in both
a source and sink connector:

.. code-block:: properties

   connection.uri=<your connection uri>

To learn more about this configuration option, see the following resources:

- :doc:`Source connector configuration options </source-connector/configuration-properties/mongodb-connection/>`
- :doc:`Sink connector configuration options </sink-connector/configuration-properties/mongodb-connection/>`

How to Configure Your Connection
--------------------------------

The {+connector+} uses the **MongoDB Java driver** to parse your connection URI.
The MongoDB Java driver is an artifact that enables Java applications like {+kafka-connect+}
to interact with MongoDB. 

.. important:: Driver Version

   Version {+connector_version+} of the {+connector+} uses version
   {+connector_driver_version+} of the MongoDB Java driver.

To learn what connection URI options are available in the connector, see
`the MongoDB Java driver Connection guide <{+connector_driver_url_base+}fundamentals/connection/#connection-options>`__.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Java driver are available
in the {+connector+}.

The following is an example of a connection URI that authenticates with MongoDB using
``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication:

.. code-block:: text

   mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256

.. important:: Load Secrets

   To avoid storing your authentication secrets as plain text in your ``connection.uri``
   setting, load your secrets from a secure location as your connector starts. 
   To learn how to load your secrets as your connector starts, see 
   `the Externalize Secrets guide from Confluent <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/security.html#externalizing-secrets>`__. 

To learn what authentication mechanisms are available, see
`the MongoDB Java driver Authentication Mechanisms guide <{+connector_driver_url_base+}fundamentals/auth/#mechanisms>`__.

To learn more about authentication in the connector, see the
:doc:`Security and Authentication guide </security-and-authentication>`.
