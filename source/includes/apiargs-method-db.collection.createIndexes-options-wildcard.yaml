  Allows users to include or exclude specific field paths from
  the  :ref:`wildcard index <wildcard-index-core>`. This option is only 
  valid if creating a :ref:`wildcard index <wildcard-index-core>`.

  The ``wildcardProjection`` option takes the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     wildcardProjection: {
       "path.to.field.a" : <value>,
       "path.to.field.b" : <value>
     }

  The ``<value>`` can be either of the following:

  - ``1`` or ``true`` to include the field in the wildcard index.

  - ``0`` or ``false`` to exclude the field from the wildcard index. 

  A ``wildcardProjection`` *cannot* contain *both* include and exclude
  specifications, with the exception of including the ``_id`` field
  while excluding other fields.

  .. note:: 

     Wildcard indexes omit the ``_id`` field by default. To include the
     ``_id`` field in the wildcard index, you must explicitly include it
     in the ``wildcardProjection`` document (i.e. ``{ "_id" : 1 }``).

  Options specified to {{role}} apply to **all** of the index
  specifications included in the key pattern array. Specify 
  ``{{argname}}`` only if you are creating a single wildcard index using 
  {{role}}.
