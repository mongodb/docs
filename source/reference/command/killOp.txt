Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: killOp

   Terminates an operation as specified by the operation ID.
   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the 
   :method:`db.killOp()` helper.
   To find operations and their corresponding IDs,
   see :method:`db.currentOp()`.

   The ``killOp`` command must be run against the ``admin`` database.

   .. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`killOp`

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "killOp": 1, "op": <opid> } 

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.killOp-param.rst

   .. include:: /includes/warning-terminating-operations.rst

Example
-------

The following example uses :dbcommand:`killOp` to target
the running operation with opid ``3478``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { "killOp": 1, "op": 3478 } )

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "attempting to kill op", "ok" : 1 }

:dbcommand:`killOp` only confirms its attempt to end the
specified operation. Use :method:`db.currentOp()` to confirm the
target operation was terminated.
