Optional: |backup| supports "excluded namespaces". Excluded
namespaces are databases or collections that will **not** be backed
up. This can be useful for namespaces containing log files or
caches, for instance.

To specify an excluded namespace, select :guilabel:`Manage excluded
namespaces`, then add the names of the databases or collections
that you do not want |backup| to include in any restores.
