.. dbcommand:: buildInfo

   The :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command is an administrative command which
   returns a build summary for the current
   :binary:`~bin.mongod`. :dbcommand:`buildInfo` has the following
   prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { buildInfo: 1 }

   In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, call :dbcommand:`buildInfo` in the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { buildInfo: 1 } )

   .. example::

      The output document of :dbcommand:`buildInfo` has the following
      form:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "version" : "<string>",
           "gitVersion" : "<string>",
           "sysInfo" : "<string>",
           "loaderFlags" : "<string>",
           "compilerFlags" : "<string>",
           "allocator" : "<string>",
           "versionArray" : [ <num>, <num>, <...> ],
           "openssl" : <document>,
           "javascriptEngine" : "<string>",
           "bits" : <num>,
           "debug" : <boolean>,
           "maxBsonObjectSize" : <num>,
           "storageEngines" : [ "<string>", "<string>", "<...>" ],
           "ok" : <num>
         }

Output
------

.. data:: buildInfo

   The document returned by the :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command.

Supported
~~~~~~~~~

These fields are stable and should provide consistent behavior.

.. data:: buildInfo.gitVersion

   The commit identifier that identifies the state of the code used
   to build the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. data:: buildInfo.versionArray

   An array that conveys version information about the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. See :data:`~buildInfo.version` for a
   more readable version of this string.

.. data:: buildInfo.version

   A string that conveys version information about the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If you need to present version information to
   a human, this field is preferable to :data:`~buildInfo.versionArray`.

   This string will take the format ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` in the case of
   a release, but development builds may contain additional information.

.. data:: buildInfo.storageEngines

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   A list of :doc:`storage engines </faq/storage>` available to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` server.

.. data:: buildInfo.javascriptEngine

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2

   A string that reports the JavaScript engine used in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. By default, this is ``mozjs`` after
   version 3.2, and previously ``V8``.

.. data:: buildInfo.bits

   A number that reflects the target processor architecture of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

.. data:: buildInfo.debug

   A boolean. ``true`` when built with debugging options.

.. data:: buildInfo.maxBsonObjectSize

   A number that reports the :limit:`Maximum BSON Document Size
   <BSON Document Size>`.

.. data:: buildInfo.openssl

   An embedded document describing the version of the TLS/SSL library
   that :binary:`~bin.mongod` was built with and is currently using.

.. data:: buildInfo.modules

   A list of add-on modules that :binary:`~bin.mongod` was built with. Possible
   values currently include "enterprise" and "rocksdb".

Unstable
~~~~~~~~

These fields are for internal use only, and you should not expect their behavior
or existence to remain consistent on any level.

.. data:: buildInfo.sysInfo

   .. deprecated:: 3.2

   :data:`buildInfo.sysInfo` no longer contains useful information.

.. data:: buildInfo.allocator

   The memory allocator that :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses. By default
   this is ``tcmalloc``.

.. data:: buildInfo.buildEnvironment

   An embedded document containing various debugging information about the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` build environment.
