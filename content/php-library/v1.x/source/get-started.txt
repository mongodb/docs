   :description: Learn how to create an app to connect to MongoDB deployment by using the PHP library.
   :keywords: quick start, tutorial, basics

Overview
--------

The {+php-library+} is a high-level abstraction for the MongoDB PHP extension, which
you can use to connect to MongoDB and interact with data stored in your deployment.
This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the {+php-library+} to
connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas and query data in your cluster.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this guide to connect a sample PHP application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

.. _php-download-and-install:

Download and Install
--------------------

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: tutorial

.. meta::
   :keywords: setup, composer, installation, code example

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install dependencies.

      Before you begin developing, ensure that you have the following
      dependencies installed on your local machine:
      
      - :php:`PHP <install>` version 7.4 or later
      - `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`__ version 2.0 or later
      - :github:`pie </php/pie/blob/main/docs/usage.md>`
    
   .. step:: Install the MongoDB PHP extension.

      Run the following command to install the ``mongodb`` PHP extension:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         pie install mongodb/mongodb-extension

      .. tip:: Specify the PHP Extension Version

         To install a specific version of the {+extension-short+}, include
         the version number as shown in the following command:

         .. code-block:: bash

            pie install mongodb/mongodb-extension:^{+full-version+}

         To install a {+extension-short+} version before v1.21, you must
         use the :php:`pecl command <mongodb.installation#mongodb.installation.pecl>`.

   .. step:: Create a project directory.

      From your root directory, run the following command in your shell to create
      a directory called ``php-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir php-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create a ``quickstart.php`` application file in the ``php-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd php-quickstart
                touch quickstart.php

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd php-quickstart
                type nul > quickstart.php

   .. step:: Install the {+php-library+}.

      To install the {+php-library+}, run the following command in your ``php-quickstart``
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer require mongodb/mongodb
      
      After installing the library, include Composer's ``autoload.php`` file by adding the
      following code to the top of your ``quickstart.php`` file:

      .. code-block:: php

         <?php

         require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory, a
new application file, and the library dependencies installed.

.. _php-create-deployment:

Create a MongoDB Deployment
---------------------------

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: tutorial

.. meta::
   :keywords: cloud, host, atlas

You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas.

      Complete the :ref:`MongoDB Get Started <unified-get-started>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a new free
      tier MongoDB deployment. Follow the instructions in the
      :guilabel:`Cloud Deployment` tabs to create your MongoDB Atlas deployment
      in the cloud.
      
   .. step:: Save your credentials.

      After you create your database user, save that user's database
      username and database password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.
  
After you complete these steps, you have a new free tier MongoDB
deployment on Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded
into your database.

.. _php-connection-string:

Create a Connection String
--------------------------

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: tutorial

.. meta::
   :keywords: uri, atlas

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

To connect to an instance or deployment not hosted on Atlas, see
:ref:`php-connection-targets`.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <php-create-deployment>`,
      log in to your Atlas account and navigate to the :guilabel:`Clusters` 
      page under the :guilabel:`Database` section. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` 
      button for your new deployment.

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connect_to_cluster.png
         :alt: The connect button in the clusters section of the Atlas UI

      If you do not already have a database user configured, MongoDB will
      prompt you to create and configure a new user.

      Click the :guilabel:`Drivers` button under
      :guilabel:`Connect to your application` section and select
      "PHP" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.
      
      Ensure the :guilabel:`View full code sample` option is deselected to
      view only the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your connection string.

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it
      to your clipboard, as shown in the following screenshot:

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_copy_connection_string_php.png
         :alt: The copy button next to the connection string in the Atlas UI

   .. step:: Update the password placeholders.

      Paste this connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<db_password>`` placeholder with your database user's
      password. The connection string is already populated with your database
      user's username.
      
      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
corresponds to your Atlas cluster.

.. _php-run-sample-query:
.. _php-connect-to-mongodb:

Run a Sample Query
------------------

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: tutorial

.. meta::
   :keywords: test connection, runnable, code example

After retrieving the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas deployment,
you can connect to the deployment from your PHP application and query
the Atlas sample datasets.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Edit your PHP application file.

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``quickstart.php`` file, which queries
      the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Assign the connection string.

      Assign the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable to the connection string that you copied
      from the :ref:`php-connection-string` step of this guide. You can assign this
      variable by running a shell command or creating a ``.env`` file in your application,
      as show in the following tabs:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Shell Command
            :tabid: shell

            .. code-block:: sh

               export MONGODB_URI=<connection string>

         .. tab:: .env File
            :tabid: dotenv

            .. code-block:: none

               MONGODB_URI=<connection string>

   .. step:: Run your PHP application.

      In your project directory, run the following shell command to start the application:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         php quickstart.php

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         {
             "_id": {
                 "$oid": "..."
             },
             ...
            "rated": "R",
            "metacritic": 80,
            "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
            ...
         }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you assigned the
      proper connection string to the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable and
      that you loaded the sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a PHP application that
connects to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on the sample
data, and returns a matching document.

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: reference

.. meta::
   :keywords: learn more

Congratulations on completing the quick start tutorial!

.. include:: /includes/get-started/troubleshoot.rst

In this tutorial, you created a PHP application that
connects to a MongoDB deployment hosted on MongoDB Atlas
and retrieves a document that matches a query.

Learn more about the {+php-library+} from the following resources:

- Learn how to configure your MongoDB connection in the :ref:`php-connect` section.
- Learn how to perform read and write operations in the :ref:`php-crud-operations` section.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section addresses issues that you might encounter when installing the
{+library-short+} and its dependencies.

PHP Headers Not Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might see a header file error that resembles the following code when installing
the {+library-short+}:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   /private/tmp/pear/install/mongodb/php_phongo.c:24:10: fatal error: 'php.h' file not found

   #include <php.h>
            ^~~~~~~

This error indicates that PHP's build system cannot find the necessary headers.
All PHP extensions require headers to compile. Those headers
must correspond to the PHP runtime for which the extension will be used.
The ``phpize`` command, which is invoked by ``pecl`` and ``pie``, usually ensures that the
extension builds with the correct headers.

If you install a PHP runtime, the corresponding headers are not always automatically
available. On many Linux distributions, headers are often published under a
separate ``php-dev`` or ``php-devel`` package. On macOS, the default PHP runtime
does not include headers. Users typically must install PHP and its headers by using
`Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.

Multiple PHP Runtimes Installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your system has multiple versions of PHP installed, each version will have
its own ``pecl``, ``pie``, and ``phpize`` commands. Additionally, each PHP runtime may
have separate ``php.ini`` files for each server application programming interface (SAPI),
such as FPM and CLI. If you installed the extension but it is not available at runtime,
ensure that you use the correct ``pecl`` or ``pie`` command and modify the appropriate ``php.ini``
file.

To see which ``php.ini`` file a PHP runtime uses,
view the output of :php:`phpinfo() <phpinfo>` for that particular
SAPI. Additionally, you can use :php:`php_ini_loaded_file() <php_ini_loaded_file>` and
:php:`php_ini_scanned_files() <php_ini_scanned_files>` to determine
which INI files have been loaded by PHP.

To debug issues when the extension is not loaded, you can use the
``detect-extension`` script provided in the tools directory. You can run this
script from the CLI or include it in a script available to your web server.
The tool finds potential issues and installation instructions for your
system. If you installed the library by using Composer, you can call the
script from the vendor directory as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: none

   php vendor/mongodb/mongodb/tools/detect-extension.php

If you want to check configuration for a web server SAPI, include the file in
a script available to the web server and open it in your browser. Ensure that you
wrap the script in ``<pre>`` tags to properly format its output as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: php

   <pre><?php require(...); ?></pre>

Loading an Incompatible DLL on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows binaries are available for several combinations of a PHP version,
thread safety setting (TS or NTS), and architecture type (x86 or x64). Failure to select the
correct binary causes an error when attempting to load the extension DLL
at runtime, as shown in the following sample output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'mongodb'

Ensure that you have downloaded a DLL that corresponds to the following PHP
runtime properties:

- PHP version (``PHP_VERSION``)
- Thread safety (``PHP_ZTS``)
- Architecture (``PHP_INT_SIZE``)

In addition to the preceding constants, these properties can also be
inferred from :php:`phpinfo() <phpinfo>`. If your system has multiple PHP
runtimes installed, view the ``phpinfo()`` output for the correct environment.

You can also use the ``detect-extension`` script described in the previous section to determine the
correct DLL for your PHP environment.
