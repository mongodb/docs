   :description: Use Atlas Triggers to execute application and database logic in response to events or schedules.


Atlas Triggers are part of the Atlas database tools. There are 2 trigger types:

- `Database triggers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers/>`__, 
  which respond to document-level, collection-level, or database-level changes.

- `Scheduled triggers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/scheduled-triggers/>`__, 
  which execute functions according to a pre-defined schedule.

For more information on creating and managing Triggers, see 
`Triggers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/>`__ 
in the Atlas Documentation.
