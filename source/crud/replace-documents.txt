Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to replace documents in a MongoDB
collection. A replace operation specifies the fields and values to replace
a single document from your collection. 

Replace One Method
------------------

A replace operation substitutes one document from your collection. The
substitution occurs between a document your query filter matches and a
replacement document. 

The `replaceOne() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#replaceOne(org.bson.conversions.Bson,TDocument)>`__
method removes all the existing fields and values in the
matching document (except the ``_id`` field) and substitutes it with the
replacement document. 

You can call the ``replaceOne()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
instance as follows: 

.. code-block:: java

    collection.replaceOne(<query>, <replacement>);
    
Replace Operation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``replaceOne()`` method has the following parameters:

- ``query`` specifies a query filter with the criteria to match a
  document to replace in your collection.
- ``replacement`` specifies fields and values of a new ``Document``
  object to replace the matched document.
- *(Optional)* ``replaceOptions`` specifies options that you can set to
  customize how the driver performs the replace operation. To learn more
  about this type, see the API documentation for `ReplaceOptions
  <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOptions.html>`__.

Replace One Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, a paint store sells five different
colors of paint. The ``paint_inventory`` collection represents their
current inventory: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
    { "_id": 3, "color": "yellow", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 4, "color": "green", "qty": 6 }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "pink", "qty": 0 }

The paint store realizes they must update their inventory again.  What they
thought was 20 cans of pink paint is actually 25 cans of orange paint. 

To update the inventory, call the ``replaceOne()`` method specifying the
following:

- A query filter that matches documents where the ``color`` is "pink" 
- A replacement document where the ``color`` is "orange" and the ``qty`` is "25"

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Update.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin replaceOneExample
   :end-before: end replaceOneExample

The output of the preceding code resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none   
   :copyable: false

    Matched document count: 1
    Modified document count: 1

The following shows the updated document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 5, "color": "orange", "qty": 25 }

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``replaceOne()`` method, it replaces the first result. You can
specify a sort in a ``ReplaceOptions`` instance to apply an order to
matched documents before the server performs the replace operation, as
shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Update.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin replaceoptions
   :end-before: end replaceoptions

If zero documents match the query filter in the replace operation,
``replaceOne()`` makes no changes to documents in the collection. See
our :ref:`upsert guide <java-upsert>` to
learn how to insert a new document instead of replacing one if no
documents match.

.. important::

    The ``replaceOne()`` method cannot make changes to a document that
    violate unique index constraints on the collection.
    For more information about constraints on unique indexes,
    see :manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique/>` in the
    {+mdb-server+} manual.
