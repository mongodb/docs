===============
Modify an Index
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Indexes allow MongoDB to execute queries more efficiently than scanning
every document in a :term:`collection` to select documents that match the
query statement. Scanning every document requires :program:`mongod` to
process larger amounts of data than scanning an index for each query
operation.

Indexes cannot be modified, as demonstrated below. To modify an existing
index, follow these steps to drop and recreate the index. For more
information about indexes, see :doc:`/core/indexes-introduction` and
:doc:`/core/indexes`.

:doc:`/administration/indexes` has links to in-depth tutorials about
creating and managing indexes, as well as indexing strategies.
