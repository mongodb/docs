In-progress Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Killing a session kills any in-progress operations in the session and
closes any open cursors associated with these operations.

Killed Session Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The killed session may still be listed as a current session, and future
operations may use the killed session. To view existing sessions, see
:pipeline:`$listSessions` operation or :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

Sessions with Transactions in Prepared State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |command| operation ignores sessions that have :doc:`transactions
</core/transactions>` in prepared state. Transactions in prepared state
refer to transactions with write operations that span multiple shards
whose commit coordinator has completed the :data:`"sendingPrepare"
action <$currentOp.twoPhaseCommitCoordinator.action>`.
