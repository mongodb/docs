.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Forces the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to flush all pending write operations
   to the disk and locks the *entire* :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to
   prevent additional writes until the user releases the lock with the
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` command. :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an
   administrative command.

   This command provides a simple wrapper around a
   :dbcommand:`fsync` database command with the following
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   This function locks the database and create a window for
   :doc:`backup operations </administration/backups>`.
