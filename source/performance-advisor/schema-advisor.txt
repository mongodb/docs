Your schema is the architecture of your cluster, including your
:term:`collections <collection>`, :term:`indexes <index>` and
:term:`documents <document>`. The |service| Performance Advisor monitors
your cluster and suggests schema modifications that follow MongoDB's
best practices and help improve database performance. These suggestions
come in the form of |service| :ref:`alerts <alerts>`.

To learn more about the schema improvements that Performance Advisor
suggests and how to act on them, refer to the following pages:

   * - Schema Improvement
     - Reason for Suggestion

   * - :ref:`unbounded-arrays-anti-pattern`
     - Your documents contain array fields with many elements,
       which can degrade query performance.

   * - :ref:`too-many-namespaces-anti-pattern`
     - You have an exceedingly high number of collections in a
       database, which can result in unnecessary disk space usage.
