.. _welcome-connect-data:

Connect Your Data Sources
-------------------------

To connect your existing |service| deployments to |charts| and visualize
your data, use the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` path.

Requirements & Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must have an existing |service| deployment.

  .. include:: /includes/deployment-description.rst

  If you don't have an existing |service| deployment, you can
  :ref:`explore charts with sample data <welcome-explore-data>`.

- To connect |charts-short| to your data, you must have:

  - Access to the |service| UI for the organization that contains your
    project. To learn more, see :atlas:`Require IP Access List for the Atlas UI
    </tutorial/manage-organizations/#require-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-ui>`.
  - Read access in your project role. To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas Project Roles
    </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Once you select :guilabel:`Connect Your Data`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/connect-data.rst 

.. _welcome-explore-data:

Explore with Sample Data
------------------------

|charts| provides a :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>` that uses movie data to show
examples of possible charts you can create. You can also use the
:ref:`sample data source <charts-sample-data>` to create your own charts on
other dashboards. 

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/sample-dashboard.rst

.. note::
  
   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back
   through the :ref:`Dashboards <sample-dashboard>` page. 

.. _welcome-skip-to-dashboards:

Skip to Shared Data Sources or Dashboards
-----------------------------------------

If you have access to data sources or dashboards before completing this
Getting Started tutorial, you can bypass the tutorial and begin viewing
your shared data sources and dashboards.

To exit the Getting Started tutorial and begin exploring your shared
data sources and dashboards, click
:guilabel:`Skip selection and view` at the bottom of the tutorial view.
