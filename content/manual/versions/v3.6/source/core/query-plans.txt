The MongoDB query optimizer processes queries and chooses the most
efficient query plan for a query given the available indexes. The query
system then uses this query plan each time the query runs.

.. include:: /includes/fact-query-optimizer-cache-behavior.rst

For each query, the query planner searches the query plan cache for an entry
that fits the :term:`query shape`. If there are no matching entries, the
query planner generates candidate plans for evaluation over a trial period.
The query planner chooses a winning plan, creates a cache entry containing
the winning plan, and uses it to generate the result documents.

If a matching entry exists, the query planner generates a plan based on that
entry and evaluates its performance through a ``replanning`` mechanism. This
mechanism makes a ``pass/fail`` decision based on the plan performance and
either keeps or evicts the cache entry. On eviction, the query planner selects
a new plan using the normal planning process and caches it. The query planner
executes the plan and returns the result documents for the query.

The following diagram illustrates the query planner logic:

.. include:: /images/query-planner-diagram.rst

See :ref:`query-plans-plan-cache-flushes` for additional scenarios that trigger
changes to the plan cache.

You can use the :method:`db.collection.explain()` or the
:method:`cursor.explain()` method to view statistics about the query
plan for a given query. This information can help as you develop
:doc:`indexing strategies </applications/indexes>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-explain-collection-method.rst

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   :method:`~db.collection.explain()` operations no longer read from or write
   to the query planner cache.

Plan Cache Flushes
------------------

Catalog operations like index or collection drops flush the plan cache.

The plan cache does not persist if a :binary:`~bin.mongod` restarts or shuts down.

.. versionadded:: 2.6

   MongoDB provides :doc:`/reference/method/js-plan-cache` to view and modify
   the cached query plans. The :method:`PlanCache.clear()` method flushes the
   entire plan cache. Users can also clear particular plan cache entries using
   :method:`PlanCache.clearPlansByQuery()`.

Plan Cache Debug Info Size Limit
--------------------------------

Starting in 3.6.23, the
:doc:`plan cache </core/query-plans>` will save full ``plan cache``
entries only if the cumulative size of the ``plan caches`` for all
collections is lower than 0.5 GB. When the cumulative size of the
``plan caches`` for all collections exceeds this threshold, additional
``plan cache`` entries are stored with stripped debug information.

When ``plan cache`` entries are stored with stripped debug information,
the :dbcommand:`planCacheListQueryShapes` command output displays an
empty document in the ``shapes`` array for each each plan cache entry for
which debug information was stripped. Similarly, detailed execution
statistics for the candidate plans are omitted from the
:dbcommand:`planCacheListPlans` command output when ``plan cache``
entries are stored with stripped debug information. When debug info is
present, you can find these detailed statistics in the ``plans.reason``
field.

The estimated size in bytes of a ``plan cache`` entry is available in
the output of :dbcommand:`planCacheListPlans`.

.. _index-filters:

Index Filters
-------------

.. versionadded:: 2.6

Index filters determine which indexes the optimizer evaluates for a
:term:`query shape`. A query shape consists of a combination of query,
sort, and projection specifications. If an index filter exists for a
given query shape, the optimizer only considers those indexes
specified in the filter.

When an index filter exists for the query shape, MongoDB ignores the
:method:`~cursor.hint()`. To see whether MongoDB applied an index
filter for a query shape, check the :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.indexFilterSet`
field of either the :method:`db.collection.explain()` or the
:method:`cursor.explain()` method.

Index filters only affects which indexes the optimizer evaluates; the
optimizer may still select the collection scan as the winning plan for
a given query shape.

Index filters exist for the duration of the server process and do not
persist after shutdown. MongoDB also provides a command to manually remove
filters.

Because index filters override the expected behavior of the optimizer
as well as the :method:`~cursor.hint()` method, use index filters
sparingly.

See :dbcommand:`planCacheListFilters`,
:dbcommand:`planCacheClearFilters`, and :dbcommand:`planCacheSetFilter`.
