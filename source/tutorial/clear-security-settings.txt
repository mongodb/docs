Overview
--------

|mms| enables you to :doc:`configure the security settings
</tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication>` that your deployments
use through the |mms| user interface. If you wish to reset the security
settings for your deployment, you may do so using the :guilabel:`Clear
Settings` button. :guilabel:`Clear Settings` clears all
authentication-related settings so you can start over from a blank
configuration.

:guilabel:`Clear Settings` removes all authentication-related settings,
including the authentication mechanisms for the deployment,
automation users and roles, and defined users for the
Monitoring and {+bagent+}s.
   
You **cannot** reset the security settings for a deployment if your
deployment includes any managed processes.

Procedure
----------

You may only reset the authentication settings if there are no managed
processes associated with your deployment. As such, if you wish to reset
the security settings, you must unmanage all processes, and then use the
:guilabel:`Clear Settings` button to reset the security settings.
