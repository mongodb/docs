In this guide, you will learn how to create and connect to a {+atlas+}
deployment locally or in the cloud. To learn how to install MongoDB
Community or MongoDB Enterprise editions on your own infrastructure,
see the :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation>` guide.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Run the following commands in your shell to install the
      development tools required to develop with the {+atlas-cli+}:
      
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: macOS
            :tabid: macos

            .. code-block:: shell

               brew install mongodb-atlas-cli
               brew install docker
            
            The preceding commands use the Homebrew package manager to
            install the dependencies. If you do not have Homebrew, you
            can install it by following the instructions on the
            `Homebrew website <https://brew.sh/>`__.
         
         .. tab:: Windows
            :tabid: windows

            .. code-block:: shell

               choco install mongodb-atlas-cli
               choco install docker-desktop

            The preceding commands use the Chocolatey package manager to
            install the dependencies. If you do not have Chocolatey, you
            can install it by following the instructions on the
            `Chocolatey website <https://chocolatey.org/install>`__.
            
      For other ways to install the {+atlas-cli+}, see :atlas:`Atlas
      CLI install page </cli/current/install-atlas-cli>`.

   .. step:: Set up a fully-featured deployment

      Run the following command and follow the prompts in the shell to deploy a cluster. 
      If you do not have an {+service+} account, the following command
      prompts you to create one.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Local Deployment
            :tabid: local

            This command creates a single-member replica set in a container 
            that runs on your local machine.

            .. literalinclude:: /get-started/includes/deploy-commands.sh
               :language: shell
               :start-after: # start-deploy-local
               :end-before: # end-deploy-local

         .. tab:: Cloud Deployment
            :tabid: cloud

            This command creates a free tier cluster on |service|.

            .. literalinclude:: /get-started/includes/deploy-commands.sh
               :language: shell
               :start-after: # start-deploy-cloud
               :end-before: # end-deploy-cloud
   
   .. step:: Connect to your deployment

      You can connect to your deployment with the {+mdb-shell+} (``mongosh``) by running the
      following command:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Local Deployment
            :tabid: local

            .. code-block:: shell

               atlas deployments connect myTestDb --connectWith mongosh

         .. tab:: Cloud Deployment
            :tabid: cloud

            .. code-block:: shell

               atlas deployments connect myTestDb --username <database user name> \
               --password <database user password> --connectWith mongosh

      After connecting, you can run the following command to test
      your connection:

      .. code-block:: shell

         show dbs

      The command returns a list of databases in your deployment.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your {+atlas+}
deployment and connected to it. To learn more about how to interact with your
deployment by using the {+mdb-shell+}, see the :mongosh:`{+mdb-shell+}
documentation </reference/methods/>`. 

In the next section, you will learn how to create an application that
connects to your deployment and interacts with data.

Create Your First MongoDB Application
-------------------------------------

To connect to your {+atlas+} deployment in an application, you can
use one of the official `MongoDB client libraries
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/>`__. 

Select your preferred programming language from the following dropdown menu
to learn how to connect to your {+atlas+} deployment in that language.
