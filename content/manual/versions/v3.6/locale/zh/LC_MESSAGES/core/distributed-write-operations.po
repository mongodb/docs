"For sharded collections in a :term:`sharded cluster`, the "
":program:`mongos` directs write operations from applications to the "
"shards that are responsible for the specific *portion* of the data set. "
"The :program:`mongos` uses the cluster metadata from the :ref:`config "
"database <sharding-config-server>` to route the write operation to the "
"appropriate shards."

"MongoDB partitions data in a sharded collection into *ranges* based on "
"the values of the :term:`shard key`. Then, MongoDB distributes these "
"chunks to shards. The shard key determines the distribution of chunks to "
"shards. This can affect the performance of write operations in the "
"cluster."

"Update operations that affect a *single* document **must** include the "
":term:`shard key` or the ``_id`` field. Updates that affect multiple "
"documents are more efficient in some situations if they have the "
