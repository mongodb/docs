==================================
Time Series Collection Limitations
==================================

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

This page describes limitations on using :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Unsupported Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features are not supported for time series collections:

* :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>`
* :ref:`Change streams <changeStreams>`
* :ref:`{+csfle+} <manual-csfle-feature>`
* :atlas:`Database Triggers </atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers>`
* :ref:`Schema validation rules <schema-validation-overview>`
* :dbcommand:`reIndex`
* :dbcommand:`renameCollection`

:appservices:`Atlas Device Sync </sync>` support is limited to time
series collections that use :appservices:`Atlas Data Ingest
</sync/configure/sync-settings/#data-ingest>`.

Aggregation $merge and $out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use the :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation stage to add data from
another collection to a time series collection.

.. versionchanged:: 7.0.3

   You can use the :pipeline:`$out` aggregation stage to write
   documents to a time series collection.

.. _timeseries-limitation-distinct:

distinct Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/time-series/timeseries-distinct-command.rst

.. _timeseries-limitations-doc-size:

Document Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum size for documents within a time series collection is 4 MB.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes:

.. _timeseries-limitations-deletes:

Deletes
~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can perform limited delete operations on
time series collections. MongoDB 7.0 removes most limitations from
operations that are based on the :dbcommand:`delete` command.

Time series deletes are not supported for :ref:`multi-document
transactions <transactions-atomicity>`.

From MongoDB 5.1 to 6.3, delete commands must meet the following
requirements:

- You can only match on :ref:`metaField <time-series-fields>` field
  values.
- Your delete command must not limit the number of documents to be
  deleted. Set ``justOne: false`` or use the ``deleteMany()`` method.

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, there is only one time series related
limitation on these ``delete`` commands:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-delete-operations-list.rst

You cannot use these commands with multi-document transactions. There
are no other restrictions.

.. include:: /includes/time-series-ttl-deletes.rst

For details on TTL deletes, see :ref:`ttl-collections`.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates:

Updates
~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can perform limited update operations.

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-update-limitations.rst

In MongoDB 5.0, time series collections only support insert operations
and read queries. Updates and manual delete operations result in an
error.

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

To remove all documents from a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.drop()` method to drop the collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Time Series Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 6.0 and later features improved support for secondary indexes on
time series collections. For a summary of these options, see :ref:`timeseries-add-secondary-index-mongodb-6.0`.

Time Series Secondary Indexes
`````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, time series collections support the ``expireAfterSeconds`` index property for :ref:`partial
indexes <index-type-partial>` on the ``metaField``. For earlier versions
of MongoDB, use the collection level :ref:`expireAfterSeconds
<db.createCollection.expireAfterSeconds>` parameter.

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can add a :term:`secondary index <secondary
index>` to any field.

These index types are partially supported:
 
- You can only create :ref:`multikey indexes <index-type-multikey>` on
  the ``metaField``.
- You can only create :ref:`sparse indexes <index-type-sparse>` on the ``metaField``.

These index types aren't supported:

- :ref:`Text indexes <index-type-text>`
- :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>`
- :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>`

.. include:: /includes/time-series-secondary-indexes-downgrade-FCV.rst

Time Series Secondary Indexes with MongoDB 5.0 and Earlier
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In MongoDB 5.0 and earlier:

- The ``metaField`` can have secondary indexes.
- The ``timeField``  can have secondary indexes.
- If the ``metaField`` is a document, you can add secondary indexes on
  fields inside the document.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`indexes`

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot create a time series collection as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set the collection type when you create a collection:

- An existing collection cannot be converted into a time series
  collection.
- A time series collection cannot be converted into a different
  collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when you create the collection. You cannot modify these
parameters later.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bucket Size
```````````
For any configuration of granularity parameters, the maximum
size of a bucket is 1000 measurements or 125KB of data,
whichever is lower. MongoDB may also enforce a lower maximum size for 
high cardinality data with many unique values, so that the working set 
of buckets fits within the :ref:`WiredTiger cache <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Modifying Bucket Parameters
```````````````````````````

Once you set a collection's ``granularity`` or the custom bucketing
parameters ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds``, you
can increase the timespan covered by a bucket, but not decrease it.
Use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to modify the parameters. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      collMod: "timeseries",
      timeseries: { bucketMaxSpanSeconds: 3600, bucketRoundingSeconds: 3600 }
   })
   
.. note::

   ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` must be
   equal. If you modify one parameter, you must also set the other to
   the same value.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1 (and 5.0.6), you can create sharded time series
collections.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot shard time series
collections.

Sharding Administration Commands 
````````````````````````````````

You cannot run sharding administration commands on sharded time series 
collections. 

Shard Key Fields
````````````````

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-shard-key-limitations.rst

Resharding
``````````

You cannot reshard a sharded time series collection. However, you can 
:ref:`refine its shard key <shard-key-refine>`.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot write to time series collections in :ref:`transactions
<transactions>`.

.. note::

  Reads from time series collections are supported in transactions.

Views
~~~~~

- Time series collections are writable non-materialized :ref:`views
  <views-landing-page>`. Limitations for views apply to time series
  collections.

- You cannot create a view from a time series bucket collection
  namespace (namely, a collection prefixed with ``system.buckets``).

Snapshot Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read operations on time series collections with read concern
``"snapshot"`` guarantee snapshot isolation only in the absence of
concurrent drop or rename operations on collections in the read
operation. Re-creating a time series collection on the same namespace
with different granularity setting does not yield full snapshot
isolation.
