Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a **change stream** to monitor
real-time changes to your database. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+}
feature that allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a single
collection, database, or deployment.

You can specify a set of aggregation
operators to filter and transform the data your application receives. When
connecting to a MongoDB deployment v6.0 or later, you can also configure the
events to include the document data before and after the change.

Learn how to open and configure your change streams in the following
sections:

- :ref:`<java-change-stream-open>`
- :ref:`<java-change-stream-aggregation>`
- :ref:`<java-change-stream-configure-pre-post>`

.. _java-change-stream-open:

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

You can open a change stream to subscribe to specific types of data changes
and produce change events in your application.

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method on an instance of a
``MongoCollection``, ``MongoDatabase``, or ``MongoClient``.

.. important::

   Standalone MongoDB deployments don't support change streams because
   the feature requires a replica set oplog. To learn more about the oplog,
   see the :ref:`<replica-set-oplog>` {+mdb-server+} manual page.

The object on which you call the ``watch()`` method on determines the scope of
events that the change stream listens for.

If you call ``watch()`` on a ``MongoCollection``, the change stream monitors
a collection.

If you call ``watch()`` on a ``MongoDatabase``, the change stream monitors all
collections in that database.

If you call ``watch()`` on a ``MongoClient``, the change stream monitors all
changes in the connected MongoDB deployment.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example shows how to open a change stream on the
``myColl`` collection and print change stream events as they occur.

The driver stores change stream events in a variable of type
``ChangeStreamIterable``. In the following example, we specify that the
driver should populate the ``ChangeStreamIterable`` object with ``Document``
types. As a result, the driver stores individual change stream events as
``ChangeStreamDocument`` objects.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/change-streams/ChangeStreams.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin openChangeStreamExample
   :end-before: end openChangeStreamExample

An insert operation on the collection produces the following output:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   Received a change: ChangeStreamDocument{
      operationType=insert,
      resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
      namespace=myDb.myColl,
      ...
   }

To learn more about the ``watch()`` method, see the following API
documentation:

- `MongoCollection.watch() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#watch()>`__
- `MongoDatabase.watch() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoDatabase.html#watch()>`__
- `MongoClient.watch() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClient.html#watch()>`__

.. _java-change-stream-aggregation:

Apply Aggregation Operators to your Change Stream
-------------------------------------------------

You can pass an aggregation pipeline as a parameter to the ``watch()`` method
to specify which change events the change stream receives.

To learn which aggregation operators your {+mdb-server+} version supports, see
:ref:`<change-stream-modify-output>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code example shows how you can apply an aggregation pipeline to
configure your change stream to receive change events for only insert and
update operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/change-streams/ChangeStreams.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregationExample
   :end-before: end aggregationExample

An update operation on the collection produces the following output:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   Received a change: ChangeStreamDocument{
      operationType=update,
      resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
      namespace=myDb.myColl,
      ...
   }

.. _java-split-change-stream-events:

Split Large Change Stream Events
--------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, you can use the ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent``
aggregation stage to split events that exceed 16 MB into smaller fragments.

Use ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` only when strictly necessary. For
example, use ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` if your application requires full
document pre- or post-images, and generates events that exceed 16 MB.

The $changeStreamSplitLargeEvent stage returns the fragments sequentially. You can
access the fragments by using a change stream cursor. Each fragment
includes a ``SplitEvent`` object containing the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``fragment``
     - The index of the fragment, starting at ``1``

   * - ``of``
     - The total number of fragments that compose the split event

The following example modifies your change stream by using the
``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` aggregation stage to split large events:

.. code-block:: java

   ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = collection.watch(
         Arrays.asList(Document.parse("{ $changeStreamSplitLargeEvent: {} }")));

.. note::

   You can have only one ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` stage in your
   aggregation pipeline, and it must be the last stage in the pipeline.

You can call the ``getSplitEvent()`` method on your change stream cursor to access
the ``SplitEvent`` as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoChangeStreamCursor<ChangeStreamDocument<Document>> cursor = changeStream.cursor();
   SplitEvent event = cursor.tryNext().getSplitEvent();

For more information about the ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` aggregation stage,
see the :manual:`$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent
</reference/operator/aggregation/changeStreamSplitLargeEvent/>` server documentation.

.. _java-change-stream-configure-pre-post:

Include Pre-images and Post-images
----------------------------------

You can configure the change event to contain or omit the following data:

- The **pre-image**, a document that represents the version of the
  document before the operation, if it exists
- The **post-image**, a document that represents the version of the
  document after the operation, if it exists

.. important::

   You can enable pre- and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses MongoDB v6.0 or later.

To receive change stream events that include a pre-image or post-image, you
must perform the following actions:

- Enable pre-images and post-images for the collection on your MongoDB
  deployment.

  .. tip::

     To learn how to enable pre- and post-images on your deployment, see
     :manual:`Change Streams with Document Pre- and Post-Images </changeStreams/#change-streams-with-document-pre--and-post-images>`
     in the Server manual.

     To learn how to instruct the driver to create a collection with pre-images
     and post-images enabled, see the :ref:`<java-change-stream-pre-post-collection>`
     section.

- Configure your change stream to retrieve either or both the pre-images and
  post-images.

  .. tip::

     To configure your change stream to record the pre-image in change
     events, see the :ref:`<java-pre-image-example>`.

     To configure your change stream to record the post-image in change
     events, see the :ref:`<java-post-image-example>`.

.. _java-change-stream-pre-post-collection:

Create a Collection with Pre-Image and Post-Images Enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the driver to create a collection with the pre-image and post-image options
enabled, specify an instance of  ``ChangeStreamPreAndPostImagesOptions``
and call the ``createCollection()`` method as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/change-streams/ChangeStreams.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin createCollection
   :end-before: end createCollection

You can change the pre-image and post-image option in an existing collection
by running the ``collMod`` command from the MongoDB Shell. To learn how to
perform this operation, see the entry on :manual:`collMod </reference/command/collMod/>`
in the Server manual.

.. warning::

   If you enabled pre-images or post-images on a collection, modifying
   these settings with ``collMod`` can cause existing change streams on
   that collection to fail.

.. _java-pre-image-example:

Pre-image Configuration Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code example shows how you can configure a change stream
on the ``myColl`` collection to include the pre-image and output any
change events:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/change-streams/ChangeStreams.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin fullDocumentBeforeChangeExample
   :end-before: end fullDocumentBeforeChangeExample

The preceding example configures the change stream to use the
``FullDocumentBeforeChange.REQUIRED`` option. This option configures the change
stream to require pre-images for replace, update, and delete change
events. If the pre-image is not available, the driver raises an error.

Suppose you update the value of the ``amount`` field in a document from
``150`` to ``2000``. This change event produces the following output:

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 7
   :copyable: false

   Received a change: ChangeStreamDocument{
      operationType=update,
      resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
      namespace=myDb.myColl,
      destinationNamespace=null,
      fullDocument=null,
      fullDocumentBeforeChange=Document{{_id=..., amount=150, ...}},
      ...
   }

For a list of options, see the `FullDocumentBeforeChange <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/changestream/FullDocumentBeforeChange.html>`__
API documentation.

.. _java-post-image-example:

Post-image Configuration Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code example shows how you can configure a change stream
on the ``myColl`` collection to include the pre-image and output any
change events:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/change-streams/ChangeStreams.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin fullDocumentExample
   :end-before: end fullDocumentExample

The preceding example configures the change stream to use the
``FullDocument.WHEN_AVAILABLE`` option. This option configures the change
stream to return the post-image of the modified document for replace and
update change events, if it's available.

Suppose you update the value of the ``color`` field in a document from
``"purple"`` to ``"pink"``. The change event produces the following
output:


.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 6-7
   :copyable: false

   Received a change: ChangeStreamDocument{
      operationType=update,
      resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
      namespace=myDb.myColl,
      destinationNamespace=null,
      fullDocument=Document{{_id=..., color=purple, ...}},
      updatedFields={"color": purple},
      ...
   }

For a list of options, see the `FullDocument <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/changestream/FullDocument.html>`__
API documentation.
