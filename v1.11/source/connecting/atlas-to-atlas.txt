This page provides instructions to connect Atlas clusters using
{+c2c-full-product-name+}. For additional details on connecting to an
Atlas cluster, see :ref:`Connect to a Database Deployment
<atlas-connect-to-deployment>` 

Considerations 
--------------

- Both the source and destination Atlas clusters must use MongoDB 6.0 or 
  later. 
- ``mongosync`` supports replica sets and sharded clusters.
- ``mongosync`` **doesn't** support Atlas shared clusters or serverless 
  instances. You can use ``mongosync`` only with M10 or higher Atlas
  clusters.
