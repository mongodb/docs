Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to connect your Python application
to MongoDB with various settings.

  To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <pymongo-crud-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.
