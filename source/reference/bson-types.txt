:term:`BSON` is a binary serialization format used to store documents
and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB. The BSON specification is
located at `bsonspec.org <http://bsonspec.org/>`_.

Each BSON type has both integer and string identifiers as listed in the
following table:

.. include:: /includes/fact-bson-types.rst

- The :query:`$type` operator supports using these values to query
  fields by their BSON type. :query:`$type` also supports the 
  ``number`` alias, which matches the integer, decimal, double, and
  long BSON types.

- The :expression:`$type` aggregation operator returns the BSON type of
  its argument.
  
- The :expression:`$isNumber` aggregation operator
  returns ``true`` if its argument is a BSON integer, decimal, double,
  or long.

To determine a field's type, see :ref:`check-types-in-shell`.

If you convert BSON to JSON, see
the :ref:`Extended JSON <mongodb-extended-json-v2>` reference.

The following sections describe special considerations for particular
BSON types.

.. _document-bson-type-binary-data:

Binary Data
-----------

A BSON binary ``binData`` value is a byte array. A ``binData`` value
has a subtype that indicates how to interpret the binary data. The
following table shows the subtypes:

.. include:: /includes/binary-subtypes.rst

.. _document-bson-type-object-id:
.. _objectid:

ObjectId
--------

ObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered.
ObjectId values are 12 bytes in length, consisting of:

.. include:: /includes/fact-ObjectId-construct.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-id-field.rst

MongoDB clients should add an ``_id`` field with a unique ObjectId.
Using ObjectIds for the ``_id`` field provides the following additional
benefits:

- You can access ``ObjectId`` creation time in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` 
  using the :method:`ObjectId.getTimestamp()` method.

- ObjectIds are approximately ordered by creation time, but are not 
  perfectly ordered. Sorting a collection on an ``_id`` field 
  containing ``ObjectId`` values is roughly equivalent to sorting by 
  creation time. 

  .. important::

     .. include:: /includes/fact-ObjectId-timestamp-order.rst

Use the :method:`ObjectId()` methods to set and retrieve ObjectId
values.

.. _document-bson-type-string:

String
------

BSON strings are UTF-8. In general, drivers for each programming
language convert from the language's string format to UTF-8 when
serializing and deserializing BSON. This makes it possible to store
most international characters in BSON strings with ease.
[#sort-string-internationalization]_ In addition, MongoDB
:query:`$regex` queries support UTF-8 in the regex string.

.. [#sort-string-internationalization] Given strings using UTF-8
   character sets, using :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` on strings
   will be reasonably correct. However, because internally
   :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` uses the C++ ``strcmp`` api, the
   sort order may handle some characters incorrectly.

.. _document-bson-type-timestamp:

Timestamps
----------

BSON has a special timestamp type for *internal* MongoDB use and is
**not** associated with the regular :ref:`document-bson-type-date`
type. This internal timestamp type is a 64 bit value where:

- the most significant 32 bits are a ``time_t`` value (seconds since
  the Unix epoch)

- the least significant 32 bits are an incrementing ``ordinal`` for
  operations within a given second.

While the BSON format is little-endian, and therefore stores the least
significant bits first, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
always compares the ``time_t`` value before
the ``ordinal`` value on all platforms, regardless of
endianness.

Within a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, timestamp values are
always unique.

In replication, the :term:`oplog` has a ``ts`` field. The values in
this field reflect the operation time, which uses a BSON timestamp
value.

.. note::

   The BSON timestamp type is for *internal* MongoDB use. For most
   cases, in application development, you will want to use the BSON
   date type. See :ref:`document-bson-type-date` for more
   information.

When inserting a document that contains top-level fields with empty
timestamp values, MongoDB replaces the empty timestamp values with the
current timestamp value, with the following exception. If the ``_id``
field itself contains an empty timestamp value, it will always be
inserted as is and not replaced.

.. example:: Insert a document with an empty timestamp value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.test.insertOne( { ts: new Timestamp() } );

   Running :method:`db.test.find() <db.collection.find()>`  would then
   return a document which resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : ObjectId("542c2b97bac0595474108b48"), "ts" : Timestamp(1412180887, 1) }

   The server has replaced the empty timestamp value for ``ts`` with the
   timestamp value at time of insert.

.. _document-bson-type-date:

Date
----

BSON Date is a 64-bit integer that represents the number of
milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970). This results in a
representable date range of about 290 million years into the past and
future.

The `official BSON specification <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_
refers to the BSON Date type as the *UTC datetime*.

BSON Date type is signed. [#unsigned-date]_ Negative values represent
dates before 1970.

.. example:: Construct a Date using the ``new Date()`` constructor in
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var mydate1 = new Date()

.. example:: Construct a Date using the ``ISODate()`` constructor in
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var mydate2 = ISODate()

.. example:: Return the ``Date`` value as string:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mydate1.toString()

.. example:: Return the month portion of the Date value; months are zero-indexed,
   so that January is month ``0``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mydate1.getMonth()

.. [#unsigned-date] Prior to version 2.0, ``Date`` values were
   incorrectly interpreted as *unsigned* integers, which affected
   sorts, range queries, and indexes on ``Date`` fields. Because
   indexes are not recreated when upgrading, please re-index if you
   created an index on ``Date`` values with an earlier version, and
   dates before 1970 are relevant to your application.
