Use the {+atlas-cli+} to work with |service|, including using |fts| 
and {+avs+}, throughout the entire software development lifecycle from 
your local environment to the cloud.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-deployments-preview.rst

With the ``atlas deployments`` commands, you can perform the following
actions:

- Create and manage local |service| deployments. Local |service| 
  deployments reside on your computer and provide a non-production 
  environment for development.
- Create and manage |service| cloud deployments. Cloud |service| 
  deployments reside in the cloud for non-production and production use.
- Manage |fts| and {+avs+} indexes for your local and cloud |service| 
  deployments.

.. note::

   For local |service| deployments, you can manage only deployments that
   you created with the ``atlas deployments`` command. If you created a 
   local |service| deployment without using the {+atlas-cli+}, you can't
   manage that deployment with the {+atlas-cli+}.

You can use only ``atlas deployments`` {+atlas-cli+} commands with 
local |service| deployments. You can use all {+atlas-cli+} commands, 
including ``atlas deployments`` commands,  with cloud |service| 
deployments.

     - Use the ``atlas deployments search indexes create`` command to 
       manage |fts| indexes and work with {+avs+} locally and in the 
       cloud.
