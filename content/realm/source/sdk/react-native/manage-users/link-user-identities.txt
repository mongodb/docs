Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>`
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity.
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

You can link identities with the :realm-react-sdk:`useUser hook 
<functions/useUser.html>`.

   .. step:: Import Dependencies

      .. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/LinkIdentities.snippet.imports.tsx.rst

   .. step:: Set up Providers

         You need a logged-in user before you can link identities. This means
         you need an ``AppProvider`` and ``UserProvider``. Then you can link
         identities to the current user in any component within ``UserProvider``.

   .. step:: Create UI and Link Identities

         The following example renders the user ID for each identity associated
         with the app's current user. Initially, only the anonymous user
         identity renders, but you can create an email/password identity and
         link it to the anonymous user.
