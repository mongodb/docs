Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management system
that reduces the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups
on machines with large amounts of memory by using larger memory pages.

However, database workloads often perform poorly with THP enabled,
because they tend to have sparse rather than contiguous memory access
patterns. When running MongoDB on Linux, THP should be disabled for
best performance.

To ensure that THP is disabled before :binary:`~bin.mongod` starts,
you should create a new ``init.d`` script to apply the appropriate THP
setting, and configure it to run at boot. Additionally, for
:abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS systems that make use
of ``ktune`` and ``tuned`` performance profiles, you must
create a custom ``tuned`` profile as well.

Using ``tuned`` and ``ktune``
-----------------------------

.. important::

   If using ``tuned`` or ``ktune``, you must also perform the steps in
   this section after installing the init script.

``tuned`` and ``ktune`` are dynamic kernel tuning tools that can affect
the transparent huge pages setting on your system. If you are using
``tuned`` / ``ktune`` on your :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`
/ CentOS system while running ``mongod``, you must create a custom
``tuned`` profile to ensure that THP remains disabled.
