   :description: Configure Atlas Data Federation to read and write encrypted data in AWS S3 buckets, detailing required permissions for different encryption types.

{+adf+} can query and analyze unencrypted data in your |aws| |s3| 
buckets without additional configuration. However, to read encrypted 
data or write data to your |s3| buckets using :ref:`adf-out-stage`, 
{+df+} might require additional permissions depending on your |s3| 
encryption settings. 

The following table describes the required configuration for your 
{+fdi+} to read encrypted data and to use :ref:`adf-out-stage` to 
write data to |s3| for each type of |aws| |s3| encryption.

   * - |aws| |s3| Encryption Types
     - Required {+df+} Configuration

   * - `AES-256 
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__
     - {+adf+} supports both reads and writes of data encrypted in |s3| 
       buckets using AES-256 |aws| Managed Keys by default. No additional 
       configuration is required.

   * - `SSE with Amazon S3-Managed 
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__
     - {+adf+} supports both reads and writes of data encrypted in the 
       |s3| buckets using SSE with Amazon |s3| Managed Keys by default. No 
       additional configuration is required.

   * - `Customer Managed Symmetric Customer Master Keys 
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#symmetric-cmks>`__
     - {+adf+} can't access data encrypted in the |s3| buckets using SSE 
       Customer Managed Symmetric Customer Master Keys by default. For 
       reads and writes, you must add permissions similar to the following 
       to the policy assigned to your IAM role: 

       .. code-block:: json
       
          {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
                "kms:GenerateDataKey",
                "kms:decrypt"
             ],
             "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:<aws-region>:<role-ID>:key/<master-key>"
             ]
           }

       To modify the your |aws| IAM role trust policy: 

       1. Log in to your |aws| Management Console and navigate to the 
          :guilabel:`Identity and Access Management (IAM)` service 
          page.

       #. Select :guilabel:`Roles` from the left-side navigation and 
          click on the IAM role to modify.

       #. Select the :guilabel:`Trust Relationships` tab. 

       #. Click the :guilabel:`Edit trust relationship` button and edit 
          the :guilabel:`Policy Document`.
