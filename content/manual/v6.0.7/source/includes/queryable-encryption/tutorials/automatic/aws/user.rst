   :style: connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the `AWS IAM Console <https://aws.amazon.com/iam/>`__.

   .. step:: Create an IAM User

      .. _qe-tutorial-aws-create-iam-user:

      Create a new programmatic {+aws-iam-abbr+}
      user in the AWS management console by
      following the official AWS documentation on
      `Adding a User <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html>`__.
      You will use this {+aws-iam-abbr+} user as a service account for your {+qe+} enabled application.
      Your application authenticates with AWS KMS using the {+aws-iam-abbr+}
      user to encrypt and decrypt your {+dek-long+}s (DEKs) with your {+cmk-long+}
      (CMK).

      .. important:: Record your Credentials

         Ensure you record the following {+aws-iam-abbr+} credentials in the final
         step of creating your {+aws-iam-abbr+} user:

         - **access key ID**
         - **secret access key**

         You have one opportunity to record these credentials. If you do
         not record these credentials during this step, you must create
         another {+aws-iam-abbr+} user.

   .. step:: Grant Permissions

      Grant your {+aws-iam-abbr+} user ``kms:Encrypt`` and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions for
      your remote master key.

      .. important::

         The new client {+aws-iam-abbr+} user *should not* have administrative permissions
         for the master key. To keep your data secure, follow the
         `principle of least privilege <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Principle_of_least_privilege&oldid=1080333157>`__.

      The following inline policy allows an {+aws-iam-abbr+} user to encrypt and decrypt
      with the {+cmk-long+} with the least privileges possible:

      .. note:: Remote Master Key ARN

         The following policy requires the {+aws-arn-abbr+} of the key you generate in the
         :ref:`Create the Master Key <qe-aws-create-master-key>` step of this guide.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/queryable-encryption/tutorials/automatic/aws/iam-user-policy-minimum.json
         :language: json

      To apply the preceding policy to your {+aws-iam-abbr+} user, follow the
      `Adding IAM identity permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#add-policies-console>`__
      guide in the AWS documentation.

      .. important:: Authenticate with IAM Roles in Production

          When deploying your {+qe+} enabled application to a production environment,
          authenticate your application through an {+aws-iam-abbr+} role
          instead of an {+aws-iam-abbr+} user.

          To authenticate with an {+aws-iam-abbr+} role, specify your temporary
          {+aws-iam-abbr+} role credentials in your KMS provider
          object as follows:

          .. code-block:: json

             {
                 "accessKeyId":"<temporary access key ID>",
                 "secretAccessKey":"<temporary secret access key>",
                 "sessionToken":"<temporary session token>"
             }

          You can get your temporary {+aws-iam-abbr+} role credentials
          through the following mechanisms:

          - `Call AssumeRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__
          - `Retrieve Credentials from EC2 Instance Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials>`__

          Your application must include logic to get new temporary credentials
          and recreate your {+qe+} enabled ``MongoClient`` instance when each set of
          temporary credentials expires.

          To learn more about {+aws-iam-abbr+} roles, see the following
          pages in the official AWS documentation:

          - `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__
          - `When to create an IAM role (instead of a user) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose_role>`__

          To learn how to get temporary credentials and assume a role in each of
          the languages supported in this guide, see the following ``AssumeRole``
          runnable examples in the AWS documentation:
