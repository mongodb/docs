   * - Code
     - Cause

   * - .. error:: 0
     - Returned by MongoDB applications upon successful exit.


   * - .. error:: 1
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a generic failure when no 
       other error codes apply.


   * - .. error:: 2
     - The specified options are in error or are incompatible
       with other options.


   * - .. error:: 3
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` if there is a mismatch between 
       hostnames specified on the command line and in the 
       ``local.sources`` collection when running a replica set.


   * - .. error:: 4
     - The version of the database is different from the version
       supported by the :binary:`~bin.mongod` (or
       :binary:`mongod.exe`) instance.  The instance exits
       cleanly.


   * - .. error:: 5
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongos` if a problem is encountered
       during initialization.


   * - .. error:: 12
     - Returned by the :binary:`mongod.exe` process on Windows
       when it receives a Control-C, Close, Break or Shutdown event.


   * - .. error:: 14
     - Returned by MongoDB applications which encounter an
       unrecoverable error, an uncaught exception or uncaught signal.
       The system exits without performing a clean shutdown.


   * - .. error:: 20
     - *Message:* ``ERROR: wsastartup failed <reason>``

       Returned by MongoDB applications on Windows following an error
       in the WSAStartup function, used to initialize the networking
       subsystem.

       *Message:* ``NT Service Error``

       Returned by MongoDB applications for Windows due to failures
       installing, starting or removing the NT Service for the
       application.


   * - .. error:: 48
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
       when an error prevents a newly started instance from listening 
       for incoming connections.


   * - .. error:: 50
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` during server initialization 
       if it fails to fork the process.
       

   * - .. error:: 51
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` during server initialization 
       if the daemon fails to send a ready signal. The process exits 
       cleanly.


   * - .. error:: 61
     - Returned by the :ref:`storage-node-watchdog` if any of the 
       filesystems with monitored directories are unresponsive.


   * - .. error:: 62
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` when the datafiles in
       :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` are incompatible with the
       version of :binary:`~bin.mongod` currently running. 
       
       To resolve data incompatibility issues after upgrading, please 
       refer to the :ref:`release notes <release-notes-6.0>` for your 
       version of MongoDB and search for "Changes Affecting 
       Compatibility."

       uncaught exception.


   * - .. error:: 102
     - Returned by :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` when 
       the process fails to rotate audit logs on startup.
