Overview
--------

A group provides access to a distinct deployment of MongoDB clusters, replica
sets and standalone processes. Users must be members of a group to access the
group's deployment. When you register as a new |mms| user, you must choose
whether to join an existing group or create a new one.

Each group must have a globally unique name within the |mms| platform. Once
you name a group, the group's name cannot be changed. The user who creates a
group automatically has the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the group and
can manage user access.

You can create multiple groups. Each group has a unique agent API key that is shared
by the Monitoring, Backup and Automation Agents.
Within each group, the Monitoring Agent must be able to connect to all
hosts it monitors. If you have segregated environments separated by firewalls,
you must create separate |mms| groups for each environment.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and cannot
monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a new group.
Having a second group makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second group and agent to monitor a different set of
MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate the hosts
within the |mms| console. A user can only view data from the hosts monitored in
a single group at once.

After adding a second group, the |mms| interface will have a drop-down list that
will allow you to change groups. Selecting a new group will refresh the
current page with the data available from the servers in this group.

Create a Group
--------------

Choose a globally unique name for your group; this name must be unique within
the |mms| platform. For security and auditing reasons, you cannot use a name
used earlier, and once you name a group, the group's name cannot be changed.

|mms| automatically adds you as the first user to the group and assigns
the group a set of default :doc:`alert configurations
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.
