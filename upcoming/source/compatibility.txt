MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the versions of the
{+driver-long+} you can use with each version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/lifecycle-schedule-callout.rst

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/compatibility-table-legend.rst

.. include:: /includes/mongodb-compatibility-table-rust.rst

Language Compatibility
----------------------

The following table lists the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for each
version of the {+driver-short+}. The first column lists the driver
version.

.. include:: /includes/language-compatibility-table-rust.rst

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} increases the MSRV only in major and minor releases,
   using a Rust version that is at least six months old.

For more information on how to read the compatibility tables, see the guide on
:ref:`MongoDB Compatibility Tables <about-driver-compatibility>`.
