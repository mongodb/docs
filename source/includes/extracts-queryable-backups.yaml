   |mms| provisions these queryable snapshots as *read-only* MongoDB
   instances. Specifically, |mms| spins up a :program:`mongod` with
   data from the selected snapshot store.

   .. important::

      By default, these instances are available for up to 24 hours. You
      can configure the duration using :setting:`Expiration (Hours) <Expiration>`.
      For other queryable backup settings, see

   Prerequisites
   -------------

   For the queryable backup host, you must specify the location of the
   PEM file using the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` setting. If you
   have not already set up the queryable backup settings:

   #. Click on :guilabel:`Admin` on the upper-right hand corner. From 
      the :guilabel:`Admin` screen, click on :guilabel:`General` >
      :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config` > :guilabel:`Backup`.

   #. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Queryable Snapshot Configuration` and
      specify the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` that the tunnel or
      clients can use to connect to the queryable :program:`mongod`
      instance.

   #. Optional.  Update other queryable snapshot settings as
      appropriate. For description of the settings, see
      :ref:`queryable-snapshot-settings`.
