.. _ruby-version-2.21.1:

What's New in 2.21.1
--------------------

The {+driver-short+} 2.21.1 release includes the following new features,
changes, and improvements:

- Adds the ``type`` parameter to the
  ``Mongo::SearchIndex::View#create_one`` and
  ``Mongo::SearchIndex::View#create_many`` Search index
  creation methods. This enables you to create Atlas Vector Search
  indexes programmatically. To learn more and view examples, see the
  :ref:`ruby-atlas-search-index` guide.

- Adds compatibility with {+language+} 3.3. To learn more, see
  :ref:`ruby-compatibility`.

BSON v5.1
~~~~~~~~~

The ``bson`` gem is the implementation of the BSON specification in
{+language+}. ``bson`` v5.1 accompanies the {+driver-short+} v2.21.1
release.

The ``bson`` 5.1 release includes the following new features, changes,
and improvements:

- Adds the ``BSON::Vector`` type to represent vectors of numeric values.
  To learn more, see the :ref:`ruby-bson-vector` section of the BSON
  guide.

- ``BSON::Document`` objects do not support use of the
  ``#deep_symbolize_keys!`` and ``#symbolize_keys!`` methods. In
  previous versions, the ``#symbolize_keys!`` method raises an
  ``ArgumentError`` when used on a ``BSON::Document``, but
  ``#deep_symbolize_keys!`` does not, and only returns a ``Hash``
  rather than a ``BSON::Document``.

  This release adds a warning when you use ``#deep_symbolize_keys!`` on a
  ``BSON::Document`` instance. In ``bson`` v6.0, this action will raise
  an error.

.. _version-2.21:

What's New in 2.21
------------------

The {+driver-short+} 2.21 release includes the following new features: 

- Supports the Client-Side Operations Timeout (CSOT) feature, which unifies
  most timeout-related options under a single ``timeout_ms`` option.
- Supports {+mdb-server+} version 8.0.
- Support for range v2 queries with Queryable Encryption, including a new ``trim_factor``
  parameter. For more information about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>`
  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

To learn more about this release, see the
:github:`v2.21 Release Notes <mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/releases/tag/v2.21.0>` on
GitHub.

.. _version-2.20:

What's New in 2.20
------------------

The {+driver-short+} 2.20 release includes the following new features:

- Discontinues support for Ruby 2.5 and 2.6. Deprecates support for Ruby 2.7 and
  JRuby 9.2, which will be discontinued in the next minor driver version. Adds
  support for JRuby 9.4.
- Supports the newly-released Ruby-BSON version 5.0.
- Allows connection strings without a slash between the hosts and the options.
  For example, ``mongodb://example.com?w=1`` and ``mongodb://example.com/?w=1`` are
  both valid connection strings now.
- Sends container runtime and orchestration metadata for the client environment
  to the server for analytics purposes.
- Writes a warning message to the log when detecting the host as a CosmosDB
  (Azure) or DocumentDB (Amazon) instance.
- Attempts retries of read or write operations on a different ``mongos``
  instance in a sharded topology, if possible.

To learn more about this release, see the
:github:`v2.20 Release Notes <mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/releases/tag/v2.20.0>` on
GitHub.
