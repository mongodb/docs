Non-voting members allow you to add additional members for read
distribution beyond the maximum seven voting members.

To configure a member as non-voting, set both its
:rsconf:`~members[n].votes` and :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` values to
``0``.

Example
-------

The following example configures the fourth, fifth, and sixth replica
set members to be non-voting members.

#. In a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to a primary, run the
   :method:`rs.conf()` method and assign the result to a variable:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf();

   The returned document contains a ``members`` field which contains a
   zero-indexed array of member configuration documents, one document for each
   member of the replica set.

#. To configure the fourth, fifth, and sixth replica set members to be
   non-voting, use the following command sequence to set both their
   :rsconf:`members[n].votes` and :rsconf:`members[n].priority` values
   to ``0``.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg.members[3].votes = 0;
      cfg.members[3].priority = 0;
      cfg.members[4].votes = 0
      cfg.members[4].priority = 0;
      cfg.members[5].votes = 0
      cfg.members[5].priority = 0;

#. Use :method:`rs.reconfig()` method to reconfigure the replica set
   with the updated replica set configuration document.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(cfg);

Place voting members so that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance or instances
that you wish to serve as primary can
reach a majority of votes in the event of a network partition.

Use :rsconf:`members[n].priority`
to control which members are more likely to become primary.
