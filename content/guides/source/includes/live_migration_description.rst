The MongoDB Atlas Live Migration Service helps you migrate MongoDB databases to
our fully managed cloud database, MongoDB Atlas, quickly and securely. It works
by connecting to your existing MongoDB database and synchronizing it with a
cluster running in Atlas all while your application continues to function
normally. Once the data between the two clusters has been synchronized, you can
simply update the database connection string in your application to cut over to
your cluster in Atlas.
