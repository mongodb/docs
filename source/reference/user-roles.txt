   :widths: 35 65

   * - Organization Role
     - Decription

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Owner

     - Grants root access to the organization, including:

       - :authrole:`Project Owner` access to all projects in
         the organization, even if added to a project with a
         non-Owner role.

       - Privileges to administer organization settings.

       - Privileges to add/remove/edit users to the organization.

       - Privileges to delete the organization.

       - All the privileges granted by the other organization roles
         combined.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Project Creator

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to create projects in the organization.

     - Grants the following access:

       - Privileges to administer billing information for the organization.

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Read Only

     - Provides read-only access to everything in the organization,
       including all projects in the organization.

       For an :authrole:`Organization Member`, within a project, the
       user has the privileges as determined by the user's
       :ref:`project role <project-roles>`. If a user's project role is
       :authrole:`Project Owner`, then the user can
       add a new user to the project, which results in adding the
       newly-added user to the organization as well (if the newly added
       user is not already in the organization).

   * - .. authrole:: Organization Member

     - Provides read-only access to the organization (settings, users,
       and billing) and the projects to which they belong.

       For an :authrole:`Organization Member`, within a project, the
       user has the privileges as determined by the user's
       :ref:`project role <project-roles>`. If a user's project role is
       :authrole:`Project Owner`, then the user can
       add a new user to the project, which results in adding the
       newly-added user to the organization as well (if the newly added
       user is not already in the organization).

The following roles grant privileges within a project.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Project Role
     - Decription

   * - .. authrole:: Project Owner

         :doc:`project settings </tutorial/manage-project-settings>`.

       - :doc:`Manage programmatic access to a project 
         </tutorial/manage-programmatic-access>`.
       
         You can grant |api| Keys access to a project with either an
         organization or a project role. If your key has both the
         :authrole:`Organization Owner` and :authrole:`Project Owner`
         roles, it can access all projects in the organization.
  
       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and 
         :doc:`audit </database-auditing>` logs for all clusters in the project.

         To retrieve logs, you must have the :authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`
         role or higher in the project that the cluster belongs to.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Cluster Manager

     - A user with the :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role can perform the
       following tasks:
       
       - Grants access to edit, :doc:`pause </pause-terminate-cluster>`, and 
         resume |service| clustersdit |service| clusters.
      
       The :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role doesn't allow users to:

       - Access the :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`.

       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and
         :doc:`audit </database-auditing>` logs.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Data Access Admin

     - Grants access to :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`. This role 
       also grants privileges of :authrole:`Project Read
       Only`.

       Allows the user to perform the following
       :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>` actions:

       - View, create, and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

       - View, modify, and delete documents.

       - Retrieve :ref:`process <mongodb-logs>` and :doc:`audit 
         </database-auditing>` logs for all clusters in the project.

       - View the sample query field values in the :doc:`/performance-advisor`.

        
       The :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` role does not grant privileges
       to initiate backup or restore jobs.

       .. COMMENT
          In Atlas, Data Access Admin does not have access to real time metrics tab, so can't actually get to the screen to kill.  As such, will not mention the killOp privilege in Atlas. Mention only in CloudMgr/OpsMgr docs.

         project.

   * - .. authrole:: Project Data Access Read Only
