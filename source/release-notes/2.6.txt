   :local:
   :depth: 2

MongoDB 2.6 is currently in development, as part of the 2.5
development release series. While 2.5-series releases are currently
available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing only and
not for production use**.

This document will eventually contain the full release notes for
MongoDB 2.6; before its release this document covers the 2.5
development series as a work-in-progress.

Downloading
-----------

You can download the current 2.5 development release on the `downloads
page`_ in the :guilabel:`Development Release (Unstable)`
section. There are no distribution packages for development releases,
but you can use the binaries provided for testing purposes. See
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`,
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows`, or
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x` for the basic installation
process.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

.. important:: The MongoDB 2.5-series, which will become MongoDB 2.6,
   is for testing and development **only**. All identifiers, names,
   interfaces are subject to change. Do **not** use a MongoDB 2.5
   release in production situations.

SNMP Enterprise Identifier and MIB Field Name Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. DOCS-1696

In 2.5.1, the IANA enterprise identifier for MongoDB changed from
37601 to 34601. Users of SNMP monitoring must modify their SNMP
configuration (i.e. MIB) accordingly.

In 2.5.4, MongoDB changed the MIB field name ``globalopcounts`` to
``globalOpcounts``.

Default ``bind_ip`` for RPM and DEB Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the official MongoDB packages in RPM (Red Hat, CentOS,
Fedora Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and
derivatives), the default :setting:`bind_ip` value attaches MongoDB
components to the localhost interface *only*. These packages set this
default in the default configuration file
(i.e. ``/etc/mongodb.conf``.)

If you use one of these packages and have *not* modified the default
``/etc/mongodb.conf`` file, you will need to set :setting:`bind_ip`
before or during the upgrade.

There is no default ``bind_ip`` setting in any other 10gen distributions
of MongoDB.

``isMaster`` Command includes Wire Protocol Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.0

In order to support changes to the wire protocol both now and in the
future, the output of :dbcommand:`isMaster` now contains two new
fields that report the earliest version of the wire protocol that this
:program:`mongod` instance supports and the highest version of the
wire protocol that this :program:`mongo` instance supports. See
:data:`~isMaster.minWireVersion` and :data:`~isMaster.maxWireVersion`
for more information.

Replica Set Vote Configuration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB now deprecates giving any :term:`replica set` member more than
a single vote. During configuration,
:data:`local.system.replset.members[n].votes` should only have a value
of 1 for voting members and 0 for non-voting members. MongoDB treats
values other than 1 or 0 as a value of 1 and produces a warning message.

More Restrictive Checks on Metadata Refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

For sharded clusters, MongoDB 2.6 disallows a shard from refreshing the
metadata if the shard name has not been explicitly set.

For mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4 and
version 2.6 shards, this change can cause errors when migrating chunks
**from** version 2.4 shards **to** version 2.6 shards if the shard name
is unknown to the version 2.6 shards. MongoDB does not support
migrations in mixed sharded cluster deployments. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

.. _agg-helper-incompatibility:

Behavior of ``aggregate()`` Method in the ``mongo`` Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.5.3

.. the text of this message will improve and become more clear before
   2.6 when we remove mention of 2.5-series releases.


The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper now :ref:`returns a
cursor <rn-2.6-aggregation-cursor>`. As a result, you cannot use the
:method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method from a 2.5.3 (or later)
version of the :program:`mongo` shell while connected to 2.4 (and
earlier) versions of MongoDB.

To perform aggregation on earlier versions of MongoDB, use either a
previous version of the :program:`mongo` shell or if using the 2.5.3
(or later) version of the :program:`mongo` shell, run the
:dbcommand:`aggregate` command, not the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper, without specifying the
``cursor`` option.

.. TODO DOCS-1948 Uncomment when this feature is complete

   MongoDB Refuses to Insert Documents that Cannot be Indexed
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In 2.5.3, MongoDB will *not* insert documents into collections if
   the content of an indexed field exceeds the :limit:`Maximum Index
   Key Length <Index Key>` and return an error. In previous versions of
   MongoDB, such documents were inserted but not indexed.

.. _authentication-incompatibility:

Authentication and Authorization Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.5.4 introduces :ref:`enhancements for managing user
credentials and privileges <release-notes-user-defined-roles>`,
including a change to the user privilege model. To upgrade from the
version 2.4 :doc:`user privilege model
</reference/privilege-documents>` to the :ref:`2.5.4 model
<release-notes-user-defined-roles>`, you must convert existing users to
the new user privilege model.

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/important-upgrade-auth-model-prerequisites.rst

For details on upgrading MongoDB to 2.5.4 as well as then upgrading the
user privilege model, see :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

Version 2.5.4 is for testing and development only.

.. _ldap-mixed-mode-incompatibility:

LDAP Authentication And Mixed Sharded Cluster Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.6 introduces :ref:`LDAP Support for Authentication
<relnotes-ldap-authentication>`. MongoDB does not support LDAP
authentication in mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both
version 2.4 and version 2.6 shards. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for upgrade instructions.

``$mod`` Query Operator Enforces Strict Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$mod` operator now only accepts an array with exactly two
elements, and errors when passed an array with fewer or more elements.
In previous versions, if passed an array with one element, the
:query:`$mod` operator uses ``0`` as the second element, and if passed
an array with more than two elements, the :query:`$mod` ignores all but
the first two elements. Previous versions do return an error when
passed an empty array.

See :ref:`mod-not-enough-elements` and :ref:`mod-too-many-elements` for
details.

.. _update-operations-incompatibility:

Update Operations Enforce Field Name Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates cannot use :doc:`update operators (e.g $set)
</reference/operator/update>` to target fields with empty field names
(i.e. ``""``). For existing documents that currently have fields with
empty names ``""``, replace the whole document. See
:method:`db.collection.update()` and :method:`db.collection.save()` for
details on replacing an existing document.

Starting in MongoDB version 2.5.4, update operations no longer supports
saving field names that contain a dot (``.``) or a field name that
starts with a dollar sign (``$``). To remove or rename existing fields
with these attributes, use the :update:`$unset` operator or the
:update:`$rename` operator.

See :ref:`rel-notes-write-operations` for all changes to the write
operations, including updates.

.. _ssl-hostname-validation:

SSL Certificate Hostname Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.4

The SSL certificate validation now checks the Common Name (``CN``) and
the Subject Alternative Name (``SAN``) fields to ensure that either the
``CN`` or one of the ``SAN`` entries matches the hostname of the
server. As a result, if you currently use SSL and *neither* the ``CN``
nor any of the ``SAN`` entries of your current SSL certificates match
the hostnames, upgrading to version 2.5.4 will cause the SSL
connections to fail.

To allow for the continued use of these certificates, MongoDB provides
the :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting. The setting is
available for:

- :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` to bypass the validation of
  SSL certificates on other servers in the cluster.

- :program:`mongo` shell, :ref:`MongoDB tools that support SSL
  <mongodb-tools-support-ssl>`, and the C++ driver to bypass the
  validation of server certificates.

When using the :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB
logs as a warning the use of the invalid certificates.

.. warning:: The :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting
   bypasses the other certificate validation, such as checks for
   expiration and valid signatures.

``$all`` Operator Behavior Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$all` operator is now equivalent to an :query:`$and`
operation of the specified values. This change in behavior can allow
for more matches than previous versions when passed an array of a
single nested array (e.g. ``[ [ "A" ] ]``). When passed an array of a
nested array, :query:`$all` can now match documents where the field
contains the nested array as an element (e.g. ``field: [ [ "A" ], ...
]``), *or* the field equals the nested array (e.g. ``field: [ "A", "B"
]``). Earlier version could only match documents where the field
contains the nested array.

See :query:`$all` for details.

Changes
-------

.. important:: The MongoDB 2.5-series, which will become MongoDB 2.6,
   is for testing and development **only**. All identifiers, names,
   interfaces are subject to change. Do **not** use a MongoDB 2.5
   release in production situations.

Aggregation Pipeline Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _aggregation-method-change:

``db.collection.aggregate()`` Accepts Second Parameter
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In the 2.5.3 version of the :program:`mongo` shell, the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper can now accept as a second
parameter a document of options. See
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`agg-helper-incompatibility`

``$out`` Stage to Write Data to a Collection
````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.2

The aggregation pipeline adds a new stage named :pipeline:`$out` that
writes the result of the pipeline operation to an output collection and
returns an empty result set. In version 2.5.3 of the :program:`mongo`
shell, because the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a
cursor, specifying an :pipeline:`$out` stage returns an empty cursor.

See the :doc:`$out documentation </reference/operator/aggregation/out>`
for more information.

.. _rn-2.6-aggregation-cursor:

Aggregation Operations Now Return Cursors
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. There's a few other edits in the content below to make our statements stronger.

.. DOCS-1835

The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper in the :program:`mongo`
shell now returns a cursor. By returning a cursor, aggregation
pipelines can return result sets of any size. In previous versions, the
result of an aggregation operation could be no larger than 16
megabytes. See :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`.

The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return a document that contains
results with which to instantiate a cursor object.  See :dbcommand:`aggregate`.

``explain`` Option for the Aggregation Pipeline
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The new ``explain`` option for aggregation provides information about
how :program:`mongod` processes the pipeline. See
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` and :dbcommand:`aggregate` for
details.

Improved Sorting
````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.2

The :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$group` stages now use a more
efficient sorting system that provides improved performance.

The new ``allowDiskUsage`` option enables stages to write data to
temporary files. See :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` and
:dbcommand:`aggregate`.

``$redact`` Stage to Provide Filtering for Field-Level Access Control
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

The :pipeline:`$redact` stage restricts the content of a returned document
on a per-field level. See :pipeline:`$redact`.

Set Expression Operations in Aggregation Pipeline Stages
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In 2.5.2, the :pipeline:`$project` and :pipeline:`$redact` aggregation
pipeline stages now support a collection of :doc:`set expression
operators </reference/operator/aggregation-set>`.

``$map`` and ``$let`` Expressions in Aggregation Pipeline Stages
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. tip:: For :expression:`$let` and :expression:`$map`, the
   aggregation framework introduces variables. To specify a variable,
   use the name of the variable prefixed by **2** dollar signs
   (i.e. ``$$``) as in: ``$$<name>``.

The :expression:`$let` and :expression:`$map` make it possible to
declare and manipulate variables within an aggregation pipeline
stages, specifically the :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$group`, and
:pipeline:`$redact` stages. See: :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation/let` and
:doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation/map` for more information.

``$literal`` Expression for Aggregation Pipeline Stages
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The new :expression:`$literal` operator allows users to explicitly
specify documents in aggregation operations that the pipeline stage
would otherwise interpret directly. See
:doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation/literal` for more information.

``$cond`` Accepts Objects as Arguments
``````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

The ternary :expression:`$cond` expression can now take either an object
or an array. Previously :expression:`$cond` always took an array. See
:doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation/cond` for more information.

New ``$size`` Operator for the Aggregation Pipeline
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

The new :expression:`$size` operator for the :doc:`aggregation
pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>` returns the size of a specified
array. See :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation/size` for more
information.

.. _rel-notes-write-operations:

Write Operation Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-update-field-order.rst
   :start-after: order-of-document-fields
   :end-before: .. versionchanged

.. seealso:: :ref:`update-operations-incompatibility`

New Write Commands
``````````````````

.. versionchanged:: 2.5.4

MongoDB now supports new :dbcommand:`insert`,
:dbcommand:`update`, and :dbcommand:`delete` commands for all write
operations. These commands allow you to specify a write concern for an
entire bulk write operation as well as the continuation behavior in
the event of a single failed write. See the documentation of these
commands for more information:

- :dbcommand:`insert`
- :dbcommand:`update`
- :dbcommand:`delete`

The :program:`mongo` shell uses these new commands by default for
*all* write operations when connected to a version 2.5.4 or above
MongoDB instance. The :program:`mongo` shell will use legacy write
operations when connected to earlier MongoDB instances.

All officially supported MongoDB drivers will support the new write
commands before the official 2.6 release. Please see your driver's
release notes for more information.

New Update Operators
`````````````````````

.. versionadded 2.5.3

MongoDB also introduces new changes to the update language:

``$mul`` Update Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new :update:`$mul` operator allows you to multiply the value of a
field by the specified amount. See :update:`$mul` for details.

``xor`` operation for ``$bit`` Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :update:`$bit` operator now supports bitwise updates using a logical
``xor`` operation. See the documentation of :update:`$bit` for more
information on bitwise updates. Consider the following operation:

``$min`` Update Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new :update:`$min` operator updates the value of the field to a
specified value *if* the specified value is **less than** the current
value of the field. See :update:`$min` for details.

``$max`` Update Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new :update:`$max` operator updates the value of the field to a
specified value *if* the specified value is **greater than** the
current value of the field. See :update:`$max` for details.

``$currentDate`` Update Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :update:`$currentDate` operator sets the value of a field to the
current date, either as a :ref:`Date <document-bson-type-date>` or a
:ref:`timestamp <document-bson-type-timestamp>`. See
:update:`$currentDate` for details.

Enhanced Modifiers for ``$push`` Update Operator
````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionchanged:: 2.5.3

The :update:`$push` operator has enhanced support for the
:update:`$sort`, :update:`$slice`, and :update:`$each` modifiers
to increase functionality and usability. MongoDB also provides a new
:update:`$position` modifier for the :update:`$push` operator.

``$each`` Modifier Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When used in conjunction with the :update:`$sort`, the
:update:`$slice`, and the :update:`$position` modifiers, the
:update:`$each` modifier no longer needs to be the first modifier for
the :update:`$push`.

``$sort`` Modifier Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :update:`$sort` modifier can sort the array elements as a whole.
This change means that the :update:`$sort` modifier can now sort
array elements that are not documents. Or, if the array elements are
documents, the modifier can sort by the whole documents, and not just
by the field in the documents. The :update:`$sort` no longer requires
the :update:`$slice` modifier. See :update:`$sort` for details.

``$slice`` Modifier Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :update:`$slice` modifier can accept positive numbers to slice
from the front of the array. See :update:`$slice` for details.

``$position`` Modifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :update:`$position` modifier specifies the insert position for
the :update:`$push` operator. See :update:`$position`.

Sharding Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Removing Orphan Data From Shards
````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.2

The new :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command helps support sharded
cluster maintenance, by providing a mechanism to removed orphaned data
from a shard. Orphaned data are those documents in a collection that
exist on shards that belong to another shard in the cluster. Orphaned
data are the result of failed migrations or incomplete migration
cleanup due to abnormal shutdown.

Ability to Merge Co-located Contiguous Chunks
`````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.2

The :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` provides the ability for users to combine
contiguous chunks located on a single shard. This makes it possible to
combine chunks in situations where document removal leaves a sharded
collection with too many empty chunks.

See :doc:`/reference/command/mergeChunks` for more information and
:doc:`/tutorial/merge-chunks-in-sharded-cluster` for full
documentation of this operation.

Security Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _release-notes-collection-level-access-control:

Collection-Level Access Control
```````````````````````````````

MongoDB 2.5.3 provides the ability to specify user privileges at a
collection-level granularity. See :ref:`user-defined-roles` for more
information.

.. _release-notes-user-defined-roles:

User Defined Roles
``````````````````

.. important:: For authentication/authorization, to upgrade from
   version 2.4 model for user credentials and privileges to the 2.5.4
   model, see :ref:`authentication-incompatibility`.

MongoDB provides the ability to create custom user roles in addition to
the roles provided by MongoDB. In addition, MongoDB now provides global
user management, storing all user and user-defined role data in the
admin database and providing a new set of commands for managing users
and roles.

For more information on the new authorization model and user-defined
roles, see :ref:`authorization`.

SSL Improvements
````````````````

.. seealso:: :ref:`ssl-hostname-validation`

Optionally Prompt for SSL Certificate Passphrases at Server Startup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In MongoDB 2.5.4, a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` can now
interactively prompt the user at startup to enter the passphrase for
an encrypted SSL private key. This provides an alternative to
providing a cleartext passphrase on the command line or in a
configuration file. See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

Tools Now Support SSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB utility programs provide support for connecting to
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using SSL connection.
See :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl` for more information.

MongoDB Allows Only Strong SSL Ciphers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. DOCS-1921

MongoDB's SSL encryption only allows use of strong SSL ciphers, with a minimum
of 128-bit key length for all connections.

The strong-cipher requirement prevents an old or malicious client from forcing
use of a weak cipher.

Support for SSL and non-SSL Connections on the Same Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To permit upgrades of MongoDB clusters to use SSL encrypted connections, the
MongoDB server supports listening for both SSL encrypted and unencrypted
connections on the same TCP port. See :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl`.

.. _rn26-x509-authentication:

x.509 Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MongoDB introduces :doc:`x.509 certificate authentication
</tutorial/configure-x509>` for use with a secure :doc:`SSL connection
</tutorial/configure-ssl>` for client authentication as well as for
internal authentication of sharded and/or replica set cluster members.

See :ref:`x509-client-authentication` and
:ref:`x509-internal-authentication`.

Disable HTTP Interface By Default
`````````````````````````````````

MongoDB disables the http interface by default, limiting :doc:`network
exposure </core/security-network>`. To enable the interface, see
:setting:`httpinterface`.

Index Building Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background Index Builds Replicate to Secondaries
````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 2.5.0, if you initiate a :ref:`background index
build <index-creation-background>` on a :term:`primary`, the
secondaries will replicate the index build in the background.
In previous versions of MongoDB, secondaries built all indexes in the
foreground, even if the primary built an index in the background.

For all index builds, secondaries will not begin building indexes
until the primary has successfully completed the index build.

``mongod`` Automatically Continues In-Progress Index Builds Following Restart
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If your :program:`mongod` instance was building an index when it
shut down or terminated, :program:`mongod` will now restart building
the index when the :program:`mongod` restarts. Previously, foreground index
builds *had* to finish building before :program:`mongod` shutdown cleanly, and
background index builds were simply aborted.

To disable this behavior, the 2.5 series adds a new runtime option,
:setting:`noIndexBuildRetry` (or ``--noIndexBuildRetry`` on the
command line), for :program:`mongod`. :setting:`noIndexBuildRetry`
prevents :program:`mongod` from continuing rebuilding indexes that did
not finish building before the :program:`mongod` last shut down.

Tool Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Global ``mongorc.js`` File
``````````````````````````

If the file :file:`mongorc.js` exists in the :file:`/etc` directory (or
:file:`%ProgramData%\\MongoDB` directory on Windows), the
:program:`mongo` shell evaluates the contents of this file on start-up.
Then, the :program:`mongo` shell evaluates the user's
:file:`.mongorc.js` file if the file exists in the user's :envvar:`HOME
directory`.

The :option:`--norc` option for :program:`mongo` suppresses only the
user's :file:`.mongorc.js` file.

.. important::
   The :file:`mongorc.js` in :file:`/etc` directory must have read
   permission for the user running the shell.

Support for ``--quiet`` Option for all Tools
````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.0

All MongoDB :doc:`executable files </reference/program>` now support
the ``--quiet`` option. This option suppresses all logging output
except for error messages.

``mongoimport`` Uses Filename If Collection Name Is Not Specified
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

When invoked without the ``-c`` or ``--collection`` command-line argument,
the :program:`mongoimport` tool uses the input filename as the name
of the collection. MongoDB omits the extension of the file from the
collection name if the input file has an extension.

.. example::

   The following command imports data from the ``contacts.csv`` file
   into the ``contacts`` collection:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongoimport --db users --type csv --file /opt/backups/contacts.csv

   To specify the collection to import, use the ``-c`` or
   ``--collection`` option:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongoimport --db users --collection contacts --type csv --file /opt/backups/contacts.csv

``mongostat`` Can Support ``--rowcount`` Option with ``--discover`` Option
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

The :program:`mongostat` program now produces the specified
number of lines of output when using :option:`--rowcount` (:option:`-n`)
with the :option:`--discover` option. In earlier versions of
:program:`mongostat`, the :option:`--discover` option would override
:option:`--rowcount`, and would continue to produce output until the
user terminated the program.

Limit for ``maxConns`` Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 2.5.0, there is no longer any upward limit for the
:setting:`maxConns`, or :program:`mongod --maxConns` and
:program:`mongos --maxConns` options. Previous versions capped the
maximum possible :setting:`maxConns` setting at ``20,000``
connections.

See :setting:`maxConns`.

Additional Operation Termination Semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.4

MongoDB adds the cursor method :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS()` and
corresponding option for commands. ``maxTimeMS`` allows operations to specify
a time limit. MongoDB terminates operations
that exceed their allotted time limit, using the same mechanism as
:method:`db.killOp()`. MongoDB only terminates operations at
designated *interrupt* points.

Geospatial Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.2

MongoDB added support for the following `GeoJSON
<http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_ object types for use with
:doc:`2dsphere indexes </core/2dsphere>`: :ref:`geojson-multipoint`,
:ref:`geojson-multilinestring`, :ref:`geojson-multipolygon`, and
:ref:`geojson-geometrycollection`.

C++ Driver Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.0

The C++ driver now monitors :term:`replica set` health with the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` command instead of :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`.
This allows the C++ driver to support systems that have access control
enabled.

MSI Package for MongoDB Available for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB now distributes MSI packages for Microsoft Windows. This is the
recommended method for MongoDB installation under Windows.

New Replica Set Status Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides two additional methods to provide information
regarding the status of a :term:`replica set`:
:method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` and
:method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`.

The :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` method provides a formatted
report of the status of a :term:`replica set` from the perspective of
the primary set member. The output is identical to that of the
:method:`db.printReplicationInfo()` method.

The :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` method provides a
formatted report of the status of a :term:`replica set` from the
perspective of a secondary set member. The output is identical to that
of the :method:`db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` method.

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

Support for Auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

.. important:: Auditing, like all new features in 2.5.3, is in ongoing
   development. Specifically, the interface, output format, audited
   events and the structure of audited events will change
   significantly in the 2.5 series before the release of 2.6.

MongoDB Enterprise adds features to audit server and client activity
for :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. See
:ref:`auditing` for details.

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SASL Library Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise uses Cyrus SASL instead of GNU SASL (``libgsasl``).
This change has the following SASL2 and Cyrus SASL library and GSSAPI
plugin dependencies:

For Debian or Ubuntu, install the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install cyrus-sasl2-dbg cyrus-sasl2-mit-dbg libsasl2-2 libsasl2-dev libsasl2-modules libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit

For CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Amazon AMI, install the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum install cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-lib cyrus-sasl-devel cyrus-sasl-gssapi

For SUSE, install the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo zypper install cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-devel cyrus-sasl-gssapi

LDAP Support for Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise provides support for proxy authentication of users.
This allows administrators to configure a MongoDB cluster to
authenticate users via Linux PAM or by proxying authentication requests
to a specified Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service.
See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication`.

Expanded SNMP Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB Enterprise has greatly expanded its SNMP support. Enterprise
clients who need fine-grained server statistics now have SNMP access to
nearly the full range of metrics provided by
:dbcommand:`db.serverStatus()`.
