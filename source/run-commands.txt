Run Commands in ``mongosh``
===========================

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/fact-mdb-shell-beta.rst

To run commands in ``mongosh``, you must first
:ref:`connect to a MongoDB deployment <mdb-shell-connect>`. 

Switch Databases
----------------

To display the database you are using, type ``db``:

.. code-block:: sh

   db

The operation should return ``test``, which is the default database.

To switch databases, issue the ``use <db>`` helper, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use <database>

To access a different database from the current database without
switching your current database context, see the
:method:`db.getSiblingDB()` method.

To list the databases available to the user, use the helper ``show
dbs``.

Create a New Database and Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new database, issue the ``use <db>`` command with the
database that you would like to create. For example, the following
commands create both the database ``myNewDatabase`` and the
:term:`collection` ``myCollection`` using the
:method:`~db.collection.insertOne()` operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use myNewDatabase
   db.myCollection.insertOne( { x: 1 } );

If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you
first store data for that collection.

Insert Data into a Collection
-----------------------------

The :method:`db.myCollection.insertOne() <db.collection.insertOne()>` is one
of the :doc:`methods available in mongosh </reference/methods>`.

- ``db`` refers to the current database.

- ``myCollection`` is the name of the collection.

If ``mongosh`` does not accept the name of a collection,
you can use the alternative :method:`db.getCollection()` syntax.
For instance, if a collection name contains a space or hyphen, starts
with a number, or conflicts with a built-in function:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getCollection("3 test").find()
   db.getCollection("3-test").find()
   db.getCollection("stats").find()

For more documentation of basic MongoDB operations in ``mongosh``, see:

- :doc:`/crud/insert`
- :doc:`/crud/read`
- :doc:`/crud/update`
- :doc:`/crud/delete`
- :doc:`/reference/methods`

Terminate a Running Command
---------------------------

To terminate a running command or query in ``mongosh``,
press ``Ctrl + C``.

``Ctrl + C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
terminate the process on the MongoDB server. This behavior
differs from the :method:`db.killOp()` method, which terminates
commands on the server.

Command Exceptions
------------------

In scenarios where the output of a command includes ``{ ok: 0 }``,
``mongosh`` throws an exception and does not return the raw output from
the server.

.. note::

   In the legacy ``mongo`` shell, when a command's output included ``{
   ok: 0 }``, the behavior differs between commands. ``mongosh``
   provides consistent behavior by always throwing an exception in these
   scenarios.

Clear the ``mongosh`` Console
-----------------------------

The ``cls`` command clears the console. You can also clear the console
with ``Ctrl + L`` and ``console.clear()``.
