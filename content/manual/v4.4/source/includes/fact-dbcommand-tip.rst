.. tip::

   In the :program:`mongo` Shell, this command can also be run through the 
   |method|.

   Helper methods are convenient for :program:`mongo` users, but they may not
   return the same level of information as database commands.  In cases where
   the convenience is not needed or the additional return fields are required,
   use the database command.
