# Downgrade 3.6 Replica Set to 3.4

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.


## Downgrade Path

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


## Create Backup

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


## Prerequisites

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any 3.6 features
[incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4 or earlier
versions as generally outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

### 1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version

Tip: 

* Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command while an initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart. 

* Ensure that no replica set member is in [``ROLLBACK``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-states/#replstate.ROLLBACK) or [``RECOVERING``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-states/#replstate.RECOVERING) state. 

1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary. 

2. Downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.4"``. 

   ```javascript

   db.adminCommand({setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"})

   ```

   The [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command performs writes
   to an internal system collection and is idempotent. If for any reason
   the command does not complete successfully, retry the command on the
   primary.

To ensure that all members of the replica set reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member and
check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

```

All members should return a result that includes:

```javascript

"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }

```

If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` that includes
either a ``version`` value of ``"3.6"`` or a ``targetVersion`` field,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"3.4"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see [View FeatureCompatibilityVersion](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#view-fcv).


### 2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features

Remove all persisted features that are [incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4. For example, if you have defined
any any view definitions, document validators, and partial index
filters that use 3.6 query features such as [``$jsonSchema``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/#op._S_jsonSchema) or
[``$expr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/expr/#op._S_expr), you must remove them.


## Procedure

Warning: Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect the prerequisite changes. That is, check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible features for each node before downgrading. 


### Step 1: Download the latest 3.4 binaries.

Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
release in the 3.4 series. If using a package manager, add a new
repository for the 3.4 binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
process.

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


### Step 2: Downgrade secondary members of the replica set.

Downgrade each [*secondary*](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-secondary) member of the replica set, one at a
time:

1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod). See [Stop mongod Processes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#terminate-mongod-processes) for instructions on safely terminating [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) processes. 

2. Replace the 3.6 binary with the 3.4 binary and restart. 

3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before downgrading the next secondary. To check the memberâ€™s state, use the [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) method in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell. 


### Step 3: Step down the primary.

Use [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to
step down the [*primary*](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-primary) and force the normal [failover](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-high-availability/#replica-set-failover) procedure.

```javascript

rs.stepDown()

```

[``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) expedites the failover procedure and is
preferable to shutting down the primary directly.


### Step 4: Replace and restart former primary ``mongod``.

When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down
and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
previous primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with
the 3.4 binary and start the new instance.
