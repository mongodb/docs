The PHP community has created a huge number of libraries to make working
with MongoDB easier and integrate it with existing frameworks.

Libraries and Frameworks
------------------------

CakePHP
~~~~~~~

- `MongoDB datasource for CakePHP <https://github.com/ichikaway/cakephp-mongodb>`_.

- `Introductory blog post <http://mark-story.com/posts/view/using-mongodb-with-cakephp>`_
  on using it with MongoDB.

Doctrine
~~~~~~~~

`ODM <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb-odm.html>`_
(Object Document Mapper) is an experimental Doctrine MongoDB object
mapper. The ``Doctrine\ODM\Mongo`` namespace is an experimental project for
a PHP 5.3 MongoDB Object Mapper. It allows you to easily write PHP 5
classes and map them to collections in MongoDB. You just work with your
objects like normal and Doctrine will transparently persist them to
MongoDB.

This project implements the same "style" of the Doctrine 2 ORM project
interface so it will look very familiar to you and it has lots of the
same features and implementations.

How to batch import JSON data output from FFprobe for motion stream analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FFprobe is a stream analyzer that optionally reports in JSON. This
example is a PHP script that reads JSON from STDIN, makes an object
using json_decode, and inserts the object into a MongoDB database. This
script could be used with any program that outputs a JSON stream. A bash
script will be used to batch process all files within the current
directory. For example, the data may be used for analysis and logging of
a day's shoot.
