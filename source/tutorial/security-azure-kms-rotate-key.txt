|service| does *not* automatically rotate the Key Identifier
used for Azure-provided key management.

|service| automatically creates an
:alert:`encryption key rotation alert <Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
to remind you to rotate your Azure Key Identifier every 90 days by
default when you :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <security-azure-kms>`
for |a-service| project.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must create a new key in the Azure Key Vault associated to the
|service| project.

Procedure
---------

The following procedure documents how to rotate your |service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new key identifier in |service|.

alert at the completion of this procedure.
