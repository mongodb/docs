.. method:: sh.reshardCollection(namespace, key, unique, options)

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   The :method:`sh.reshardCollection()` method changes the shard key for
   a collection and changes the distribution of your data.

   Before you reshard a collection, read the the :ref:`reshard
   requirements <reshard-requirements>` and :ref:`reshard limitations
   <resharding-limitations>`.

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`reshardCollection` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt.rst

   ``sh.reshardCollection()`` takes the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80

      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``namespace``
        - string
        - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to shard in the form
          ``"<database>.<collection>"``.

      * - ``key``
        - document
        - The document that specifies the new field or fields to use as the
          :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.

          ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``

          Set the field values to either:

          - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`
          - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
            :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.

          See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`

      * - ``unique``
        - boolean
        - Optional. Specify whether there is a :doc:`uniqueness
          </core/index-unique>` constraint on the shard key. Only
          ``false`` is supported. Defaults to ``false``.

      * - ``options``
        - document
        - Optional. A document containing optional fields, including
          ``numInitialChunks``, ``collation`` and ``zones``.

The ``options`` field supports the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``numInitialChunks``
     - integer
     - Optional. Specifies the initial number of chunks to create
       across all shards in the cluster when resharding a collection.
       The default is the number of chunks that exist for the
       collection under the current shard key pattern. MongoDB will
       then create and balance chunks across the cluster. The
       ``numInitialChunks`` must result in less than ``8192`` per shard.

   * - ``collation``
     - document
     - Optional. If the collection specified to ``reshardCollection``
       has a default :ref:`collation <collation>`, you *must* include a 
       collation document with ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or the 
       ``reshardCollection`` command fails.

   * - ``zones``
     - array
     - Optional. To maintain or add :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`,
       specify the zones for your collection in an array:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          [
             {
                 min: <document with same shape as shardkey>,
                 max: <document with same shape as shardkey>,
                 zone: <string> | null
             },
             ...
          ]

Resharding Process
------------------

.. include:: /includes/reshard-collection-introduction.rst

Initialization Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the initialization phase, the resharding coordinator determines
the new data distribution for the sharded collection.

Index Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~

During the index phase:

- Each shard recipient creates a new, empty sharded collection with the
  same collection options as the existing sharded collection. This new
  sharded collection is the target for where recipient shards write the
  new data.
- Each shard recipient builds the necessary new indexes. These include
  all existing indexes on the sharded collection and an index compatible
  with the new shard key pattern if such an index doesn’t already exist on
  the sharded collection.

Clone, Apply, and Catch-up Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the clone, apply, and catch-up phase:

- Each shard recipient clones an initial copy of the documents it would
  own under the new shard key.
- Each shard recipient begins applying oplog entries from operations
  that happened after the recipient cloned the data.
- When the estimate for the time remaining to complete the resharding
  operation is under **two seconds**, the resharding coordinator blocks
  writes for the collection.

  .. note::

     If required, you can manually force the resharding operation to
     complete by issuing the :method:`sh.commitReshardCollection()`
     method. This is useful if the current time estimate to complete the
     resharding operation is an acceptable duration for your collection
     to block writes. The :method:`sh.commitReshardCollection()` method
     blocks writes early and forces the resharding operation to
     complete. During the time period where writes are blocked your
     application experiences an increase in latency.

.. _resharding-commit-phase-method:

Commit Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- After the resharding process reaches the commit phase, the process
  cannot be ended with :method:`sh.abortReshardCollection()`.
- When all shards have reached strict consistency, the resharding
  coordinator commits the resharding operation and installs the new
  routing table.
- The resharding coordinator instructs each donor and recipient shard
  primary, independently, to rename the temporary sharded collection.
  The temporary collection becomes the new resharded collection.
- Each donor shard drops the old sharded collection.

Example
-------

Reshard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example reshards the ``sales.orders`` collection with the
new shard key ``{ order_id: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.reshardCollection( "sales.orders", { order_id: 1 } )

Example output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
     ok: 1,
     '$clusterTime': {
       clusterTime: Timestamp(1, 1624887954),
       signature: {
         hash: Binary(Buffer.from("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "hex"), 0),
         keyId: 0
       }
     },
     operationTime: Timestamp(1, 1624887947)
   }

Reshard a Collection with Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reshard a collection with zones when you need to adjust the distribution 
of data across the shards in your cluster to meet changing requirements or 
to improve performance. 

In the following example, the ``test.scores`` collection resides on ``shard0`` 
and ``shard1``. The current shard key is ``{ _id: 1}``. 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Add shards to a new zone

      In this example, this zone is called ``NewZone``.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShardToZone( “shard2”, ‘NewZone’ )
         sh.addShardToZone( “shard3”, ‘NewZone’ )

   .. step:: Run ``sh.reshardCollection`` with the new zone information

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.reshardCollection(
           "test.scores", 
           { "studentId": 1, "testId": 1}, 
           { zones: [ {
             min: { "studentId": MinKey(), "testId": MinKey() },
             max: { "studentId": MaxKey(), "testId": MaxKey() },
             zone: "NewZone" }
             ]
         } )

      The resharding operation adds the shards in zone ``NewZone`` as recipients. 
      The database primary shard is added as a recipient as a backstop for any
      missing ranges in the zone definition. If there are no missing ranges, the 
      collection is cloned on shards in the "NewZone", such as ``shard2`` and 
      ``shard3`` in this example. ``sh.reshardCollection`` returns the following:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false 

         {
            ok: 1,
            '$clusterTime': {
            clusterTime: Timestamp( { t: 1699484530, i: 54 } ),
            signature: {
            hash: Binary.createFromBase64( "90ApBDrSSi4XnCpV3OWIH4OGO0Y=", 0 ),
            keyId: Long( "7296989036055363606" )
            } },
            operationTime: Timestamp( { t: 1699484530, i: 54 } )
         }
