Complete Aggregation Pipeline Example
-------------------------------------

Create the following collection that contains orders for products:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
      { _id: 0, productName: "Steel beam", status: "new", quantity: 10 },
      { _id: 1, productName: "Steel beam", status: "urgent", quantity: 20 },
      { _id: 2, productName: "Steel beam", status: "urgent", quantity: 30 },
      { _id: 3, productName: "Iron rod", status: "new", quantity: 15 },
      { _id: 4, productName: "Iron rod", status: "urgent", quantity: 50 },
      { _id: 5, productName: "Iron rod", status: "urgent", quantity: 10 }
   ] )

.. include:: /includes/aggregation-pipeline-example.rst

Example output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { _id: 'Steel beam', sumQuantity: 50 },
      { _id: 'Iron rod', sumQuantity: 60 }
   ]

MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command to
run the aggregation pipeline.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-stages:

Aggregation Pipeline Stages
---------------------------

An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more :ref:`stages
<aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` that process documents:
 
- Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline.

- A stage does not have to output one document for every input
  document. For example, some stages may produce new documents or
  filter out documents.

- The same stage can appear multiple times in the pipeline with these
  stage exceptions: :pipeline:`$out`, :pipeline:`$merge`, and
  :pipeline:`$geoNear`.
  
- For all available stages, see
  :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`.

Run an Aggregation Pipeline
---------------------------

To run an aggregation pipeline, use:

- :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` or

- :dbcommand:`aggregate`

Update Documents Using an Aggregation Pipeline
----------------------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use the aggregation pipeline to update
documents using these methods:

.. include:: /includes/table-update-with-aggregation-availability.rst

 .. _aggregation-pipeline-expressions:
 
Pipeline Expressions
--------------------

Some pipeline stages accept a pipeline expression as the operand.
Pipeline expressions specify the transformation to apply to the input
documents. Expressions have a :doc:`document </core/document>`
structure and can contain other :ref:`expression
<aggregation-expressions>`.

Pipeline expressions can only operate on the current document in the
pipeline and cannot refer to data from other documents: expression
operations provide in-memory transformation of documents.

Generally, expressions are stateless and are only evaluated when seen
by the aggregation process with one exception: :ref:`accumulator
<aggregation-accumulator-operators>` expressions.

The accumulators, used in the :pipeline:`$group` stage, maintain their
state (for example, totals, maximums, minimums, and related data) as
documents progress through the pipeline. Some accumulators are available
in the :pipeline:`$project` stage; however, when used in the
:pipeline:`$project` stage, the accumulators do not maintain their state
across documents.

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB provides the :group:`$accumulator` and
:expression:`$function` aggregation operators. These operators provide
users with the ability to define custom aggregation expressions in
JavaScript.

For more information on expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

.. _aggregation-optimize-performance:

Aggregation Pipeline Behavior
-----------------------------

In MongoDB, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command operates on a single
collection, logically passing the *entire* collection into the
aggregation pipeline. To optimize the operation, wherever possible, use
the following strategies to avoid scanning the entire collection.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-operators-and-performance:

Pipeline Operators and Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's :ref:`query planner <query-plans-query-optimization>` analyzes
an aggregation pipeline to determine whether :ref:`indexes <indexes>`
can be used to improve pipeline performance. For example, the following
pipeline stages can take advantage of indexes:

.. note::

   The following pipeline stages do not represent a complete list of all
   stages which can use an index.

``$match``
  The :pipeline:`$match` stage can use
  an index to filter documents if it occurs at the beginning of
  a pipeline.

``$sort``
  The :pipeline:`$sort` stage can use an index as long as it is not
  preceded by a :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$unwind`, or
  :pipeline:`$group` stage.

``$group``
  The :pipeline:`$group` stage can sometimes use an index to find the
  first document in each group if all of the following criteria are met:
  
  - The :pipeline:`$group` stage is preceded by a :pipeline:`$sort`
    stage that sorts the field to group by,

  - There is an index on the grouped field which matches the sort order
    and

  - The only accumulator used in the :pipeline:`$group` stage is
    :group:`$first`.

  See :ref:`group-pipeline-optimization` for an example.

``$geoNear``
  The :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator takes advantage of a
  geospatial index. When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, the
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operation must appear as the first
  stage in an aggregation pipeline.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, indexes can :ref:`cover
   <read-operations-covered-query>` an aggregation pipeline. In MongoDB
   2.6 and 3.0, indexes could not cover an aggregation pipeline since
   even when the pipeline uses an index, aggregation still requires
   access to the actual documents.

Early Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the data in a
collection, use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and
:pipeline:`$skip` stages to restrict the documents that enter at the
beginning of the pipeline. When placed at the beginning of a pipeline,
:pipeline:`$match` operations use suitable indexes to scan only
the matching documents in a collection.

Placing a :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage followed by a
:pipeline:`$sort` stage at the start of the pipeline is logically
equivalent to a single query with a sort and can use an index. When
possible, place :pipeline:`$match` operators at the beginning of the
pipeline.

Considerations
--------------

Aggregation Pipeline Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline has some limitations on the value types and
the result size. See :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits`.

Aggregation Pipeline Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline has an internal optimization phase that provides
improved performance for certain sequences of operators. See
:doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization`.

Aggregation on Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline supports operations on sharded collections.
See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-sharded-collection`.

Aggregation Pipeline as an Alternative to Map-Reduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
