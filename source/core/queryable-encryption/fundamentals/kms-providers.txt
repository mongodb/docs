Overview
--------

Learn about the {+kms-long+} ({+kms-abbr+}) providers {+qe+}
supports.

.. _qe-reasons-to-use-remote-kms:

Reasons to Use a Remote {+kms-long+}
---------------------------------------------

Using a remote {+kms-long+} to manage your {+cmk-long+}
has the following advantages over using your local filesystem to host
it:

- Secure storage of the key with access auditing
- Reduced risk of access permission issues
- Availability and distribution of the key to remote clients
- Automated key backup and recovery
- Centralized encryption key lifecycle management

Additionally, for the following {+kms-abbr+} providers, your
{+kms-abbr+} remotely encrypts and decrypts your {+dek-long+}, ensuring
your {+cmk-long+} is never exposed to your {+qe+} enabled
application:

- {+aws-long+} KMS
- {+azure-kv+}
- {+gcp-kms-abbr+}

{+kms-long+} Tasks
----------------------------

In {+qe+}, your {+kms-long+}:

- Creates and encrypts the {+cmk-long+}
- Encrypts the {+dek-long+}s created by your application
- Decrypts {+dek-long+}s

To learn more about {+cmk-long+}s and {+dek-long+}s, see
:ref:`qe-reference-keys-key-vaults`.

.. _qe-reference-kms-providers-create-and-store:

Create and Store your {+cmk-long+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a {+cmk-long+}, configure your {+kms-long+} to generate your {+cmk-long+} as follows:

To view a tutorial that demonstrates how to create and store a
{+cmk-abbr+} in your preferred {+kms-abbr+},
see :ref:`qe-tutorial-automatic-encryption`.

.. _qe-reference-kms-providers-encrypt:

Create and Encrypt a {+dek-long+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a {+dek-long+}:

- Instantiate a ``ClientEncryption`` instance in your
  {+qe+} enabled application:

  * Provide a ``kmsProviders`` object that specifies the credentials
    your {+qe+} enabled application uses to authenticate with
    your {+kms-abbr+} provider.

- Create a {+dek-long+} with the ``CreateDataKey`` method of the
  ``ClientEncryption`` object in your {+qe+} enabled application.

  * Provide a ``dataKeyOpts`` object that specifies with which key
    your {+kms-abbr+} should encrypt your new {+dek-long+}.

To view a tutorial demonstrating how to create and encrypt a
{+dek-long+}, see the following resources:

- :ref:`qe-quick-start`
- :ref:`qe-tutorial-automatic-encryption`

To view the structure of ``kmsProviders`` and ``dataKeyOpts`` objects
for all supported {+kms-abbr+} providers, see
