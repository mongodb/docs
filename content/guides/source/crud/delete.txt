What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

- Data inserted from the :ref:`guide-insert-query` guide.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_delete_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to query. In
      this case you will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection. 

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_delete.rst

   .. step:: Delete specific documents in the ``comets`` collection.

      The following example illustrates using a query filter to delete
      documents where their ``orbitalPeriod`` is greater than 5 and less
      than 85.

      .. include:: /includes/delete_documents.rst

   .. step:: Display your results.

      The ``result`` contains some information about the delete
      operation. To verify you deleted documents, print the amount of
      documents the driver deleted.

      .. include:: /includes/delete_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_delete_query.rst
