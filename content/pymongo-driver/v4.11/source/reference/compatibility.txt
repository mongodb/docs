Language Compatibility
----------------------

{+driver-short+} supports both CPython and PyPy.

When a version of Python is marked end-of-life (EOL), the next minor release of
{+driver-short+} drops support for that version. The driver offers the
following ongoing support for EOL Python versions:

- **CPython**: The last minor {+driver-short+} version compatible with the EOL CPython
  version receives critical bug fixes for one year.
- **PyPy**: {+driver-short+} doesn't support PyPy versions past their EOL date.

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version of
{+driver-short+} for use with a specific version of Python.
The first column lists the driver version.
