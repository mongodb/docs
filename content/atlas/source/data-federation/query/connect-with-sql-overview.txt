MongoDB SQL Interface
=====================

The {+sql-interface+} provides custom connectors and drivers that simplify exporting 
data stored in MongoDB's document model to SQL-driven tooling in a modern and unified way.
You can use it to connect to both {+service+} and On-Premise MongoDB deployments.

Key Benefits of the MongoDB SQL Interface
-----------------------------------------

**Schema Improvements**
   Experience significantly improved schema computations that adapt to your 
   data. There's no need for cumbersome schema files as MongoSQL dynamically 
   derives schemas on-the-fly and stores them in the database for easy retrieval. 
   The schema mapping is very accurate with no sampling.

**Simple & Secure** 
   Enjoy a simplified setup with no complex proxy configurations, allowing you 
   to connect directly to your MongoDB cluster. It offers robust authentication 
   with support for X509 and OIDC protocols.

**First-class SQL Experience**
   Leverage rich objects and arrays with native driver support, enhancing your 
   data interactions. Server restarts are seamless, ensuring uninterrupted 
   operations and high availability. The interface uses MongoSQL, a 
   MongoDB-Native SQL-92 compatible dialect, which supports complex transformations 
   like flattening nested objects and unwinding arrays directly within SQL queries.

**Unified Access**
   Provides the same drivers, connectors, and schema mapping for Atlas Cloud, 
   Atlas Data Federation, and On-Premise EA Databases.

**BI Tool Integration**
   The Power BI Connector is certified by Microsoft and the Tableau Connector 
   is developed in partnership with Tableau. It supports Power BI with 
   DirectQuery and Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, and Tableau Prep. Tableau 
   Cloud support is expected in the first half of 2025.

Legacy Options

.. warning::
   The BI Connector has a scheduled **End-of-Life (EOL) date of September 2026**.

analytics tools.
