Solution Overview  
-----------------

The real-time flight management solution enables airlines to  
proactively manage and mitigate costly flight delays. In 2019 alone, 
flight delays cost European airlines an average of €4,320 per hour per flight.

The solution leverages intelligent data handling and immediate response to provide
real-time monitoring, predictive insights, and optimized resource allocation. It
uses an event-driven architecture with:

- FastAPI for simulation
- GCP PubSub for messaging 
- Vertex AI for advanced analytics
- Google Cloud Functions for serverless event-driven processing. 

Built on MongoDB's flexible document model and time series collections, the solution  
offers a comprehensive approach to minimizing operational disruptions.

The solution delivers:  

- **Reduced delay propagation:** Real-time monitoring and immediate  
  response capabilities help prevent delays from cascading through  
  flight schedules.  
- **Optimized resource allocation:** Intelligent data analysis enables  
  efficient reallocation of resources during disruptions.  
- **Enhanced customer experience:** Better disruption management leads  
  to improved passenger satisfaction and loyalty.  
- **Scalable operations:** Flexible architecture supports growing data  
  volumes and operational demands.  
- **Real-time decision making:** Immediate access to flight data  
  enables quick and informed operational decisions.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

The real-time flight management solution implements an 
event-driven architecture for delay management, which provides real-time 
monitoring, predictive insights, and resource optimization. The architecture 
consists of several key components: 

**1. Data generation and processing**  

- FastAPI microservice housing Real-Time Data Simulator and Path Finder.  
- PubSub topics handling both static and real-time data streams.  
- Cloud Functions for processing application and telemetry data.  

**2. Analytics and cost management**

- Vertex AI Cost Calculator for financial impact analysis.  
- Analytical data creator Cloud Function for data transformation.  
- Aggregation pipeline for complex data processing.  

**3. Database structure**  

- MongoDB database as the central data store.  

- Specialized collections:  

  - ``flight_costs`` collection to track and analyze flight-related expenses.  
        
  - ``flight_plane`` simulation collection for predictive modeling and scenario planning.  
        
  - ``flight_realtimeCF`` collection designed for  
    real-time data tracking and historical analysis (`Time  
    Series Collection <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/timeseries-collections/>`__).  

  - ``flights`` collection for comprehensive general flight information management.  

**4. Integration components**

- Change Streams for real-time data changes.  
- Google Maps API for visualizing geographical data.  
- Next.js for front-end interface and visualization.  

As illustrated in Figure 2, this architecture enables the following data flows:

- **Operational data flow (blue lines):** Handles real-time flight operations.  
- **Analytical data flow (green lines):** Manages business intelligence.  
- **Internal connections (black lines):** Maintains system integration.

Build the Solution
------------------

For a detailed, step-by-step guide that implements this solution, including code
samples and specific configuration instructions, visit this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-airline>`__.
This solution provides a scalable, event-driven architecture to manage flight 
operations and minimize delays and disruptions.

To implement the solution, follow these steps:

.. procedure::  
   :style: normal  

   .. step:: Set up the prerequisites

      Install the following dependencies:

      - Node.js (v14 or later)  
      - MongoDB (local or cloud)  
      - Next.js (v12 or later)  
      - Google Cloud SDK 

   .. step:: Set up MongoDB  

      - Store flight data in a flexible schema.  
      - Enable real-time updates.  
      - Handle time series data for analytics.  
      - Maintain operational flight information, ensuring you  
        obtain the MongoDB connection string for subsequent  
        configuration and integration steps.  
  
   .. step:: Configure GCP services
  
      - Deploy the application as a containerized service using Google Cloud’s Cloud Run.  
      - Configure Google Cloud’s Cloud Build for automated deployments.  
      - Set up Google Cloud’s Cloud Storage for assets.  
      - Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time data distribution.  
      - Implement Google Cloud’s Cloud Functions for data  
        processing. The code snippet runs in a cloud function. When the system 
        identifies a disruption, the function updates the new path obtained from
        the path finder algorithm. This feature ensures optimal rerouting, which 
        minimizes fuel consumption and reduces costs.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **Utilize flexible models:** MongoDB's flexible schema and time series 
  collections provide a powerful foundation for flight operations. These 
  features enable airlines to efficiently handle both pre-flight planning and 
  telemetry data, while adapting to changing requirements.

- **Enable real-time monitoring:** An event-driven architecture powered by MongoDB's 
  integration with Google Cloud services, such as Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions, enables 
  immediate response to flight disruptions. By processing real-time data streams,
  this approach helps airlines minimize delays, which can `cost an average of €4,320 per hour <https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-84402402402511-8>`__.  

- **Obtain enhanced insights:** MongoDB’s aggregation pipelines turn operational
  flight data into actionable insights, enabling airlines to optimize routes 
  and resources. Google Cloud Vertex AI delivers predictive analytics that help 
  airlines manage costs and delays.

- **Manage data efficiently:** This solution shows how MongoDB handles diverse 
  data types and workloads, from real-time telemetry collection to analytical 
  processing. Its distributed architecture and change streams capabilities 
  ensure consistent performance.
