   Snapshot encryption depends upon which
   :manual:`version of MongoDB your database is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
   This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version
   to one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the FCV can be ``4.0`` or
   ``4.2``.

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier

         |onprem| supports encryption for any backup job that was
         stored in a :term:`head database` running
         :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
         3.4 or later with the
         :ref:`WiredTiger <encrypted-storage-engine>` storage engine.

         To encrypt backups, you use a master key that a
         |kmip|-compliant key management appliance generates and
         maintains. This master key encrypts the
         :term:`head databases <head database>`. As the
         :term:`Backup Daemon` creates snapshots from the head
         databases, resulting snapshots from the encrypted head
         databases are themselves encrypted.

         To restore from an encrypted backup, you need the same master
         key used to encrypt the backup and either the same certificate
         as is on the :term:`Backup Daemon` host or a new certificate
         provisioned with that key from the |kmip| host. This
         corresponds to the value in the **KMIP client certificate
         path** field.

         |mms| can encrypt any backup job that it had stored in a
         snapshot store. The snapshot must come from a database that
         ran
         :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
         4.2 or later with:

         - |fcv-link| of 4.2 or later and
         - :ref:`WiredTiger <encrypted-storage-engine>` storage engine.

         To encrypt backups, use a master key that a |kmip|-compliant
         key management appliance generates and maintains. This master
         key encrypts key that encrypts the database.

         .. important::

            The :term:`Backup Daemon` requires a connection to the
            |kmip| host to process a :doc:`queryable restore job
            </tutorial/query-backup>` of an encrypted backup.

Prerequisites
-------------

A host running |kmip|-compliant key management to generate and store
encryption keys.

      .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
         :tabid: fcv40

         - :term:`Head databases <head database>` use
           :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
           3.4 or later with the WiredTiger :term:`storage engine`.

         - A valid |kmip| client certificate and |kmip| host |certauth|
           files. These files are used to authenticate |onprem| to the
           |kmip| host. The client certificate on the Backup Daemon
           host must have access to all keys in the |kmip| host.

      .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
         :tabid: fcv42

         .. important::

            Clusters running MongoDB |fcv-link| 4.2 or later must use
            |kmip| servers. These clusters don't support local key
            management using files.

.. important::

   You must maintain all keys, even rotated keys, in the |kmip| host.

            For existing backups in a project, enabling encryption
            requires an initial backup sync to recreate the backups'
            head databases.
