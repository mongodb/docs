Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} uses connection pools to manage
connections to a MongoDB deployment and how you can configure connection pool settings
in your application.

A connection pool is a cache of open database connections maintained by the {+driver-short+}.
When your application requests a connection to MongoDB, the {+driver-short+} seamlessly
gets a connection from the pool, performs operations, and returns the connection
to the pool for reuse.

Connection pools help reduce application latency and the number of times new connections
are created by {+driver-short+}.

Create a Connection Pool
------------------------

Every ``MongoClient`` instance has a built-in connection pool for each server 
in your MongoDB topology. Connection pools open sockets on demand to support 
concurrent MongoDB operations in your multi-threaded application.

The ``maxPoolSize`` option sets the maximum size of each connection pool, which 
defaults to 100. If the number of in-use connections to a server reaches the 
value of ``maxPoolSize``, the next request to that server will wait until a 
connection becomes available.

Each ``MongoClient`` instance opens two more sockets per server in your MongoDB 
topology for monitoring the server's state.

Configure a Connection Pool
---------------------------

You can specify settings for your connection pool using either a connection
string or by passing a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to the 
``MongoClients.create()`` method.

The following code creates a client with a maximum connection pool size of ``50``. 
Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings`  tab to
see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri
    
    .. code-block:: java

      ConnectionString connectionString = "mongodb://<host>:<port>/?maxPoolSize=50"
      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString)

    The following are connection string settings you can use to configure your 
    connection pool:

      * - Setting
        - Description
      
      * - ``maxConnecting``
      
        - Maximum number of connections a pool may establish
          concurrently.

          *Default:* ``2``
      
      * - ``maxIdleTimeMS``
      
        - The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can 
          remain idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

          *Default:* ``0``
      
      * - ``maxPoolSize``

        - Maximum number of connections opened in the pool. When the 
          connection pool reaches the maximum number of connections, new 
          connections wait up until to the value of 
          ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``.

          *Default:* ``100`` 

      * - ``minPoolSize``

        - Minimum number of connections opened in the pool. 
          The value of ``minPoolSize`` must be less than 
          the value of ``maxPoolSize``.

          *Default*: ``0``

      * - ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``

        - Maximum wait time in milliseconds that an operation can wait for 
          a connection to become available. A value of ``0`` means there
          is no limit. 

          *Default*: ``120000`` (120 seconds)

    :ref:`Connection Options <connection-options>`
    guide.
