About this Task
---------------

.. include:: /includes/database-connections/about-this-task.rst

.. important::

   To plan your migration and map your |db-type| schema to a 
   MongoDB schema, you must connect using an account with the correct 
   ``read`` permissions.
   
   To migrate data, you must connect to your |db-type| database using a 
   service account with the required permissions.

   For information on database configuration and required permissions, see
   :ref:`Configure MySQL <rm-prereq-mysql>`.

Steps
-----

.. _rm-mysql-connection-string:

Database Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+rel-mig+} requires a connection string to connect to your MySQL instance.

The MySQL connection string looks like:

.. code-block::

   jdbc:mysql://<host:port>/<database>?<properties>

For example, the ``test`` MySQL database running on ``host1`` at port ``3306`` 
uses the following connection string:

.. code-block::

   jdbc:mysql://host1:3306/test

Alternatively, {+rel-mig+} can create the appropriate connection string 
based on user-provided database information.

.. _rm-save-mysql-connection:

Connect to |db-type|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To save a new connection from the :guilabel:`Connections` page, perform 
the following actions:

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. include:: /includes/database-connections/connect-to-db-steps-part-1.rst
      
   .. step:: To create a connection string, enter the following:

      .. include:: /includes/table-mysql-connection-fields.rst

   .. include:: /includes/database-connections/connect-to-db-steps-part-2.rst

- {+rel-mig+} relies on the open-source Debezium connector to capture 
  row-level changes. For more details, see
