While the MongoDB frontend stack is increasingly making use of new and
nonstandard Web platform features (such as ES6 modules and candidate ES7
language features), a significant chunk of our users are not using
evergreen browsers that are required for these features.

For this reason, we compile our JavaScript and CSS into a form that these
older browsers support. However, we want to take a data-driven approach
to choosing which older browsers to support using
`browserslist-ga <https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-ga>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that you have a current version of `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__,
and run the following to install ``browserslist-ga`` and ``browserslist``:

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install -g browserslist-ga browserslist

Generate a Stats File
---------------------

Run the following to generate a browserslist statistics file:

.. code-block:: sh

   browserslist-ga

This will open a Google authentication workflow in your default browser.
Sign in, and return to your terminal to provide the following answers:

.. list-table::

   * - Please select an account:
     - ``All MongoDB (#7301842)``
   * - Please select a property:
     - ``Combined Traffic (#UA-7301842-14)``
   * - Please select a profile:
     - ``Docs - Domain Only (#72085910)``
   * - Specify a start date:
     - Default is 90 days prior
   * - Specify an end date:
     - Default is today

After a moment, ``browserslist-ga`` should return and write a file called
``browserslist-stats.json`` that you will provide to ``browserslist``.

Generate a Browser Coverage List
--------------------------------

In the same directory, run the following to return a list of browsers
that provide 99.5% coverage of docs visitors:

.. code-block:: sh

   browserslist --stats=browserslist-stats.json 'cover 99.5% in my stats'
