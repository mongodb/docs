Load the Sample Synonyms Source Collection with the Java Driver
---------------------------------------------------------------

Each document in the synonyms source collection describe how one or more
words map to one or more synonyms of those words. To learn more about the
fields and word mapping types in the synonyms source collection documents,
see :ref:`synonyms-coll-format`. 

To begin, you create the synonyms source collection and then add the
collection to the database where you intend to use the synonyms source
collection. In this section, you create one or two sample synonyms source
collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database using the MongoDB Java driver, and then use 
the synonyms source collections with an index of the ``movies`` collection in the same
database.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Set up your Java project with the MongoDB Java driver.

      .. include:: /includes/fts/field-types/add-java-dependency.rst

      For more detailed installation instructions and version compatibility, see
      the :driver:`MongoDB Java Driver documentation </java/sync/current/get-started/>`.

   .. step:: Create and populate the synonyms source collections.

      If you are running a free tier {+cluster+} or a {+Flex-cluster+},
      follow the steps in the :guilabel:`Transportation Synonyms` tab to create the collection
      for a single synonym mapping definition in your index. If you have a
      ``M10`` or higher cluster and wish to create multiple synonym
      mappings in your index, follow the steps in the :guilabel:`Multiple Synonyms` tab to create
      both the :guilabel:`Transportation Synonyms` and :guilabel:`Attire Synonyms` collections.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Transport Synonyms
            :tabid: transport

            Create and populate the ``transport_synonyms`` collection:
            
            .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/synonyms/TransportSynonyms.java
               :language: java
               :copyable:
               :linenos:
         
         .. tab:: Multiple Synonyms
            :tabid: multiple

            Create and populate both the ``transport_synonyms`` and ``attire_synonyms`` collections:
            
            .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/synonyms/MultipleSynonyms.java
               :language: java
               :copyable:
               :linenos:

      .. include:: /includes/fts/field-types/find-connection-string.rst

   .. step:: Compile and run the file to create the index.

      Compile and run your application in your IDE or your shell. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: shell

            javac FileName.java
            java FileName

         .. output::
            :visible: false
