To run a data migration job, Relational Migrator requires MongoDB account 
credentials with the :authrole:`readWrite` role on the target database. This 
page describes the procedure to make a user in your MongoDB database.

Steps
-----

Relational Migrator can connect to an Atlas cluster or an on-premises
deployment. Select the tab corresponding to your deployment type.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas
      :tabid: service-user-atlas

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Connect to your deployment

            Log in to `the Atlas GUI <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/>`__.
            
         .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation, click :guilabel:`Database Access`.
         
         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add New Database User`.

         .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Authentication Method` section of the :guilabel:`Add New Database User` modal window, select the box labeled :guilabel:`Password`.
            
         .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Password Authentication`, enter the username ``migrator-service`` for the new user in the top text field.
         
         .. step:: Enter the password ``password`` for the new user in the lower text field.
         
         .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Database User Privileges`, click :guilabel:`Built-in Role`.
         
         .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Read and write to any database`.
         
         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add User`.

   .. tab:: On-Premises
      :tabid: service-user-onprem

      Use ``mongosh`` to provision a user account that has
      :authrole:`readWrite` access to your data migration target database.

      The example commands assume your deployment is running on ``localhost``
      on the default port of ``27017``, and that you're creating a user to
      access the ``MongoEnterprises`` database.

      For more information on connecting to MongoDB using ``mongosh``, see
      `Connecting to your MongoDB Deployment <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/connect/>`__.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Connect to your deployment using ``mongosh``
            
            You must use an account that can run `createUser <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/>`__ 
            on the admin and ``MongoEnterprises`` databases.

            .. code-block::

               mongosh "mongodb://myadminuser:myadminpassword@localhost:27017/admin"

         .. step:: Create the service user in the ``admin`` database for authentication

            Run the following command to create a 
            ``migrator-service`` user with a password of your choice and 
            ``readWrite`` access to the ``MongoEnterprises`` database:

            .. code-block::

               use admin
               db.createUser(
                  { user: "migrator-service",
                     pwd: "password",
                     roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
                  }
               )       
         
         .. step:: Create the same user in the ``MongoEnterprises`` database

            .. code-block::
               
               use MongoEnterprises
               db.createUser(
                  { user: "migrator-service",
                     pwd: "password",
                     roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
                  }
               )
