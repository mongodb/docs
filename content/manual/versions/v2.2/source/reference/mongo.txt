Description
-----------

.. only:: (not man)

   .. binary:: mongo

:binary:`~bin.mongo` is an interactive JavaScript shell interface to
MongoDB, which provides a powerful interface for systems
administrators as well as a way for developers to test queries and
operations directly with the database. :binary:`~bin.mongo` also provides
a fully functional JavaScript environment for use with a MongoDB. This
document addresses the basic invocation of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
and an overview of its usage.

Synopsis
--------

.. describe:: mongo [--shell] [--nodb] [--norc] [--quiet] [--port <port>] [--host <host>] [--eval <JavaScript>] [-u <username>] [--username <username>] [-p <password>] [--password <password>] [--help] [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--ipv6] [database] [file.js]

Interface
---------

.. _mongo-shell-options:

Options
~~~~~~~

.. program:: mongo

.. option:: --shell

   Enables the shell interface after evaluating a :term:`JavaScript` file.
   If you invoke the :binary:`~bin.mongo` command and specify a JavaScript
   file as an argument, or use :option:`--eval` to specify
   JavaScript on the command line, the :option:`--shell` option
   provides the user with a shell prompt after the file finishes
   executing.

.. option:: --nodb

   Prevents the shell from connecting to any database instances. Later,
   to connect to a database within the shell, see
   :ref:`mongo-shell-new-connections`.

.. option:: --norc

   Prevents the shell from sourcing and evaluating
   :file:`~/.mongorc.js` on start up.

.. option:: --quiet

   Silences output from the shell during the connection process.

.. option:: --port <port>

   Specifies the port where the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance is listening. Unless specified :binary:`~bin.mongo` connects
   to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances on port ``27017``, which is the default
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` port.

.. option:: --host <hostname>

   specifies the host where the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` is running to
   connect to as ``<hostname>``. By default :binary:`~bin.mongo` will attempt
   to connect to a MongoDB process running on the localhost.

.. option:: --eval <javascript>

   Evaluates a JavaScript expression specified as an argument to this
   option. :binary:`~bin.mongo` does not load its own environment when evaluating
   code: as a result many options of the shell environment are not
   available.

.. option:: --username <username>, -u <username>

   Specifies a username to authenticate to the MongoDB instance.
   Use in conjunction with the
   :option:`--password` option to supply a password.
   If you specify a username and password but the default database
   or the specified database do not require authentication,
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` will exit with an exception.

.. option:: --password <password>, -p <password>

   Specifies a password to authenticate to the MongoDB instance.
   Use in conjunction with the
   :option:`--username` option to supply a username. If you
   specify a :option:`--username` without the
   :option:`--password` option, :binary:`~bin.mongo` will prompt for a
   password interactively, if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` requires authentication.

.. option:: --help,  -h

   Returns a basic help and usage text.

.. option:: --version

   Returns the version of the shell.

.. option:: --verbose

   Increases the verbosity of the output of the shell during the
   connection process.

.. option:: --ipv6

   Enables IPv6 support that allows :binary:`~bin.mongo` to connect
   to the MongoDB instance using an IPv6 network. All MongoDB programs
   and processes, including :binary:`~bin.mongo`, disable IPv6
   support by default.

.. option:: <db address>

   Specifies the "database address" of the database to connect to. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo admin

   The above command will connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
   :term:`admin database` on the local machine. You may specify a
   remote database instance, with the resolvable hostname or IP
   address. Separate the database name from the hostname using a
   ``/`` character. See the following examples:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo mongodb1.example.net
      mongo mongodb1/admin
      mongo 10.8.8.10/test

.. _mongo-shell-file:
.. option:: <file.js>

   Specifies a JavaScript file to run and then exit.
   Must be the last option specified.
   Use the
   :option:`--shell` option to return to a shell after the file
   finishes running.

Files
~~~~~

.. _mongo-dbshell-file:

:file:`~/.dbshell`

   :binary:`~bin.mongo` maintains a history of commands in the :file:`.dbshell`
   file.

   .. note::

      :binary:`~bin.mongo` does not recorded interaction related to
      authentication in the history file, including
      :dbcommand:`authenticate` and :method:`db.addUser()`.

   .. warning::

      Versions of Windows :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe` earlier than 2.2.0 will
      save the `.dbshell` file in the :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe` working
      directory.

.. _mongo-mongorc-file:

:file:`~/.mongorc.js`

   :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the ``.mongorc.js`` file from the home
   directory of the user invoking :binary:`~bin.mongo`. In the file, users
   can define variables, customize the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell prompt,
   or update information that they would like updated every time they
   launch a shell. If you use the shell to evaluate a JavaScript file
   or expression either on the command line with :option:`--eval` or
   by specifying :ref:`a .js file to mongo <mongo-shell-file>`,
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the ``.mongorc.js`` file *after* the
   JavaScript has finished processing.

   Specify the :option:`--norc` option to disable
   reading ``.mongorc.js``.

:file:`/tmp/mongo_edit{<time_t>}.js`

   Created by :binary:`~bin.mongo` when editing a file.  If the file
   exists :binary:`~bin.mongo` will append an integer from ``1`` to ``10`` to the
   time value to attempt to create a unique file.

:file:`%TEMP%\mongo_edit{<time_t>}.js`

   Created by :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe` on Windows when editing a file.
   If the file
   exists :binary:`~bin.mongo` will append an integer from ``1`` to ``10`` to
   the time value to attempt to create a unique file.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. envvar:: EDITOR

   Specifies the path to an editor to use with the ``edit`` shell
   command.  A JavaScript variable ``EDITOR`` will override the value of
   :envvar:`EDITOR`.

.. envvar:: HOME

   Specifies the path to the home directory where :binary:`~bin.mongo` will
   read the :file:`.mongorc.js` file and write the :file:`.dbshell`
   file.

.. envvar:: HOMEDRIVE

   On Windows systems, :envvar:`HOMEDRIVE` specifies the path the
   directory where :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the :file:`.mongorc.js`
   file and write the :file:`.dbshell` file.

.. envvar:: HOMEPATH

   Specifies the Windows path to the home directory where
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the :file:`.mongorc.js` file and write
   the :file:`.dbshell` file.

.. [#multiple-bindings] MongoDB accommodates multiple keybinding.
   Since 2.0, :binary:`~bin.mongo` includes support for basic emacs
   keybindings.

.. _mongo-usage-examples:

Use
---

Typically users invoke the shell with the :binary:`~bin.mongo` command at
the system prompt. Consider the following examples for other
scenarios.

To connect to a database on a remote host using authentication and a
non-standard port, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --username <user> --password <pass> --host <host> --port 28015

Alternatively, consider the following short form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo -u <user> -p <pass> --host <host> --port 28015

Replace ``<user>``, ``<pass>``, and ``<host>`` with the appropriate
values for your situation and substitute or omit the :option:`--port`
as needed.

To execute a JavaScript file without evaluating the :file:`~/.mongorc.js`
file before starting a shell session, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --shell --norc alternate-environment.js

To print return a query as :term:`JSON`, from the system prompt using
the :option:`--eval <mongo --eval>` option, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --eval 'db.collection.find().forEach(printjson)'

Use single quotes (e.g. ``'``) to enclose the JavaScript, as well as
the additional JavaScript required to generate this output.
