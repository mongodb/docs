|ak8so| supports private endpoints to connect to 
{+dedicated-clusters+} and {+fdi+}s.

When you use |ak8so| to configure private links in |service|, |service| 
creates its own |vpc| or a Private Link service and places 
{+dedicated-clusters+} within a region 
behind a load balancer in the |service| |vpc| or |service| VNet. To 
learn more, see the :ref:`Private Endpoint Overview 
<private-endpoint-overview>`.

To manage your private endpoints with |ak8so|, you can specify and 
update one of the following parameters:

- For {+dedicated-clusters+}, specify the 
  :setting:`spec.privateEndpoints` parameter for the 
  :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`.

- For {+fdi+}s, specify the 
  :ref:`spec.privateEndpoints <fdi-setting-spec.privateEndpoints>`
  parameter for the :ref:`atlasdatafederation-custom-resource`.

Each time you change the ``spec`` field in any of the supported custom 
resources, |ak8so| :ref:`creates or updates 
<ak8so-create-update-process>` the corresponding |service| 
configuration.

Certain considerations and limitations apply to private endpoints. To 
learn more, see :ref:`private-endpoint`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable connections with |ak8so| to |service| using private 
endpoints, you must:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
      :tabid: clusters

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
            :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

            - Have a running |k8s| cluster with |ak8so| :ref:`deployed 
              <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.

            .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-prereq-aws.rst

         .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
            :tabid: {+az-pl+}
       
            - Have running |k8s| cluster with |ak8so| :ref:`deployed 
              <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
              
            .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-prereq-azure.rst

         .. tab:: {+gcp-psc+}
            :tabid: {+gcp-psc+}

            - Have a running |k8s| cluster with |ak8so| :ref:`deployed 
              <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
     
            - Have the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
              :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

            - Have a |gcp| user account with an |iam| user policy and 
              a :gcp:`Compute Network Admin
              </iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.networkAdmin>`
              role that grants permissions to create, modify, and 
              delete networking resources. To learn more about 
              managing private endpoints and connections, see the 
              :gcp:`Google Cloud documentation 
              </vpc/docs/overview.html>`.

            - Install :gcp:`the gcloud CLI </sdk/docs/install>`.

            - If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and 
              Compute instances in |gcp|. To learn more, see the 
              :gcp:`GCP documentation </vpc/docs/using-vpc.html>`.

            - Ensure egress firewall rules permit traffic to the 
              internal IP address of the {+gcp-psc+} endpoint.
         
            - (Optional) If you enforce a security perimeter with 
              |vpc| service controls (VPC-SC), you must create ingress 
              and egress rules to establish the connection between the 
              {+gcp-psc+} endpoint and |service| {+clusters+}. To 
              learn more, see the :gcp:`GCP documentation </vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#vpc-sc>`.
