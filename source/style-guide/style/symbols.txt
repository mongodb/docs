Symbols are used in code, as punctuation, with numbers, and to indicate
trademarks. Use the following general guidelines when you include
symbols in your documentation.

For guidelines about using specific marks of punctuation, see
:ref:`punctuation`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example
   * - When referring explicitly to a symbol in text, don't show only
       the symbol. Show the name of the symbol, or the name followed by
       the symbol in parentheses.

       On subsequent uses of the symbol, you can use just the name.

       If the symbol is a common mark of punctuation, like a period or
       a comma, don't show the mark in parentheses.
     - Escape the line by typing a backslash (\\) character.

       To find files that were modified more than two days ago, type a
       plus sign (+) in front of the 2.

       Type a comma.
   * - Use a symbol *instead of* the name of the symbol only if space
       is limited (for example, in a table). Don't use symbols in
       running text.
     - *Body text:*

       45 percent

       16 degrees

       1,800 dollars

       *Limited space:*

       45%

       16º

       $1,800
   * - Don't insert a space between a number and a symbol, except when
       the symbol is used as a mathematical operator.
     - For files that use a total of 1,500 KB and a record size of 256,
       the equation is as follows: ``1,500,000 ÷ 256 = 5,860``
   * - To separate the options in a menu path, use right-angle brackets
       (>) surrounded by spaces.
     - Open Mac Mail and select **Preferences > Accounts**.
