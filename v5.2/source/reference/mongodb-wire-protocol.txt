Introduction
------------

The MongoDB Wire Protocol is a simple socket-based, request-response
style protocol. Clients communicate with the database server through a
regular TCP/IP socket.

TCP/IP Socket
-------------

Clients should connect to the database with a regular TCP/IP socket.

Port
~~~~

The default port number for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances is 27017. The port number for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` is configurable and may vary.

Byte Ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All integers in the MongoDB wire protocol use little-endian byte order:
that is, least-significant byte first.

Messages Types and Formats
--------------------------

MongoDB uses the :ref:`OP_MSG <wire-op-msg>` opcode for both client
requests and database replies. There are several message formats used in
older versions of MongoDB which have been deprecated in favor of
``OP_MSG``.

.. note::

   This page uses a C-like ``struct`` to describe the message
   structure.

   The types used in this document (for example, ``int32``) are the same
   as those defined in the `BSON specification
   <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_.

.. _wp-message-header:

Standard Message Header
-----------------------

In general, each message consists of a standard message header followed
by request-specific data. The standard message header is structured as
follows:

.. code-block:: c

   struct MsgHeader {
       int32   messageLength; // total message size, including this
       int32   requestID;     // identifier for this message
       int32   responseTo;    // requestID from the original request
                              //   (used in responses from the database)
       int32   opCode;        // message type
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``messageLength``

     - The total size of the message in bytes. This total includes the
       4 bytes that holds the message length.

   * - ``requestID``

     - A client or database-generated identifier that uniquely
       identifies the message.

   * - ``responseTo``

     - The ``requestID`` taken from the messages from the client.

   * - ``opCode``

     - Type of message. See :ref:`wp-request-opcodes` for details.

.. _wp-request-opcodes:

Opcodes

MongoDB uses these ``opCode`` values:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 10 65

.. _wire-op-compressed:

``OP_COMPRESSED``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: MongoDB 3.4

Any opcode can be compressed and wrapped in an ``OP_COMPRESSED`` header.
The ``OP_COMPRESSED`` message contains the original compressed opcode
message alongside the metadata necessary to process and decompress it.

The format of the ``OP_COMPRESSED`` message is:

.. code-block:: bash

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;            // standard message header
       int32  originalOpcode;       // value of wrapped opcode
       int32  uncompressedSize;     // size of deflated compressedMessage, excluding MsgHeader
       uint8  compressorId;         // ID of compressor that compressed message
       char    *compressedMessage;  // opcode itself, excluding MsgHeader
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``MsgHeader``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``originalOpcode``

     - Contains the value of the wrapped opcode.

   * - ``uncompressedSize``

     - The size of the deflated ``compressedMessage``, which excludes
       the ``MsgHeader``.

   * - ``compressorId``

     - The ID of the compressor that compressed the message. A list of
       ``compressorId`` values is provided below.

   * - ``compressedMessage``

     - The opcode itself, excluding the ``MsgHeader``.

Each compressor is assigned a predefined compressor ID as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 25 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - compressorId
     - Handshake Value
     - Description

   * - ``0``

     - noop

     - The content of the message is uncompressed. This is used for
       testing.

   * - ``1``

     - snappy

     - The content of the message is compressed using snappy.

   * - ``2``

     - zlib

     - The content of the message is compressed using zlib.

   * - ``3``

     - zstd

     - The content of the message is compressed using zstd.

   * - ``4-255``

     - reserved

     - Reserved for future use.

.. _wire-op-msg:

``OP_MSG``
~~~~~~~~~~

``OP_MSG`` is an extensible message format used to encode both client
requests and server replies on the wire.

``OP_MSG`` has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   OP_MSG {
       MsgHeader header;           // standard message header
       uint32 flagBits;            // message flags
       Sections[] sections;        // data sections
       optional<uint32> checksum;  // optional CRC-32C checksum
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``
     - Standard message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``flagBits``
     - An integer bitmask containing message flags, as described in
       :ref:`wire-msg-flags`.

   * - ``sections``
     - Message body sections, as described in :ref:`wire-msg-sections`.

   * - ``checksum``
     - An optional CRC-32C checksum, as described in
       :ref:`wire-msg-checksum`.

.. _wire-msg-flags:

Flag Bits
`````````

The ``flagBits`` integer is a bitmask encoding flags that modify the
format and behavior of ``OP_MSG``.

The first 16 bits (0-15) are *required* and parsers **MUST**
error if an unknown bit is set.

The last 16 bits (16-31) are *optional*, and parsers **MUST**
ignore any unknown set bits. Proxies and other message forwarders
**MUST** clear any unknown optional bits before forwarding messages.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 10 10 60

   * - Bit
     - Name
     - Request
     - Response
     - Description

   * - 0
     - ``checksumPresent``
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - The message ends with 4 bytes containing a CRC-32C [#f1]_
       checksum. See :ref:`wire-msg-checksum` for details.

   * - 1
     - ``moreToCome``
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - Another message will follow this one without further action from
       the receiver. The receiver **MUST NOT** send another message until
       receiving one with ``moreToCome`` set to 0 as sends may block,
       causing deadlock. Requests with the ``moreToCome``
       bit set will not receive a reply. Replies will only have this
       set in response to requests with the ``exhaustAllowed`` bit set.

   * - 16
     - ``exhaustAllowed``
     - |checkmark|
     -
     - The client is prepared for multiple replies to this request using
       the ``moreToCome`` bit. The server will never produce replies with
       the ``moreToCome`` bit set unless the request has this bit set.

       This ensures that multiple replies are only sent when the network
       layer of the requester is prepared for them.

.. _wire-msg-sections:

Sections
````````

An ``OP_MSG`` message contains one or more sections. Each section starts
with a ``kind`` byte indicating its type. Everything after the ``kind``
byte constitutes the section's payload.

The available kinds of sections follow.

Kind 0: Body
````````````

A body section is encoded as a **single** :ref:`BSON object <bson-types>`.
The size in the BSON object also serves as the size of the section. This
section kind is the standard command request and reply body.

All top-level fields **MUST** have a unique name.

Kind 1: Document Sequence
`````````````````````````

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Type
     - Description

   * - int32
     - Size of the section in bytes.

   * - C String
     - Document sequence identifier. In all current commands this field
       is the (possibly nested) field that it is replacing from the body
       section.

       This field **MUST NOT** also exist in the body section.

   * - Zero or more BSON objects
     - - Objects are sequenced back to back with no separators.

       - Each object is limited to the ``maxBSONObjectSize`` of the
         server. The combination of all objects is not limited to
         ``maxBSONObjSize``.

       - The document sequence ends once ``size`` bytes have been consumed.

       - Parsers **MAY** choose to merge these objects into the body as
         an array at the path specified by the sequence identifier when
         converting to language-level objects.

Kind 2
``````

This section is used for internal purposes.


.. _wire-msg-checksum:

Checksum
````````

Each message **MAY** end with a CRC-32C [#f1]_ checksum that covers all
bytes in the message except for the checksum itself.

Starting in MongoDB 4.2:

- :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell instances will exchange messages with
  checksums *if not* using TLS/SSL connection.

- :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell instances will skip the checksum if using
  TLS/SSL connection.
   
Drivers and older binaries will ignore the checksum if presented with
messages with checksum.

The presence of a checksum is indicated by the ``checksumPresent`` flag
bit.

Legacy Opcodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, these opcodes are removed in favor of
:ref:`OP_MSG <wire-op-msg>`:

- ``OP_DELETE``
- ``OP_GET_MORE``
- ``OP_INSERT``
- ``OP_KILL_CURSORS``
- ``OP_QUERY`` [#op-query-footnote]_
- ``OP_REPLY``
- ``OP_UPDATE``

If you are running an older version of MongoDB and need detailed
information on the previous opcodes, see :ref:`wire-legacy-opcodes`.

Opcode Considerations
---------------------

In version 4.2, MongoDB removes the deprecated internal ``OP_COMMAND``
and ``OP_COMMANDREPLY`` protocol.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#op-query-footnote] 

    MongoDB 5.1 removes support for both ``OP_QUERY`` find operations
    and ``OP_QUERY`` commands. As an exception, ``OP_QUERY`` is still
    supported for running the :dbcommand:`hello` and ``isMaster``
    commands as part of the connection handshake.

.. [#f1] 32-bit :abbr:`CRC (cyclic redundancy check)` computed with the Castagnoli polynomial as
   described by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4960#page-140.
