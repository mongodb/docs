You can pause, resume, or terminate your {+clusters+}. For
{+serverless-instances+}, see :doc:`Terminate a Serverless Instance
</terminate-serverless-instance>`.

Considerations for Paused Clusters
----------------------------------

- You can't:

  - Modify the configuration of a paused cluster.
  - Read data from or write data to a paused cluster.

- For paused clusters, |service|:

  - Doesn't trigger configured alerts.
  - Stops all backups. Your existing snapshots remain until they
    expire.   

.. _pause-cluster:

Pause One Cluster
-----------------

.. include:: /includes/serverless-preview-dont-use.rst

Depending on your cluster tier, |service| either pauses clusters
automatically or when you initiate. 

To pause a cluster with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see 
:ref:`modify-one-cluster-ref`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: M10+
      :tabid: m10+

      You can pause ``M10`` or larger clusters:

      - If they do not use :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`. 
      - For up to 30 days. If you don't resume the cluster within 30 
        days, |service| resumes the cluster.
      
      |service| only charges paused clusters for storage. |service| does
      not charge for any other services or data transfer on paused
      clusters.

      To pause |a-service| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/pause-cluster.rst     

   .. tab:: M0
      :tabid: m0

      |service| automatically pauses ``M0`` clusters after 60 days of
      inactivity where the cluster experiences zero connections.
      |service| sends an email seven days before pausing the cluster.
      |service| sends another email after pausing the cluster.
      
      You can :ref:`resume <resume-cluster>` or :ref:`terminate
      <terminate-cluster>` an automatically paused
      cluster at any time. You can't initiate a pause for ``M0``
      clusters. 
      
.. _resume-cluster:

Resume One Cluster
------------------

.. include:: /includes/serverless-preview-dont-use.rst

To resume a paused |service| ``M0`` cluster, connect to that cluster
using the {+atlas-admin-api+}, a :doc:`Driver </driver-connection>`,
{+mongosh+}, or :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`.

To resume a paused |service| ``M10+`` cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/resume-cluster.rst

.. note::

   If you don't resume an ``M10+`` cluster within 30 days, |service|
   resumes the cluster.

.. _terminate-cluster:

Terminate One Cluster
---------------------

To terminate |a-service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the cluster after completing any in-progress
deployment changes.

|service| bills for the hours that the cluster was active. To learn
more about |service| billing, see :doc:`/billing`.

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

.. note:: Public IP Address Retention

   When you terminate a cluster with a lifetime of 12 hours or more, 
   |service| reserves the cluster's public |ipaddr| address, bound to 
   its original cluster name.

   The following time frames apply from the moment the user terminates 
   the cluster:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 10 30
   
      * - Cluster Lifetime
        - IP Address Retention
  
      * - Less than 12 hours
        - Not retained

      * - 12 to 35 hours
        - 12 to 35 hours (equal to the cluster lifetime)
   
      * - 36 hours or more
        - 36 hours
    
   If, in the applicable time frame, you create a new 
   cluster with the same name, |service| reassigns the reserved public 
   |ipaddr| address to that cluster.

   Cluster |ipaddr| addresses don't change when clusters are paused
   then resumed.
