Overview
--------

|charts-short| on |service| is metered based on the volume of data
transferred from the |charts-short| web server to web browser clients.
MongoDB provides each |charts-short| instance with a free ``1 GB`` of
data transfers per month. You can view your |charts-short| instance's
monthly data usage in the :ref:`Data Transfer <admin-usage>` page.

The free usage tier provides approximately 500,000 chart
renders over a month. However, this number may vary based on the types
of charts being rendered. A number chart or a bar chart with few bars
typically consumes less data, while a scatter chart with many
data points or a large table could consume more.

Once the ``1 GB`` of free data usage has been consumed, MongoDB bills
Charts data transfers at a fixed rate of **$1.00 per GB**.

In addition, any applicable |service| data transfer fees apply, as per
the :guilabel:`Data Transfer Fees` section of the
`Atlas Pricing <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing>`__ page.
|charts-short| is hosted on |aws| ``us-east-1`` region, and
uses this region to calculate the fees.

Sample Pricing Scenarios
------------------------

The following examples show the expected monthly charge for different
usage scenarios. Consider:

1. A |charts-short| instance with 5 users, each of whom refreshes a 
   10-chart :ref:`dashboard <dashboards>` once an hour during business
   hours. This results in about 8,000 renders over
   the month, and easily falls within the ``1 GB`` free tier.

   |

2. A dashboard on a large-screen display with 20 charts set to refresh
   every 5 minutes, all 24 hours of the day. This results in about
   300,000 renders over the month. Assuming these charts are not
   abnormally large, this scenario also falls entirely within the
   ``1 GB`` free tier.

   |

3. A *large* chart embedded on a web page that receives 10,000 views
   per day, resulting in 300,000 renders over the month. This chart
   takes roughly five times as much data to render compared to a
   typical chart, and consumes ``3 GB`` of data over the month.

   The first ``1 GB`` is free, and the remaining ``2 GB`` is billed at
   $1.00 per GB, resulting in a total cost of $2.00 for the month.
