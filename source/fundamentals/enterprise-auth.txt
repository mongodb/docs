Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate to MongoDB using the
authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Enterprise
Edition. When you connect to MongoDB, you can use an authentication
mechanism to establish trust between the driver and the server.

The {+driver-short+} supports authenticating to a Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server by using the
:ref:`LDAP (PLAIN) <rust-LDAP>` enterprise authentication mechanism.

.. note:: GSSAPI/Kerberos Authentication
   
   The driver does not support the GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication
   mechanism, but you can use other methods to authenticate this way. To
   learn more about these methods, see :manual:`Kerberos Authentication
   </core/kerberos/>` in the Server manual.

.. seealso::

   To authenticate to MongoDB by using mechanisms available in
   the MongoDB Community Edition, see the guide on :ref:`<rust-authentication>`.

   To learn more about connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see the
   :ref:`rust-connect-to-mongodb`.

To select a specific authentication mechanism, specify the
mechanism, your credentials, and other necessary information
in the options of your connection string or in a ``Credential`` struct.

.. _rust-LDAP:

Authenticate to LDAP (PLAIN)
----------------------------

You can authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server 
by using your directory server username and password.

The name of the authentication mechanism is ``PLAIN`` instead of LDAP
because the mechanism uses the PLAIN Simple Authentication and
Security Layer (SASL) defined in `RFC-4616
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4616>`__.

.. warning::

   This authentication mechanism sends your password to the server in
   plaintext. Use this mechanism only after enabling TLS
   on your connection to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities in
   your application.
   
   To learn more, see :manual:`TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption)
   </core/security-transport-encryption/>` in the Server manual.

Example
~~~~~~~

To specify the ``PLAIN`` authentication mechanism, set the
``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``AuthMechanism::Plain``. This example specifies the
authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: Your LDAP username
- ``password``: Your LDAP password

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/enterprise-auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-ldap
   :end-before: end-ldap

.. note:: Authentication Database

   Because your credentials are stored outside of MongoDB, you must use the
   ``$external`` database for authentication. The ``source`` field of
   the ``Credential`` struct defaults to ``$external``, so you do
   not need to explicitly set this field.

Alternatively, you can authenticate by using a connection string URI by
setting the value of the ``authMechanism`` connection string option to ``PLAIN``.
This example shows how to specify the ``PLAIN`` authentication mechanism in
a connection string URI by using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: Your LDAP username
- ``password``: Your LDAP password
- ``hostname``: The network address of your MongoDB server

.. code-block:: rust
   
   let uri = "mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/?authSource=$external&authMechanism=PLAIN";
