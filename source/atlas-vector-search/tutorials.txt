You can learn how to leverage {+avs+} with our use-case
tutorials.

Prerequisites 
-------------

.. |query-type| replace:: {+avs+}
.. |search-stage| replace:: :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
.. |tutorial| replace:: These tutorials

To complete these tutorials, you must have the following: 

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version v6.0.11, or v7.0.2 or later. 

- The :doc:`sample data </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  cluster.
  
- One of the following clients to run queries on your |service|
  {+cluster+}:

  - :ref:`Search Tester <atlas-search-query-ui>`
  - {+mongosh+}
  - {+Compass+}
  - :driver:`C# </csharp/current/>`
  - :driver:`Java </java-drivers/>`
  - :driver:`MongoDB Node Driver </node/current/>`
  - :driver:`PyMongo </pymongo/>`

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-search-queries-drivers.rst

   You can also complete these tutorials with local |service|
   deployments that you create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more,
   see :atlascli:`Create a Local Atlas Deployment
   </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

About the Tutorials 
-------------------

- The :ref:`vector-search-tutorial` tutorial describes how to index and
  perform an |ann| search on vector embeddings in the
  ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection. 

- The :ref:`avs-reciprocal-rank-fusion` tutorial describes how to perform
  a semantic search against the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
  collection and combine the results with |fts| full-text search results
  by using reciprocal rank fusion.

- The :ref:`local-rag` tutorial describes how to generate
  embeddings for {+avs+} and implement |rag|
  by using local embedding and generative models, without
  the need for |api| keys.
