=================================
Install MongoDB on Linux on Azure
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In this tutorial, you will learn to deploy a MongoDB replica set to
CentOS VMs on `Windows Azure <http://www.windowsazure.com/>`_ and access
it from outside Azure. The following are the tasks to achieve this:

1. Sign up for "Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks" preview feature.
   See :ref:`azure-sign-up`.

#. :ref:`azure-linux-set-up-affinity-group`

#. :ref:`azure-linux-create-vms`

#. :ref:`azure-linux-run-mongodb`

#. :ref:`azure-linux-configure-replica-set`

.. _azure-linux-set-up-affinity-group:

Set Up Affinity Group
---------------------

The affinity group needs to be set up from the old portal.

1. If in the new Azure Management preview portal, click your user name
   in the top right of the screen, then "Previous Portal" to switch to
   the old portal.

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-old-portal.png

#. Once in the old portal, click "Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN"

#. Select "Affinity Groups" and then "New Affinity Group"

#. In the “Create a New Affinity Group” dialog, enter an affinity group
   name such as “mongoaffinitygroup” and choose a location. Choose one
   of the newer Azure data centers such as “West US,” “East US” or “West
   Europe.”

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-e.png

.. _azure-linux-create-vms:

Create and Set Up the Virtual Machines
--------------------------------------

To create a 3-node MongoDB replica set you will be creating 3 VM
instances. For this step, log in to the new preview portal, or from the
old portal, click "Visit the Previous Portal" at the bottom of the page

Create Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instance 1
``````````

1. In the portal, click New->Virtual Machine->From Gallery

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-f.png

#. On the VM OS Selection page, choose "OpenLogic CentOS 6.2" and click the
   next arrow to continue

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-g.png

#. On the VM Configuration page, specify values for the parameters

   - Virtual Machine Name - "mongodbrs1"

   - New User Name – "mongouser." This user will be added to the
     "sudoers" list file

   - New Password box – type a strong password that conforms to the
     Azure specifications

   - Retype the password to confirm

   - Size – Choose appropriate size from drop down list. For anything
     but small test instances, choose a size larger than Medium

   - Leave "Upload SSH key for Authentication" unchecked

   Click the next arrow to continue

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-h.png

#. On the VM Mode page, specify values for the required parameters

   - Select "Standalone Virtual Machine"

   - DNS – a valid DNS prefix e.g., "mongodbrs"

   - Storage Account box – choose "Use Automatically Generated Storage Account"

   - In the "Region/Affinity Group/Virtual Network" box, select the affinity
     group created previously “mongoaffinitygroup”

   Click next arrow to continue

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-i.png

#. On the VM Options page select "None for Availability Set"

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-j.png

#. Click the check mark to create the VM instance

Instance 2
``````````

A similar process to creating instance 1.

1. In the portal, click New->Virtual Machine->From Gallery

#. On the VM OS Selection page, choose "OpenLogic CentOS 6.2" and click the
   next arrow to continue

#. On the VM Configuration page, specify values for the parameters

   - Virtual Machine Name - "mongodbrs2"

   - New User Name – "mongouser." This user will be added to the "sudoers"
     list file

   - New Password box – type a strong password that conforms to the Azure
     specifications

   - Retype the password to confirm

   - Size – Choose the same size as instance 1

   - Leave "Upload SSH key for Authentication" unchecked

   Click the next arrow to continue

#. On the VM Mode page, specify values for the required parameters

   - Select "Connect to Existing Virtual Machine"

   - In the dropdown choose the host created in instance 1, in this case
     "mongodbrs1"

   - Storage Account box – choose "Use Automatically Generated Storage
     Account"

   - The "Region/Affinity Group/Virtual Network" box should be automatically
     set to “mongoaffinitygroup”

   Click next arrow to continue

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-k.png

#. On the VM Options page select "None for Availability Set"

#. Click the check mark to create the VM instance

Instance 3
``````````

A similar process for creating instance 2. Choose "mongodbrs3" to be the
Virtual Machine Name in step 3.

Configure Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the virtual machines are connected you need to configure the
endpoints to:

- Allow remote connection

- Allow MongoDB traffic

Instance 1
``````````

1. In the management portal, click virtual machines and click the name of
   instance 1, "mongodbrs1"

#. Now click on endpoints

#. The ssh endpoint should be automatically created. For this endpoint
   ensure the following are set

   - Protocol – tcp

   - Public Port – 22

   - Private Port – 22

   - Load Balanced – No

#. Create a new endpoint for MongoDB by clicking on "Add Endpoint" at the
   bottom of the screen

#. Ensure "Add endpoint" is selected and click the right arrow to go to the
   next screen

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-l.png

#. Specify the endpoint details as below:

   - Name : MongoDB-Port

   - Protocol : TCP

   - Public Port : 27018

   - Private Port : 27018

   - Click on check mark to create endpoint

     .. image:: /images/azure-linux-m.png

     The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

     .. image:: /images/azure-linux-o.png

Instance 2
``````````

We need to configure the endpoints for instance 2 similar to instance 1:

1. In the management portal, click "virtual machines" and click the name of
   instance 2

#. Now click on "endpoints"

#. The ssh endpoint should be automatically created. Ensure that:

   - Name – SSH

   - Protocol – TCP

   - Private Port – 22

   - Load Balanced – No

#. Now click on Edit Endpoint at the bottom of the screen and set "Public
   Port" to 23. Click on the "check mark" to update

#. Create a new endpoint for MongoDB by clicking on "Add Endpoint" at the
   bottom of the screen

#. Ensure "Add Endpoint" is selected and click the right arrow to go to the
   next screen

#. Specify the endpoint details as below:

   - Name : MongoDB-Port

   - Protocol : TCP

   - Public Port : 27019

   - Private Port : 27019

   - Click on check mark to create endpoint

   The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-n.png

Instance 3
``````````

Create endpoints for instance 3 similar to instance 2 with the following
changes:

- In step 4, set public port to 24

- In step 7, set public and private ports to be 27020

The instance now should have 2 endpoints, 1 for SSH and 1 for MongoDB

.. image:: /images/azure-linux-rs3-ports.png

Update OS
~~~~~~~~~

Use this optional step to update the operating system on each of your VM
instances. Once the machine endpoints have been configured above, you
need to log into the machines to update them. More information on this
can be found at
`How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Linux <https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/linux/how-to-guides/log-on-a-linux-vm/>`_.

Use the username and password you used when creating the virtual machine
instances.

Once you are connected to the machine, update the operating system by
running: sudo yum update and following the prompts. This could take some
time.

When connecting to instances 2 and 3, remember to use ports 23 and
24 and not the default ssh port of 22.

.. image:: /images/azure-linux-p.png

Set up Disks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the instances are updated, you can then attach a data disk to each
of the instances. The data disks will be storing the actual MongoDB data
as part of ``--dbpath``. More information on Azure data disks can be found
at `Data Disk Concepts <http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/windows/how-to-guides/attach-a-disk/#concepts/>`_.

To set up the data disk follow the steps outlined below for each of the
instances you created:

1. Attach an empty disk of at least 10 GB to the instance as described in
   `How to: Attach an empty disk <http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/windows/how-to-guides/attach-a-disk/#attachempty>`.

2. Initialize the data disk by following the steps described at
   `How to: Initialize a new data disk in Linux <http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/windows/how-to-guides/attach-a-disk/#initializeinlinux/>`_.

3. Also once mounted, create a data directory by:

   a. Log on onto the instance

   #. Then run ``sudo chown `id -u` /mnt/datadrive/`` to make the ``mongouser`` the
      owner of the data directory

   #. Run the following command: ``mkdir -p /mnt/datadrive/data``

.. _azure-linux-run-mongodb:

Install and Run MongoDB
-----------------------

As part of this step, you will be using the official 10gen-supplied
packages to install, configure and run MongoDB as a service using YUM.
You want to install as a service since this would ensure that
:program:`manual:mongod` is started on machine restart also. For more information see
:manual: `Install MongoDB on RedHat Enterprise, CentOS, or Fedora </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-redhat-centos-or-fedora-linux/>`.

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repeat the following steps on each instance:

1. Log onto the instance

#. Create an ``/etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo`` file to hold information about your
   repository using your favorite editor as sudo. Place the following
   configuration in ``/etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo`` file:

   .. code-block:: sh

      [10gen]
      name=10gen Repository
      baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64
      gpgcheck=0
      enabled=1

#. After saving the new .repo file, issue the following command to update
   the local package database: ``sudo yum update``

#. Issue the following command (as root or with sudo) to install the latest
   stable version of MongoDB and the associated tools:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-q.png

#. When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB.

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-r.png

Configure MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The packages installed in the previous step configure MongoDB using the
``/etc/mongod.conf`` file in conjunction with the control script. You can
find the init script at ``/etc/rc.d/init.d/mongod``. As part of this step
you will edit the ``mongod.conf`` file to set the appropriate parameters. If
the parameters are commented, make sure to uncomment them.

Instance 1
``````````

1. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY

#. As sudo, edit ``/etc/mongod.conf`` to set the following parameters:

   .. code-block:: sh

      port = 27018
      dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
      logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
      replSet = mongors

#. Save the config file

Instance 2
``````````

1. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY, remembering the SSH port for
   this node has been changed from the default of 22

#. As sudo, edit ``/etc/mongod.conf`` to set the following parameter:

   .. code-block:: sh

      port = 27019
      dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
      logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
      replSet = mongors

#. Save the config file

Instance 3
``````````

1. Connect to the instance using ssh or PuTTY, remembering the SSH port for
   this node has been changed from the default of 22

#. As sudo, edit ``/etc/mongod.conf`` to set the following parameter:

   .. code-block:: sh

      port = 27020
      dbpath = /mnt/datadrive/data
      logpath = /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log
      replSet = mongors

#. Save the config file

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the configuration files have been edited, start the database
process :program:`manual:mongod` on each instance by:

1. Log on onto the instance

#. Run the following command to start the process:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

   This should start the :program:`manual:mongod` process

#. Verify that :program:`manual:mongod` start by tailing the log file using the command

   .. code-block:: sh

      tail --f /mnt/datadrive/mongod.log

#. The "waiting for connections" message in the log file indicates :program:`manual:mongod`
   is up and running and waiting for client connections. This may take a
   while as :program:`manual:mongod` preallocates its journal files

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-s.png

.. _azure-linux-configure-replica-set:

Configure the Replica Set
-------------------------

At this point in time, you should have :program:`manual:mongod` running on all 3 of your
instances. You can now configure the 3 instances as a replica set by
connecting to 1 of the 3 instances from within Azure or from outside.

Connect to the running :program:`manual:mongod` process using the :program:`manual:mongo` shell:

1. If connected to the VM instance type the following command where ``port`` is
   ``27018`` for instance 1, ``27019`` for instance 2 and ``27020`` for instance 3:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --port <port number>

#. If connecting to the :program:`manual:mongod` process in Azure from your local machine use
   the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host mongodbrs.cloudapp.net --port <port number>

#. In the :program:`manual:mongo` shell type the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      > conf = {
         _id = “mongors”,
         members : [
           {_id:0, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27018},
           {_id:1, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27019},
           {_id:2, host:”mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27020}]}
      > rs.initiate(conf)

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-t.png

#. This will start the initialization of the MongoDB replica set

#. Type the command ``rs.status()`` to check the status of the replica set.
   Upon successful initialization, you should see 1 of the 3 instances
   being the "Primary" of the set and the other 2 being the "Secondaries"

   .. image:: /images/azure-linux-u.png

You have now successfully initiated the replica set

Summary
-------

In this tutorial you have learned how to create a set of CentOS virtual
machines on Windows Azure, deploy MongoDB to them and create a replica
set out of them. You can access this set from anywhere using the
connection string

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://mongodbrs.cloudapp.net:27018, .cloudapp.net:27019, .cloudapp.net:27020/?replicaSet=mongors"
