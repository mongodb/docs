.. important:: You Can't Disable a {+bcp+}

   After you enable a {+bcp+}, you can't disable it without MongoDB 
   support. To disable a {+bcp+}, the security or legal representative 
   specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
   <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification process. 
   Before you enable a {+bcp+}, carefully review the 
   :ref:`prohibited actions <bcp-prohibited-actions>` and 
   :ref:`considerations <bcp-considerations>`. You can re-enable a 
   {+bcp+} at any time.
