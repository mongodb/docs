  {{role}} accepts a *namespace pattern* as its argument. The namespace
  pattern permits {{role}} to refer to any namespace that matches the
  specified pattern. {{program}} matches the smallest valid occurrence
  of the namespace pattern.
  
  Use asterisks (``*``) as wild cards. Escape all literal asterisks
  and backslashes with a backslash. :ref:`example-basic-wildcard-usage`
  provides an example of using asterisks as wild cards.

  For simple replacements, use asterisks (``*``) as wild cards.
  Escape all literal asterisks and backslashes with a backslash.
  Replacements correspond linearly to matches: each asterisk in
  ``--nsFrom`` must correspond to an asterisk in ``--nsTo``, and the
  first asterisk in ``--nsFrom`` matches the first asterisk in ``nsTo``.

  For more complex replacements, use dollar signs to delimit a "wild
  card" variable to use in the replacement.
  :ref:`example-complex-wildcard-usage` provides an example of complex
  replacements with dollar sign-delimited wild cards.

  Unlike replacements with asterisks, replacements with dollar
  sign-delimited wild cards do **not** need to be linear.
