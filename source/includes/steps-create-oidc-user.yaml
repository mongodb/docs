  Select the database group privileges. You can assign privileges to the new group
  in one or more of the following ways:

  - Select a :ref:`built-in role <atlas-user-privileges>` from the
    :guilabel:`Built-in Role` dropdown menu. You can select one
    built-in role per database group within the {+atlas-ui+}. If you delete the
    default option, you can click :guilabel:`Add Built-in Role` to select a new built-in role.

  - If you have any :ref:`custom roles <mongodb-roles>` defined, you can expand
    the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` section and select
    one or more roles from the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` dropdown menu. Click
    :guilabel:`Add Custom Role` to add more custom roles. You can also
    click the :guilabel:`Custom Roles` link to see the custom
    roles for your project.

  - Expand the :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` section and select one or more
    :ref:`privileges <atlas-specific-privileges>` from the
    :guilabel:`Specific Privileges` dropdown menu. Click
    :guilabel:`Add Specific Privilege` to add more privileges. This assigns the
    group specific privileges on individual databases and collections.

  |service| can apply a built-in role, multiple custom roles, and multiple specific
  privileges to a database group. 
  
  To remove an applied role or privilege, click :icon-fa4:`trash-o`
  :guilabel:`Delete` next to the role or privilege you wish to delete.

  .. note::

    |service| doesn't display the :icon-fa4:`trash-o` :guilabel:`Delete` icon
    next to your :guilabel:`Built-in Role`, :guilabel:`Custom Role`, or
    :guilabel:`Specific Privilege` selection if you selected only one option. You
    can delete the selected role or privilege once you apply another role or privilege.
     
  For more information on authorization, see :manual:`Role-Based
  Access Control </core/authorization>` and :manual:`Built-in
  Roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` in the MongoDB manual.

  By default, groups can access all the clusters and {+fdi+}\s in the 
  project. You can restrict access to specific clusters and {+fdi+}\s
  by doing the following: 

  a. Toggle :guilabel:`Restrict Access to Specific Clusters/Federated 
     Database Instances` to :guilabel:`ON`.

  #. Select the clusters and {+fdi+}\s to grant the group access to 
     from the :guilabel:`Grant Access To` list.

  Toggle :guilabel:`Temporary Group` to :guilabel:`On` and choose

  :guilabel:`Temporary Group Duration` dropdown. You can select one of the
  following time periods for the group to exist:

  - 6 hours
  - 1 day
  - 1 week

  In the :guilabel:`Database Users` tab, temporary groups display
  the time remaining until |service| will delete the group. Once
  |service| deletes the group, any client or application that uses
  the temporary group's credentials loses access to the cluster.
