You can export the data underlying a chart can as a table. All viewers of 
public dashboards and authenticated users of non-public dashboards can

chart data` from the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. Each row in the table 
represents a data point.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen Dashboard View
-------------------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and expands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To enter the fullscreen view for dashboards: 

.. procedure:: Import a Dashboard From a File
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from the 
      :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.
   
   .. step:: Click
      :icon-fa5:`expand` at the top-right of the dashboard.

.. note::

   In the fullscreen view for dashboards, you can still:
   
   - :ref:`Remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
     <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
     <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`edit
     <dashboard-edit-chart>` charts by hovering over the desired chart.

   - Configure refresh settings and manually refresh chart data.
   
   - Enter the :ref:`fullscreen charts view <fullscreen-charts-view>`.

To exit the fullscreen view for dashboards, do one of the following 
tasks:

- Click :icon-fa5:`compress` at 
  the top-right of the dashboard.

- Press the escape key.
