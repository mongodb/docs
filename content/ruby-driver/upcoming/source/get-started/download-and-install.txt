   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Before you begin developing, ensure you install `Ruby
      <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>`__ version 2.7
      or later in your development environment. {+language+}
      is pre-installed on macOS and some Linux distributions,
      but you might need to update your version.

      .. important::

         The {+driver-short+} is not officially supported on Windows.

   .. step:: Create a project directory

      Run the following command in your shell to create a directory
      called ``ruby-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir ruby-quickstart

      Then, run the following commands to create a ``quickstart.rb`` file in
      the ``ruby-quickstart`` directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd ruby-quickstart
         touch quickstart.rb

   .. step:: Add the {+driver-short+} to your project

      Open the ``quickstart.rb`` file and add the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.rb
         :language: ruby
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-bundler
         :end-before: end-bundler

      This code adds the {+driver-short+} as a dependency by
      using the `Bundler <https://bundler.io/>`__ dependency management tool.

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory with the driver
dependencies installed.
