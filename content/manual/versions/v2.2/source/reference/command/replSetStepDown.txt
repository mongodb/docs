.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   :option boolean force: Forces the :term:`primary` to step down
                          even if there aren't any secondary
                          members within 10 seconds of the
                          primary's latest optime. This option is
                          not available in versions of
                          :binary:`~bin.mongod` before 2.0.

   The :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command forces the :term:`primary`
   of the replica set to relinquish its status as primary. This
   initiates an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`. You may specify a number of
   seconds for the node to avoid election to primary:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetStepDown: <seconds> }

   If you do not specify a value for ``<seconds>``,
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will attempt to avoid reelection to primary for
   60 seconds.

   .. warning:: :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients
      currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps
      ensure that clients maintain an accurate view of the replica
      set.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0
      If there is no :term:`secondary`, within 10 seconds of the
      primary, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will not succeed to
      prevent long running elections.
