Atlas Device Sync :ref:`optimizes sync storage <optimize-sync-atlas-usage>` by 
minimizing the amount of Device Sync metadata stored in your Atlas clusters. 
However, these strategies do *not* reduce the overall size of the Atlas cluster. 

To reclaim disk space in your cluster, you must compact the data on an Atlas 
volume. You can compact your Atlas volume by using the 
:manual:`compact() </reference/command/compact/>` command.

This method involves performing a failover on the cluster's primary node. To 
fully understand this process and to ensure that your cluster meets the 
minimum requirements to successfully handle a primary failover, we highly 
recommend that you first perform a 
:atlas:`primary failover test </tutorial/test-resilience/test-primary-failover/>`. 

After successfully testing failover of your primary node, follow these steps: 

1. Run the :manual:`compact() </reference/command/compact/>` command on 
   each of the cluster's secondary nodes, one at a time. 

#. Perform a failover on the primary mode, then run ``compact()`` on the 
   primary node.

.. note::

   If you experience issues running the ``compact()`` command, raise a 
   `Support case <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/support/>`__.
