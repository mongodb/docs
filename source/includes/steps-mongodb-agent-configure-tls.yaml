  If you enabled |tls| for your |mms| deployment, then you must
  :doc:`configure the {+mdbagent+} to use TLS
  </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`. To configure the {+mdbagent+} to
  use |tls|, you must have the trusted |certauth| certificate that
  signed the MongoDB instance's certificate.

  In the :doc:`{+mdbagent+}'s install directory
  </tutorial/install-mongodb-agent-to-manage>`, edit the configuration
  file to set :setting:`tlsTrustedMMSServerCertificate` field to the
  path of a file containing one or more certificates in |pem| format.

  .. include:: /includes/list-table-mongodb-agent-conf-file-locations.rst

  .. example::

     Use the following command to connect through the
     |mongo| shell:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongo --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem example.net:27017

     Then, modify the configuration file and set the following
     key/value pair:

     .. code-block:: ini

        tlsTrustedMMSServerCertificate=/etc/ssl/ca.pem

     Save the configuration file.
