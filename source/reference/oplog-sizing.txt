The :ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` program uses :ref:`change streams
<changeStreams>` to synchronize data between source and destination
clusters. ``mongosync`` does not access the :term:`oplog` directly,
but when a change stream returns events from the past, the events must
be within the :term:`oplog` time range.

Estimate ``oplog`` Size Needed for Initial Sync
-----------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Determine the ``oplog`` Time Span

      To get the difference in seconds between the first and last entry
      in the ``oplog`` run :method:`db.getReplicationInfo()`. If you
      are replicating a sharded cluster, run the command on each shard.
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
       
         db.getReplicationInfo().timeDiff
         
      The value returned is the minimum ``oplog`` window of the
      cluster. If there are multiple shards, the smallest number is the
      minimum ``oplog`` window.

   .. step:: Estimate Copy Rate During Synching

      .. _c2c-step-est-size:

      To gather performance data while synching, start the sync process
      and monitor how fast data is transferred between clusters.
      
      To start syncing, run the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` command.

      To get the ``copy_rate``:
      
      - run the  :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` command to get
        ``estimatedCopiedBytes_time01``
      - wait a second or two
      - run the  :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` command to get
        ``estimatedCopiedBytes_time02``
      
      The ``copy_rate`` is:

      .. code-block:: shell

         copy_rate = ( estimatedCopiedBytes_time02 - estimatedCopiedBytes_01) / time_between_requests

   .. step:: Estimate Copy Time

      Estimate the time needed to copy the entire collection. The
      estimated copy time is:
      
      .. code-block:: shell

         estimatedCopyTime = estimatedTotalBytes / copy_rate

   .. step:: Validate ``oplog`` Size

      If the estimated time is larger than the minimum oplog window you
      must cancel synchronization. Before restarting, make one of the
      following changes:

      - Increase the oplog window. Use :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`
        to set ``minRetentionHours`` greater than the estimated copy
        time.
      - Scale up the ``mongosync`` instance. Add cpu or memory to scale
        up the ``mongosync`` node so that it has a higher copy rate.

.. note::

   The copy rate may vary during synchronization. To monitor progress,
   repeat the :ref:`steps to estimate the copy rate
   <c2c-step-est-size>` and verify that the copy rate stays about the
   same.
