.. _onprem-own-logs:

Available |onprem| Logs
-----------------------

|application| stores its own logs in the
:file:`/opt/mongodb/mms/logs/` directory of each |onprem| host.

Some of the logs have a configuration file that |onprem| maintains.
|onprem| rotates such logs  daily. For these logs, |onprem|:

- Closes the current file.
- Compresses the closed file using ``gzip``.
- Starts a new log file.

|onprem| retains each compressed file for 30 days, then deletes the
compressed file.

You can :ref:`change the retention policy <change-onprem-log-retention>`
of the following logs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - Log File Name

     - Log Contents

     - Configuration File

   * - :file:`mms[#].log`, typically :file:`mms0.log`

     - |onprem| operations

     - :file:`logback.xml`

   * - :file:`daemon.log`

     - |onprem| backup operations

     - :file:`logback.xml`

   * - :file:`mms[#]-access.log`, typically :file:`mms0-access.log`

     - |onprem| access attempts

     - :file:`logback-access.xml`

   * - :file:`mms[#]-startup.log`, typically :file:`mms0-startup.log`

     - |onprem| startup process messages

     - :file:`logback-access.xml`

You can manage the retention policy of the following logs
using your platform's tools:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: 30 70

   * - :file:`daemon-startup.log`
     - |onprem| backup process startup process messages

   * - :file:`mms-migration.log`
     - |onprem| migration process messages

|onprem| may generate additional log files in extenuating
circumstances. If you find files in the log directory that
aren't listed in these tables, contact
:mdb-sup:`MongoDB Support </welcome>` for assistance.

.. _change-onprem-log-retention:

Change |onprem| Log Retention
-----------------------------

If |application| logs have configuration files, you can change their
log retention using these files. You cannot change log retention of
these log files in the console.

.. important::

   If you upgrade |onprem|, it overwrites its configuration files.
   To customize log retention after you upgrade, repeat the steps
   in this procedure.
