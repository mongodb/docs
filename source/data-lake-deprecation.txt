{+adl+} Deprecation Guide - Preview
=============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

{+adl+} is an analytic storage service that extracts data from |service|
clusters into cloud object stores for querying. **{+adl+} is in Public
Preview.** 

For extracting and storing |service| cluster data in cloud object
storage, consider the following alternatives: 

- :ref:`Export Cloud Backup Snapshot <adl-deprecation-export-snapshot>`
- :ref:`Atlas Data Federation $out <adl-deprecation-adf-out>`

For querying data stored in a cloud object storage, consider the
following alternatives: 

- :ref:`Atlas Data Federation Query <adl-deprecation-query-with-adf>`
- :ref:`Cloud Native Query Engines <adl-deprecation-query-engines>`

.. _adl-deprecation-export-snapshot:

Export Cloud Backup Snapshot
----------------------------

You can export your |service| cluster Cloud Backup snapshots to
|aws| |s3| or Azure Blob Storage. You can manually export
individual snapshots or set up an export policy to automatically export
your snapshots. To learn more, see |service| :atlas:`documentation
</backup/cloud-backup/export/>`. 

.. _adl-deprecation-adf-out:

Atlas Data Federation ``$out`` 
------------------------------

The :pipeline:`$out` stage takes documents returned by the aggregation
pipeline and writes them to a specified collection. In {+adf+}, 
you can use ``$out`` to write data from your cluster to |aws| |s3|
or Azure Blob Storage. This allows you to make copies of your
data at a point in time and store it in cloud object storage. To learn
more, see :atlas:`Query Federated Data with $out
</data-federation/supported-unsupported/pipeline/out/>`.  

.. _adl-deprecation-query-with-adf:

Atlas Data Federation Query
---------------------------

{+adf+} can query data in an |aws| |s3| bucket or Azure Blob Storage
container and HTTP URL. To learn more about how to deploy and query a
{+fdi+}, see the following resources: 

:atlas:`Deploy a {+fdi+} </data-federation/tutorial/deploy/>`
:atlas:`Query a {+fdi+} </data-federation/query/query-federated-database/>`

.. _adl-deprecation-query-engines:

Cloud Native Query Engines
--------------------------

There are several cloud-native services designed to query cloud object
storage, such as the following:

- `AWS Athena <https://aws.amazon.com/athena/>`__
- `Azure Synapse <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics>`__
- `Google BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery>`__
