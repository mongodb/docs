Create and Query a View
=======================

To create a view, use one of the following methods:

- Use :method:`db.createCollection()`
- Use :method:`db.createView()`

To create a view in the {+atlas+} UI, you must use a materialized
view. To learn more, see :ref:`create-view-atlas`.

.. important:: View Names are Included in Collection List Output

   Operations that list collections, such as
   :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and
   :method:`db.getCollectionNames()`, include views in their outputs.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst

``db.createCollection()`` Syntax
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection( 
     "<viewName>", 
     {
       "viewOn" : "<source>", 
       "pipeline" : [<pipeline>],
       "collation" : { <collation> }
     }
   )

``db.createView()`` Syntax
--------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(
     "<viewName>",
     "<source>",
     [<pipeline>],
     {
       "collation" : { <collation> }
     }
   )

Restrictions
------------

- You must create views in the same database as the source collection.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-restriction-output-to-disk.rst

- You cannot rename a view once it is created.

Unsupported Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operations are not available with views:

- :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`.

- :query:`$text` operator, since ``$text`` in
  aggregation is valid only for the first stage.

- Renaming a view.

For more information, see :ref:`views-supported-operations`.

Example
-------

This example populates a collection with student data and creates a view
to query the data.

Populate the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a ``students`` collection to use for this example:

.. _ex-views-create-sample:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.insertMany( [
      { sID: 22001, name: "Alex", year: 1, score: 4.0 }, 
      { sID: 21001, name: "bernie", year: 2, score: 3.7 }, 
      { sID: 20010, name: "Chris", year: 3, score: 2.5 }, 
      { sID: 22021, name: "Drew", year: 1, score: 3.2 }, 
      { sID: 17301, name: "harley", year: 6, score: 3.1 }, 
      { sID: 21022, name: "Farmer", year: 1, score: 2.2 }, 
      { sID: 20020, name: "george", year: 3, score: 2.8 },
      { sID: 18020, name: "Harley", year: 5, score: 2.8 }, 
   ] )

Use db.createView() to Create a View 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :method:`db.createView()` to create a view that is limited to first
year students: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createView(
      "firstYears",
      "students",
      [ { $match: { year: 1 } } ]
   )

In the example:

- ``firstYears`` is the name of the new view.
- ``students`` is the collection the view is based on.
- :pipeline:`$match` is an aggregation expression that matches first
  year students in the ``students`` collection.

Query the View
``````````````

This example queries the view:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.firstYears.find({}, { _id: 0 } )

The following output only contains the documents with data on first
year students. The ``{ _id: 0 }`` :ref:`projection
<method-find-projection>` suppresses the ``_id`` field in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     { sID: 22001, name: 'Alex', year: 1, score: 4 },
     { sID: 22021, name: 'Drew', year: 1, score: 3.2 },
     { sID: 21022, name: 'Farmer', year: 1, score: 2.2 }
   ]

.. note:: Projection Restrictions

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-projection-operators.rst

Use db.createCollection() to Create a View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`db.createCollection()` method allows you to create a
collection or a view with specific options.

The following example creates a ``graduateStudents`` view. The view
only contains documents selected by the :pipeline:`$match` stage. The
optional :ref:`collation <collation>` setting determines the sort
order.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
      "graduateStudents",
      { 
         viewOn: "students",
         pipeline: [ { $match: { $expr: { $gt: [ "$year", 4 ] } } } ],
         collation: { locale: "en", caseFirst: "upper" }
      }
   )

.. note:: Collation Behavior

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-collation-behavior.rst

Query the View
``````````````

The following example queries the view. The :pipeline:`$unset` stage
removes the ``_id`` field from the output for clarity.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.graduateStudents.aggregate(
      [
         { $sort: { name: 1 } },
         { $unset: [ "_id" ] }
      ]
   )

When the output is sorted, the :pipeline:`$sort` stage uses the 
:ref:`collation <collation>` ordering to sort uppercase letters before
lowercase letters.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     { sID: 18020, name: 'Harley', year: 5, score: 2.8 },
     { sID: 17301, name: 'harley', year: 6, score: 3.1 }
   ]

Behavior
--------

The following sections describe the behaviors of view creation and
queries.

Aggregation Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you query a view:

- Query ``filter``, ``projection``, ``sort``, ``skip``, ``limit``,
  and other operations for :method:`db.collection.find()` are
  converted to the equivalent :ref:`aggregation pipeline stages
  <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`.

- MongoDB appends the client query to the underlying pipeline and
  returns the results of that combined pipeline to the client. MongoDB
  may apply :doc:`aggregation pipeline optimizations
  </core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization>` to the combined pipeline.

- The :doc:`aggregation pipeline optimizer
  </core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization>` reshapes the view
  aggregation pipeline stages to improve performance. The optimization
  does not change the query results.
