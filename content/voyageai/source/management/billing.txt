You can manage payments and billing for the {+voyage-api-full+}
through the billing and payments interface in the {+atlas-ui+}.
|service| sends billing charges to the |service| account linked to
your {+model-api-keys+}.

.. _voyage-billing-overview:

Overview
--------

MongoDB uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model and charges for
usage based on consumption:

- For text-based models, charges apply per :term:`token <tokens>`.
- For multimodal models that process images and videos, charges apply
  per pixel.

You configure billing settings at the organization level, which apply
to all projects within that organization. You can examine costs and
billing for your {+model-api-keys+} per project in the {+atlas-ui+}.

For {+model-api-keys+} usage, |service|:

- Tracks your usage of tokens and pixels on the :guilabel:`Usage` page. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`voyage-monitor-usage`.
- Provides detailed cost breakdowns through the :ref:`Cost Explorer <cost-explorer>`. 
- Displays your current monthly costs on the :guilabel:`Invoices` page. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-invoices`.

To learn more about billing in |service|, 
see the :ref:`{+service+} documentation <atlas-billing>`.

.. note::

   The Public Preview does not support prepaid credits for the
   {+voyage-api+}. This is subject to change.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To view billing information, you must have
  :authrole:`Organization Billing Viewer` access or higher.

- To configure billing settings, such as the payment method and
  billing profile, you must have :authrole:`Organization Owner`
  or :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` access.

Rate Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+voyage-api-full+} enforces rate limits based on requests per
minute (RPM) and tokens per minute (TPM). MongoDB sets limits at the
organization level, but you can configure lower limits at the project
level. Higher rate limit tiers are available based on payment history
and spending. To learn more, see :ref:`voyage-rate-limits`.

Usage Tiers
-----------

As your API usage and spending increase, you are automatically graduated
to higher usage tiers with increased :ref:`rate limits
<voyage-rate-limits-overview>`. Your organization is assigned to a usage
tier based on cumulative spending since account creation. Once you
qualify for a tier, you remain at that tier unless your organization is
:ref:`unlinked <voyage-org-linking>` from a parent organization.

Your organization's rate limits automatically increase when you move to
the next usage tier based on the following criteria:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Usage Tier
     - Requirements to Advance
   * - Free trial
     - Add a payment method to move to Usage Tier 1.
   * - Usage tier 1
     - Spend at least $100 since account creation to move to Usage
       Tier 2.
   * - Usage tier 2
     - Spend at least $1,000 since account creation to move to Usage
       Tier 3.
   * - Usage tier 3
     - If you still need a higher rate limit, please request a rate
       limit increase.

.. _voyage-org-tier-determination:

How Usage Tiers are Determined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When determining an organization's usage tier, {+service+} follows a priority
order:

1. If the child organization has an established tier, that tier is used.
2. If the child organization does not yet have a tier but is :ref:`linked <voyage-org-linking>`
   to a parent organization, {+service+} checks the parent's tier.
3. If the parent organization also does not have an established tier,
   {+service+} evaluates the parent's payment method status:

   - Organizations with an active payment method default to **Tier 1**.
   - Organizations without a payment method default to the **Free Tier**.

.. _voyage-org-linking:

Organization Linking and Tier Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a child organization is linked to a parent organization, the
child organization inherits the parent's usage tier if the parent's tier is
higher than the child's current tier. To learn how to link organizations, see
:ref:`cross-org-billing`.

The following rules apply when linking and unlinking organizations:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Linking Organizations
      :tabid: linking-organizations

      When organization linking occurs, {+service+} evaluates both the parent and
      child organization tiers and sets the child's tier to the maximum of the two.
      This ensures:

      - The child organization is never at a lower tier than its parent.
      - The child organization is never downgraded if it has already achieved a
        higher tier independently.

      .. example::

         If a child organization is at Tier 2 and is linked to a parent
         organization at Tier 1, the child organization remains at Tier 2.

         If a child organization is at Tier 1 and is linked to a parent
         organization at Tier 3, the child organization is upgraded to Tier 3.

   .. tab:: Unlinking Organizations
      :tabid: unlinking-organizations

      When an organization is unlinked from its parent, the child organization's
      tier is re-evaluated based on its own lifetime spend and payment method status.

      Unlike the linking scenario, unlinking allows for tier downgrades:

      - If the child organization's individual spend history does not qualify it for
        its current tier, the tier is adjusted downward to match what the
        organization has earned on its own.
      - Organizations without a payment method and without qualifying spend are
        placed in the Free Tier after unlinking.

      .. example::

         If a child organization inherited Tier 3 from its parent but has only
         spent $50 on its own, unlinking will downgrade the child organization to
         the Free Tier (if no payment method is attached) or Tier 1 (if a payment
         method is attached).

Manage Billing
--------------

To access billing, log into the {+atlas-ui+}, navigate to your
organization, and click the :guilabel:`Billing` icon in the upper-right
corner of your screen. The :guilabel:`Billing > Overview` page 
includes the following:

- The :guilabel:`Pending Invoice`, which includes
  :guilabel:`Net Month-to-Date Amount`, showing the total amount due
  for your usage so far this month. It also shows the
  :guilabel:`Month-to-Date Usage`, including whether usage went up or
  down compared to this time last month, the usage for
  :guilabel:`This Time Last Month`, the :guilabel:`Billing Period`, and
  the :guilabel:`Invoice Date`. Click :guilabel:`View Pending Invoice`
  to view details.

- The :guilabel:`Last Invoice`, which shows the :guilabel:`Amount Due`,
  :guilabel:`Total Usage`, :guilabel:`Billing Period`, and
  :guilabel:`Invoice Date`. Click :guilabel:`View Invoice` to view
  details.

.. tip::

   To understand how your usage translates to costs, use the
   :ref:`Cost Explorer <cost-explorer>` in the {+atlas-ui+} and filter
   by AI model. MongoDB derives costs from metering data and updates them
   every 24 hours. To learn more, see :ref:`voyage-monitor-usage`.

Your billing profile for |service| is the same as the billing profile
for your {+model-api-keys+}. To view or edit your billing profile, see
:ref:`{+service+} Billing <atlas-billing>`.

Payment Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To pay for your {+voyage-api+} usage, use your configured
payment method. MongoDB accepts the following payment methods 
through the |service| console:

- Credit card
- `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/us/home>`__

To set your payment method for your {+model-api-keys+} in |service|,
see :ref:`Atlas Payment Methods <atlas-billing-methods>`.

Through :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`, you can pay using:

- A currency other than USD
- A method other than a credit card or PayPal

.. important::

   To confirm your credit card information, |service| charges $1.00
   when you first connect a credit card to your account. After
   |service| confirms your information, it refunds the $1.00 charge.
   If you encounter any issues with connecting a credit card to your
   account, reach out to your card provider or banking institution.
   Verify whether they declined the initial charge, which would prevent
   |service| from confirming your information.

.. _examine-voyage-invoices:

Manage Invoices
---------------

For each of your invoices, including your current invoice, you can:

- View the payment amount due, the total cost of your usage for the
  billing period, and your billing information.
- Export the invoice details to PDF or CSV.
- Explore invoice cost visualization charts that show total usage costs
  by service, such as the {+model-api-keys+}.
- Review usage summaries by project and by service, such as the
  {+model-api-keys+}.
- Examine payment and usage details that explain usage, as well as paid
  and pending charges for the {+model-api-keys+}.

To learn more, see :ref:`examine-invoices`.

.. _voyage-view-billing:

View Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the most recent and pending charges for your {+model-api-keys+}
in an organization:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/usage/steps-view-billing-org-level.rst

You can also access billing information directly from the :guilabel:`Usage` page
by clicking the :guilabel:`View Invoice` button.

.. _voyage-billing-page-features:

Invoice Page Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the :guilabel:`Invoices` page in |service|, you can view your
billing invoices for your {+model-api-keys+}.

The :guilabel:`Invoice` page displays the following columns:

- :guilabel:`Payment Status`: Shows ``PENDING`` or ``SUCCESSFUL``.
- :guilabel:`Invoice Date`: Shows the date when |service| generates
  the invoice.
- :guilabel:`Invoice Period`: Shows the billing period for the invoice.
  For example, you might see a usage summary for the billing period of
  ``December 1, 2025 - January 1, 2026``.
- :guilabel:`Total Cost`: Shows your total monthly charges in your
  selected currency. The total monthly charges include the billed
  amount and any applicable taxes, but don't include any payments you
  made.

  For example, the :guilabel:`Total Cost` column might show
  ``$29.98 (month-to-date)``. This indicates that your total charges
  for the month so far are $29.98, including taxes, but doesn't
  reflect any payments you might have made.

- :guilabel:`Download`: Provides an icon for downloading the invoice.
  You can download your :guilabel:`Usage Summary` in PDF or CSV format.
  The :guilabel:`Usage Summary` shows a detailed breakdown of daily
  usage activity for your {+model-api-keys+}.

For example, your {+model-api-keys+} invoice may show the following information:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   Usage Summary Number: 692cff3069022138575632aa
   Organization: MyVoyageOrg

   This usage summary is for the billing period December 1, 2025 - January 1, 2026.
