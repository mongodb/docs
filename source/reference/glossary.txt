   absolute system CPU utilization
      System CPU utilization relative to the full amount of CPU available
      to cloud instances that share CPU.

      - When a cloud provider throttles CPU utilization for a cloud instance,
        the instance's absolute system CPU utilization is equal to the
        :term:`baseline CPU utilization` assigned to this instance.
      - When a cloud provider adds CPU above the baseline CPU, such as
        through a bursting mechanism, the sum of normalized kernel CPU
        utilization and user CPU utilization on an instance can exceed
        the instance's baseline CPU. In this case, the sum of the normalized
        kernel CPU utilization and user CPU utilization is still less than
        the full amount of CPU shared by cloud instances. See also
        :term:`relative system CPU utilization`, :term:`baseline CPU utilization`,
        and :term:`burstable instances`.

   alert
      Notification sent by |service| when your database operations or
      server usage reach thresholds that affect cluster
      performance. To learn what conditions you can set to trigger
      alerts, see :ref:`alert-conditions`.

         :ref:`respond-to-alerts`

   analytics node
      Specialized read-only node that can isolate queries which you do
      not want to affect your operational workload. Analytics nodes are
      useful for handling analytic data such as reporting queries
      executed by BI tools. You can host analytics nodes in dedicated
      geographic regions to optimize read performance and reduce
      latency.
      
   API
      Communication protocol facilitating interaction between the
      client and |service-fullname|. You can use the 
      {+atlas-admin-api+} to
      automate many of the tasks performed in the {+atlas-ui+}.
      
      .. seealso::

         - `{+atlas-admin-api+} Specification <https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec>`__
      
   Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search 
      Computational technique used to quickly find points in a dataset
      that are close to a given query point. {+avs+} uses |ann| search
      to find vector embeddings in the data that are closest to the
      vector embeddings in the {+avs+} query without scanning every
      vector. 

   Atlas Search
      Fine-grained text indexing enabling advanced text search on your
      data without any additional required management. |fts| provides
      options for several kinds of :ref:`text analyzers
      <analyzers-ref>`, score-based results ranking, and a rich
      :ref:`query language <query-syntax-ref>`.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`fts-top-ref`

   Atlas user
      Account used to access the |service| application. You can grant
      |service| users access to |service| organizations, projects, or
      both, with certain permissions defined by :ref:`user roles
      <user-roles>`. |service| users are different than
      :term:`database users <Database user>`. |service| users do not
      provide access to any MongoDB databases.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`atlas_users`
      
   Atlas user role
      Set of permissions granted to an :term:`Atlas user`. You can grant
      permissions at the :term:`organization` or :term:`project` level.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`user-roles`

   {+avs+}
      Feature in |service| that allows you to perform semantic search
      on vector embeddings by comparing query vectors with indexed
      vectors to find the closest match.

   auto-scaling      
      Configurable option to have your cluster automatically increase
      or decrease its cluster tier, storage capacity, or both in
      response to cluster usage.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`cluster-autoscaling`
      
   backup      
      Copy of your data that encapsulates the state of your cluster at
      a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the case of
      data loss events.
      
      |service| provides fully-managed :term:`Cloud Backups <cloud
      backups>`.

   baseline CPU utilization
      Fraction of the full amount of CPU available to cloud instances that
      share CPU. A cloud provider assigns a certain amount of baseline CPU
      to each cloud instance, based on the instance's {+cluster+} tier.
      Typically, baseline CPU utilization falls between 20% and 50% of
      :term:`absolute system CPU utilization`. See also :term:`relative system CPU utilization`
      and :term:`burstable instances`.

   burstable instances
      Cloud instance types that share a common physical CPU that, for some
      cloud providers, use a "CPU credit" model. When you use burstable instances,
      portions of shared CPU may either become available to each of the virtual
      instances or may become unavailable, under different demands on the
      instance resources. To learn more, see |aws-burstable-instances|,
      |azure-disk-bursting|, and |gcp-cpu-bursting|. See also
      :term:`baseline CPU utilization`, :term:`absolute system CPU utilization`,
      and :term:`relative system CPU utilization`.

   cloud backups      
      Localized cluster :term:`backup` storage using the native
      :term:`snapshot` functionality of the cluster's cloud service
      provider.
      
      |service| supports {+Cloud-Backup+}s for clusters served on:
      
      - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
      - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
      - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`
      
   cluster
      Set of nodes comprising a MongoDB :term:`deployment`. In
      |service|, clusters can be :term:`replica sets <replica set>` or
      :term:`sharded deployments <sharded cluster>`.
      
   cluster class     
      *Configurable for M40+ clusters hosted on AWS.*
      
      Storage class of your cluster. Your selected class affects cluster
      storage performance and cluster costs. You can choose one of the
      following classes:
      
      - :guilabel:`Low CPU`
      - :guilabel:`General`
      - :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD`
      
      .. seealso::
      
         - :ref:`create-cluster-storage`
         - :term:`NVMe storage`
      
   cluster tier
      Dictates the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops| specification for 
      each data-bearing server in the cluster. Cluster storage size and
      overall performance increase as the cluster tier increases.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         - :ref:`create-cluster-instance`
         - :ref:`sizing`

   cosine similarity 
      Metric that uses the angle between two vectors to determine the
      similarity between those vectors. Cosine similarity is sensitive
      to vector orientation. You can use cosine similarity function when
      indexing your vector embeddings for {+avs+}. If the vectors are
      normalized to unit length, use :term:`dotProduct similarity`
      function instead.  

   CPU steal
      Percentage by which the CPU usage exceeds the guaranteed baseline
      CPU credit accumulation rate. CPU steal is relevant for cloud providers
      that rely on the credit model in their bursting strategy. CPU credits
      are units of CPU utilization that you accumulate. The credits accumulate
      at a constant rate to provide a guaranteed level of performance. These
      credits can be used for additional CPU performance. When the credit
      balance is exhausted, only the guaranteed baseline of CPU performance
      is provided, and the amount of excess is shown as steal percent.
      See also :term:`relative system CPU utilization`, :term:`baseline CPU utilization`,
      and :term:`burstable instances`.

   custom role
      Custom set of MongoDB :term:`privilege actions <action>` and MongoDB
      :term:`roles <role>` that you can save and assign to
      :term:`database users <Database user>`. Create custom roles when
      |service|'s :ref:`built-in roles
      <atlas-user-privileges>` don't describe your desired set of
      privileges.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`mongodb-roles`

         :ref:`atlas-ui`
      
   Data Federation
      MongoDB's solution for querying data stored in low-cost S3 
      buckets, |service| clusters, and |http| endpoints using the
      MongoDB Query Language. Analytics applications can use {+adf+} to
      make use of archived data for their data processing needs.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`Atlas Data Federation <atlas-data-federation>`

   data ingestion pipeline
      Workflow for organizing and transforming data by using |rag| and
      storing it in a vector database such as |service|.

           - Production

   dense vectors 
      Numeric representation of data where most or all of the dimensions
      contain non-zero values. {+avs+} uses dense vectors, which are
      packed with more data, to capture more complex relationships. 

   deployment
      A group of MongoDB servers containing your data.
      |service|-managed {+database-deployments+} are {+clusters+}
      (:term:`replica sets <replica set>` or
      :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`).
      
   dimensions 
      Number of components or elements that make up the features or
      attributes of data in multi-dimensional space. {+avs+} supports up
      to ``8192`` dimensions at index-time and query-time.

   dotProduct similarity
      Measures similarity between two vectors in multi-dimensional
      space and returns a scalar value, which is positive when the
      vectors point in roughly the same direction, negative when the
      vectors point in opposite direction, and zero when the vectors
      have no similarity. {+avs+} supports using ``dotproduct``
      similarity function when searching for nearest neighbors. We
      recommend this similarity function instead of cosine similarity if
      the vectors are normalized to unit length. 

   electable node
      Node which is eligible to become the :term:`primary` member of
      your :term:`replica set`. |service| prioritizes nodes in the
      :term:`Highest Priority region` for primary eligibility during
      elections. To ensure reliable elections, the total number of
      electable nodes across an entire region must be 3, 5, or 7.
      
   embedding 
      Representation of data such as text, images, audio, video,
      and so on as an array of numbers, which can be interpreted as
      coordinates in multi-dimensional space. |service| supports storing
      embeddings in an |service| {+cluster+} and {+avs+} supports indexing
      and querying vector embeddings of up to ``8192`` dimensions. 

   encryption key
      Random string of bits generated specifically to encrypt and
      decrypt data.
      
      |service| :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` can
      configure an additional layer of encryption on their data in
      addition to the default :ref:`encryption at rest
      <security-kms-encryption>` that |service| provides. Project
      owners can use their |service|-compatible customer key management
      provider with the MongoDB :manual:`encrypted storage engine
      </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`.
      
      |service| supports the following customer key management providers
      when configuring Encryption at Rest:
      
      - :ref:`Amazon Web Services Key Management Service <security-aws-kms>`
      - :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`
      - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform Key Management Service <security-gcp-kms>`
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`security-kms-encryption`
      
   euclidean similarity 
      Formula to calculate the similarity by using the distance between
      two vectors in multi-dimensional space. Euclidean distance is
      sensitive to the magnitude of the vectors. {+avs+} supports using
      ``euclidean`` similarity function for indexing vectors and when
      searching for nearest neighbors. 

   Free Tier

      that sends traffic to the |service| private endpoint service over |aws| PrivateLink.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`private-endpoint-concepts`

   IP access list
      List of |ipaddr| addresses and |cidr| blocks with access to {+clusters+}
      within an |service| :term:`project`. For client connections over the
      public Internet, |service| allows connections to a {+cluster+} only
      from entries in the corresponding project's IP access list.
      The access list may have up to 200 entries.

      |service| also allows client connections over nonpublic networking,
      such :ref:`network peering connections <vpc-peering>` or private
      endpoints. These types of connections work irrespective of the
      IP access list. To learn more, see :ref:`vpc-peering` and
      :ref:`private-endpoint-concepts`.

   K-nearest neighbor search
      Given a set of points *P* with a defined similarity function *S*,
      for a query point *q*, finds the set of *k* points in *P* with the
      best values of *S*(*p*, *q*). {+avs+} |enn| search returns the
      exact top *k* points and |ann| search returns *k* points that are
      similar to *q*, but not necessarily the *k* most similar to *q*. 

   LDAP
      Cross-platform protocol used to authenticate users and authorize
      them to access data on a cluster. You can use |service| to manage
      user authentication and authorization from all MongoDB clients
      using your own |ldap| server over |tls|. A single |ldaps|
      configuration applies to all clusters in an |service| project.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`ldaps-authentication-authorization`

   link-token
      String that contains the information necessary to connect from
      |com| to |service| during a live migration from a |com| deployment
      to a cluster in |service|.

      When you are ready to live migrate data from a |com| deployment,
      you generate a link-token in |service| and then enter it in your
      |com| organization's settings. You use the same link-token to
      migrate each deployment in your |com| organization sequentially,
      one at a time. You can generate multiple link-tokens in |service|.
      Use one unique link-token for each |com| organization.


   Live Migration
      Process to seamlessly move an existing source replica set or
      sharded cluster to |service|. During the live migration process,
      |service| keeps the destination cluster in sync with the remote source
      until you cut your applications over to the |service| cluster.

   Database user
      Credentials used to authenticate a client to access a MongoDB
      {+database-deployment+}. You can assign :ref:`privileges
      <atlas-user-privileges>` to a database user to determine that
      user's access level to a {+database-deployment+}. Database users
      are different from :term:`Atlas users <Atlas user>`. Database
      users have access to MongoDB deployments, not the |service|
      application.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`mongodb-users`
      
   Database user privileges
      Set of :term:`privilege actions <action>` or :term:`roles <role>`
      granted to a database user. You can assign database user
      privileges at the {+database-deployment+}, database, and

      Organizations </returnAllOrganizations>` endpoint returns the ID 
      of all organizations that the authenticated user executing the 
      |api| call can access.

   Performance Advisor
      |service| tool that monitors slow queries executed on your
      cluster and suggests indexes to improve query performance. Each
      index that the Performance Advisor suggests include an
      :term:`Impact` score indicating the potential performance
      improvement that index would bring.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`performance-advisor`

      |service| :term:`project`. The :oas-atlas-op:`Get All Projects 
      </listProjects>` |api| endpoint returns the ID of all 
      projects that the authenticated user executing the API call can 
      access.
      
      .. note::
      
         Project ID is synonymous with group ID.

   relative system CPU utilization
      CPU utilization relative to the amount of baseline CPU assigned to
      a cloud instance. You can calculate relative system CPU utilization
      by dividing the :term:`absolute system CPU utilization` by the amount
      of baseline CPU assigned to a cloud instance.

      Relative system CPU utilization is capped at 100%. When a cloud provider
      throttles CPU utilization for a cloud instance, or bursts CPU utilization
      for an instance above the baseline amount of CPU available to that
      instance, the relative system CPU value is 100%.

      See also :term:`absolute system CPU utilization`, and :term:`burstable instances`.

   softIRQ
      CPU utilization metric that reflects a portion of CPU that a cloud
      instance currently uses to process software interrupt requests.
      On some cloud providers, this metric is useful for tracking CPU
      utilization on :term:`burstable instances`.

   quantization
      Quantization is the process of compressing the value of dimensions
      to a smaller range to allow the storage of more vectors or of
      vectors with higher dimensions. {+avs+} supports automatic
      quantization of full-fidelity vectors to reduce memory and storage
      costs, and ingestion and indexing of scalar and binary quantized
      vectors from embedding models.  

   Query Profiler
      |service| tool that diagnoses and monitors performance
      issues in your cluster. The Query Profiler can expose long-running
      queries and their performance statistics. You can filter the data
      returned by the Query Profiler to hone in on specific namespaces
      and operation types.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`query-profiler`
      
   read-only node
      Replica set in a dedicated geographic region that supplements your
      :term:`electable node` regions. You can use read-only nodes to
      localize data where it is most frequently read to improve
      performance.
      
   Real-Time Performance Panel
      |service| monitoring service that displays current network
      traffic, database operations on your clusters, and hardware
      statistics about your host machines. Use the |rtpp| to visually
      evaluate query execution times, monitor network activity, and
      discover potential replication lag on secondary members of
      replica sets.
      
      .. seealso::

   recall 
      Measures the fraction of true nearest neighbors that were returned
      by an |ann| search. This measure reflects how close the algorithm
      approximates the results of |enn| search. The notation *Recall@k*
      refers to the measurement of how many of the true nearest
      neighbors were present in the top *k* results returned by {+avs+}. 

   replica set
      Group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. Replica
      sets provide redundancy, high availability, and are the basis for
      all production deployments.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :manual:`Replication </replication>`
      
   rolling restart
      Process that restarts all nodes in the cluster in sequence. To
      maintain cluster availability, |service| restarts one node at a
      time starting with a :term:`secondary <secondary>` node.
      |service| always maintains a primary node until the rolling
      restart completes. 

   scalar quantization 
      Scalar quantization involves selecting the minimum and maximum values
      across all indexed vectors within a segment for each dimension,
      and producing equally sized bins between them. The mappings for
      each of these dimensions to the bins yields the new quantized
      values. {+avs+} supports automatic scalar quantization for your
      float32 vectors, and ingestion and indexing of your scalar
      quantized vectors from embedding providers. 

   semantic search 
      Search for values that have a similar meaning to query. Semantic
      search captures the natural relationship between words or phrases
      even when there is no lexical overlap. Semantic search and vector
      search are often used interchangeably. {+avs+} supports semantic
      search on vector data stored in |service| {+clusters+}. 

   sharded cluster
      Set of nodes comprising a :term:`sharded <sharding>` MongoDB
      deployment. A sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards,
      and one or more |mongos| routing processes.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :manual:`Sharded Cluster Components </core/sharded-cluster-components/>`
      
   shared cluster
      Cluster category containing ``M0`` (:term:`Free Tier`), ``M2``,
      and ``M5`` tier clusters. Shared clusters are generally used for
      development and small production workloads.
      
      .. seealso::
      
         :ref:`atlas-free-tier`
      
   similarity function 
      Measures the similarity between two vectors. {+avs+} supports
      ``euclidean``, ``cosine``, and ``dotProduct`` similarity functions.

   snapshot
      :term:`Backup <backup>` of your data captured at a specific
      interval and stored in a backup data center.
      The :ref:`Snapshot Schedule <cloud-provider-retention-policy>` determines the
      interval for taking snapshots and how long to store them.
      
      .. seealso::

   team
      Group of :term:`Atlas users <Atlas user>` in the same organization. You can use teams to grant access to
      the same group of Atlas users across multiple
      :term:`projects <project>`. All users in the team share the same
      project access.
      
      .. note::
      
         |service| users can belong to multiple teams.

   topology
      State of a deployment of MongoDB instances, which includes the following
      details:

      - Type of deployment (standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster)
      - Availability of servers
      - Role of each server (:term:`primary`, :term:`secondary`,
        config server, or :binary:`~bin.mongos`)

   vector database 
      System that stores vector embeddings and associated metadata, and
      enables nearest neighbor search on the stored vector embeddings.
      You can use |service| as your vector database and {+avs+} to
      perform vector search on the stored vector embeddings. You can use
      vector database to implement |rag|. 

   vector index 
      Data structure that efficiently processes nearest neighbor search
      queries. {+avs+} supports creating indexes of type ``vector`` to
      index fields for running :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. 

   vector search
      Method of performing *k* nearest neighbor search over a set of
      vectors stored in a vector index. {+avs+} supports |ann| and |enn|
      search for *k* nearest neighbors.
