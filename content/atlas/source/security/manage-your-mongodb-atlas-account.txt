Delete an |service| Account
---------------------------

This section walks you through deleting your |service| account.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete your |service| account, you must ensure that you have no:

- Outstanding invoices
- Active {+database-deployments+}
- Projects
- Organizations

.. important::

   If you log in to |service| through an identity provider, you can't 
   delete your account yourself. Contact your identity provider 
   to delete your |service| account.

Delete All Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete a Project
````````````````

To delete a project for an organization:

- You must either have the ``Owner`` role for the project or have 
  the ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's organization.

- The project must have no outstanding invoices.

- The project must have no active {+database-deployments+}. To learn how
  to view your project's invoices, see :ref:`atlas-invoices`.

Terminate All Clusters
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster.

To terminate an |service| {+cluster+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps-terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the cluster after completing any in-progress deployment changes.

Delete the Project
++++++++++++++++++

You can delete a project for an organization either from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

   - id: projects-view

     name: "Delete from Projects view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps-delete-project.rst

   - id: project-setting-view

     name: "Delete from Project Setting view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps-delete-project-from-settings.rst

Leave or Delete All Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leave an Organization
`````````````````````

.. note::

   If you are the only :authrole:`Organization Owner` in an 
   organization, you must promote 
   another member to :authrole:`Organization Owner` before you can 
   leave an organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/leave-organization.rst

Delete an Organization
``````````````````````

.. note::

   To delete an organization, you must have the
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

   You cannot delete an organization that has active projects. You must
   delete the organization's projects before you can delete the
   organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps-delete-organization.rst

Once you delete all active {+database-deployments+}, projects, and 
organizations, you are no longer billed for any |service| activity 
and no longer receive |service| alerts.

Delete your |service| Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Once you delete your account there's no way to recover it.
   
   |service| requires up to two weeks to fully process an account deletion. 
   Until then, you can't create a new |service| account with the email address 
   associated with your deleted account.

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-atlas-account.rst
