==================================================
Backup a Sharded Cluster with Filesystem Snapshots
==================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system
snapshots to capture a copy of the :program:`mongod` instance. An
alternate procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create binary
database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the
alternate procedure.

See :doc:`/core/backups` and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for complete
information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded clusters in
particular.

Procedure
---------

In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup
up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each
shard in the cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can improve the quality
of the backup while minimizing impact on the cluster by taking the
backup from a secondary member of the replica set that provides each
shard.

.. warning::

   It is essential that you stop the balancer before creating
   backups. If the balancer remains active, your resulting backups
   could have duplicate data or miss some data, as :term:`chunks
   <chunk>` may migrate while recording backups.
