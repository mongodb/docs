     |tls| works with all authentication mechanisms.

     * - Field
       - Action

     * - Enable TLS
       - Toggle this slider to :guilabel:`Yes`.

     * - TLS CA File Path
       - The |tls| |certauth| file is a ``.pem``-format certificate
         file that contains the root certificate chain from the
         |certauth|. The {+mdbagent+} uses this same |certauth| file
         to connect to every item in your deployment.

         Type the file path to the |tls| |certauth| file on every host
         running a MongoDB process:

         - Type the file path on all Linux hosts in the first box.

         - Type the file path on all Windows hosts in the second box.

         This enables the :setting:`net.tls.CAFile` setting for the
         MongoDB processes in the project.

     * - Client Certificate Mode
       - Select if client applications or {+mdbagent+}\s must present a
         |tls| certificate when connecting to a |tls|\-enabled MongoDB
         deployments. Each MongoDB deployment checks for certificates
         from these client hosts when they try to connect. If you
         choose to require the client |tls| certificates, make sure
         they are valid.

         Accepted values are:

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 75
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - OPTIONAL
              - Every client may present a valid |tls| certificate when
                connecting to MongoDB deployments. {+mdbagent+}\s might
                use |tls| certificates if you *don't* set the |mongod|
                :parameter:`tlsMode` to ``None``.

            * - REQUIRED
              - Every MongoDB deployment in this project starts with
                |tls|\-encrypted network connections. All Agents
                must use |tls| to connect to any MongoDB
                deployment.

  Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

  a. In the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` list, click the same
     authentication mechanisms that you did for the project.

  b. Follow the procedure to configure the {+mdbagent+} to use that
     authentication method:

     - :doc:`SCRAM-SHA </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-scram>`
     - :doc:`X.509 Certificates </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-x509>`
     - :doc:`LDAP </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap>`
     - :doc:`Kerberos </tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-kerberos>`

  .. note::

     If you had |tls| certificates for Legacy Agents, see
     **What if I had TLS certificates for Legacy Backup or Monitoring
     Agents?** at the end of this procedure for guidance.
