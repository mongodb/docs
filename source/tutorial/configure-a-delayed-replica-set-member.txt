======================================
Configure a Delayed Replica Set Member
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To configure a :term:`replica set` member with a one hour delay, use the
following sequence of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].slaveDelay = 3600
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst

After the replica set reconfigures, the first member of the set in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array will have a priority
of ``0`` and cannot become :term:`primary`. The :data:`slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>` value
delays both replication and the member's :term:`oplog` by 3600 seconds (1
hour). Setting :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].slaveDelay` to a
non-zero value also sets :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].hidden` to
``true`` for this replica set so that it does not receive application
queries in normal operations.

.. include:: /includes/seealso-elections.rst

.. warning::

   The length of the secondary
   :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].slaveDelay` must
   fit within the window of the oplog. If the oplog is shorter than
   the :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].slaveDelay`
   window, the delayed member cannot successfully replicate
   operations.

   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`, :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`,
   and the :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size` tutorial.
