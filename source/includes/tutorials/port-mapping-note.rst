.. note:: Port Mappings

   The sandbox maps the following services to ports on your host
   machine:

   - The sandbox MongoDB server maps to port ``{+mongodb-port-mapping+}`` on your host machine
   - The sandbox {+kc+} JMX server maps to port ``{+jmx-port-mapping+}`` on your host machine

   These ports must be free to start the sandbox.
