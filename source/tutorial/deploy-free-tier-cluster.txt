|service| {+free-clusters+} provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. {+Free-clusters+} never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster`.

.. note::

   You can deploy only one {+free-cluster+} per |service| project.

Procedure
---------

You can create {+free-clusters+} through the :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} 
</>`, |service| User Interface, and {+atlas-admin-api+}. Select the
appropriate tab based on how you would like to create the 
{+free-clusters+}.

      To create a free cluster using the |service| Administration API, 
      send a ``POST`` request to the ``clusters`` endpoint with the 
      ``instanceSize`` set to ``M0``. To learn more about the resource 
      and parameters, see :oas-atlas-op:`Create </createOneCluster>`.
