.. method:: rs.addArb(hostname)

   :param string host: Specifies a host (and optionally port-number)
                       for an arbiter member for the replica set.

   Adds a new :term:`arbiter` to an existing replica set.

   This function will disconnect the shell briefly and forces a
   reconnection as the replica set renegotiates which node
   will be :term:`primary`. As a result, the shell will display an
   error even if this command succeeds.
