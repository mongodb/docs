Install MongoDB on Debian
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB on Debian systems. The tutorial uses
``.deb`` packages to install. While some Debian distributions include
their own MongoDB packages, the official MongoDB packages are generally
more up to date.

.. note::

   This tutorial applies to both Debian systems and versions of Ubuntu
   Linux prior to 9.10 "Karmic" which do not use Upstart. Other Ubuntu
   users will want to follow the :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu`
   tutorial.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Control Scripts

.. |init-script-path| replace:: ``/etc/init.d/mongod``
.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

Considerations
--------------

For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit systems.

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages that
your release of Debian may include.

The default ''/etc/mongodb.conf'' configuration file supplied by the 2.6 series
''.deb'' package has ''bind_ip'' set to ''127.0.0.1'' by default. Ensure that this
is changed to the appropriate value for your environment before activating a
:term:`replica set <replica set>`.

Install MongoDB
---------------

The Debian package management tools (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys.

Run MongoDB
-----------

The MongoDB instance stores its data files in ``/var/lib/mongo``
and its log files in ``/var/log/mongo``, and runs using the ``mongod``
user account. If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you
**must** modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongo`` and
``/var/log/mongo`` directories.
