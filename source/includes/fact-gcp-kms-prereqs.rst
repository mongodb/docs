- Your |gcp| Service Account Key.
- Your symmetric Encryption Key in |gcp| KMS. 
- The Key Version Resource ID associated with your |gcp| KMS 
  Encryption Key.
- A |gcp| service account with credentials specified in your Service
  Account Key with sufficient permissions to:

  - Get the |gcp| KMS Encryption Key version.
  - Encrypt data with the |gcp| KMS Encryption Key version.
  - Decrypt data with the |gcp| KMS Encryption Key.

  .. note::

     The key, not the key version, handles decryption.

- If your |gcp| |kms| configuration requires it, :gcp:`allow access
  </iam/docs/conditions-attribute-reference#access-levels>`
  from :ref:`Atlas IP addresses <atlas-add-inbound-ips>` and the public 
  IP addresses or DNS hostnames of your cluster nodes so that |service| 
  can communicate with your |kms|. If the node IP addresses 
  :ref:`change <faq-public-ip-changes>`, you must update your 
  configuration to avoid connectivity interruptions.
