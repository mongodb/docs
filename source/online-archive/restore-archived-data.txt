You can restore archived data to your |service| {+cluster+}. You can use 
the alternate syntax that {+adf+} provides for the :ref:`$merge 
<adf-merge-stage>` pipeline stage or the MongoDB
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` database tools
to move the data back into the same or different |service| {+cluster+},
database, or collection within the same |service| project.

.. note:: 

   Ensure that your {+cluster+} is adequately provisioned for the amount of 
   data that will be restored from your archive so that it doesn't run 
   out of space during or after restoration of archived data. Contact 
   :doc:`Support </support>` for additional technical guidance on
   setting up the size of the oplog or for troubleshooting any space
   issues on your |service| {+cluster+}.

This page describes how to restore archived data using the :pipeline:`$merge` 
pipeline stage or MongoDB Tools.

Required Access
---------------

To follow this procedure, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` access or higher to the project.

   .. tab:: MongoDB Database Tools 
      :tabid: db-tools
            
      You can use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` 
      to move archived data back to your |service| {+cluster+}.

      :tabid: pipeline-stage

      If your dataset is small, you can use the :pipeline:`$merge` stage
      to move your archived data back to you |service| {+cluster+}. This
      approach is not recommended for large datasets (around 1TB of
      data) with large number of partitions.

.. note:: 

   If you run into issues while migrating data back to your |service| 
   {+cluster+}, contact :doc:`Support </support>`.
