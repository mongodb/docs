Overview
---------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+django-odm+} to run
create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on your MongoDB
collection.

You can also use the {+framework+} admin site to edit your models
and their corresponding collections on a web interface. For
more information, see the `Django Admin Site <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/contrib/admin/>`__
entry in the {+framework+} documentation.

Query API
~~~~~~~~~

You can use methods provided by the {+framework+} ``QuerySet`` API to run
CRUD operations. To run these operations, you can call ``QuerySet`` methods
on your model's manager. The ``Manager`` class handles database
operations and allows you to interact with your MongoDB data by referencing
Django models. By default, {+framework+} adds a ``Manager`` named ``objects``
to every model class. 

.. tip::

    To learn more about {+framework+}'s ``QuerySet`` API, see the
    `QuerySet API reference <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/querysets/>`__
    in the {+framework+} documentation.

This guide shows how to use the following ``QuerySet`` methods:

- :ref:`create() <django-crud-insert>`: Inserts documents into the collection
- :ref:`filter() and get() <django-crud-read>`: Retrieves one or multiple collection documents
- :ref:`update() <django-crud-modify>`: Modifies collection documents
- :ref:`delete() <django-crud-delete>`: Deletes collection documents

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``Movie`` model, which represents
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`.
The ``Movie`` model class has the following definition:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
   :start-after: start-models
   :end-before: end-models
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. include:: /includes/use-sample-data.rst

   .. replacement:: model-classes

      ``Movie`` model includes

   .. replacement:: model-imports

      .. code-block:: python

         from <your application name>.models import Movie
         from django.utils import timezone
         from datetime import datetime

.. _django-crud-insert:

Insert Documents
----------------

To insert a document into a collection, call the ``create()`` method on your
model's manager. Pass the new document's field names and field values
as arguments to the ``create()`` method.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example calls the ``create()`` method to insert a document
into the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The new document has
a ``title`` value of ``"Poor Things"`` and a ``runtime`` value
of ``141``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
   :start-after: start-insert
   :end-before: end-insert
   :language: python
   :copyable:

The ``create()`` method allows you to create a new ``Movie`` object
and save the object to MongoDB in one method call. Alternatively, you
can create a ``Movie`` object and call ``save()``, as shown in the following
code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
   :start-after: start-save
   :end-before: end-save
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``create()`` method, see `create()
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#create>`__ in the {+framework+}
   documentation.

.. _django-crud-read:

Read Documents
--------------

To retrieve documents from your collection, call the ``filter()`` method
on your model's manager. Pass a query filter, or criteria that specifies
which documents to retrieve, as an argument to the ``filter()`` method.

Alternatively, you can call the ``get()`` method to retrieve a single document
that matches your query. 

Return Multiple Documents Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example calls the ``filter()`` method to retrieve
documents from the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The query
returns ``Movie`` objects that represent movies released on January 1, 2000:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
      :start-after: start-find-many
      :end-before: end-find-many
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

       <QuerySet [<Movie: The Bumblebee Flies Anyway>, <Movie: Angels of the Universe>,
       <Movie: First Person Plural>, <Movie: Just, Melvin: Just Evil>, <Movie: Sound and Fury>,
       <Movie: Peppermint Candy>]>

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``filter()`` method, see `filter()
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#filter>`__ in the {+framework+}
   documentation.

Return One Document Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve only one document that matches your query criteria, call the
``get()`` method and pass a query filter as an argument. The following example
retrieves a document in which the ``title`` value is ``"Boyhood"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
      :start-after: start-find-one
      :end-before: end-find-one
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

       <Movie: Boyhood>

.. important::

   If your query matches no documents or multiple documents, the ``get()``
   method generates an error. To retrieve one document from a query
   that might match multiple, chain the ``first()`` method to ``filter()``,
   as shown in the following code:

   .. code-block:: python

      Movie.objects.filter(title="Boyhood").first()

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``get()`` method, see `get()
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#get>`__ in the {+framework+}
   documentation.

.. _django-crud-modify:

Modify Documents
----------------

To modify documents in a collection, call the ``filter()`` and ``update()``
methods on your model's manager. Pass a query filter, or criteria that
specifies which documents to update, as an argument to the ``filter()``
method. Then, pass the fields and values you want to update as
arguments to the ``update()`` method.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example calls the ``update()`` method to modify
documents in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The code matches
a document that has a ``title`` value of ``"High Fidelity"`` and adds a
``plot`` field:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
      :start-after: start-update
      :end-before: end-update
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

       // Outputs the number of modified documents
       1

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``update()`` method, see `update()
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#update>`__ in the {+framework+}
   documentation.

.. _django-crud-delete:

Delete Documents
----------------

To delete documents in a collection, call the ``filter()`` and ``delete()``
methods on your model's ``Manager`` class. Pass a query filter,
or criteria that specifies which documents to delete, as an argument to the
``filter()`` method.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example calls the ``delete()`` method to delete documents
in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The code matches
and deletes documents that have a ``runtime`` value of ``5``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/crud.py
      :start-after: start-delete
      :end-before: end-delete
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

       // Outputs the number of deleted documents and objects
       (16, {'sample_mflix.Movie': 16})

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``delete()`` method, see `delete()
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#delete>`__ in the {+framework+}
   documentation.
