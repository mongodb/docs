You can set the following in the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 40 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Setting

    - Description

  * - :guilabel:`Project Name`

    - Sets your project's name.

      .. note::

          You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the 
          project or the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the 
          project's organization to edit the project name.

  * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

    - Sets your project's time zone. This affects the maintenance window
      timezone and alerts, but not the timezone set for individual user
      accounts. [#user-settings]_
      
      .. note::
        
         There is also a :guilabel:`User Preferences` timezone, which 
         only affects the activity feed.

  * - :guilabel:`Connect via Peering Only (GCP and Azure)`

    - Allows you to enable or disable connections between MongoDB
      Atlas dedicated {+clusters+} and public |ipaddr| addresses outside
      of the peered |vpc|/VNet. You can only enable or disable this
      setting when there are no active dedicated GCP or Azure {+clusters+}
      in your project.

      .. important:: Feature Deprecated

         This feature has been deprecated. Existing {+clusters+} can
         continue to use this feature. Use both Standard and Private
         IP for Peering connection strings to connect to your project.
         These connection strings allow you to connect using both
         |vpc|/VNet Peering and allowed public IP addresses. To
         learn more about support for multiple connection strings, see
         :dochub:`this FAQ <atlas-horizon-faq>`.

  * - :guilabel:`Using Custom DNS on AWS with VPC peering`

    - Allows you to expose a second connection string for your
      dedicated |service| {+clusters+} on |aws| that resolves to private IPs.

      Enable this setting if you use custom DNS that cannot take
      advantage of |aws| built-in split-horizon DNS across a VPC peering
      connection.

      .. note::

         |service| displays this setting only when you
         :doc:`enable network peering on AWS </security-vpc-peering>`.

  * - :guilabel:`Multiple Regionalized Private Endpoints`

    - Allows you to create more than one :ref:`Private Endpoint
      <private-endpoint>` in more than one region for multi-region and
      global sharded {+clusters+}.

      Enable this setting if you want to connect to multi-region or
      global sharded {+clusters+} using private endpoints.

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/warnings/regionalized-pls-change-connection-strings.rst

      .. include:: /includes/enable-regionalized-privatelink.rst

  * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

    - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
      statistics in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

  * - :guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time`

    - Set which hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
      maintenance on your cluster.

      To learn more about {+cluster+} maintenance windows, see
      :ref:`configure-maintenance-window`. 

  * - :guilabel:`Real Time Performance Panel`

    - Allows you to see real time metrics from your MongoDB database.

  * - :guilabel:`Data Explorer`

    - Allows you to query your database with an easy-to-use interface.

      .. important::

         .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-de-limitations.rst

  * - :guilabel:`Performance Advisor and Profiler`

    - Allows you to analyze database logs and receive performance
      improvement recommendations.

  * - :guilabel:`Schema Advisor`

    - Allows you to receive customized recommendations to optimize your
      data model and enhance performance.

      Disable this setting to disable schema suggestions in the
      :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` and the
      :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-dbs>`.
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-serverless-schema-advisor.rst

  * - :guilabel:`Enable Extended Storage Sizes`

    - Allows you to configure M40+ {+clusters+} with greater maximum
      storage than the standard limit. Only {+clusters+} which meet the
      following criteria support extended storage:

      - The {+cluster+} is on AWS or GCP
      - The {+cluster+} is either General or Low-CPU class
      - The {+cluster+} is single-region

      .. include:: /includes/fact-extended-storage.rst

  * - :guilabel:`Delete Charts`

    - .. include:: /includes/fact-delete-charts-warning.rst
      
      Allows :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` to delete the
      |charts| instance associated with your project. This setting is
      only visible if you have
      :charts:`created a Charts instance </launch-charts>` for your
      project.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-recreate-charts-instance.rst

  * - :guilabel:`Delete Project`

    - The ``DELETE`` button allows you to delete a project.
