Service account secrets expire after the duration specified :ref:`when created <see-org-api-keys>`, 
anywhere from 8 hours to 365 days. 
When it's time to rotate the secret, |service| returns the alert 
``Service Account Secrets are about to expire``.


.. note::
   
   To configure service account alerts, see :ref:`configure-alerts`.

To rotate your service account secret, complete the following steps to generate a new client secret, 
update your application with the new client secret, and delete the old secret.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      You can generate a new client secret and delete the old one using the {+atlas-ui+}.
