You can use a customer-managed key (CMK) from Google Cloud KMS 
to further encrypt your data at rest in |service|.

|service| uses your |cmk| from Google Cloud KMS 
to encrypt and decrypt MongoDB Master Keys, which are then 
used to encrypt cluster database files and 
:ref:`cloud providers snapshots <backup-cloud-provider>`. To learn more
about how |service| uses |cmk|\s for encryption,
see :ref:`enable-cmk-gcp`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-key-rotation.rst

You must configure customer key management for the |service| project
before enabling it on clusters in that project.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable customer-managed keys with |gcp| |kms| for a MongoDB
project, you must have:

.. include:: /includes/fact-gcp-kms-prereqs.rst

.. _gcp-kms-configure-project:

Enable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must enable customer key management for a project before you can
enable it on a cluster in that project.

.. include:: /includes/steps-configure-gcp-encryption-for-project.rst

.. _gcp-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`gcp-kms-configure-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| cluster that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for clusters in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the
:ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you create the cluster. 

For existing clusters:

.. include:: /includes/steps-cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Alerts
~~~~~~

|service| automatically creates an :alert:`encryption key rotation alert <GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
once you configure customer key management for a project. You can reset this alert at any time by
:ref:`rotating your GCP Key Version Resource ID <gcp-kms-rotate-key>`.

.. _gcp-kms-rotate-key:

Rotate your GCP Key Version Resource ID
---------------------------------------

.. meta::
   :keywords: encryption
   :description: Manage customer keys with Google Cloud KMS to encrypt data at rest in Atlas, including key rotation and enabling encryption for clusters.

.. include:: /includes/unavailable-flex-serverless-m0-m2-m5-clusters.rst

MongoDB Master Key - MongoDB Responsibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-key-rotation.rst

Your |gcp| |cmk| - Your Responsibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| does *not* automatically rotate the Key Version Resource ID
used for |gcp| key management.

As a best practice, |service| creates an :alert:`alert <AWS encryption
key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>` to remind you
to rotate your GCP Key Version Resource ID every 90 days by default when 
you :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <security-gcp-kms>` for the
|service| project. You can configure the time period of this alert.

You can `rotate <https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/rotate-key>`__ your
|gcp| |cmk| yourself or configure your |gcp| |kms| instance to
`automatically rotate
<https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/rotate-key#automatic>`__ 
your |cmk|. If you configure automatic |gcp| |cmk| rotation, the default
time period for rotation is approximately 365 days.

If you have already set up an automatic |cmk| rotation in |gcp| and
don't want to receive the |service| alert to rotate your |cmk| every 90 
days, you can :ref:`modify <configure-alerts>` the default alert period
to be greater than 365 days.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must create a new Service Account Key in the |gcp| account
associated with your |service| project.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure documents how to rotate your |service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new Key Version Resource ID in |service|.

.. include:: /includes/steps-rotate-gcp-encryption-key.rst

Alerts
~~~~~~

|service| resets the
:alert:`encryption key rotation alert <GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
timer at the completion of this procedure.
