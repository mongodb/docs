If you have strict data protection requirements, you can enable a 
{+bcp+} to protect your backup data.

.. _bcp-prohibited-actions:

Prohibited Actions
------------------

If you enable a {+bcp+}, no user, regardless of role, can do the 
following actions:

- Disable the {+bcp+} without MongoDB support. To disable a {+bcp+}, 
  the security or legal representative specified for the {+bcp+} must 
  :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an extensive 
  verification process.

  .. note::

     The only exception applies to empty projects that contain no 
     active or paused {+clusters+} and no retained snapshots from 
     previously terminated {+clusters+}. If a project is empty, users 
     with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role or the 
     :authrole:`Project Owner` role can disable the {+bcp+}.

- Modify the :ref:`backup policy <configure-backup-policy>` for an 
  individual {+cluster+} below the minimum requirements set in the 
  {+bcp+}.

- :ref:`Delete a backup snapshot <delete-snapshot>`.

- Decrease the :ref:`retention time <configure-backup-policy>` for a 
  snapshot after it's taken.

- Disable :ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+} <create-cluster-backups>`.

- Disable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>` if the 
  {+bcp+} has the 
  :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option set 
  to :guilabel:`On` without MongoDB Support. To disable 
  {+PIT-Restore+}, the security or legal representative specified for 
  the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and 
  complete an extensive verification process.

- Reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window <create-pit-policy>` 
  without MongoDB Support. To reduce the {+PIT-Restore+} 
  :guilabel:`Restore Window`, the security or legal representative 
  specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
  <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification process.

- Delete :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` specified in the 
  {+bcp+} without MongoDB Support. To delete policy items specified in 
  the {+bcp+}, the security or legal representative specified for the 
  {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an 
  extensive verification process.

- :ref:`Delete the project <delete-project>` if any snapshots exist. 
  If you can't remove all projects, you can't :ref:`delete the 
  organization <delete-organization>`.

.. _bcp-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

After you enable a {+bcp+}, the following behaviors apply:

- A {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup storage costs. You 
  can't adjust the retention or delete a backup to reduce the 
  backup storage costs. To learn more, 
  see :ref:`atlas-billing`.

- All new and existing {+clusters+} have {+Cloud-Backup+} automatically 
  enabled and use the project-level {+bcp+}. |service| augments any 
  preexisting :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policies 
  <configure-backup-policy>` to meet the minimum requirements of the 
  {+bcp+}. All new {+clusters+} use the {+bcp+} unless the mininum 
  requirements of the :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policy 
  <configure-backup-policy>` expand beyond the mininum requirements of 
  the {+bcp+}.
  
- You can modify the :ref:`{+cluster+}-level backup policies 
  <configure-backup-policy>` at any time. If you reduce the frequency 
  of a {+cluster+}-level backup policy, the change applies only to 
  future backups. Any existing :term:`oplog` remains for the original 
  window. The minimum requirements of the {+bcp+} apply.

- If the {+bcp+} has the 
  :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions`
  option set to :guilabel:`On` and you enable, modify, or 
  delete :ref:`multi-region snapshots <snapshot-distribution>`, any 
  snapshots already taken remain.

- When you :ref:`resume a {+cluster+} <resume-cluster>`, |service| 
  automatically enables {+Cloud-Backup+}. If the {+bcp+} has 
  the :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option 
  set to :guilabel:`On`, |service| automatically enables 
  {+PIT-Restore+} and adjusts the restore window according to the 
  {+bcp+}. |service| automatically modifies the backup to meet the 
  minimum requirements of the {+bcp+}.

- If you :ref:`terminate a {+cluster+} <terminate-cluster>`, |service| 
  maintains all existing snapshots after the termination according to 
  your backup policy. |service| retains the :term:`oplog` for 
  :ref:`restoring a point in time with {+pit-restore+} 
  <recover-pit-continuous-cloud-backup>` in a static state until 
  |service| can no longer use them for {+pit-restore+}.

- If you :ref:`terminate a {+cluster+} <terminate-cluster>`, you can't create another
  {+cluster+} with the same name because |service| uses the name to 
  identify snapshots.   

- Whenever a user enables, modifies, or disables a {+bcp+}, |service| 
  reflects the event in the :ref:`Project Activity Feed 
  <view-activity-feed>`.

Required Access
---------------

To configure a {+bcp+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. 
Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner`` 
to the project before configuring a {+bcp+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Only MongoDB Support can do the following actions:
 
  - Disable the {+bcp+}.
   
  - Disable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>` if the 
    {+bcp+} has the 
    :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option 
    set to :guilabel:`On`.

  - Reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window 
    <create-pit-policy>`.

  - Delete :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` specified in 
    the {+bcp+}.
    
- Only the specified security or legal representative can 
  :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

- You can apply a {+bcp+} to ``M10+`` {+dedicated-clusters+} only.

  .. note::

     You can't convert a {+dedicated-cluster+} to a ``M0`` 
     {+free-clusters+}, an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+shared-cluster+}, or a 
     {+serverless-instance+}.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Enable the {+bcp+}.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-you-cannot-disable-bcp.rst

      a. If it is not already displayed, select the organization that
         contains your desired project from the |ui-org-menu| in the
         navigation bar.

      #. If it is not already displayed, select your desired project
         from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. Next to the :guilabel:`Projects` menu, expand the
         :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`Options` menu, then click 
         :guilabel:`Project Settings`.

      #. Toggle :guilabel:`Data Protection Policy` to :guilabel:`On`.

         The :guilabel:`Edit Data Protection Policy` dialog opens. 

         .. note::

            This {+bcp+} applies as the minimum backup policy to all 
            {+clusters+} in the project. The {+bcp+} protects all 
            existing snapshots. The {+bcp+} prevents any user, 
            regardless of role, from modifying or deleting existing 
            snapshots prior to their expiration. Changes made to this 
            {+bcp+} apply only to future snapshots. If you enable a 
            {+bcp+}, the {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup 
            storage costs. You can't adjust the retention or delete a 
            backup to reduce the backup storage costs.

   .. step:: :ref:`Configure your backup policy <creating-backup-policy>`.

      Each row in the :guilabel:`Backup Policy Frequency and Retention` 
      table represents a backup policy item.

      .. important::

         After you save the {+bcp+}, you can't delete 
         :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` 
         specified in the {+bcp+} without MongoDB Support. To delete 
         policy items specified in the {+bcp+}, the security or legal 
         representative specified for the {+bcp+} must 
         :ref:`request support <request-support>` and complete an 
         extensive verification process. Ensure that you have the 
         correct policy items before you save the {+bcp+}.

      a. Do one of the following steps:
      
         - Select the frequency unit from :guilabel:`Frequency Unit` 
           for a policy item.

         - Click :guilabel:`Add Frequency Unit` to add a new policy 
           item to your backup policy.

      #. Select the frequency for the frequency unit from the
         :guilabel:`Every` column.

      #. Specify the retention time for the policy item in
         the :guilabel:`Retention Time` column and the units for the 
         retention time in the column to the right.

   .. step:: (Optional) :ref:`Configure the restore window <create-pit-policy>`.

      a. Toggle 
         :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` to 
         :guilabel:`On`.
      
      #. Specify a :guilabel:`Restore Window`.

         .. important::

            You can't configure a restore window that is longer than 
            the :ref:`Hourly Snapshot Retention Time 
            <creating-backup-policy>`. After you save this {+bcp+}, you 
            can't change this setting without MongoDB support. To 
            change this setting, the security or legal representative 
            specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
            <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification 
            process.

   .. step:: (Optional) :ref:`Require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters <encrypted-cloud-provider-snapshot>`

      Toggle :guilabel:`Require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters` to :guilabel:`On`.

      .. note::

         To enable this option, you must 
         :ref:`Enable Encryption at Rest <security-kms-encryption>` for 
         all current {+clusters+}. You can't enable this option on 
         :ref:`paused {+clusters+} <paused-cluster-considerations>` 
         that don't have Encryption at Rest enabled.

   .. step:: (Optional) :ref:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions <snapshot-distribution>`.

      You can prevent {+cluster+} users from deleting backups copied to 
      other regions even if you change the 
      :guilabel:`Copy to other regions` option to :guilabel:`Off`. To 
      learn more, see :ref:`snapshot-distribution`.

      - Toggle 
        :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions` to :guilabel:`On`.
     
   .. step:: Confirm and save the {+bcp+}.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-you-cannot-disable-bcp.rst

      #. Specify the :guilabel:`First Name` and :guilabel:`Last Name` 
         of a security or legal representative.

      #. Specify the :guilabel:`Email address of a representative`.

         .. important::

            An invalid or incorrect email address prevents you from 
            modifying or enabling this {+bcp+} until you correct it 
            with MongoDB Support.

      #. If you are *sure* that you want to save the {+bcp+}, specify 
         the project name to continue.

      #. Click the checkbox to confirm that you understand that when 
         you enable a {+bcp+}, no user, regardless of role, can modify 
         or delete backup snapshots. If you enable a {+bcp+}, the 
         {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup storage costs and 
         you can *not* adjust the retention or delete a backup to 
         reduce backup storage costs. Only MongoDB Support can disable 
         a {+bcp+}. Only the specified security or legal representative 
         can :ref:`request support <request-support>` to disable a 
         {+bcp+}.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Confirm and Save`.
