msgid "To sort on multiple fields, create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`. With compound indexes, the results can be in the sorted order of either the full index or an index prefix. An index prefix is a subset of a compound index; the subset consists of one or more fields at the start of the index, in order. For example, given an index ``{ a:1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1 }``, the following subsets are index prefixes:"
