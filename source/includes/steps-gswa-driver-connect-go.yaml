  The following sample application connects to your |service|
  cluster with your connection string and sends a ping to 
  confirm a successful connection. To test the sample application:

  a. Create a new directory called ``connect`` and 
     initialize your project by using the ``go mod`` command.

     .. code-block:: shell

        mkdir connect
        cd connect
        go mod init connect

  #. Run the following commands to download the Go driver 
     and driver dependencies:

     .. code-block:: shell

        go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo
        go get github.com/joho/godotenv
  
  #. In your project, create a new file called ``connect.go`` and paste 
     the following code. Make sure to replace the placeholder with 
     your updated connection string:

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect.go
        :language: go
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 15

  #. To run your application, use the following command:
     
     .. io-code-block::

        .. input::
           :language: bash

           go run connect.go
        
        .. output::
           :language: none
