If you are archiving stale data to save on storage costs, consider
:atlas:`Online Archive </online-archive/manage-online-archive>` in
`MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud?tck=docs_server>`__. Online
Archive automatically archives infrequently accessed data to
fully-managed S3 buckets for cost-effective data tiering.
