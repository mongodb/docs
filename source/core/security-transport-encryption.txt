TLS/SSL Ciphers
---------------

MongoDB's TLS/SSL encryption only allows use of strong TLS/SSL ciphers
with a minimum of 128-bit key length for all connections.

.. _tls-forward-secrecy:

Forward Secrecy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forward Secrecy cipher suites create an ephemeral session key that is
protected by the server's private key but is never transmitted. The use
of an ephemeral key ensures that even if a server's private key is
compromised, you cannot decrypt past sessions with the compromised key.

MongoDB supports Forward Secrecy cipher suites that use Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman (DHE) and Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
(ECDHE) algorithms.

.. _ecdhe:

Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE)
```````````````````````````````````````````````

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 90
   
   * - Platform
     - Level of Support

   * - Linux
   
     - If the Linux platform's OpenSSL supports automatic curve selection, 
       MongoDB enables support for Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
       (ECDHE).
   
       Else if the Linux platform's OpenSSL does not support automatic curve 
       selection, MongoDB attempts to enable ECDHE support using ``prime256v1`` 
       as the named curve.

   * - Windows
   
     - Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) is implicitly supported 
       through the use of Secure Channel (Schannel), the native Windows TLS/SSL 
       library.

   * - macOS
   
     - Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) is implicitly supported 
       through the use of Secure Transport, the native macOS TLS/SSL library.

ECDHE cipher suites are slower than static RSA cipher suites. For
better performance with ECDHE, you can use certificates that use
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (``ECDSA``). See also
:ref:`forward-secrecy-performance` for more information

.. _dhe:

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE)
``````````````````````````````

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 90
   
   * - Platform
     - Level of Support

   * - Linux

     - MongoDB enables support for Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE):

       - If the :parameter:`opensslDiffieHellmanParameters` is set at
         startup (regardless of whether :ref:`ECDHE <ecdhe>` is enabled
         or disabled).

       - Else, if the :parameter:`opensslDiffieHellmanParameters`
         parameter is unset but if :ref:`ECDHE <ecdhe>` is enabled,
         MongoDB enables DHE using the ``ffdhe3072`` parameter, as
         defined in :rfc:`7919#appendix-A.2`.

   * - Windows
   
     - Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) is implicitly supported through the use 
       of Secure Channel (Schannel), the native Windows TLS/SSL library.

   * - macOS

     - Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) is implicitly supported through the use 
       of Secure Transport, the native macOS TLS/SSL library.

.. note::

   If clients negotiate a cipher suite with DHE but cannot accept the
   server selected parameter, the TLS connection fails.
   
   Strong parameters (i.e. size is greater than 1024) are not supported
   with Java 6 and 7 unless extended support has been purchased from
   Oracle. However, Java 7 supports and prefers ECDHE, so will
   negotiate ECDHE if available.

DHE (and ECDHE) cipher suites are slower performance than static
RSA cipher suites, with DHE being significantly slower than ECDHE. See
:ref:`forward-secrecy-performance` for more information.

.. _forward-secrecy-performance:

Forward Secrecy Performance
```````````````````````````

DHE and ECDHE cipher suites are slower than static RSA cipher suites,
with DHE being significantly slower than ECDHE.

For better performance with ECDHE, you can use certificates that
use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (``ECDSA``).
Alternatively, you can disable ECDHE cipher suites with the
:parameter:`opensslCipherConfig` parameter as in the following example
(which also disables DHE)

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --setParameter opensslCipherConfig='HIGH:!EXPORT:!aNULL:!kECDHE:!ECDHE:!DHE:!kDHE@STRENGTH'

If you need to disable support for DHE cipher suites due to
performance, you can use the :parameter:`opensslCipherConfig`
parameter, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --setParameter opensslCipherConfig='HIGH:!EXPORT:!aNULL:!DHE:!kDHE@STRENGTH'

.. |binary| replace:: MongoDB

Certificates
------------

To use TLS/SSL with MongoDB , you must have the TLS/SSL certificates as
:file:`PEM` files, which are concatenated certificate containers.

MongoDB can use any valid TLS/SSL certificate issued by a certificate
authority or a self-signed certificate. For production use, your MongoDB
deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by the 
same certificate authority. You can generate and maintain an independent
certificate authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party 
TLS/SSL vendor.

Using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority allows 
MongoDB drivers to verify the server's identity.

For example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`.

Certificate Expiry Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-certificate-expiry-warning.rst

.. _ocsp-support:

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-ocsp-enabled.rst

To check for certificate revocation, MongoDB :parameter:`enables <ocspEnabled>` 
the use of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) by default. The use of 
OCSP eliminates the need to periodically download a 
:setting:`Certificate Revocation List (CRL) <net.tls.CRLFile>` and restart the
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` with the updated CRL.

As part of its OCSP support, MongoDB supports the following on
Linux:

.. include:: /includes/list-ocsp-support.rst

MongoDB also provides the following OCSP-related parameters:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-ocsp-parameters.rst

You can set these parameters at startup using the
:setting:`setParameter` configuration file setting or the
:option:`--setParameter <mongod --setParameter>` command line option.

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :dbcommand:`rotateCertificates` command
   and :method:`db.rotateCertificates()` method will also refresh any
   stapled OCSP responses.
   
Identity Verification
---------------------

In addition to encrypting connections, TLS/SSL allows for authentication
using certificates, both for :ref:`client authentication
<authentication>` and for :doc:`internal authentication
</core/security-internal-authentication>` of members of replica sets and
sharded clusters.

For more information, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`

FIPS Mode
---------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries
that encrypt and decrypt data securely. You can configure MongoDB to run
with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by
default or as needed from the command line.

For an example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-fips`.

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:
   :hidden:

   Configure mongod & mongos </tutorial/configure-ssl>
   Configure Clients </tutorial/configure-ssl-clients>
   Upgrade Cluster </tutorial/upgrade-cluster-to-ssl>
   Configure for FIPS </tutorial/configure-fips>
