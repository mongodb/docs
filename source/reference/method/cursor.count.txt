.. method:: cursor.count()

   Counts the number of documents referenced by a cursor. Append the
   :method:`~cursor.count()` method to a
   :method:`~db.collection.find()` query to return the number of
   matching documents. The operation does not perform the query but
   instead counts the results that would be returned by the query.

   .. important::

      - Avoid using :method:`~cursor.count()` if the
        :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation is run without a
        query predicate since without the query predicate, these
        :method:`~cursor.count()` returns results based on the
        collection's metadata, which may result in an approximate
        count. In particular, the resulting count will not correctly
        filter out :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` in a
        sharded cluster.

      - For counts based on collection metadata, the
        :ref:`collStats pipeline stage with the count <collstat-count>`
        option is preferred over :dbcommand:`count` and its wrapper
        methods.


   The :method:`~cursor.count()` method has the following
   prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find(<query>).count()

   The :method:`~cursor.count()` method has the following
   parameter:

   MongoDB also provides an equivalent :method:`db.collection.count()`
   as an alternative to the ``db.collection.find(<query>).count()``
   construct.

   MongoDB supports the use of :method:`~cursor.hint()` with
   :method:`~cursor.count()`. See :ref:`count-method-hint` for an
   example.

Examples
--------

The following are examples of the :method:`~cursor.count()` method.

Count All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of all documents in the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find().count()

Count Documents That Match a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of the documents in the
``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt`` greater than ``new
Date('01/01/2012')``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } } ).count()

Limit Documents in Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of the documents in the
``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt`` greater than ``new
Date('01/01/2012')`` *taking into account* the effect of the
``limit(5)``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } } ).limit(5).count(true)

.. _count-method-hint:

Specify the Index to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation uses the index named ``"status_1"``, which has
the index key specification of ``{ status: 1 }``, to return a count of
the documents in the ``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt``
greater than ``new Date('01/01/2012')`` and the ``status`` field is
equal to ``"D"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find(
      { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') }, status: "D" }
   ).hint( "status_1" ).count()
