msgid ""
"Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. "
"Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index "
"for a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:19
msgid ""
"To ensure selectivity, write queries that limit the number of possible "
"documents with the indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately "
"selective relative to your indexed data."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:26
msgid ""
"Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values are "
"``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status`` you've "
"created a low-selectivity index. The index will be of little help in "
"locating records."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:31
msgid ""
"A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a "
":ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the low-"
"selectivity field and another field. For example, you could create a "
"compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:36
msgid ""
"Another option, again depending on your use case, might be to use "
"separate collections, one for each status."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:41
msgid ""
"Consider an index ``{ a : 1 }`` (i.e. an index on the key ``a`` sorted in"
" ascending order) on a collection where ``a`` has three values evenly "
"distributed across the collection:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:57
msgid ""
"If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"no\" }`` MongoDB must scan 3 "
":term:`documents <document>` in the collection to return the one matching"
" result. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: { $gt: 1}, b: \"tv\" }`` must scan"
" 6 documents, also to return one result."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:62
msgid ""
"Consider the same index on a collection where ``a`` has *nine* values "
"evenly distributed across the collection:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:77
msgid ""
"If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"cd\" }``, MongoDB must scan only one "
"document to fulfill the query. The index and query are more selective "
"because the values of ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query can "
"select a specific document using the index."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:82
msgid ""
"However, although the index on ``a`` is more selective, a query such as "
"``{ a: { $gt: 5 }, b: \"tv\" }`` would still need to scan 4 documents."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/create-queries-that-ensure-selectivity.txt:88
msgid ""
"If overall selectivity is low, and if MongoDB must read a number of "
"documents to return results, then some queries may perform faster without"
" indexes. To determine performance, see :ref:`indexes-measuring-use`."
