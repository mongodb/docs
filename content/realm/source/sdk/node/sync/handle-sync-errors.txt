When you use Atlas Device Sync in your Realm app, you can encounter a new class
of errors: :ref:`sync errors <sync-errors>`.

The Realm Node.js SDK can help you detect and handle sync errors. For example,
you can write your own sync error handler to respond to specific errors. You can
also define how your client app handles client resets.

.. _node-set-error-handler:

Sync Error Handler
------------------

You should set an error handler for apps that use Atlas Device Sync. A generic
error handler will detect and respond to failed sync-related API calls to your
Atlas backend.

Add a Generic Sync Error Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set an error handler by registering an error callback function as part of the 
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <types/BaseSyncConfiguration.html#__type.onError>`.

Handle Compensating Write Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want your sync error handler to specifically address compensating write
errors in a way that makes sense for your app. The :js-sdk:`CompensatingWriteError 
<classes/CompensatingWriteError.html>` class can help you identify and react to
compensating write errors in your custom error handler.

Handle Client Reset Errors
--------------------------

A **client reset error** is a scenario where a client realm cannot sync
data with the Atlas App Services backend. Clients in this state may continue to
run and save data locally but cannot send or receive sync changesets
until they perform a client reset.

To learn about the causes of and modes for handling client
resets, check out Device Sync :ref:`Client Resets in the App Services documentation <client-resets>`.

.. _node-automatic-vs-manual-client-reset:

Client Reset Modes
------------------

You can specify which **client reset mode** your app should use
to restore the realm to a syncable state:

- :ref:`Recover unsynced changes mode <node-recover-unsynced-changes>`:
  When you choose this mode, the client attempts to recover unsynced changes.
  Choose this mode when you do not want to fall through to discard unsynced changes.
- :ref:`Recover or discard unsynced changes mode <node-recover-discard-unsynced-changes>`:
  The client first attempts to recover changes that have not yet synced.
  If the client cannot recover unsynced  data, it falls through to
  discard unsynced changes but continues to automatically perform the client reset.
  Choose this mode when you want to enable automatic client
  recovery to fall back to discard unsynced changes.
- :ref:`Discard unsynced changes mode <node-discard-unsynced-changes>`:
  Restores the realm to a syncable state by discarding changes made
  since the last sync.
- :ref:`Manual recovery mode <node-manually-recover-unsynced-changes>`:
  Downloads a new copy of the realm, and moves the unsyncable realm
  to a backup. Migrate unsynced data from the backup copy of the
  realm to the new syncable copy.

Automatic vs. Manual Client Reset
---------------------------------

The Realm SDKs provide client reset modes
that automatically handle most client reset errors.

Automatic client reset modes restore your local realm file to a syncable state without
closing the realm or missing notifications.
The following client reset modes support automatic client resets:

- Recover unsynced changes mode
- Recover or discard unsynced changes mode
- Discard unsynced changes mode

The differences between these modes are based on how they handle
changes on the device that have not yet synced to the backend.
Only manual recovery mode does not perform an automatic client reset.

Choose recover unsynced changes mode to handle most client reset
scenarios automatically. This attempts to recover unsynced changes when a
client reset occurs.

If your app requires specific client reset logic that can't be handled automatically,
you may want or need to :ref:`add a manual client reset handler <node-manually-recover-unsynced-changes>`
to the automatic client reset mode.

.. _node-client-reset-recovery:

Client Reset with Recovery
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

Client Recovery is a feature that is enabled by default when you configure Device Sync.
When Client Recovery is enabled, Realm automatically manages the
client reset process in most cases. The client can recover unsynced changes
when there are no schema changes, or non-breaking schema changes.

To use Client Recovery, configure your realm with one of the following client reset modes:

- Recover unsynced changes mode
- Recover or discard unsynced changes

.. include:: /includes/client-recovery-rules.rst

For more information about configuring Client Recovery, refer to
:ref:`Client Recovery <enable-or-disable-recovery-mode>` in the App Services documentation.

Client Recovery cannot succeed when your app makes breaking schema changes.
A breaking change is a change that you can make in your server-side
schema that requires additional action to handle.
In this scenario, client reset falls back to a
:ref:`manual error client reset fallback <node-manual-client-reset-fallback>`.

For information on breaking vs. non-breaking schema changes, refer to
:ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference` in the App Services documentation.

.. _node-recover-unsynced-changes:

Recover Unsynced Changes Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you choose **recover unsynced changes** mode,
the client attempts to recover unsynced changes with Client Recovery.
Choose this mode when you do not want to fall through to discard unsynced changes.

To handle client resets with the recover unsynced changes mode,
pass a :js-sdk:`ClientResetConfig <types/ClientResetConfig.html>`
to the ``clientReset`` field of your
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <types/BaseSyncConfiguration.html#__type.clientReset>`.
Include these properties in the ``ClientResetConfiguration``:

- ``mode``: Set to ``"recoverUnsyncedChanges"``.
- ``onBefore``: Optional. Callback function invoked before the SDK executes this mode,
  when the SDK receives a client reset error from the backend.
  Provides a copy of the realm.
- ``onAfter``: Optional. Callback function invoked after the SDK successfully
  executes this mode. Provides instances of the realm before and after the client reset.
- ``onFallback``: Optional. Callback function which the SDK invokes
  only if the automatic recovery fails. For more information, refer to the
  :ref:`Manual Client Reset Fallback section <node-manual-client-reset-fallback>`.

The following example implements recover unsynced changes mode:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.recover-unsynced-changes.js
   :language: js

.. _node-recover-discard-unsynced-changes:

Recover or Discard Unsynced Changes Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In **recover or discard unsynced changes** mode,
the client first attempts to recover changes that have not yet synced.
If the client cannot recover unsynced  data, it falls through to
discard unsynced changes but continues to automatically perform the client reset.
Choose this mode when you want to enable automatic client
recovery to fall back to discard unsynced changes.

Do not use recover or discard unsynced changes mode if your application
cannot lose local data that has not yet synced to the backend.

To handle client resets with the recover or discard unsynced changes mode,
pass a :js-sdk:`ClientResetConfig <types/ClientResetConfig.html>`
to the ``clientReset`` field of your
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <types/BaseSyncConfiguration.html#__type.clientReset>`.
Include these properties in the ``ClientResetConfiguration``:

- ``mode``: Set to ``"recoverOrDiscardUnsyncedChanges"``.
- ``onBefore``: Optional. Callback function invoked before the SDK executes this mode,
  when the SDK receives a client reset error from the backend.
  Provides a copy of the realm.
- ``onAfter``: Optional. Callback function invoked after the SDK successfully
  executes this mode. Provides instances of the realm before and after the client reset.
- ``onFallback``: Optional. Callback function which the SDK invokes
  only if both the automatic recovery and and discarding changes fails.
  For more information, refer to the :ref:`Manual Client Reset Fallback section
  <node-manual-client-reset-fallback>`.

The following example implements recover unsynced changes mode:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.recover-or-discard-unsynced-changes.js
   :language: js

.. _node-manual-client-reset-fallback:

Manual Client Reset Fallback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the client reset with recovery cannot complete automatically,
like when there are breaking schema changes, the client reset process falls through
to a manual error handler. This may occur in either of the client reset with recovery modes,
recover unsynced changes and recover or discard unsynced changes.

You must provide a manual client reset implementation
in the ``SyncConfiguration.onFallback()`` callback. ``onFallback()`` takes two
arguments:

- ``session``: :js-sdk:`Session <classes/SyncSession.html>` object representing
  the state of the Device Sync session.
- ``path``: String with the path to the current realm file.

The following example demonstrates how you can manually handle this error case by
discarding all unsynced changes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.recovery-fallback.js
   :language: js

.. _node-discard-unsynced-changes:

Discard Unsynced Changes Mode
-----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.11.0

.. versionchanged:: 10.23.0 Mode renamed from "discardLocal" to "discardUnsyncedChanges". Both currently work, but in a future version, "discardLocal" will be removed. "clientResetBefore" and "clientResetAfter" callbacks renamed to "onBefore" and "onAfter", respectively.

**Discard Unsynced Changes** mode permanently deletes all
local unsynced changes made since the last successful sync.
You might use this mode when your app requires client recovery logic that is not
consistent with :ref:`automatic Client Recovery <node-client-reset-recovery>`,
or when you don't want to recover unsynced data.

Do not use discard unsynced changes mode if your application cannot lose local
data that has not yet synced to the backend.

To handle client resets with the discard unsynced changes mode,
pass a :js-sdk:`ClientResetConfig <types/ClientResetConfig.html>`
to the ``clientReset`` field of your
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <types/BaseSyncConfiguration.html#__type.clientReset>`.
Include these properties in the ``ClientResetConfiguration``:

- ``mode``: Set to ``"discardUnsyncedChanges"``.
- ``onBefore``: Optional. Callback function invoked before the SDK executes this mode,
  when the SDK receives a client reset error from the backend.
  Provides a copy of the realm.
- ``onAfter``: Optional. Callback function invoked after the SDK successfully
  executes this mode. Provides instances of the realm
  before and after the client reset.

The following example implements discard unsynced changes mode:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.discard-unsynced-changes.js
   :language: javascript

.. _node-discard-unsynced-changes-after-breaking-schema-changes:

Discard Unsynced Changes after Breaking Schema Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application experiences a breaking schema change, discard
unsynced changes mode cannot handle the resulting client reset
automatically. Instead, you must provide a manual client reset
implementation in the SyncConfiguration ``error()`` callback. The following
example demonstrates how you can manually handle this error case by
discarding all unsynced changes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.discard-unsynced-changes-after-destructive-schema-changes.js
   :language: javascript

.. note:: Discard with Recovery

   If you'd like to attempt to recover unsynced changes, but but discard
   any changes that cannot be recovered, refer to the
   :ref:`recover or discard unsynced changes mode section <node-recover-discard-unsynced-changes>`.

.. _node-manually-recover-unsynced-changes:

Manual Mode
-----------

.. versionchanged:: 10.23.0 onManual callback added

In **manual** mode, you define your own client reset handler.
You might want to use a manual client reset handler if the Automatic Recovery logic
does not work for your app and you can't discard unsynced local data.

To handle client resets with manual mode,
pass a :js-sdk:`ClientResetConfig <types/ClientResetConfig.html>`
to the ``clientReset`` field of your
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <types/BaseSyncConfiguration.html#__type.clientReset>`.
Include these properties in the ``ClientResetConfiguration``:

- ``mode``: Set to ``"manual"``.
- ``onManual``: Optional. Callback function invoked when the client reset occurs.
  Provides information about the sync session and the path to the current realm.
  If you don't set the ``onManual`` error handler, the client reset error falls
  back to the general sync error handler.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/client-reset.snippet.manual-client-reset-onmanual.js
   :language: js

Manual Data Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To recover data from a manual client reset requires significant amounts
of code, schema concessions, and custom conflict resolution logic.
If you need to implement your own custom client reset logic,
see the :ref:`Advanced Guide to Manual Client Reset Data Recovery
<node-advanced-manual-client-reset-data-recovery>`.
