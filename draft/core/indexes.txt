Synopsis
--------

An index is a data structure that allows you to quickly locate documents
based on the values stored in certain specified fields. Fundamentally, indexes
in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other database systems. MongoDB
supports indexes on any field or sub-field contained in documents
within a MongoDB collection. Consider the following core features of
indexes:

- MongoDB defines indexes on a per-:term:`collection` level.

- Indexes often dramatically increase the performance of queries;
  however, each index creates a slight overhead for every write
  operation.

- Every query, including update operations, use one and only one
  index. The query optimizer selects the index empirically, by
  occasionally running alternate query plans, and selecting the plan
  with the best response time for each query type.  You can override
  the query optimizer using the :func:`cursor.hint()` method.

- You can create indexes on a single field or on multiple fields using
  a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`.

- When the index covers queries, the database returns results more
  quickly than queries that have to scan many individual documents. An
  index "covers" a query if the keys of the index stores all the data
  that the query must return.

- Using queries with good index coverage will reduce the number of full
  documents that MongoDB needs to store in memory, thus maximizing database
  performance and throughput.

Continue reading for a complete overview of indexes in MongoDB,
including the :ref:`types of indexes <index-types>`, basic
:ref:`operations with indexes <index-operations>`, and other MongoDB
:ref:`features <index-features>` implemented using indexes.

Index Types
-----------

All indexes in MongoDB are "B-Tree" indexes. In the :program:`mongo`
shell, the helper :func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`
provides a method for creating indexes. This section provides an
overview of the types of indexes available in MongoDB as well as an
introduction to their use.

.. index:: _id index
.. index:: _id
.. index:: index; _id
.. index:: index types; primary
.. _index-type-primary:

_id
~~~

The ``_id`` index is a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
[#unique-index-report]_ on the ``_id`` field, and MongoDB creates this
index by default on all collections, except for capped collections. [#capped-collections]_
You cannot delete the index on ``_id``.

The ``_id`` field is the :term:`primary key` for the collection, and
every document *must* have a unique ``_id`` field. You may store any
unique value in the ``_id`` field. The default value of ``_id`` is
:term:`ObjectID` on every :func:`insert` operation. :term:`ObjectIds`
are 12-byte, unique identifiers, that make suitable ``_id`` values.

.. note::

   In :term:`shard clusters <shard cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field
   to prevent errors.  This is most-often done by using the standard
   auto-generated :term:`ObjectIds`.

.. [#unique-index-report] Although the index on ``_id`` *is* unique,
   the :func:`getIndexes() <db.collection.getIndexes()>` method will
   *not* print ``unique: true`` in the :program:`mongo` shell.

.. [#capped-collections] Capped collections are special collections
   that do not have an ``_id`` index by default. If you specify
   ``autoIndexId: true`` when creating a capped collection MongoDB will
   create an ``_id`` index on this collection. Replica set members may
   create ``_id`` indexes on capped collections during the replication
   process.

.. TODO fix the above when a full capped-collection page exists.

.. _index-types-secondary:

Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All indexes other than the index on the ``_id`` field are
:term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`. You can create indexes on
any field within any document or sub-document. Additionally, you can
create compound indexes with multiple fields, so that a single query
can match multiple components using the index without needing to scan
(as many) actual documents.

In general, you should have secondary indexes that support all of your
primary, common, and user-facing queries and require MongoDB to scan
the fewest number of documents possible.

To create a secondary index, use the :func:`ensureIndex()`
method. The argument to :func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` will resemble the following
in the MongoDB shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "field": 1 }
   { "field0.field1": 1 }
   { "field0": 1, "field1": 1 }

For each field in the index you will specify either ``1`` for an
ascending order or ``-1`` for a descending order, which represents the
order of the keys in the index. For indexes with more than one key
(i.e. "compound indexes,") the sequence of fields is important.

Embedded Fields
```````````````

You can create indexes on fields that exist in sub-documents within
your collection. Consider the collection ``people`` that holds
documents that resemble the following example document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"_id": ObjectId(...)
    "name": "John Doe"
    "address": {
              "street": "Main"
              "zipcode": 53511
              "state": "WI"
             }
   }

You can create an index on the ``address.zipcode`` field, using the
following specification:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { "address.zipcode": 1 } )

Introspecting sub-documents in this way is commonly called "dot
notation."

.. _index-type-compound:

Compound Indexes
````````````````

MongoDB supports "compound indexes," where a single index structure
holds references to multiple fields within a collection's
documents. Consider the collection ``products`` that holds documents
that resemble the following example document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...)
    "item": "Banana"
    "category": ["food", "produce", "grocery"]
    "stock": 4
    "type": cases
    "arrival": Date(...)
   }

Most queries probably select on the ``item`` field, but a significant
number of queries will also check the ``stock`` field. You can
specify a single compound index to support both of these queries:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "item": 1, "stock": 1 } )

MongoDB will be able to use this index to support queries that select
the ``item`` field as well as those queries that select the ``item``
field **and** the ``stock`` field. However, this index will not
be useful for queries that select *only* the ``stock`` field.

.. note::

   The order of fields in a compound index is very important. In the
   previous example, the index will contain references to documents
   sorted by the values of the ``item`` field, and within each item,
   sorted by values of the ``stock`` field.

.. _index-ascending-and-descending:

Ascending and Descending
````````````````````````

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending or descending
order. For single-field indexes, the order of keys doesn't matter,
because MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction. However,
for compound indexes, if you need to order results against two fields,
sometimes you need the index fields running in opposite order relative
to each other.

To specify an index with a descending order, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "field": -1 } )

More typically in the context of a :ref:`compound
index<index-type-compound>`, the specification would resemble the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "field0": 1, "field1": -1 } )

Consider a collection of event data that includes both usernames and a
timestamp. If you want to return a list of events sorted by username
and then with the most recent events first. To create this index, use
the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.ensureIndex( { "username" : 1, "timestamp" : -1 } )

.. _index-types-multikey:

Multikey
````````

If you index a field that contains an array, you will create a
multikey index, which adds entries to the index for *every* item in
the array. Consider a ``feedback`` collection with documents in the
following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...)
    "title": "Grocery Quality"
    "comments": [
       { author_id: ObjectId(..)
         date: Date(...)
         text: "Please expand the cheddar selection." },
       { author_id: ObjectId(..)
         date: Date(...)
         text: "Please expand the mustard selection." },
       { author_id: ObjectId(..)
         date: Date(...)
         text: "Please expand the olive selection." }
    ]
   }

An index on the ``comments.text`` field would be a multikey index, and will
add items to the index for all of the sub-documents in the array. As a
result you will be able to run the following query, using only the
index to locate the document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.feedback.find( { "comments.text": "Please expand the olive selection." } )

.. include:: /includes/note-build-indexes-on-replica-sets.rst

.. warning::

   MongoDB will refuse to insert documents into a compound index where
   more than one field is an array (i.e. ``{a: [1, 2], b: [1, 2]}``);
   however, MongoDB permits documents in collections with compound
   indexes where only one field per compound index is an array
   (i.e. ``{a: [1, 2], b: 1}`` and ``{a: 1, b: [1, 2]}``.)

.. _index-type-unique:

Unique Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A unique index causes MongoDB to reject all documents that
contain a duplicate value for the indexed field. To create a unique index
on the ``user_id`` field of the ``members`` collection, use the
following operation in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.addresses.ensureIndex( { "user_id": 1 }, { unique: true } )

If you use the unique constraint on a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` then MongoDB will enforce uniqueness on the
*combination* of values, rather than the individual value for any or all
values of the key.

If a document does not have a value for the indexed field in a unique
index, the index will store a null value for this document. MongoDB
will only permit one document without a unique value in the collection
because of this unique constraint. You can combine with the
:ref:`sparse index <index-type-sparse>` to filter these null values
from the unique index.

.. index:: index; sparse
.. _index-type-sparse:

Sparse Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the
indexed field. By contrast, non-sparse indexes contain all documents
in a collection, and store null values for documents that do not
contain the indexed field. Create a sparse index on the ``xmpp_id``
field, of the ``members`` collection, using the following operation in
the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.addresses.ensureIndex( { "xmpp_id": 1 }, { sparse: true } )

.. warning::

   Using these indexes will sometimes result in incomplete results
   when filtering or sorting results, because sparse indexes are not
   complete for all documents in a collection.

.. note::

   Sparse indexes in MongoDB are not to be confused with `block-level`_
   indexes in other databases. Think of them as dense indexes with a
   specific filter.

   You can combine the sparse index option with the :ref:`unique
   indexes <index-type-unique>` option so that :program:`mongod` will
   reject documents that have duplicate values for a field, but that
   ignore documents that do not have the key.

   .. _`block-level`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_%28database%29#Sparse_index>

.. _index-operations:

Index Creation Options
----------------------

Most parameters [#index-parameters]_ to the :func:`ensureIndex()
<db.collection.ensureIndex()>` operation affect the kind of index that
MongoDB creates. Two options, :ref:`background construction
<index-creation-background>` and :ref:`duplicate dropping
<index-creation-duplicate-dropping>`, affect how MongoDB builds the
indexes.

.. [#index-parameters] Other functionality accessible by way of
   parameters include :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`, :ref:`unique
   <index-type-unique>`, and :ref:`TTL <index-feature-ttl>`.

.. _index-creation-background:

Background Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO redirect background indexing page here
   http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexing+as+a+Background+Operation

By default, creating an index is a blocking operation. Building an
index on a large collection of data, the operation can take a long
time to complete. To resolve this issue, the background option can
allow you to continue to use your :program:`mongod` instance during
the index build. Create an index in the background of the ``zipcode``
field of the ``people`` collection using a command that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { zipcode: 1}, {background: true} )

You can combine the background option with other options, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { zipcode: 1}, {background: true, sparse: true } )

Be aware of the following behaviors with background index
construction:

- A single :program:`mongod` can only build a single index at a time.

- The indexing operation runs in the background so that other database
  operations can run while creating the index. However, the
  :program:`mongo` shell session or connection where you are creating
  the index will block until the index build is complete. Open another
  connection or :program:`mongo` instance to continue using commands
  to the database.

- The background index operation use an incremental approach that is
  slower than the normal "foreground" index builds. If the index is
  larger than the available RAM, then the incremental process
  can take *much* longer than the foreground build.

.. admonition:: Building Indexes on Secondaries

   Background index operations on a :term:`replica set`
   :term:`primary`, become foreground indexing operations on secondary
   members of the set. All indexing operations on secondaries block
   replication.

   To build large indexes on secondaries the best approach is to
   restart one secondary at a time in "standalone" mode and build the
   index. After building the index, restart as a member of the
   replica set, allow it to catch up with the other members of the
   set, and then build the index on the next secondary. When all the
   secondaries have the new index, step down the primary, restart it
   as a standalone, and build the index on the former primary.

   Remember, the amount of time required to build the index on a
   secondary node must be within the window of the :term:`oplog`, so
   that the secondary can catch up with the primary.

   See :ref:`index-building-replica-sets` for more information on
   this process.

  Indexes on secondary members in "recovering" mode are always built
  in the foreground to allow them to catch up as soon as possible.

  .. TODO create tutorials for the replica set reindexing
     http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Building+indexes+with+replica+sets

.. note::

   Administrative operations such as :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` and
   :dbcommand:`compact` will not run concurrently with a background
   index build.

Queries will not use these indexes until the index build is complete.

.. _index-creation-duplicate-dropping:

Duplicate Dropping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB cannot create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on a
field that has duplicate values. To force the creation of a unique
index, you can specify the ``dropDups`` option, which will only index
the first occurrence of a value for the key, and delete all subsequent
values.

.. warning::

   As in all unique indexes, if a document does not have the indexed
   field, MongoDB will include it in the index with a "null" value.

   If subsequent fields *do not* have the indexed field, and you have
   set ``{dropDups: true}``, MongoDB will remove these documents from
   the collection when creating the index. If you combine ``dropDups``
   with the :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` option, this index will
   only include documents in the index that have the value, and the
   documents without the field will remain in the database.

To create a unique index that drops duplicates on the ``username``
field of the ``accounts`` collection, use a command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.ensureIndex( { username: 1 }, { unique: true, dropDups: true } )

.. warning::

   Specifying ``{ dropDups: true }`` will delete data from your
   database. Use with extreme caution.

Index Features
--------------

.. _index-feature-ttl:

TTL Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~

TTL indexes are special indexes that MongoDB can use to automatically
remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of
time. This is ideal for some types of information like machine
generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to
persist in a database for a limited amount of time.

These indexes have the following limitations:

- Compound indexes are *not* supported.

- The indexed field **must** be a date :term:`type <bson type>`.

- If the field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed data
  in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest*
  (i.e. earliest) matches the expiration threshold.

.. include:: /includes/note-ttl-collection-background-timing.rst

In all other respects, TTL indexes are normal :ref:`secondary indexes
<index-types-secondary>`, and if appropriate, MongoDB can use these
indexes to fulfill arbitrary queries.

.. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data`

.. _index-feature-geospatial:

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides "geospatial indexes" to support location-based and
other similar queries in a two dimensional coordinate systems. For
example, use geospatial indexes when you need to take a collection of
documents that have coordinates, and return a number of options that
are "near" a given coordinate pair.

To create a geospatial index, your :term:`documents <document>` must
have a coordinate pair. For maximum compatibility, these coordinate
pairs should be in the form of a two element array, such as ``[ x , y
]``. Given the field of ``loc``, that held a coordinate pair, in the
collection ``places``, you would create a geospatial index as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { loc : "2d" } )

MongoDB will reject documents that have values in the ``loc`` field
beyond the minimum and maximum values.

.. note::

   MongoDB permits only one geospatial index per collection. Although,
   MongoDB will allow clients to create multiple geospatial indexes, a
   single query can use only one index.

See the :operator:`$near`, and the database command
:dbcommand:`geoNear` for more information on accessing geospatial
data.

.. TODO insert link to special /core/geospatial.txt documentation
   on this topic. once that document exists.

Geohaystack Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO update links in the following session as needed:

In addition to conventional :ref:`geospatial indexes
<index-feature-geospatial>`, MongoDB also provides a bucket-based
geospatial index, called "geospatial haystack indexes." These indexes
support high performance queries for locations within a small area,
when the query must filter along another dimension.

.. example::

   If you need to return all documents that have coordinates within 25
   miles of a given point *and* have a type field value of "museum," a
   haystack index would be provide the best support for these queries.

Haystack indexes allow you to tune your bucket size to the
distribution of your data, so that in general you search only very
small regions of 2d space for a particular kind of document. These
indexes are not suited for finding the closest documents to a
particular location, when the closest documents are far away compared
to bucket size.

Index Limitations
-----------------

Be aware of the following current limitations of MongoDB's indexes:

- A collection may have no more than :ref:`64 indexes <limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection>`.

- Index keys can be no larger than :ref:`1024 bytes <limit-index-size>`.

  This includes the field value or values, the field name or names,
  and the :term:`namespace`.

- The name of an index, including the :term:`namespace` must be
  shorter than :ref:`128 characters <limit-index-name-length>`.

- Indexes have storage requirements, and impacts insert/update speed
  to some degree.

- Create indexes to support queries and other operations, but do not
  maintain indexes that your MongoDB instance cannot or will not use.
