MongoDB Limits and Thresholds
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document provides a collection of hard and soft limitations of
the MongoDB system.

BSON Documents
--------------

.. _limit-bson-document-size:
.. limit:: BSON Document Size

   .. include:: /includes/fact-document-max-size.rst

.. _limit-nested-depth:
.. limit:: Nested Depth for BSON Documents

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2

   MongoDB supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for :term:`BSON
   documents <document>`.

Namespaces
----------

.. _limit-namespace-length:
.. limit:: Namespace Length

   Each namespace, including database and collection name, must be
   shorter than 123 bytes.

   .. fix when we know what the actual limit is.

.. _limit-number-of-namespaces:
.. limit:: Number of Namespaces

   The limitation on the number of namespaces is the size of the
   namespace file divided by 628.

   A 16 megabyte namespace file can support approximately 24,000
   namespaces. Each collection and index is a namespace.

.. _limit-size-of-namespace-file:
.. limit:: Size of Namespace File

   Namespace files can be no larger than 2047 megabytes.

   By default namespace files are 16 megabytes. You can configure the
   size using the :setting:`nssize` option.

.. _index-limitations:

Indexes
-------

.. _limit-index-size:
.. limit:: Index Key

   The *total size* of an index key entry, which can include structural
   overhead depending on the BSON type, must be *less than* 1024 bytes.

   .. COMMENT refer to src/mongo/db/structure/btree/key.cpp (KeyV1Owned::KeyV1Owned)

   .. |limit| replace:: :limit:`index key limit <Index Key>`

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6

      .. include:: /includes/list-index-field-limit-behaviors.rst

.. _limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection:
.. limit:: Number of Indexes per Collection

   A single collection can have *no more* than 64 indexes.

.. _limit-index-name-length:
.. limit:: Index Name Length

   The names of indexes, including their namespace (i.e database and
   collection name), cannot be longer than 125 characters. The default
   index name is the concatenation of the field names and index
   directions.

   You can explicitly specify an index name to the
   :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` helper if the default index
   name is too long.

   .. The actual maximum length of an index is 128 characters,
      however, there are three characters of required punctuation
      hence the 125 figure.

.. limit:: Number of Indexed Fields in a Compound Index

   There can be no more than 31 fields in a compound index.

.. limit:: Queries cannot use both text and Geospatial Indexes

   .. |operation| replace:: :dbcommand:`text` command

   .. include:: /includes/fact-special-indexes-and-text.rst

   .. TODO remove in the 2.6 version of the manual

.. seealso:: The unique indexes limit in :ref:`limits-sharding-operations`.

Data
----

.. limit:: Maximum Number of Documents in a Capped Collection

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4

   If you specify a maximum number of documents for a capped
   collection using the ``max`` parameter to
   :dbcommand:`create`, the limit must be less than 2\ :sup:`32`
   documents. If you do not specify a maximum number of documents when
   creating a capped collection, there is no limit on the number of
   documents.

.. _limit-data-size:
.. limit:: Data Size

   A single :program:`mongod` instance cannot manage a data set that
   exceeds maximum virtual memory address space provided by the
   underlying operating system.

   .. list-table:: Virtual Memory Limitations
      :widths: 15 10 10
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Operating System
        - Journaled
        - Not Journaled
      * - Linux
        - 64 terabytes
        - 128 terabytes
      * - Windows
        - 4 terabytes
        - 8 terabytes

.. limit:: Number of Collections in a Database

   The maximum number of collections in a database is a function of
   the size of the namespace file and the number of indexes of
   collections in the database.

   See :limit:`Number of Namespaces` for more information.

Replica Sets
------------

.. limit:: Number of Members of a Replica Set

   Replica sets can have no more than 12 members.

.. limit:: Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set

   Only 7 members of a replica set can have votes at any given
   time. See can vote :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members` for more information

.. _limits-sharding:

Sharded Clusters
----------------

Sharded clusters have the restrictions and thresholds described here.

.. _limits-sharding-operations:

Sharding Operational Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Operations Unavailable in Sharded Environments

   The :dbcommand:`group` does not work with sharding. Use
   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` or :dbcommand:`aggregate` instead.

   :method:`db.eval()` is incompatible with sharded collections. You may
   use :method:`db.eval()` with un-sharded collections in a shard
   cluster.

   :query:`$where` does not permit references to the ``db`` object
   from the :query:`$where` function. This is uncommon in
   un-sharded collections.

   The :update:`$isolated` update modifier does not work in sharded
   environments.

   :operator:`$snapshot` queries do not work in sharded environments.

   The :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command is not supported in sharded
   environments.

.. limit:: Covered Queries in Sharded Clusters

   MongoDB does not support :ref:`covered queries <covered-queries>`
   from sharded collections.

.. limit:: Sharding Existing Collection Data Size

   For existing collections that hold documents, MongoDB supports
   enabling sharding on *any* collections that contains less than 256
   gigabytes of data. MongoDB *may* be able to shard collections with as
   many as 400 gigabytes depending on the distribution of document
   sizes. The precise size of the limitation is a function of the
   chunk size and the data size.

   .. important:: Sharded collections may have *any* size, after
      successfully enabling sharding.

.. limit:: Single Document Modification Operations in Sharded Collections

   .. |single-modification-operation-names| replace:: :method:`~db.collection.update()` and :method:`~db.collection.remove()`
   .. |single-modification-operation-option| replace:: ``justOne`` or ``multi: false``

   .. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst

.. _limit-sharding-unique-indexes:

.. limit:: Unique Indexes in Sharded Collections

   MongoDB does not support unique indexes across shards, except when
   the unique index contains the full shard key as a prefix of the
   index. In these situations MongoDB will enforce uniqueness across
   the full key, not a single field.

   .. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-unique-keys-for-sharded-collections`
      for an alternate approach.

.. _limits-shard-keys:

Shard Key Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Shard Key Size

   A shard key cannot exceed 512 bytes.

.. limit:: Shard Key is Immutable

   You cannot change a shard key after sharding the collection. If
   you must change a shard key:

   - Dump all data from MongoDB into an external format.

   - Drop the original sharded collection.

   - Configure sharding using the new shard key.

   - :doc:`Pre-split </tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` the shard
     key range to ensure initial even distribution.

   - Restore the dumped data into MongoDB.

.. limit:: Shard Key Value in a Document is Immutable

   After you insert a document into a sharded collection, you cannot
   change the document's value for the field or fields that comprise
   the shard key. The :method:`~db.collection.update()` operation will
   not modify the value of a shard key in an existing document.

.. limit:: Monotonically Increasing Shard Keys Can Limit Insert Throughput

   For clusters with high insert volumes, a shard keys with
   monotonically increasing and decreasing keys can affect insert
   throughput. If your shard key is the ``_id`` field, be aware that
   the default values of the ``_id`` fields are :term:`ObjectIds
   <ObjectId>` which have generally increasing values.

   When inserting documents with monotonically increasing shard keys, all
   inserts belong to the same :term:`chunk` on a single
   :term:`shard`. The system will eventually divide the
   chunk range that receives all write operations
   and migrate its contents to distribute data more evenly. However, at any
   moment the cluster can direct insert operations only to a single
   shard, which creates an insert throughput bottleneck.

   If the operations on the cluster are predominately read operations
   and updates, this limitation may not affect the cluster.

   To avoid this constraint, use a :ref:`hashed shard key
   <sharding-hashed-sharding>`  or select a field that does not
   increase or decrease monotonically.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      :ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` and
      :ref:`hashed indexes <index-type-hashed>` store hashes of keys
      with ascending values.

Operations
----------

.. _limit-sort:
.. limit:: Sorted Documents

   MongoDB will only return sorted results on fields without an index
   *if* the sort operation uses less than 32 megabytes of memory.

.. _limit-agg-sort:

.. limit:: Aggregation Pipeline Operation

   .. include:: /includes/fact-agg-memory-limit.rst

.. limit:: 2d Geospatial queries cannot use the $or operator

   .. see:: :query:`$or` and :doc:`/core/geospatial-indexes`.

.. limit:: Spherical Polygons must fit within a hemisphere.

   .. |geo-operator-method| replace:: :query:`$geoIntersects` or :query:`$geoWithin`

   .. include:: /includes/fact-geometry-hemisphere-limitation.rst

.. limit:: Bulk Operation Size

   A bulk operation can have at most 1000 operations.

Naming Restrictions
-------------------

.. limit:: Database Name Case Sensitivity

   Database names are case sensitive even if the underlying file
   system is case insensitive. MongoDB does not permit database names
   that differ only by the case of the characters.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Windows

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      :ref:`rn-2.2-database-name-restriction-windows`.

   For MongoDB deployments running on Windows, MongoDB will not permit
   database names that include any of the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

         /\. "*<>:|?

   Also, database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Unix and Linux Systems

   For MongoDB deployments running on Unix and Linux systems, MongoDB
   will not permit database names that include any of the following
   characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      /\. "

   Also, database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Length of Database Names

   Database names cannot be empty and must have fewer than 64
   characters.

.. limit:: Restriction on Collection Names

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   Collection names should begin with an underscore or a letter
   character, and *cannot*:

   - contain the ``$``.

   - be an empty string (e.g. ``""``).

   - contain the null character.

   - begin with the ``system.`` prefix. (Reserved for internal use.)

   In the :program:`mongo` shell, use :method:`db.getCollection()` to
   specify collection names that might interact with the shell or are
   not valid JavaScript.

.. _limit-restrictions-on-field-names:

.. limit:: Restrictions on Field Names

   Field names cannot contain dots (i.e. ``.``), dollar signs
   (i.e. ``$``), or null characters. See
   :ref:`faq-dollar-sign-escaping` for an alternate approach.
