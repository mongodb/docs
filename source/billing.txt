{+adl+} Costs
---------------------

You incur |service| |data-lake| costs for the following items:

- Storage on the cloud object storage
- Data processed by |data-lake|
- Data returned by |data-lake|

Total Data Processed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that |data-lake| 
processes from your |aws| S3 buckets, rounded up to the nearest 
megabyte. |service| charges **$5.00 per TB** of processed data, with a 
minimum of **10 MB** or **$0.00005 per query**.

.. include:: /includes/fact-partition-cost-benefit.rst

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |aws| |s3| to
reduce the amount of processed data.

Total Data Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned by
|data-lake|. This total is the sum of the following data transfers:

- The number of bytes transferred between |data-lake| service nodes
- The number of bytes transferred from |data-lake| to the client

Returned data is billed as outlined in the :guilabel:`Data Transfer
Fees` section of the `Atlas pricing page 
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing?tck=docs_atlas>`_. The 
cost of data transfer depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges 
for same-region, region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer.
