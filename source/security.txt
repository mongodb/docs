Maintaining a secure MongoDB deployment requires administrators to
implement controls to ensure that users and applications have
access to only the data that they require. MongoDB provides features that
allow administrators to implement these controls and restrictions for
any MongoDB deployment.

If you are already familiar with security and MongoDB security
practices, consider the :doc:`/administration/security-checklist` for a
collection of recommended actions to protect a MongoDB deployment.
