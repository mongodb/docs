|service| secures your databases through TLS/SSL, virtual private cloud
(VPC), whitelists, and user authentication and access control.

.. _security-tls:

TLS/SSL
-------

|service| uses TLS/SSL to encrypt the connections to your databases.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

.. _whitelist:
.. _add-to-whitelist:

Add IP Addresses to the Whitelist
---------------------------------

|service| allows client connections to the cluster only from IP
addresses on the group's whitelist; i.e. a client can connect to the
MongoDB deployment only from an IP address on this list. The whitelist
applies to all clusters in the group and can have up to 20 entries. Each
entry is either a single IP address or a CIDR-notated range of addresses.

To add an IP address or an address range to the whitelist, from the
:guilabel:`Clusters` view, select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then
click :guilabel:`IP Whitelist`, then :guilabel:`Add IP Address`.

.. _mongodb-users:

Create a New MongoDB User for the Cluster
-----------------------------------------

Create MongoDB users to provide clients access to the clusters in your
group. A MongoDB user's access is determined by the roles assigned to
the user. When you create a MongoDB user, the user is added to all
clusters in your |service| group.

To create a new MongoDB user, from the :guilabel:`Clusters` view,
select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then click :guilabel:`Users`, then
:guilabel:`Add New User`.

MongoDB users are separate from |service| users. MongoDB users have
access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users access to the
|service| application itself.
