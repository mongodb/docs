title: Configure the package management system (``zypper``).
stepnum: 1
ref: config-zypper
pre: |
  Add the repository so that you can install MongoDB using ``zypper``.
action:
  - pre: |
      Run the command appropriate for your version of SUSE:

      SUSE 11
        .. code-block:: sh

            sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.com/zypper/suse/11/mongodb-enterprise/3.2/x86_64/" mongodb

      SUSE 12
        .. code-block:: sh

           sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.com/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-enterprise/3.2/x86_64/" mongodb
  - pre: |
      If you'd like to install MongoDB packages from a previous :ref:`release
      series <release-version-numbers>`, such as 2.6, you can
      specify the release series in the repository configuration. For
      example, to restrict your SUSE 11 system to the 2.6 release series,
      use the following command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck https://repo.mongodb.com/zypper/suse/11/mongodb-enterprise/2.6/x86_64/ mongodb

title: Install the MongoDB packages and associated tools.
stepnum: 2
ref: install
pre: |
  When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
  release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper -n install mongodb-enterprise
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-enterprise.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
      will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
      command:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock-enterprise.rst
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
