Payment and Usage Details
-------------------------

:ref:`Current invoices <view-current-invoice>` and
:ref:`past invoices <view-past-invoices>` include payment details,
such as paid and pending charges, and usage details for each of your
MongoDB services.

You can find the following information in the :guilabel:`Payment Details`
and the :guilabel:`Usage Details` sections of your invoices:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Section
     - Contents

   * - :guilabel:`Payment Details`
     - Lists :ref:`payment methods <atlas-billing-methods>`, which may
       include |service| credits from a prepaid or promotional
       :ref:`subscription <activate-subscription>`, a monthly commitment
       subscription, a marketplace subscription, PayPal, or a credit card.

       For each payment method, lists:
       
       - The :guilabel:`Date` when |service| issued the charge.
       - The current :ref:`payment status <payment-statuses>`.
       - The usage (the amount you have used).
       - The billed usage (the amount you are being billed for).
       - The total amount (the unit price multiplied by billed usage,
         plus tax).
       - The amount due.
       - The :guilabel:`Action` that you can click. Actions can be one of
         the following:

         - :guilabel:`PDF` for downloading the PDF of the tax invoice that
           you receive by email.
         
           This PDF contains the charges for the specific payment in the
           invoice. This PDF differs from the invoice-level PDF that you
           download when viewing your current invoice. The invoice-level
           PDF provides usage details for the entire invoice.

         - :guilabel:`VIEW DETAILS`. View your subscription details.
         - :guilabel:`PAY NOW`. Pay your bill directly if you are a
           YayPay customer.
         - :guilabel:`RETRY`. :ref:`Retry the failed payment
           <retry-failed-payment>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Usage Details`
     - Lists all line item details for each month's bill. This is a
       granular breakout of all services that are invoiced, including
       dates used and billed, quantity (the number of server hours),
       the project, the unit price, and the amount. You can download the
       usage details as a CSV.

.. _resource-tags-on-invoices:

Resource Tags on Invoices
-------------------------

You can use :ref:`resource tags <configure-resource-tags>`
to help categorize your costs. Resource tags appear on invoice |csv| files. 
For each tag key, |service| adds another column to your CSV file 
with the header ``Tag/<your key>`` and the cell value ``<your value>``.

For instructions on downloading your invoice as a CSV file,
see :ref:`download-current-invoice`.

To learn more about configuring resource tags for a deployment,
see :ref:`database-deployment-tags`.

.. include:: /includes/billing/fact-tag-snapshot.rst

You can also get a list of resource tags for a deployment
by retrieving deployment details with the 
|service| :ref:`Admin API <atlas-admin-api-ref>`, or view your
tags in the |service| console.

.. _troubleshoot-invoice-payment:

Troubleshoot Invoices and Payments
----------------------------------

If a payment fails, try the following:

1. :ref:`Retry the failed payment <retry-failed-payment>`.

#. Ensure your :ref:`payment method <payment-method>` has 
   sufficient funds and supports payments made in |usd|.

#. Speak with your bank or credit card issuer to ensure your payment 
   method is authorized to make transactions with MongoDB.

#. Use an alternative :ref:`payment method <payment-method>`.

#. :ref:`Request support <request-support>` through the 
   |service| console.
