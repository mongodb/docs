Find Inconsistent Indexes across Shards
---------------------------------------

A sharded collection has an inconsistent index if the collection does
not have the exact same indexes (including the index options) on each
shard that contains chunks for the collection. Although inconsistent
indexes should not occur during normal operations, inconsistent indexes
can occur , such as:

- When a user is creating an index with a ``unique`` key constraint and
  one shard contains a chunk with duplicate documents. In such cases,
  the create index operation may succeed on the shards without
  duplicates but not on the shard with duplicates.
  
- When a user is creating an index across the shards in a :doc:`rolling
  manner (i.e. manually building the index one by one across the
  shards) </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` but either
  fails to build the index for an associated shard or incorrectly
  builds an index with different specification.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4 (and 4.2.6), the :doc:`config server
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` primary, by default, checks for
index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections, and
the command :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, when run on the config server
primary, returns the field :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency`
field to report on the number of sharded collections with index
inconsistencies.

If :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` reports any index
inconsistencies, you can run the following pipeline for your
sharded collections until you find the inconsistencies.

.. note::

   The following pipeline is for MongoDB 4.2.4 and above.

#. Define the following :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      const pipeline = [
          // Get indexes and the shards that they belong to.
          {$indexStats: {}},
          // Attach a list of all shards which reported indexes to each document from $indexStats.
          {$group: {_id: null, indexDoc: {$push: "$$ROOT"}, allShards: {$addToSet: "$shard"}}},
          // Unwind the generated array back into an array of index documents.
          {$unwind: "$indexDoc"},
          // Group by index name.
          {
              $group: {
                  "_id": "$indexDoc.name",
                  "shards": {$push: "$indexDoc.shard"},
                  // Convert each index specification into an array of its properties 
                  // that can be compared using set operators.
                  "specs": {$push: {$objectToArray: {$ifNull: ["$indexDoc.spec", {}]}}},
                  "allShards": {$first: "$allShards"}
              }
          },
          // Compute which indexes are not present on all targeted shards and 
          // which index specification properties aren't the same across all shards.
          {
              $project: {
                  missingFromShards: {$setDifference: ["$allShards", "$shards"]},
                  inconsistentProperties: {
                       $setDifference: [
                           {$reduce: {
                               input: "$specs",
                               initialValue: {$arrayElemAt: ["$specs", 0]},
                               in: {$setUnion: ["$$value", "$$this"]}}},
                           {$reduce: {
                               input: "$specs",
                               initialValue: {$arrayElemAt: ["$specs", 0]},
                               in: {$setIntersection: ["$$value", "$$this"]}}}
                       ]
                   }
              }
          },
          // Only return output that indicates an index was inconsistent, i.e. either a shard was missing
          // an index or a property on at least one shard was not the same on all others.
          {
              $match: {
                  $expr:
                      {$or: [
                          {$gt: [{$size: "$missingFromShards"}, 0]},
                          {$gt: [{$size: "$inconsistentProperties"}, 0]},
                      ]
                  }
              }
          },
          // Output relevant fields.
          {$project: {_id: 0, indexName: "$$ROOT._id", inconsistentProperties: 1, missingFromShards: 1}}
      ];

#. Run the aggregation pipeline for the sharded collection to test. For
   example, to test if the sharded collection ``test.reviews`` has
   inconsistent indexes across its associated shards:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("test").reviews.aggregate(pipeline)

   If the collection has inconsistent indexes, the aggregation for that
   collection returns details regarding the inconsistent indexes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "missingFromShards" : [ "shardB" ], "inconsistentProperties" : [ ], "indexName" : "page_1_score_1" }
      { "missingFromShards" : [ ], "inconsistentProperties" : [ { "k" : "expireAfterSeconds", "v" : 60 }, { "k" : "expireAfterSeconds", "v" : 600 } ], "indexName" : "reviewDt_1" }

   The returned documents indicate two inconsistencies for the sharded
   collection ``test.reviews``:

   #. An index named ``page_1_score_1`` is missing from the collection
      on ``shardB``.

   #. An index named ``reviewDt_1`` has inconsistent properties across
      the collection's shards, specifically, the ``expireAfterSeconds``
      properties differ.

To resolve the inconsistency where an index is missing  from the collection on a particular shard(s),
   You can either:

   - Perform a :doc:`rolling index build
     </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` for the collection
     on the affected shard(s).

     \-OR-

   - Issue an index build :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` from a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The operation only builds the
     collection's index on the shard(s) missing the index.

To resolve where the index properties differ across the shards, 
   Drop the incorrect index from the collection on the affected
   shard(s) and rebuild the index. To rebuild the index, you can either:
   
   - Perform a :doc:`rolling index build
     </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` for the collection
     on the affected shard.

     \-OR-

   - Issue an index build :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` from a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The operation only builds the
     collection's index on the shard(s) missing the index.

   Alternatively, if the inconsistency is the ``expireAfterSeconds`` property,
   you can run the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to update the number of
   seconds instead of dropping and rebuilding the index.
