.. readconcern:: "majority"

For read operations not associated with :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"``
guarantees that the data read has been acknowledged by a majority of
the replica set members. The documents read are durable and
guaranteed to not roll back.

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.

For more information about what happens if a primary fails, see
:ref:`replication-auto-failover`.

Performance
-----------

Each replica set member maintains, in memory, a view of the data at the
majority-commit point; the majority-commit point is calculated by the
primary. To fulfill read concern ``"majority"``, the node returns data
from this view and is comparable in performance to other read
concerns.

Availability
------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for use with or
without causally consistent sessions and transactions.

Example

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.

Storage Engine Support
----------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for the
WiredTiger storage engine.

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field, which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

Read Concern ``"majority"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

.. note:: 

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level. To set the read concern for
   transactions, see :ref:`transactions-read-concern`.

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.
