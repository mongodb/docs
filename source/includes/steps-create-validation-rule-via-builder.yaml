   To add a new rule, click the :guilabel:`Add Rule` button.

   When adding or modifying a rule, select the field and the rule to
   apply to the field. The following rule categories are available via
   the Rule Builder:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 35 65

      * - ``Rule Category``
        - Description

      * - ``Exists / Must Not Exist``

        - Enforces the presence / absence of a field in the documents.

      * - ``Type``

        - Enforces a specific BSON Type for a field in the documents.

      * - ``Range``
        - Enforces a numeric range for a field in the documents.

      * - ``Regex``

        - Enforces a regular expression match for a string field in the
          documents.

   For a rule, you can also select the :guilabel:`Nullable` checkbox to
   indicate that the rule is also fulfilled if the value is null or the
   field is not present in the document. With the Rule Builder, you
   cannot create compound rules for a single field other than by the
   :guilabel:`Nullable` checkbox.

   The rule categories :guilabel:`"Exists"` and :guilabel:`"Must not
   Exist"` do not support the :guilabel:`Nullable`` checkbox.

   To delete a rule, click on the trash can icon for the rule.
