You can modify your {+cluster+} after initial configuration.

- For a summary of available options, see :ref:`cluster-config-options`.

- For in-depth configuration steps, see :ref:`scale-cluster-open-dialog` and 
  the options that follow.

For more information about the impact, cost, and backup policy of your
{+cluster+} changes, see :ref:`cluster-config-considerations`.

.. _cluster-config-options:

|service| Configuration Options
-------------------------------

You can change the following options of your |service| {+cluster+}:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Setting
     - Action
     - Limitations


   * - :ref:`Cluster Type <change-cluster-type>`
     
     - Change the {+cluster+} type.

     - You can move from a {+Flex-cluster+} to a {+dedicated-cluster+}.
       You can also move from a {Serverless-instance+} to a {+dedicated-cluster+}.

   * - :ref:`Global Cluster Configuration <scale-cluster-global-config>`

     - Enable |global-write| for your {+cluster+} or change existing global
       {+cluster+} configurations.

     - After you enable |global-write| for a {+cluster+}, you can't disable
       them.

   * - :ref:`Cloud Provider & Region <scale-cluster-cloud-provider>`

     - Select a different provider to change the cloud provider for
       your {+dedicated-clusters+}. 
       
       If you created an |service| {+cluster+} on |aws| **or** created
       an |service| {+cluster+} after November 2, 2020, your connection
       string doesn't change. You don't experience {+cluster+} downtime.

     - If you created an |service| {+cluster+} 
       on |gcp| or |azure| before November 2, 2020, when |service| added
       support for multi-cloud clusters, changing to a different
       provider changes the connection string to your new {+cluster+}. Consider scheduling a time to :ref:`update your applications 
       with the new connection string <atlas-faq-migrate-providers>`
       to connect to the {+cluster+} again.

       To learn more, see :ref:`dedicated-to-dedicated`.

       If you add or move a node to a region without a primary node
       or without an existing secondary node requires each newly 
       migrated replica set member to perform an
       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync>`.

       For {+clusters+} on |azure|, if you change a region, some storage
       capabilities might be unavailable in that region. The {+atlas-ui+}
       notifies you that your |iops| will be reduced, which might impact
       your application performance. To learn more, see
       :ref:`regions that support extended storage <microsoft-azure-storage-supported-regions>`,
       and :ref:`change-storage-capacity-azure`.


   * - :ref:`Deploy or Configure a multi-cloud, multi-region {+cluster+} <scale-cluster-region>`
     - Deploy or modify a multi-cloud, multi-region {+cluster+}.

     - For {+clusters+} on |azure|, if you change to a multi-region {+cluster+},
       some storage volume capabilities might be unavailable in one of
       the regions. The {+atlas-ui+} notifies you that your |iops| will be
       reduced, which might impact your application performance.
       To learn more, see :ref:`regions that support extended storage <microsoft-azure-storage-supported-regions>`,
       and :ref:`change-storage-capacity-azure`.

   * - :ref:`Cluster Tier <scale-cluster-instance>`

     - Change the {+cluster+} tier.

     - If your {+cluster+} uses :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`,
       |service| must perform an
       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync>`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-nvme-fcbis.rst

   * - :ref:`Cluster Storage Options <create-cluster-storage>`

     - Change the storage options for the {+cluster+} tier.

     - Clusters using |nvme| storage have a fixed size for each {+cluster+}
       tier.

   * - :ref:`Cluster Autoscaling Options <cluster-autoscaling>`

     - Change the {+cluster+}'s auto-scaling options, including storage
       auto-scaling. Depending on whether you choose to use storage auto-scaling,
       |service| manages the oplog entries based on either the minimum oplog
       retention window, or the oplog size. To learn more, see
       :ref:`Oplog Size Behavior <oplog-size-behavior>`. |service| enables
       storage auto-scaling by default.

     - None

   * - :ref:`MongoDB Version <scale-cluster-version>`

     - Upgrade the major MongoDB version of the {+cluster+}.

     - You can't downgrade the MongoDB version unless you pinned the cluster's
       |fcv| before upgrading.

   * - :ref:`Deploy a Sharded {+Cluster+} <scale-cluster-sharding>`

     - Scale up a replica set to a sharded {+cluster+}.

     - You can't reverse this operation.

       |service| allows Sharded Clusters for ``M30`` or larger
       clusters.

       .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/convert-to-sharded-cluster-limitations.rst

   * - :ref:`Modify the Number of Shards <scale-cluster-shardNum>`

     - Set the number of shards for a sharded {+cluster+}.

     - Reducing the number of shards takes some time. |service| 
       removes shards in descending order based on the number in
       in their ``"_id"`` field. Any subsequent MongoDB
       configuration changes start after |service| removes the shards.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-reduce-shards-warning-nested.rst

       |service| allows Sharded Clusters for ``M30`` or larger
       clusters.

   * - :ref:`Enable or Disable Backup <scale-cluster-backups>`

     - Enable or disable backups for the {+cluster+}.

     - |service| enables backups for M2 and M5 {+clusters+} (deprecated) automatically.
       You can't disable backup for {+clusters+} on those tiers.

   * - :ref:`Enable or Disable the Business Intelligence Connector <create-cluster-enable-bi>`

     - Enable or disable the |bic| for this {+cluster+}.

of these modifications.

.. _cluster-config-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

Migration, Availability, and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making changes to a {+cluster+} often requires migrating to new servers
and storage volumes. The time required for an :term:`initial sync` and
resynchronizing data across storage volumes increases linearly with the
amount of data in the {+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-nvme-fcbis.rst

The following migrations require an :term:`initial sync`:

- Scaling up from a {+Free-clusters+} or {+Shared-clusters+} (``M0``,
  ``M2``, and ``M5`` {+clusters+}) to a higher {+cluster+} tier.

- Changes from general to :ref:`NVMe storage volumes <nvme-storage>` and
  from NVMe to general storage.

- Scaling up or scaling down from one |nvme| {+cluster+} tier to another,
  initiated either manually or via auto-scaling. |nvme| {+clusters+}
  auto-scale to the next higher tier when 90% of the available storage
  space is consumed.

- Changes that require a replacement of an NVMe-backed |service|
  {+cluster+}, such as region changes.

- For {+clusters+} deployed to |azure|, changes to the :ref:`storage-class-ui`.

To maximize availability:

- For a replica set, |service| migrates one node at a time, starting
  with the secondary nodes first and then the primary.

- For a sharded {+cluster+}, |service| performs the migration of the shards
  independently of each other. For each shard, such as a replica set,
  |service| migrates one node at a time, starting with the secondary
  nodes first and then the primary.

:manual:`Retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` should prevent any
write errors during the election of a new primary. On average, an
election can take five seconds.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity. Each newly migrated replica set node must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if you set
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` to read from
secondaries. The replica set is down one secondary during the
migration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

.. _cluster-config-billing:

Billing
~~~~~~~

As you change your {+cluster+}, you can compare the costs of different
options before applying them. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
displays the cost of the selected configuration, excluding data
transfer.

.. important:: {+Free-Clusters+}

   Upgrading an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} to an ``M2`` or greater paid
   tier {+cluster+} starts billing for the {+cluster+}. See :doc:`billing` for
   complete documentation on |service| billing.

The following sections provide complete documentation for each of the
|service| {+cluster+} scaling configuration options.

Backup
~~~~~~

See :ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s <backup-cloud-provider>` for more information on 
backing up your {+cluster+}.

.. _scale-cluster-atlas-cli:
.. _scale-cluster-open-dialog:

Required Access
---------------

To modify a {+cluster+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` 
access or higher to the project.

.. _edit-cluster-atlas:

Edit a {+Cluster+}
------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      You can modify any of the {+cluster+} settings on this page using the {+atlas-cli+}.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-update-and-upgrade.rst

      Edit Advanced Settings
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-advancedSettings-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

         .. step:: Edit the configuration

            For the {+cluster+} you want to modify, click the  
            :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` icon, and then select :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.

      Alternatively, if you are already viewing the specific 
      {+cluster+}, click the :guilabel:`Configuration` button. For 
      ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}, you can also click the 
      :guilabel:`Upgrade` button for the {+cluster+}.

.. _change-cluster-type:

Modify the Cluster Type
-----------------------

If you have a shared {+cluster+} (deprecated), you can change it to a dedicated 
{+cluster+}.

To scale up your ``M0``, ``M2``, or ``M5`` {+cluster+}
to an ``M10+`` {+cluster+}, complete the following steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
  
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit Config` and select your cluster from the drop-down menu.

   .. step:: At the top of your configuration settings, click the :guilabel:`Dedicated` tab.

   .. step:: Select your preferred cluster tier.
     
      To learn more, see :ref:`scale-cluster-instance`. 

Dedicated {+clusters+} have more configuration options than shared
{+clusters+} (deprecated).

.. note:: Considerations

   - You can't change a dedicated {+cluster+} to a shared {+cluster+} (deprecated).
   - You can't change a dedicated {+cluster+} to a {+Serverless-instance+} (deprecated).

.. _scale-cluster-global-config:

Modify the :guilabel:`Global {+Cluster+} Configuration`
------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   You can't disable |global-write| for a {+cluster+} once deployed.

You can enable global writes for your {+cluster+} or modify
existing global {+cluster+} configurations.

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`global-clusters`.
   - :ref:`create-new-global-write-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-region:
.. _scale-cluster-cloud-provider:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`
----------------------------------------------

.. note:: Considerations

   .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider.rst

- To view the current cloud providers and regions for this {+cluster+},
  select :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.

- To modify the cloud providers and regions applied to this {+cluster+},
  follow the procedures on :ref:`deploy-across-multiple-regions`.

- To add electable nodes to your {+cluster+} during a regional outage,
  follow the procedure on :ref:`reconfigure-rs-during-regional-outage`.

- To scale up from an |service| free- or {+Shared-cluster+} (deprecated), select
  from the available cloud providers.

- To remove or deploy additional Search Nodes, adjust the
  :guilabel:`Number of Search Nodes` setting under :guilabel:`Search
  nodes for workload isolation`. You can deploy between 2 and 32 search
  nodes on your {+cluster+}. 

  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-migrate-delete-search-nodes.rst 
     
  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-migrate-add-search-nodes.rst

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.
   - :ref:`move-cluster`.

View Available Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-availableRegions-list.rst

.. _scale-cluster-storage:
.. _scale-cluster-instance:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier`
-----------------------------------

You can change the {+cluster+} tier, as well as the memory, storage,
and |iops| (speed) specifications for the selected {+cluster+}. If you
deployed Search Nodes separately for an ``M10`` or higher {+cluster+},
you can also change your search tier.

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>`, you 
   can't modify the {+cluster+} tier to a tier that doesn't support 
   {+cloud-backup+}.

{+Free-Cluster+} and {+Shared-Cluster+} Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can't scale down an ``M10+`` {+dedicated-cluster+} to an
  ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} or ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-cluster+}.

- Changing the {+cluster+} tier requires downtime in the following 
  scenarios:
     
- You change from an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} or ``M2/M5``
  {+Shared-cluster+} to an ``M10`` or larger {+cluster+} tier.
  
- You change from an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} to an ``M2/M5`` 
  {+Shared-cluster+}.
       
- You change from an ``M2`` {+Shared-cluster+} to an ``M5`` 
  {+Shared-cluster+}.
     
  To prevent data corruption, halt write operations to your {+cluster+}
  for the duration of your scale operation.

Tier for {+Cluster+} Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select your preferred {+cluster+} tier. If you deployed Search Nodes
separately, in the :guilabel:`Base Tier` tab, select your preferred
{+cluster+} tier. The selected instance size dictates
the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops| specification for each 
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the {+cluster+}.

.. warning::

   Upgrading from a tenant (free or shared) tier to a {+dedicated-cluster+}
   tier deletes the current {+cluster+}. To keep your existing snapshots,
   :ref:`download those snapshots <restore-overview>` before upgrading
   your {+cluster+}.

.. note::
   
   |service| reboots all nodes in your {+cluster+} when you modify the cluster tier. 

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`cloud-provider-retention-policy`
   - :ref:`create-cluster-instance`

From the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section, you can also:

- :ref:`create-cluster-storage`

- :ref:`Configure Autoscaling Options <cluster-autoscaling>`

.. include:: /includes/fact-analytics-nodes-tier.rst

If you deploy :term:`read-only nodes <read-only node>` and want your
{+cluster+} to scale faster, consider adjusting your :ref:`Replica
Set Scaling Mode <replica-set-scaling-mode>`.

Tier for Search Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Search Tier` tab, select your preferred search tier.
If the search tier that you select is not available in your region,
|service| automatically switches to the next higher search tier in your
region. The selected instance size dictates the memory, storage, |iops| 
specification, and cost of each search node on your {+cluster+}.

.. note::
   
   |service| reboots all nodes in your {+cluster+} when you modify the search tier. 

.. _cluster-config-additional-settings:

Modify :guilabel:`Additional Settings`
--------------------------------------

You can set the following options:

- :ref:`scale-cluster-version`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-backups`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-termination-protection`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-sharding`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-shardNum`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-bi`
- :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-encryption`

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups are automatically enabled for {+Flex-clusters+}
and can't be disabled.

.. seealso::
   
   :ref:`m2-m5-snapshots`.
   :ref:`flex-snapshots`.

To enable backups for an ``M10+`` |service| {+cluster+}, toggle
:guilabel:`Turn on {+Cloud-Backup+} (M10 and up)` to ``Yes``.
If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at
regular intervals and retains them according to your project's
:ref:`retention policy <cloud-provider-retention-policy>`.

For detailed descriptions of the available backup options, see
:ref:`create-cluster-backups`.

.. _scale-cluster-termination-protection:

Enable or Disable Termination Protection for the {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable :guilabel:`Termination Protection` for a {+cluster+}, toggle
:guilabel:`Termination Protection` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

If enabled, |service| prevents users from deleting the
cluster. To delete a cluster that has termination protection
enabled, you must first disable termination protection. By default,
|service| disables termination protection for
all {+database-deployments+}.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`terminate-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-sharding:
