   :description: Disconnect from a MongoDB deployment in Compass by selecting "Disconnect" from the Connect menu.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Disconnecting from a MongoDB deployment closes the Compass connection to
the active deployment and returns the Compass view to the initial
connection dialog. When you disconnect, Compass safely ends your session
with the database server. This process ensures that any open transactions
are closed and resources are freed on both the client and server sides.

Disconnecting is helpful when you want to switch between different MongoDB
deployments, update your connection settings, or end your current
session for security reasons. After disconnecting, you can always reconnect
to the same deployment or connect to a different one.
