The :operator:`$min` and :operator:`$max` operators indicate that the system
should avoid normal query planning. Instead they construct an index scan where
the index bounds are explicitly specified by the values given in
:operator:`$min` and :operator:`$max`.

.. warning::

   If one of the two boundaries is not specified, the query plan will be
   an index scan that is unbounded on one side. This may degrade performance
   compared to a query containing neither operator, or one that uses both
   operators to more tightly constrain the index scan.
