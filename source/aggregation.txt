Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**aggregation operations**.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections and
return computed results. The MongoDB Aggregation framework, which is
part of the Query API, is modeled on the concept of data processing
pipelines. Documents enter a pipeline that contains one or more stages,
and this pipeline transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

An aggregation operation is similar to a car factory. A car factory has
an assembly line, which contains assembly stations with specialized
tools to do specific jobs, like drills and welders. Raw parts enter the
factory, and then the assembly line transforms and assembles them into a
finished product.

The **aggregation pipeline** is the assembly line, **aggregation stages** are the
assembly stations, and **operator expressions** are the
specialized tools.

Compare Aggregation and Find Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the different tasks that find
operations can perform and compares them to what aggregation
operations can perform. The aggregation framework provides
expanded functionality that allows you to transform and manipulate
your data.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Rename fields
       | Compute new fields
       | Summarize data
       | Connect and merge data sets

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following limitations when performing aggregation operations:

- Returned documents cannot violate the
  :manual:`BSON document size limit </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`
  of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. You can exceed this
  limit by passing a value of ``true`` to the ``allowDiskUse()`` method and chaining the
  method to ``aggregate()``.
- The :manual:`$graphLookup </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>`
  operator has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the
  value passed to the ``allowDiskUse()`` method.

.. _scala-run-aggregation:

Run Aggregation Operations
--------------------------

.. note:: Sample Data
  
   The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
   database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
   free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
   </getting-started>` guide.

To perform an aggregation, pass a list containing the pipeline stages to
the ``aggregate()`` method. The {+driver-short+} provides the ``Aggregates`` class,
which includes helper methods for building pipeline stages. 

To learn more about pipeline stages and their corresponding ``Aggregates`` helper
methods, see the following resources:

- :manual:`Aggregation Stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in the
  {+mdb-server+} manual
- `Aggregates <{+driver-api+}/model/Aggregates$.html>`__ in the API documentation

.. _scala-aggregation-example:

Filter, Group, and Count Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code example produces a count of the number of bakeries in each borough
of New York. To do so, it calls the ``aggregate()`` method and passes an aggregation
pipeline as a list of stages. The code builds these stages by using the following
``Aggregates`` helper methods:

- ``filter()``: Builds the :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage
  to filter for documents that have a ``cuisine`` value of ``"Bakery"``

- ``group()``: Builds the :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to 
  group the matching documents by the ``borough`` field, accumulating a count of documents for each
  distinct value

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation.scala
      :start-after: start-match-group
      :end-before: end-match-group
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      {"_id": "Brooklyn", "count": 173}
      {"_id": "Queens", "count": 204}
      {"_id": "Bronx", "count": 71}
      {"_id": "Staten Island", "count": 20}
      {"_id": "Missing", "count": 2}
      {"_id": "Manhattan", "count": 221}

Explain an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view information about how MongoDB executes your operation, you can
instruct the MongoDB query planner to **explain** it. When MongoDB explains
an operation, it returns **execution plans** and performance statistics.
An execution plan is a potential way in which MongoDB can complete an operation.
When you instruct MongoDB to explain an operation, it returns both the
plan MongoDB executed and any rejected execution plans by default.

To explain an aggregation operation, chain the ``explain()`` method to the
``aggregate()`` method. You can pass a verbosity level to ``explain()``,
which modifies the type and amount of information that the method returns. For more
information about verbosity, see :manual:`Verbosity Modes </reference/command/explain/#verbosity-modes>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example instructs MongoDB to explain the aggregation operation
from the preceding :ref:`scala-aggregation-example` example. The code passes a verbosity
value of ``ExplainVerbosity.EXECUTION_STATS`` to the ``explain()`` method, which
configures the method to return statistics describing the execution of the winning
plan:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation.scala
      :start-after: start-explain
      :end-before: end-explain
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      {"explainVersion": "2", "queryPlanner": {"namespace": "sample_restaurants.restaurants",
      "indexFilterSet": false, "parsedQuery": {"cuisine": {"$eq": "Bakery"}}, "queryHash": "865F14C3",
      "planCacheKey": "0FC225DA", "optimizedPipeline": true, "maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached": false, 
      "maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached": false, "maxScansToExplodeReached": false, "winningPlan":
      {"queryPlan": {"stage": "GROUP", "planNodeId": 3, "inputStage": {"stage": "COLLSCAN",
      "planNodeId": 1, "filter": {"cuisine": {"$eq": "Bakery"}}, "direction": "forward"}},
      ...}

Run an Atlas Full-Text Search
-----------------------------

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`Atlas Search index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.

To specify a full-text search of one or more fields, you can create
a ``$search`` pipeline stage. The {+driver-short+} provides the
``Aggregates.search()`` helper method to create this stage. The ``search()``
method requires the following arguments:

- ``SearchOperator`` instance: Specifies the field and text to search for.
- ``SearchOptions`` instance: Specifies options to customize the full-text
  search. You must set the ``index`` option to the name of the Atlas Search
  index to use.

This example creates pipeline stages to perform the following actions:

- Search the ``name`` field for text that contains the word ``"Salt"``
- Project only the ``_id`` and ``name`` values of matching documents

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation.scala
      :start-after: start-atlas-search
      :end-before: end-atlas-search
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "Fresh Salt"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "Salt & Pepper"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "Salt + Charcoal"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "A Salt & Battery"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "Salt And Fat"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "name": "Salt And Pepper Diner"}

.. important::

    To run the preceding example, you must create an Atlas Search index on the ``restaurants``
    collection that covers the ``name`` field. Then, replace the ``"<search index name>"``
    placeholder with the name of the index. To learn more about Atlas Search indexes, see
    the :ref:`scala-atlas-search-index` guide.
