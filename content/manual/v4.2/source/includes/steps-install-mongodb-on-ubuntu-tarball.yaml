title: Extract the files from the downloaded archive.

pre: |

   Using an archive manager program or the ``tar`` command, extract the
   files.

   For example, to extract from the terminal shell, you can use the
   following ``tar`` command:
      
   .. tip::

      If you downloaded a different MongoDB {+version+} point release,
      be sure to modify the command to reflect the correct ``.tgz``
      file name.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-*-{+release+}.tgz

title: Optional. Ensure the binaries are in a directory listed in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

   The MongoDB binaries are in the ``<mongodb-install-directory>/bin/``
   directory.
   
   To avoid having to specify the path to the MongoDB binaries, you can
   copy these binaries into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
   variable such as ``/usr/local/bin``:

   .. code-block:: sh 

      sudo cp <mongodb-install-directory>/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

...
