  .. note::

     |mms| can manage SSL for you if you are using Automation for the
     deployment. With Automation, |mms| prompts you for the certificates
     to use to connect to the deployment, when you enable SSL and then
     configures the agents appropriately. See:
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment` for more information.
