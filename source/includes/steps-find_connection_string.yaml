  In the :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step in the modal
  window, check to make sure your IP address is in the IP access list 
  for Atlas connections. If it is not, add it.

  The following Atlas screenshot shows the options for adding IP
  addresses in the Atlas UI:

  If your cluster already has one or more IP access list entries, you
  won't have access to the button to add your IP address in the
  modal. Instead, use the following procedure to add your IP address
  to the IP access list:
  
  1. Exit the modal window.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Network Access` under the :guilabel:`Security` 
     section in the Atlas UI.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`IP Access List` tab.

  #. Click the green :guilabel:`Add IP Address` button.

  #. Add your IP address.

  #. Return to the Clusters :guilabel:`Overview` tab.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button and proceed.

  To learn more about adding IP addresses to the IP access list, see
  `Configure IP Access List Entries
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/security/ip-access-list/>`_
  in the Atlas documentation.
