Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the
default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. SCRAM is based on the
IETF `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that
defines best practices for implementation of challenge-response
mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords.

Using SCRAM, MongoDB verifies the supplied user credentials against the
user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password
<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database
<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database
where the user was created, and together with the user's name, serves
to identify the user.

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM uses the SHA-1 hashing function.

SCRAM Advantages
----------------

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM represents an improvement in security
over the MongoDB challenge response authentication mechanism, providing:

- A tunable work factor (``iterationCount``),
- Per-user random salts rather than server-wide salts,
- A cryptographically stronger hash function (``SHA-1`` rather than ``MD5``),
  and
- Authentication of the server to the client as well as the client to the
  server.

Driver Support
--------------

To use SCRAM, you must upgrade your driver if your current driver
version does not support ``SCRAM``.

The minimum driver versions that support ``SCRAM`` are:
