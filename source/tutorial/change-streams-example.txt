Change Stream Examples
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.6

.. important::
   Change streams are available for replica sets or sharded clusters with replica set
   shards. You cannot open a change stream against a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
   For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream operation against
   the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   The replica set or the sharded cluster must use:

   - replica set protocol version 1 (:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`)

   -  :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine (can be :ref:`encrypted <encrypted-storage-engine>`)

Open A Change Stream
--------------------

This example opens a change stream against a replica set. The change stream is bound to a collection and
change stream documents are iterated with a cursor. This cursor remains open until it is explicitly closed,
as long as a connection to the MongoDB deployment remains open *and* the collection exists.

In order to retrieve the data change event notifications, iterate
the change stream ``cursor``.

If there are one or more majority-committed operations that modified the
updated document *after* the update operation but *before* the lookup, the
full document returned may differ significantly from the document at the time
of the update operation.

However, the deltas included in the change stream document always
correctly describe the watched
collection changes that applied to that change stream event.

Iterate the change stream ``cursor`` to retrieve the change stream
documents in order. In the example below, all update operations notifications
include a ``fullDocument``
field that represents the *current* version of the document affected by the
update operation.

Modify Change Stream Output using Aggregation Pipelines
-------------------------------------------------------

You can control change stream output by providing an array of one or
more of the following pipeline stages when configuring the change stream:

- :pipeline:`$match`
- :pipeline:`$project`
- :pipeline:`$addFields`
- :pipeline:`$replaceRoot`
- :pipeline:`$redact`

            // Select the MongoDB database and collection to open the change stream against

            MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase("myTargetDatabase");

            MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("myTargetCollection");

            // Create $match pipeline stage.
            List<Bson> pipeline = singletonList(Aggregates.match(Filters.or(
                Document.parse("{'fullDocument.username': 'alice'}"),
                Filters.in("operationType", asList("delete")))));

            // Create the change stream cursor, passing the pipeline to the
            // collection.watch() method

         The ``pipeline`` list includes a single :pipeline:`$match` stage that
         filters any operations where the ``username`` is ``alice``, or
         operations where the ``operationType`` is ``delete``.

         Passing the ``pipeline`` to the :method:`~db.collection.watch()` method directs the
         change stream to return notifications after passing them through the
         specified ``pipeline``.

         Each change stream response document has an ``_id`` field that contains a

         notification after a specific notification.

         In the example below, the ``resumeAfter`` modifier takes a parameter that must resolve to a resume
         token. Passing the ``resumeToken`` to the ``resumeAfter`` modifier directs
