MongoDB provides support for authentication and authorization on a
per-database level. Users exist in the context of a single logical
database.

.. _authentication:

Authentication
--------------

MongoDB provisions authentication, or verification of the user
identity, on a per-database level. Authentication disables anonymous
access to the database. For basic authentication, MongoDB stores the
user credentials in a database's :data:`system.users
<<database>.system.users>` collection.

Authentication is **disabled** by default. To enable authentication for
a given :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, use the
:setting:`auth` and :setting:`keyFile` configuration settings. For
details, see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`.

.. versionadded 2.0: Before 2.0, sharded clusters *had* to run with
   trusted applications and a trusted networking configuration.

For MongoDB Enterprise installations, authentication using a Kerberos
service is available. See
:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`.

.. important::

   You can authenticate as only one user for a given database. If you
   authenticate to a database as one user and later authenticate on the
   same database as a different user, the second authentication
   invalidates the first. You can, however, log into a *different*
   database as a different user and not invalidate your authentication
   on other databases, though this is not a recommended approach.

   Each client connection should authenticate as exactly one
   user.

.. _authorization:

Authorization
-------------

MongoDB provisions authorization, or access to databases and
operations, on a per-database level. MongoDB uses a role-based approach
to authorization, storing each user's roles in a :doc:`privilege
document </reference/user-privileges>` in a database's
:data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection. For more
information on privilege documents and available user roles, see
:doc:`/reference/privilege-documents` and
:doc:`/reference/user-privileges`.

.. important:: The ``admin`` database provides roles that are
   *unavailable* in other databases, including a role that effectively
   makes a user a MongoDB system superuser. See
   :ref:`database-admin-roles` and :ref:`admin-roles`.

To assign roles to users, you must be a user with administrative role
in the database. As such, you must first create an administrative user.
For details, see :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator` and
:doc:`/tutorial/add-user-to-database`.

``system.users`` Collection
---------------------------

A database's :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection
stores information for authentication and authorization to that
database. Specifically, the collection stores user credentials for
authentication and user privilege information for authorization.
MongoDB requires authorization to access the :data:`system.users
<<database>.system.users>` collection in order to prevent privilege
escalation attacks. To access the collection, you must have either
:authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4
   The schema of :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` changed
   to accommodate a more sophisticated authorization using user
   privilege model, as defined in :doc:`privilege documents
   </reference/user-privileges>`.
