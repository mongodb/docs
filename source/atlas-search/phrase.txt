Definition
----------

.. expression:: phrase

   The ``phrase`` operator performs search for documents containing an
   ordered sequence of terms using the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>`
   specified in the :ref:`index configuration <index-config-example>`.
   If no analyzer is specified, the default :ref:`standard
   <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer is used. 

.. _phrase-syntax:

Syntax
------

``phrase`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
        "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
        "phrase": {
          "query": "<search-string>",
          "path": "<field-to-search>",
          "score": <options>,
          "slop": <distance-number>,
          "synonyms": "<synonyms-mapping-name>"
        }
     }
   }

.. _phrase-options:

Options
-------

``phrase`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 60 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``query``
     - string or array of strings
     - String or strings to search for.
     - yes

   * - ``path``
     - string or array of strings
     - Indexed field or fields to search. You can also specify a 
       :ref:`wildcard path <ref-path-usage>` to search. 
       To learn more, see :ref:`Construct a Query Path <ref-path>`. 

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` To use the ``phrase`` operator, you must index the query field as type ``string`` with the ``indexOptions`` property
       set to ``positions`` or the default value, ``offsets``. To learn more, see :ref:`Configure String Field Properties <fts-field-types-string-options>`. 
     - yes

   * - ``slop``
     - integer
     - Allowable distance between words in the ``query`` phrase. Lower
       value allows less positional distance between the words and
       greater value allows more reorganization of the words and more
       distance between the words to satisfy the query. The default is
       ``0``, meaning that words must be exactly in the same position
       as the query in order to be considered a match. Exact matches
       are scored higher.
     - no

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - Score to assign to matching search results. You can modify the
       default score using the following options:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.
       - ``function``: replace the result score with the given expression.

       .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-array-scoring.rst

       For information on the options for modifying the default score,
       see :ref:`scoring-ref`. 

     - no

   * - ``synonyms`` 
     - string 
     - Required for running queries using :ref:`synonyms 
       <synonyms-ref>`.

       Name of the :ref:`synonym mapping definition <synonyms-ref>` in 
       the :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`. Value can't 
       be an empty string.

       The amount of time that |fts| takes to execute queries that 
       use :ref:`synonym mappings <synonyms-ref>` depends on the 
       number and size of documents in the synonym source 
       collection. 
       
       For example, a query that uses a synonym mapping that is based 
       on very few synonym documents might be faster than a query 
       that uses a synonym mapping that is based on many synonym 
       documents. 

     - Optional 

Examples
--------

The examples in this page use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. After loading the :ref:`sample dataset
<available-sample-datasets>` into your {+cluster+}, create the |fts|
index with dynamic mappings and run the example queries on your
{+cluster+}. To try the :ref:`synonyms <text-ref-synonyms-eg>` examples,
you must also add the :ref:`synonymous_terms collection
<sample-synonyms-coll>` to the ``sample_mflix`` database and then
:ref:`define the index <synonyms-index-definition-ex>` with the
``synonyms`` mapping collection.  

Single Phrase Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |fts| example performs a basic search of the
``title`` field for the query string ``new york``. There is no
``slop`` in the query and so the ``slop`` value defaults to
``0``, which means the position of the words must exactly match
the query string to be included in the results. The query also
includes a:

- :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 10 results.
- :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except
  ``title`` and add a field named ``score``.

Multiple Phrases Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |fts| example performs a basic search of the
``title`` field for the query strings ``the man`` and ``the
moon``. There is no ``slop`` in the query and so the ``slop``
value defaults to ``0``, which means the position of the words
must exactly match the query string to be included in the
results. The query also includes a:

.. example::

   - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 10.
   - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except
     ``title`` and add a field named ``score``.

Slop Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |fts| example performs a search of the ``title`` field
for the query string ``men women``. The ``slop`` value of ``5`` in the
``query`` allows greater movement of the words and distance between the
words ``men`` and ``women``. The query includes a :pipeline:`$project`
stage to:

- Exclude all fields except ``title``
- Add a field named ``score``

Synonyms Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following queries search the ``plot`` field in the ``movies``
collection for the terms in the given query string. |fts| returns
results based on the :ref:`type of mapping <synonyms-ref>` in the
:ref:`synonym source collection <synonyms-coll-spec>`,
``synonymous_terms``, specified in the synonym mapping definition of the 
index for the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. 

The following query searches for the phrase ``automobile race`` anywhere
in the ``plot`` field with a distance of up to ``5`` between the terms.

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 

   .. input:: 
      :language: json 

      db.movies.aggregate([

      ]

The documents in the results contain the following terms in the ``plot``
field with up to a distance of ``5`` between the terms:  

- ``automobile``, ``car``, or ``vehicle``, which are defined as
  ``equivalent`` synonyms in the ``synonymous_terms`` collection, 
- ``race``, ``contest``, or ``rally``, which are defined as
  ``explicit`` synonyms in the sy``synonymous_terms`` collection,
      
|fts| returns similar results for a search for ``car race`` or ``vehicle
race`` because we configured ``automobile``, ``car``, and ``vehicle`` to
be ``equivalent`` synonyms. However, the results for ``automobile
contest`` wouldn't include documents with ``race`` or ``rally`` and the
results for ``automobile rally`` wouldn't include documents with
``race`` or ``contest`` because we didn't configure ``contest`` or
``rally`` to be synonym of any terms.
