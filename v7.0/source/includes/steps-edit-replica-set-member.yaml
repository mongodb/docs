   You can modify the following settings:

   .. list-table::  
      :widths: 30 70

      * - :guilabel:`Votes`
        - Specify whether the replica set member votes in elections.
          A value of ``1`` indicates the member votes, while a value
          of ``0`` indicates that the member does not vote.

      * - :guilabel:`Priority`
        - Specify the priority of the replica set member during elections.
          Non-voting members must have a priority of ``0``.

      * - :guilabel:`Delay`
        - Specify whether the member is a delayed replica set member.

      * - :guilabel:`Build Indexes`
        - Specify whether the replica set member builds indexes.

      * - :guilabel:`Tags`
        - Enter JSON that defines the tag set that you want to add to the
          replica set member.
      
   .. note:: 

      After deploying the replica set, you can't modify a replica set 
      member's :guilabel:`hostname` or :option:`port <mongod.--port>`.
