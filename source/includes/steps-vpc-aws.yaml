          - |aws| region where the |service| |vpc| resides. |service|

            region if that region has no ``M10`` or greater clusters or
            |vpc| peering connections.

            Clear :guilabel:`Same as application VPC region` to select
            a region different from where your application's |vpc|
            resides.
