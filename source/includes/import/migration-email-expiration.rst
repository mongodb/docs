If your migration is about to expire, |service| sends you an email similar
to the following example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   A migration to your Atlas cluster will expire in <number> hours!
   Navigate to your destination cluster to start the cutover process. If
   you don't take any action within <number> hours, the migration will be
   cancelled and you will need to start again. You can also extend the
   migration process if you need more time.
