  As you make changes, |service| displays the updated costs. You can change the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 35 65
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Option

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Instance Size`

       - You can change combination of memory, storage, and IOPS (speed) of
         your cluster's existing servers.

     * - :guilabel:`Replication Factor`

       - Changing the number of members in your cluster's :term:`replica set`
         increases or decreases the number of copies of your database. See
         :manual:`Replication </replication>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want a sharded cluster?`

       - If the cluster will handle high throughput or contain large data
         sets, you can shard the cluster, which partitions the databases over
         multiple replica sets. Each replica set comprises the number of
         servers specified by the replication factor. See :manual:`Sharding
         </sharding>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Number of Shards`

       - This field appears only if you have a sharded cluster. You can
         increase or decrease the number of shards.

     * - :guilabel:`Do you want to enable backup?`

       - If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at regular
         intervals and retains them according to your group's :ref:`retention
         policy <retention-policy>`. You can restore a backup to the same
         cluster or any cluster in your group that has the same topology.
