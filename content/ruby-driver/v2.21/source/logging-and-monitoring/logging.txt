Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to configure
**logging** for your application. Logging allows you to
view a discrete, event-based log of driver activities.

Loggers log messages at a severity, or verbosity, level that you
can specify. When you enable logging in your application,
you can receive information about your application's activities at
different levels of detail. The driver allows you to log information categorized
at the following severity levels:

- ``unknown``
- ``fatal``
- ``error``
- ``warn``
- ``info``
- ``debug``

The preceding list is ordered by decreasing severity level, with ``unknown`` as the
highest severity level. When you specify a severity level, the driver also logs all
messages with higher severity levels. For example, if you set the log level to
``error``, the driver will also log messages with ``fatal`` and ``unknown`` severity
levels.

The lower the severity level you specify, the more information the driver logs,
which might impact the performance of your application.

Create a Logger
---------------

To configure your application to receive messages about driver events, create
an instance of a ``Logger`` class. Optionally, specify a logging severity level. If you don't 
specify a severity level, the default severity level is ``INFO``.  Then, configure
your ``Mongo::Client`` object to use the logger.

The following example performs the following actions:

- Creates a logger and logs output to ``STDOUT``. You can also log to a file
  by providing a file path.

- Sets the severity level to ``DEBUG``. 

- Configures the ``Mongo::Client`` to use the logger.

- Tests the logger with an insert operation.

        :language: none

The logger output contains the time of the operation, the severity level of the message, and the log message.

Set a Global Logging Level
--------------------------

You can set a global logging level, so you don't have to manually set a severity level for each logger.
The following example shows how to set a global logging level:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/logging.rb
   :start-after: start-global-logging
   :end-before: end-global-logging
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
