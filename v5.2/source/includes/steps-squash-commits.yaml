  text: Get hash for interactive rebase.
  character: '`'
stepnum: 1
ref: git-get-hash
pre: |
   In preparation for git interactive rebase, view the commit log to
   find the hash of the commit immediately preceding your first commit in
   this branch.
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      git log

title:
  text: Perform interactive rebase.
  character: '`'
stepnum: 2
ref: git-rebase-interactive
pre: |
   Using the hash from the previous step, perform the interactive rebase.
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      git rebase --interactive <hash>
post: |
  Alternatively, you can specify ``HEAD~<number of commits you made>``
  instead of the hash, as in ``git rebase --i HEAD~3``

  text: Squash all but your first commit.
  character: '`'
stepnum: 3
ref: git-squash
pre: |
   An editor will open a git-rebase-todo file with a list of your
   commits. Skipping the first entry, update the remaining entries,
   changing ``pick`` to ``s`` for squash.
action:
   language: none
   code: |
      pick 0300bf2 first commit message
      s 6516cc2 second commit message
      s 8cfca09 third commit message
post: Save and quit out of the editor.
---
title:
  text: Update comment for the commit.
  character: '`'
stepnum: 4
ref: git-update-commit-message
pre: |
   An editor will open with the list of commit messages involved in the squash.

   Update the first commit message to reflect accurately the changes
   you made. The message should **include the ticket number**. For
   example, ``PYTHON-555: Support $out aggregation pipeline operator``.

   Delete everything else that comes afterwards in the file that is not
   a comment.

   Ensure that the commit message is clear and complete. Avoid
   ambiguous messages, such as ``SERVER-100: MongoDB allows foobar
   input``. It is unclear whether the message is describing a *bug*
   that was erroneously allowing foobar input or whether the message is
   describing the *fix* that now allows foobar input.

   A better message might be: ``SERVER-100: Mongo should allow foobar
   input`` or ``SERVER-100: Stop allowing foobar input to Mongo``.
