               You can provide a Certificate Authority (CA) using the 
               {+atlas-ui+} by either:
         
               - Clicking :guilabel:`Upload` and selecting a ``.pem`` file from
               your filesystem and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.
         
               - Copying the contents of a ``.pem`` file into the provided text
               area and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.
         
               You can concatenate multiple CAs in the same ``.pem`` file or
               in the text area. Users can authenticate with certificates
               generated by any of the provided CAs.
         
               When you upload a CA, a project-level alert is
               automatically created to send a notification 30 days before
               the CA expires, repeating every 24 hours. You can view and
               edit this alert from |service|'s :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page. For more information on configuring alerts, see 
               :doc:`Configure Alert Settings </configure-alerts>`. 
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.
