|service| conducts :manual:`replica set elections
</core/replica-set-elections/>` when it makes configuration changes,
such as patch updates, scaling events, and when failures occur. Your
applications should handle replica set elections without any downtime.
To learn how to build a resilient application, see
:ref:`resilient-application`. 

You can enable retryable writes by adding :manual:`retryWrites=true
</reference/connection-string/#urioption.retryWrites>` to your |service|
URI connection string. To learn more, see
:manual:`Retryable Writes </core/retryable-writes/>`.

You can use the {+atlas-ui+} and |api| to test the failure of the
replica set :term:`primary` in your |service| cluster and observe how 
your application handles a replica set failover. 

Required Access
---------------

To start a failover test, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner`, :authrole:`Project Owner`, :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` 
or :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` access to the project.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you test the failure of the replica set :term:`primary`, you must
meet the following conditions:

- All pending changes to your {+cluster+} must be complete.
- All members of the {+cluster+} must be in a healthy state with
  up-to-date monitoring data.
- Each replica set or shard must have a primary node.
- Any member of the {+cluster+} must have less than a 10-second
  replication lag.
- All members of your {+cluster+} must have at least 5% of available
  disk space remaining.
- All primary node oplogs must have enough space for a three-hour
  operation.

Test Primary Failover Process 
-----------------------------

.. important:: 

   Ensure that your |service| cluster is healthy before you test primary 
   failover. Otherwise, |service| might reject your request.

When you submit a request to test primary failover, |service| simulates
a failover event. During this process: 

a. |service| shuts down the current :term:`primary`.

#. The members of the replica set hold an 
   :manual:`election </core/replica-set-elections/>` to choose which
   of the secondaries will become the new primary.

#. |service| brings the original primary back to the
   :term:`replica set` as a :term:`secondary`. When the old primary
   rejoins the replica set, it will sync with the new primary to
   catch up any writes that occurred during its downtime.

The following statements describe |service| behavior during rollovers
and when testing failover in sharded clusters: 

- If the original primary accepted write operations that had not
  been successfully replicated to the secondaries when the
  primary stepped down, the primary rolls back those write
  operations when it re-joins the replica set and begins
  synchronizing. To learn more, see
  :manual:`Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover 
  </core/replica-set-rollbacks/>`.
  Contact |mdb-support| for assistance with resolving rollbacks.
- Only the :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes that are on the same 
  instances as the primaries of the replica sets in the sharded cluster 
  are restarted. 
- The primaries of the replica sets in the sharded cluster are restarted 
  in parallel.

      :tabid: api
 
      You can use the :oas-atlas-op:`Test Failover 
      </testFailoverForOneCluster>` |api| endpoint to simulate a
      failover event. To learn more about the failover process, see
      :ref:`Test Failover Process <test-failover-process>`.
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
 
      To perform a Primary Failover test using the {+atlas-ui+}:

      1. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-db-deployments-page.rst

      #. For the cluster you wish to perform failover testing, click the
         :guilabel:`...` button.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Test Resilience`. 

      #. On the :guilabel:`Test Resilience` modal, click the
         :guilabel:`Primary Failover` tab. |service| displays the steps
         that it takes to simulate a failover event. To learn more, see 
         :ref:`Test Failover Process <test-failover-process>`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Restart Primary` to begin the test. |service|
         displays the results of your simulated failover process in the
         :guilabel:`Test Resilience` modal.

Verify the Failover
-------------------

To verify that the failover is successful:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Observe the nodes.

      a. Click the name of the cluster for which you performed the 
         failover test.

      #. Observe the following changes in the list of nodes in 
         the :guilabel:`Overview` tab:

         - The original ``PRIMARY`` node is now a ``SECONDARY`` node.

         - A former ``SECONDARY`` node is now the ``PRIMARY`` node.

Troubleshoot Failover Issues 
----------------------------

If your application doesn't handle the failover gracefully, ensure the
following:

- You are using the :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.
- You are using the latest version of the driver.
- You have implemented appropriate retry logic in your application.
