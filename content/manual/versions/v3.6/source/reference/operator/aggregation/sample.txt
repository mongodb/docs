Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $sample

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   Randomly selects the specified number of documents from its input.

   The :pipeline:`$sample` stage has the following syntax: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $sample: { size: <positive integer> } }

Behavior
--------

:pipeline:`$sample` uses one of two methods to obtain N random
documents, depending on the size of the collection, the size of N,
and ``$sample``'s position in the pipeline.

If all the following conditions are met, ``$sample`` uses a
pseudo-random cursor to select documents:

- ``$sample`` is the first stage of the pipeline
- N is less than 5% of the total documents in the collection
- The collection contains more than 100 documents

If any of the above conditions are NOT met, ``$sample`` performs a
collection scan followed by a random sort to select N documents. In
this case, the :pipeline:`$sample` stage is subject to the
:ref:`sort memory restrictions <sort-memory-limit>`.

.. warning::

   :pipeline:`$sample` may output the same document more than once in
   its result set. For more information, see :ref:`cursor-isolation`.

Example
--------

Given a collection named ``users`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "dave123", "q1" : true, "q2" : true }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "dave2", "q1" : false, "q2" : false  }
   { "_id" : 3, "name" : "ahn", "q1" : true, "q2" : true  }
   { "_id" : 4, "name" : "li", "q1" : true, "q2" : false  }
   { "_id" : 5, "name" : "annT", "q1" : false, "q2" : true  }
   { "_id" : 6, "name" : "li", "q1" : true, "q2" : true  }
   { "_id" : 7, "name" : "ty", "q1" : false, "q2" : true  }

The following aggregation operation randomly selects ``3`` documents from the
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
      [ { $sample: { size: 3 } } ]
   )

The operation returns three random documents.
