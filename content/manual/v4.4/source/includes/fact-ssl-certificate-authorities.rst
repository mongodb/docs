For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
certificates generated and signed by a certificate authority. You or
your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate
authority, or use certificates generated by third-party TLS/SSL
vendors. Obtaining and managing certificates is beyond the scope of
this documentation.
