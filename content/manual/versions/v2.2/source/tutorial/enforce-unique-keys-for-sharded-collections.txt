Overview
--------

The :method:`unique <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` constraint on indexes ensures
that only one document can have a value for a field in a
:term:`collection`. For :ref:`sharded collections these unique indexes
cannot enforce uniqueness <limit-sharding-unique-indexes>` because
insert and indexing operations are local to each shard. [#limitation]_

If your need to ensure that a field is always unique in all
collections in a sharded environment, there are two options:

#. Enforce uniqueness of the :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.

   MongoDB *can* enforce uniqueness for the :term:`shard key`. For
   compound shard keys, MongoDB will enforce uniqueness on the
   *entire* key combination, and not for a specific component of the
   shard key.

#. Use a secondary collection to enforce uniqueness.

   Create a minimal collection that only contains the unique field and
   a reference to a document in the main collection. If you always
   insert into a secondary collection *before* inserting to the main
   collection, MongoDB will produce an error if you attempt to use a
   duplicate key.

   .. note::

      If you have a small data set, you may not need to shard this
      collection and you can create multiple unique indexes. Otherwise
      you can shard on a single unique key.

Always use the default :ref:`acknowledged <write-concern-acknowledged>`
:ref:`write concern <write-concern>` in conjunction with a
:doc:`recent MongoDB driver </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`.

.. [#limitation] If you specify a unique index on a sharded
   collection, MongoDB will be able to enforce uniqueness only among
   the documents located on a single shard *at the time of creation*.

Unique Constraints on the Shard Key
-----------------------------------

.. _sharding-pattern-unique-procedure-shard-key:

Process
~~~~~~~

To shard a collection
using the ``unique`` constraint, specify the :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.users" , key : { email : 1 } , unique : true } );

Remember that the ``_id`` field index is always unique. By default, MongoDB
inserts an ``ObjectId`` into the ``_id`` field. However,
you can manually insert your own value into the ``_id`` field and
use this as the shard key. To use the
``_id`` field as the shard key, use the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.users" } )

.. warning::

   In any sharded collection where you are *not* sharding by the
   ``_id`` field, you must ensure uniqueness of the ``_id``
   field. The best way to ensure ``_id`` is always unique is to use
   ``ObjectId``, or another universally unique identifier (UUID.)

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only enforce uniqueness on one single field in the collection
  using this method.

- If you use a compound shard key, you can only enforce
  uniqueness on the *combination* of component keys in the shard
  key.

In most cases, the best shard keys are compound keys that include elements
that permit :ref:`write scaling <sharding-shard-key-write-scaling>`
and :ref:`query isolation <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`, as
well as :ref:`high cardinality <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>`.
These ideal shard keys are not often the same keys that require
uniqueness and requires a different approach.

.. In the last sentence above, is it compound keys that require a different approach? -bg

Unique Constraints on Arbitrary Fields
--------------------------------------

If you cannot use a unique field as the shard key or if you need to
enforce uniqueness over multiple fields, you must create another
:term:`collection` to act as a "proxy collection". This collection
must contain both a reference to the original document (i.e. its
``ObjectId``) and the unique key.

If you must shard this "proxy" collection, then shard on the unique
key using the :ref:`above procedure <sharding-pattern-unique-procedure-shard-key>`;
otherwise, you can simply create multiple unique indexes on the
collection.

Process
~~~~~~~

Consider the following for the "proxy collection:"

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("...")
     "email" ": "..."
   }

The ``_id`` field holds the ``ObjectId`` of the :term:`document`
it reflects, and the ``email`` field is the field on which you want to
ensure uniqueness.

To shard this collection, use the following operation
using the ``email`` field as the :term:`shard key`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "records.proxy" , key : { email : 1 } , unique : true } );

If you do not need to shard the proxy collection, use the following
command to create a unique index on the ``email`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.proxy.ensureIndex( { "email" : 1 }, {unique : true} )

You may create multiple unique indexes on this collection if you do
not plan to shard the ``proxy`` collection.

To insert documents, use the following procedure in the
:ref:`JavaScript shell <mongo>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use records;

   var primary_id = ObjectId();

   db.proxy.insert({
      "_id" : primary_id
      "email" : "example@example.net"
   })

   // if: the above operation returns successfully,
   // then continue:

   db.information.insert({
      "_id" : primary_id
      "email": "example@example.net"
      // additional information...
   })

You must insert a document into the ``proxy`` collection first. If
this operation succeeds, the ``email`` field is unique, and you may
continue by inserting the actual document into the ``information``
collection.

.. see:: The full documentation of: :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`
   and :dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Your application must catch errors when inserting documents into the
  "proxy" collection and must enforce consistency between the two
  collections.

- If the proxy collection requires sharding, you must shard on the
  single field on which you want to enforce uniqueness.

- To enforce uniqueness on more than one field using sharded proxy
  collections, you must have *one* proxy collection for *every* field
  for which to enforce uniqueness. If you create multiple unique
  indexes on a single proxy collection, you will *not* be able to
  shard proxy collections.
