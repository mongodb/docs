===================================================================
Enable SCRAM-SHA-1 / MONGODB-CR Authentication for your |mms| Group
===================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/enable-auth-intro.rst

In MongoDB 3.0 and later, MongoDB's default authentication mechanism is
a challenge and response mechanism (``SCRAM-SHA-1``). Previously, MongoDB
used MongoDB Challenge and Response (``MONGODB-CR``) as the default.

``SCRAM-SHA-1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is an IETF standard, `RFC 5802
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_, that defines best practice
methods for implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for
authenticating users with passwords.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` verifies supplied user credentials against the user’s name,
password and database. The user’s database is the database where the
user was created, and the user’s database and the user’s name together
serves to identify the user.

``MONGODB-CR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response mechanism that authenticates
users through passwords.

``MONGODB-CR`` verifies supplied user credentials against the user’s name,
password and database. The user’s database is the database where the
user was created, and the user’s database and the user’s name together
serve to identify the user.

Considerations
--------------

This tutorial describes how to enable Username/Password
(``MONGODB-CR``/``SCRAM-SHA-1``) authentication for your |mms|
deployment. Username/Password authentication is the only authentication
mechanism available in |mms| when using the MongoDB Community version.

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable ``MONGODB-CR`` / ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or Backup
agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure them to
use ``MONGODB-CR`` / ``SCRAM-SHA-1``. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-cr` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr` for instructions.
