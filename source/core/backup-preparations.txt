Backup Preparations
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Before backing up your cluster or replica set, decide how to back up the
data and what data to back up. This page describes items you must consider
before starting a backup. 

.. only:: cloud or onprem

   For an overview of how Backup works, see
   :ref:`mms-backup-functional-overview`.

.. _snapshot-frequency-and-retention:

Snapshot Frequency and Retention Policy
---------------------------------------

By default, |mms| takes a base snapshot of your data every 6 hours. If
desired, administrators can change the frequency of base snapshots to 8,
12, or 24 hours.

|mms| retains snapshots for the time periods listed in the following
table. If you terminate a backup, |mms| immediately deletes the backup's
snapshots.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 30 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Snapshot
     - Default Retention Policy
     - Maximum Retention Setting
   * - Base snapshot.
     - 2 days
     - 5 days.
   * - Daily snapshot
     - 1 week
     - 1 year
   * - Weekly snapshot
     - 1 month
     - 1 year
   * - Monthly snapshot
     - 1 year
     - 3 years.

.. only:: cloud

   Changes to the snapshot schedule affect your :ref:`snapshot storage
   costs <backup-pricing>`.

Administrators can change snapshot frequency and the retention policy
through the :doc:`snapshotSchedule resource in the API
</reference/api/snapshot-schedule>`. If you change the schedule to save
fewer snapshots, |mms| does **not** delete existing snapshots to conform
to the new schedule. To delete unneeded snapshots, see
:doc:`/tutorial/delete-backup-snapshots`.

.. _excluded-namespaces:

Excluded Namespaces
-------------------

Excluded namespaces are databases or collections that |mms| will not
back up. Exclude namespaces to prevent backing up collections that
contain logging data, caches, or other ephemeral data. Excluding
these kinds of databases and collections will allow you to reduce
backup time and costs.

.. _considerations-backup-storage-engine:

Storage Engine
--------------

When you enable backups for a cluster or replica set that runs on MongoDB
3.0 or higher, you can choose the storage engine for the backups. Your
choices are the MMAPv1 engine or WiredTiger engine. If you do not specify
a storage engine, |mms| uses MMAPv1 by default. For more information on
storage engines, see :manual:`Storage </core/storage>` in the MongoDB
manual.

You can choose a different storage engine for a backup than you do for the
original data. There is no requirement that the storage engine for a backup
match that of the data it replicates. If your original data uses MMAPv1,
you can choose WiredTiger for backing up, and vice versa.

You can change the storage engine for a cluster or replica set's backups
at any time, but doing so requires an :term:`initial sync` of the backup
on the new engine.

If you choose the WiredTiger engine to back up a collection that
already uses WiredTiger, the initial sync replicates all the
collection's WiredTiger options. For information on these options,
see the ``storage.wiredTiger.collectionConfig`` section of the
:manual:`Configuration File Options </reference/configuration-options>`
page in the MongoDB manual.

.. only:: onprem

   For collections created after initial sync, the Backup Daemon uses its
   own defaults for storing data. The Daemon will not replicate any
   WiredTiger options for a collection created after iniitial sync.

Index collection options are never replicated.

Resyncing Production Deployments
--------------------------------

For production deployments, it is recommended that as a best practice you
periodically (annually) :doc:`resync </tutorial/resync-backup>` all
backed-up replica sets. When you resync, data is read from a secondary in
each replica set. During resync, no new snapshots are generated.

.. _checkpoint:

Checkpoints
-----------

For :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, checkpoints provide
additional restore points between snapshots. With
checkpoints enabled, |mms| Backup creates restoration points at
configurable intervals of every 15, 30 or 60 minutes between
snapshots.

To create a checkpoint, |mms| Backup stops the :term:`balancer`
and inserts a token into the :term:`oplog` of each
:term:`shard` and :term:`config server` in the cluster. These
checkpoint tokens are lightweight and do not have a consequential
impact on performance or disk use.

Backup does not require checkpoints, and they are disabled by default.

Restoring from a checkpoint requires |mms| Backup to apply the oplog of
each shard and config server to the last snapshot captured before the
checkpoint. Restoration from a checkpoint takes longer than
restoration from a snapshot.

.. _snapshot-while-balancer-enabled:

Snapshots when Agent Cannot Stop Balancer
-----------------------------------------

For :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`,
|mms| disables the :term:`balancer` before taking a
cluster snapshot. In certain situations, such as a long migration or no
running :program:`mongos`, |mms| tries to disable the balancer but cannot.
In such cases, |mms| will continue to take cluster snapshots but will flag
the snapshots with a warning that data may be incomplete and/or
inconsistent. Cluster snapshots taken during an active balancing
operation run the risk of data loss or orphaned data.

Snapshots when Agent Cannot Contact a ``mongod``
------------------------------------------------

For :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`,
if the Backup Agent cannot reach a :program:`mongod` instance, whether a
shard or config server, then the agent cannot insert a synchronization
:term:`oplog` token. If this happens, |mms| will not create the snapshot and
will display a warning message.
