# library. Each YAML document has the following schema:
#
#    from: "the path to the redirected URL"
#    to: "the path to the new location for the resource"
#    type: "currently this script only supports 'redirect', and
#          ignores all documents with another type."
#    code: "the HTTP redirect code. Raises exception if not 301, 302, 303."
#    outputs: "a list of branches/paths beneath http://docs.mongodb.org/ to
#             place this redirect. 'all', 'before-<branch>' and
#             'after-<branch>' have special meaning.
#
# 'outputs' possibility:
#
# - 'all': Generates redirects for all published branches, but *not* 'manual'.
#
# - 'before-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that
#   reflect releases previous to the specified branch. (Inclusive.)
#
# - 'after-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that
#   reflect releases after the specified branch. (Non-inclusive.)
#
# Note:
#   For most cases, should **not** have any before-xxx in conjunction with current and master
#   There might be some temporary exceptions, but should not be any in this redirect file
#
#   If a file and a directory share the same name (and it could be earlier versions)
#   make sure you add .html to the file and use *quotes*.
#   For example, '/monitoring/tutorial.html' and monitoring/tutorial/ directory to
#   ensure redirect of /monitoring/tutorial/xxx doesn't substitute the
#   /monitoring/tutorial part first
#
# All paths are relative to the ``source/`` directory.
