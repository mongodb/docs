Considerations
--------------

Support by {+Cluster+} Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports changing a {+cluster+}'s region and cloud provider:

- When you :doc:`increase the {+cluster+} tier </scale-cluster>` of an 
  ``M0``, ``M2``, or  ``M5`` {+cluster+}.
- Anytime on an ``M10+`` multi-region {+cluster+}.

Preferred and Electable Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each node in the preferred and electable regions can:

- Participate in :manual:`replica set elections
  </core/replica-set-elections>`

- Become the :term:`primary` if the majority of replica set nodes
  are available.

Electable nodes in the {+cluster+} must total 3, 5, or 7.

Migration, Downtime and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the amount of data to migrate, migrations can take a
significant amount of time. To maximize availability for a replica set,
|service| migrates one member at a time, starting with the secondary
members first and then the primary.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity: each newly migrated replica set member must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` are set to read from
secondaries: the replica set is down one secondary during the migration.

VPC Peering (AWS Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you move a {+cluster+} out of a region that has a
:doc:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) </security-vpc-peering>` peering
connection, the moved cluster can no longer use that peering connection
to communicate with servers in the |vpc|. Any other {+clusters+} with 
nodes remaining in the original region can continue to use the |vpc| 
peering connection.

You can create multiple |vpc| connections for each region, including
a new |vpc| peering connection with the region that you moved a
{+cluster+} to.

.. note::

   {+Cluster+} nodes removed from a region can't inherit access rules 
   from an |aws| security group or allowed |vpc| |cidr| blocks 
   configured for the |vpc| peering connection. You must 
   :ref:`add-to-access-list` for all the virtual servers residing in 
   the |vpc|. {+Cluster+} nodes remaining in the region are 
   unaffected.

Billing 
~~~~~~~

If you change your {+cluster+}'s :ref:`highest priority region 
<deploy-across-multiple-regions>` or if MongoDB migrates oplog data to 
a different region, you will be billed for storage in both the old and 
new regions for the days following the region change. You must disable 
{+pit-restore+} and reenable it to prevent billing in both the regions.

.. note:: 

   If you disable {+pit-restore+}, |service| will delete the 
   {+pit-restore+} history.


Move a Single-Region {+Cluster+}
--------------------------------

Use the following procedure to move nodes to a single-region 
{+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/steps/move-single-region-cluster.rst

Move a Multi-Region {+Cluster+}
-------------------------------

Use the following procedure to move nodes to one or more regions in an
``M10`` or larger multi-region {+cluster+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/move-multi-region-cluster.rst
