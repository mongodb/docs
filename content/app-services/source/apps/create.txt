Overview
--------

You can create a new App Services App from the App Services UI, CLI, or
Admin API.

An App Services App is a managed backend instance that contains your
application's services. Each app belongs to a specific Atlas project.

To create an App in a project, you must be logged in to `MongoDB Atlas
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_ and have
**Project Owner** permissions.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You will need the following to create an App in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      You will need the following to create an App in the CLI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/appservices-cli.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      You will need the following to create an App with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

Procedure
---------

.. _create-app-ui:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the App Services UI

            In the Atlas UI Project dashboard, click the :guilabel:`App
            Services` tab.

         .. step:: Choose an App Type

            You can either create a new blank App or start from a
            template that has some services pre-configured for you. Some
            template Apps also come with corresponding client
            applications.

            To learn more, see :ref:`Template Apps <template-apps>`.

            If the project has no Apps, you will be prompted to either
            create a new App from a template or to start from scratch.

            Otherwise, you can choose between two create buttons at the
            top right of the :guilabel:`App Services` tab:

            - To create a blank App, click the :guilabel:`Create a New App` button.

            - To use a template, click the :guilabel:`Create App from
              Template` and select a template from the dropdown menu.

         .. step:: Configure App Settings

            The UI prompts you to configure the following settings:

            - The **Application Name**. Your App name is public and
              included in the App ID used by clients.

              .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst

            - A **Linked Data Source**. This is an Atlas cluster that
              the App can access. If the project has no clusters, you
              can have App Services create one for you automatically.

              .. include:: /includes/mongodb-5.0-required-for-sync-admonition.rst

            You can also configure the following optional settings under
            :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration`:

            - The **Application Region** which determines where your App
              executes and where its metadata is stored. To learn more,
              see :ref:`Deployment Models & Regions
              <realm-deployment-models>`.

            - The **App Environment** that determines which environment
              values to use. To learn more, see :ref:`Configure an App
              Environment <app-environment>`.

         .. step:: Create the App

            Once you've configured the App, click :guilabel:`Create App
            Service`.

            Upon creation of your App, the Atlas UI automatically
            redirects you to the App Services Admin UI.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: Run the App Creation Command

            The CLI can create an app and copy its :ref:`configuration files
            <app-configuration>` to a local directory with a single command. The command
            asks you to specify the app name and the Atlas project that should contain the
            app. You can configure the command with flags or interactively.

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} apps create

            The command also supports additional flags that you can optionally include
            to customize your app. The following table lists common flags you might use:

            .. list-table::

               * - ``--template``
                 - Choose an App template to start from. If you don't
                   specify a template, the command creates a blank app.

                   For a list of all template apps, see to
                   :ref:`Available Template Apps <template-apps-list>`.

               * - ``--deployment-model``
                 - Defines the App's :ref:`deployment model <deployment-model>`.

                   Valid values:

                   - ``GLOBAL``
                   - ``LOCAL``

               * - ``--provider-region``
                 - Defines the App's deployment region.
                 
                   For a list of available regions, see :ref:`<deployment-regions>`.

               * - ``--environment``
                 - Sets the App's :ref:`environment tag <app-environment>`.

                   Valid values:

                   - ``development``
                   - ``testing``
                   - ``qa``
                   - ``production``

            .. seealso::

              For more details and additional flags, see the
              :ref:`CLI documentation for the create command <appservices-apps-create>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Get an Admin API Access Token

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Get the Project ID

            Every App Services App belongs to a MongoDB Atlas project.

            To create a App you need the Project ID (sometimes referred to as
            the Group ID) of the MongoDB Atlas project that contains the app.
            You will include this ID in the URL of API requests.

         .. step:: Create a new App

            You can create a new App through the
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Create an App
            <operation/adminCreateApplication>` endpoint.

            Your request must include:

            - An ``Authorization`` header with your Admin API access
              token as a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>`.

            - A ``name`` for the new App

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl -X POST \
                 https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps \
                 --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
                 --data '{ "name": "<App Name>" }'

            If you want to create an app from a :ref:`template
            <template-apps>`, you must also include the following in the
            request body:

            - The ``template_id`` field with one of the available
              template apps. For a list of all template apps, refer to
              :ref:`Available Template Apps <template-apps-list>`.

            - The ``data_source`` field with information about an
              existing Atlas cluster.

              .. code-block:: shell

                 curl -X POST \
                   https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps \
                   -H 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
                   -d '{
                     "name": "<App Name>",
                     "template_id": "<Template App Id>",
                     "data_source": {
                       "name": "mongodb-atlas",
                       "type": "mongodb-atlas",
                       "config": {
                         "clusterName": "<Atlas Cluster Name>"
                       }
                     }
                   }'

            If your App is created successfully, the API returns a
            ``201`` response with information about your new App.
