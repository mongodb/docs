   To specify filter condition, type in a :ref:`query filter
   <read-operations-query-argument>` document in the filter bar. For
   example, to specify equality condition, use a filter document of the
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: <value1>, ... }

   To use query operators to specify a filter condition, use a filter
   document of the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: { <queryoperator>: <value1> }, ... }

   To clone a document displayed in the query results, hover over the
   document and click on its clone document icon.
   
   .. figure:: /images/clone-document.png
      :alt: Clone document icon
      :figwidth: 202px

   The document editor appears with the ``_id`` field with an
   :ref:`objectid` value that reflects the time of its generation and
   not the insertion time of the document. As such, the :ref:`objectid`
   does not represent a strict insertion order.
