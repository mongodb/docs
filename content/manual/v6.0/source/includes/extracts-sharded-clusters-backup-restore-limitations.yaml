   To use :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` as a backup
   strategy for sharded clusters, see :ref:`backup-sharded-dumps`.

   Sharded clusters can also use one of the following coordinated backup
   and restore processes, which maintain the atomicity guarantees of
   transactions across shards:

   - `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database>`_

   - `MongoDB Cloud Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager>`_

   - `MongoDB Ops Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager>`_
