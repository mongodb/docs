Can I bring an existing MongoDB deployment into |service-fullname| for management?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. However, you can upload data from existing MongoDB deployment into
|service-fullname|.

- You can use the :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>` feature
  in |service| to migrate from a source replica set to an Atlas cluster.

- You can use :program:`mongomirror` to migrate data from an existing
  MongoDB replica set into |service-fullname|.

- You can use :program:`mongodump <bin.mongodump>` and
  :program:`mongorestore <bin.mongorestore>` to seed |service-fullname|
  clusters from an existing standalone, replica set, and sharded
  cluster .

For information, see :doc:`/import`.

You can also write scripts using official MongoDB supported drivers to
upload data.

Which versions of MongoDB does |service| use for the clusters?
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. include:: /includes/note-enterprise-not-supported.rst

Can I migrate between regions?
------------------------------

You cannot migrate between regions automatically; however, you can
create different |service| groups that are associated with different
regions and perform manual migration.

Do you support cross-region deployments?
----------------------------------------

No. However, |service| continues to evaluate various deployment
strategies that ensure that a cluster deployment spans at least three
availability zones, including potentially the use of cross-region
deployments of clusters.

Until that time, if a cluster must span multiple regions, see MongoDB
Cloud Manager.

Will you support more regions in the future?
--------------------------------------------

|service| continues to evaluate various strategies that ensure that a
cluster deployment spans at least three availability zones, including
the use of new regions, infrastructure, and deployment strategies.

Until that time, if a cluster must exist in non-supported regions, see
MongoDB Cloud Manager.

Do you handle OS patches?
-------------------------

Yes. |service| will automatically and transparently upgrade the OS
patches in a rolling fashion to maintain cluster availability.

How can I pay for |service-fullname| without a credit card?
-----------------------------------------------------------

For alternative ways of purchasing |service|, please `contact MongoDB
Inc. <https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.

Can I specify my own VPC for my |service-fullname| group?
---------------------------------------------------------

No. An |service| group, and its clusters, are associated with a
region-specific Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

To use a different VPC (e.g. on the customer's own cloud infrastructure
accounts), then the customer would need to use MongoDB Cloud Manager or
Ops Manager.

|service-fullname| or Cloud Manager?
------------------------------------

|service| offers a managed experience, but without all of the
configurations and infrastructure flexibility that some MongoDB users
require. For example, |service| only supports MongoDB versions 3.2 and
MongoDB 3.4 with the WiredTiger storage engine. You also cannot
customize the replica set or sharded cluster configuration.

MongoDB Cloud Manager offers users more control, exposing numerous
MongoDB configuration options such as the storage engine, startup
parameters, and access control options. Cloud Manager also provides
the ability to manage MongoDB on the infrastructure of your choice.
MongoDB Cloud Manager is better suited for advanced operations users
who require this higher level of control, but Cloud Manager requires
users to manage the full lifecycle of their infrastructure.

.. _cm-create-atlas-group:

As an existing |mms-full| account holder, how do I create a new |service-fullname| group?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/add-atlas-group-cm-version.rst

The :guilabel:`Create a New Group` screen provides you the choice to
create either an |service| group or a |mms| group. Select
:guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas` to create a new |service| group and switch to
the :guilabel:`Clusters` view in |service|. To add clusters to the new
group, continue to :doc:`/create-new-cluster`.


Can I disable SSL/TLS on my deployment?
---------------------------------------

No.

.. _how-do-i-remove-my-company-group:

How do I remove my group?
-------------------------

You can remove a group if:

- You have the Owner role for the group.

- The group has no outstanding invoices.

- The group has no active clusters.

To remove a group, go to :guilabel:`Settings`,
:guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions` and click the :guilabel:`Close Group
<groupName>` link.

.. _can-i-pause-or-stop-cluster:

Can I pause or stop my |service| clusters?
------------------------------------------

No. You can only create and terminate |service| clusters.

.. _how-do-i-modify-my-alert-settings:

How do I modify alerts?
-----------------------

To modify an existing alert settings, go to :guilabel:`Alerts` and
select :guilabel:`Alert Settings`. Click the ellipsis ``...`` to modify
(edit, clone, disable, delete) the setting for an active Alerts.

Does MongoDB |service| expose the oplog?
----------------------------------------

Yes. To access the :term:`oplog`, a database user must have read access on the
``local`` database. To create a user with read access on ``local``:

1. Click :guilabel:`Clusters`, then :guilabel:`Security`.

2. Click :guilabel:`Add New User` and enter a user name. For example, "oploguser".

3. Click :guilabel:`Show Advanced Options` and select the ``read`` role and
   the ``local`` database. This restricts the user to read operations on the
   ``local`` database.

4. Enter a password and click :guilabel:`Add User`.

Can MongoDB |service deploy clusters with more than 12 shards?
--------------------------------------------------------------

While MongoDB |service| out of the box allows selection of up to 12 shards,
customers interested in more than 12 shards should inquire with MongoDB
representatives
