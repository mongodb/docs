To backup the :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>`
collection, which is created when you activate :ref:`database profiling
<database-profiling>`, you must have **additional**
``read`` access on this collection. Several
roles provide this access, including the :authrole:`clusterAdmin` and
:authrole:`dbAdmin` roles.
