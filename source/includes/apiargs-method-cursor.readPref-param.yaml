  Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the client
  stops using it for read operations. For details, see:
  :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness`.

  By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
  secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation.
  
  The minimum {{arg_name}} value is 90 seconds. Specifying a
  value of less than 90 seconds will produce an error.
  
  .. important::
     To use ``maxStalenessSeconds``, all of the
     MongoDB instances in your deployment must be using MongoDB 3.4 or
     later. If any instances are on an earlier version of MongoDB, the
     driver of :program:`mongos` will raise an error.
