MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the {+driver-short+} for use with a specific version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.

Language Compatibility
----------------------

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version of the 
{+driver-long+} for use with a specific version of C.

The first column lists the driver version.

Platform Compatibility
----------------------

This section includes version compatibility information about platforms and
toolchains that are supported by the {+driver-short+}.

Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operating systems are expected to be supported for use
with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :align: left

  * - Operating System
    - Notes

  * - Debian
    - Versions 11.0 and later

  * - RHEL
    - Versions 7.0 and later. RHEL derivatives (such as CentOS,
      Rocky Linux, and AlmaLinux) of the same release version are
      supported. Fedora is also supported.

  * - Ubuntu
    - Versions 20.04 and later. Ubuntu derivatives based on supported
      Ubuntu versions are also supported.

  * - Arch Linux
    -

  * - macOS
    - Versions 11.0 and later

  * - Windows
    - Windows Server 2008 and later

Compilers
~~~~~~~~~

The following compilers are continually tested with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :align: left

  * - Compiler
    - Notes

  * - Clang
    - Versions 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0. Newer versions
      are also supported, as well as the corresponding Apple Clang releases.

  * - GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
    - Versions 4.8, 5.4, 6.3, 7.5, 8.2, 8.3,
      9.4, and 10.2. The MinGW-w64 GCC is also tested and supported.

  * - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
    - Tested with MSVC 14.x (Visual Studio 2015) and 15.x (Visual Studio
      2017). Newer MSVC versions are supported but not yet tested.

Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following CPU architectures are continually tested with the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
  :align: left
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Architecture
    - Notes
  * - x86 (32-bit)
    - Tested only on Windows
  * - x86_64 (64-bit x86)
    - Tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * - ARM / aarch64
    - Tested on macOS and Linux
  * - Power8 (ppc64le)
    - Tested only on Linux
  * - zSeries (s390x)
    - Tested only on Linux

Additional Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other platforms and toolchains are not tested, but we expect similar versions
of the preceding platforms to work. If you encounter a platform or toolchain that you
expect to work and find that it does not, please open an issue describing the
problem, or open a `GitHub Pull Request <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/pulls>`__ to fix it.

.. important::
  
   Simple pull requests to fix unsupported platforms are welcome, but will be
   considered on a case-by-case basis. The acceptance of a pull request to fix the
   libraries on an unsupported platform does not imply full support of that
   platform.
