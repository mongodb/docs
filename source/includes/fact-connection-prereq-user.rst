MongoDB Database User
   To access a cluster, you must create a
   :manual:`Database User </core/security-users/>` with access to the
   desired database(s) on your |service| cluster. MongoDB database users
   are separate from |service| users. MongoDB database users have access
   to MongoDB databases, while |service| users have access to the
   |service| application itself.

   You can create a MongoDB database user to access to your |service|
   cluster in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the
   MongoDB database user from the :ref:`Clusters view <mongodb-users>`.
