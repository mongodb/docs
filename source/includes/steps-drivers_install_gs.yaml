title: Create the MongoDB Connection URI String
ref: connection_string
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |
  
  In order to connect to MongoDB, you will need a :ref:`URI string <mongodb-uri>`. A
  ``URI`` (Uniform Resource Identifier) is similar to a URL, and is
  supplied as a parameter to the ``mongo`` shell, Compass, and the
  MongoDB drivers to connect to a MongoDB
  deployment.
  
  Use the form below to populate the URI string.

  .. note:: The $[password] will not be replaced in the string below, so you will 
            need to replace the string with your password.
            Use caution where you store and enter passwords, particularly when
            running from a shell or command prompt. Special characters
            in passwords must be escaped.

  .. note:: If you are connecting to MongoDB in the cloud (Atlas), you'll need to
            add the ip address of the client you wish to use in the ip whitelist
            in your Atlas account. For more details, `Atlas documentation
            <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-whitelist/>__`
