This tutorial describes how to create an index on the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and run partial string queries 
against the ``plot`` field. To return matches for partial string 
queries, you can use one of the following operators:

- The :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator, which allows you to search the 
  specified fields for a word or phrase that contains the sequence of 
  characters that you specify with your query.

- The :ref:`phrase-ref` operator, which allows you to search the 
  specified fields for documents that contain the terms in your query 
  string at the distance you specify between the terms.

- The :ref:`regex-ref` operator, which allows you to search the 
  specified fields for strings using regular expression.

- The :ref:`wildcard-ref` operator, which allows you to search the 
  specified fields using special characters in your query to match any 
  character.

This tutorial takes you through the following steps: 

1. Set up an |fts| index on the ``plot`` field in the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
#. Run |fts| query for a partial string against the ``plot`` field in 
   the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection using 
   :ref:`autocomplete-ref`, :ref:`phrase-ref`, :ref:`regex-ref`, and 
   :ref:`wildcard-ref` operators.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| cluster meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`.

Create the |fts| Index  
----------------------

In this section, you will create an |fts| index on the ``plot`` field 
in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for running partial match 
queries against those fields.

You can use the :ref:`autocomplete-ref`, :ref:`phrase-ref`, 
:ref:`regex-ref`, and :ref:`wildcard-ref` operators to run a 
case-sensitive partial match query. This tutorial uses these operators  
to search for movies whose plot contain the specified partial string. 

In this section, you will connect to your |service| cluster and run the 
sample query using the operator against the ``plot`` field in the 
``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
