Read Concern Majority (3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB enables support for
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern by default.

You can disable read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` to prevent the
storage cache pressure from immobilizing a three-member replica set
with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded
cluster with a three-member PSA shards.

.. note::

   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern disables support
   for :doc:`/changeStreams`.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-concern-majority.rst

For more information, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Change Stream Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 uses the version 1 (i.e. ``v1``) change streams
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`, introduced in
version 4.0.7.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.2-greater.rst

.. admonition:: When upgrading from MongoDB 4.0.6 or earlier to MongoDB |newversion|
   :class: note

   During the upgrade process, the members of the sharded clusters will
   continue to produce ``v0`` tokens until the first
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is upgraded. The upgrade
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances will begin producing ``v1`` change
   stream resume tokens. These cannot be used to resume a stream on a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` which has not yet been upgraded.

Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process
checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

MMAPv1 to WiredTiger Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 removes support for the deprecated MMAPv1 storage engine.

If your 4.0 deployment uses MMAPv1, you must change the 4.0 deployment
to :doc:`/core/wiredtiger` before upgrading to MongoDB 4.2. For
details, see :doc:`/tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger`.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| sharded cluster must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.0``. 

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.0``, connect to each
shard replica set member and each config server replica set member
and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shards and config servers, ensure that no replica set member is in
:replstate:`ROLLBACK` or :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Back up the ``config`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs>`_.

See :doc:`/installation` for more information.
