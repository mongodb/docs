.. method:: isInteractive()

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

   Returns a boolean value indicating if the current
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session is running in interactive mode or in

   - ``true`` if in interactive mode
   
   - ``false`` if in script mode

Examples
--------

Interactive Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issuing Operations inside the Shell
```````````````````````````````````

Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to a deployment. Inside
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`, run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   isInteractive()

The method returns ``true``.

Running a Javascript File inside ``mongosh``
````````````````````````````````````````````

Create a JavaScript ``testExample.js`` file with the content:

.. code-block:: javascript

   print("Is the shell in interactive mode?  " + isInteractive() );

Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to a deployment. Inside
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`, load the javascript file (see
:method:`load()`):

.. code-block:: javascript

   let loadStatus = load("testExample.js");  //You may need to specify the path to the file

The method returns the following in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

.. code-block:: none

   Is the shell in interactive mode?  true


Script Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a JavaScript ``testExample.js`` file with the content:

.. code-block:: javascript

   print("\n\nIs the shell in interactive mode?  " + isInteractive() );

From a terminal/command-line prompt (i.e. not inside
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`), specify the javascript file to
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` in order to execute the file, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh localhost:27017/test testExample.js

The operation prints to the terminal information about the MongoDB
shell version and various information followed by:

.. code-block:: none

   MongoDB shell version v4.4.0
   ...


   Is the shell in interactive mode?  false
