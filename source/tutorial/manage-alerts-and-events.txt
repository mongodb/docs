Overview
--------

|mms| sends an alert when a specified :doc:`alert condition
</reference/alerts>` occurs, such as an unresponsive host or outdated
agent. |mms| defines alert conditions and their notification methods in
:doc:`alert configurations </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`. You
can view alerts through the :guilabel:`Activity` tab, as well as through
the alert notification.

When a condition triggers an alert, you receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert is resolved or canceled. You can acknowledge an
alert for a period of time, but if the alert condition persists, you again
receive notifications when the acknowledgment period ends.

An alert is resolved when the condition that triggered the alert is
corrected. |mms| sends notifications at the time the alert is resolved.

An alert is canceled if the alert configuration that triggered the alert
is deleted, disabled, or edited, or if the open alert becomes invalid.
Some examples of an alert becoming invalid are:

- There is an open "Host Down" alert, and the target host is deleted.

- There is an open "Replication Lag" alert, and the target host is elected
  primary.

- There is an open "Replica Set Has No Primary" alert for replica sets whose
  name is "rs0," and the target replica set is renamed to "rs1."

When an alert is canceled, |mms| does **not** send a notification and does
not record an entry in the :guilabel:`Activity` tab.

Manage Alerts
-------------

View Open Alerts
++++++++++++++++

To view open alerts, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then select
:guilabel:`All Activity`. The :guilabel:`All Activity` page displays a
feed of all events tracked by |mms|. If you have open alerts, the page
displays them above the feed.

Filter Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the event feed by date.

.. include:: /includes/steps/activity-feed-filter.rst

Download Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the event feed as a CSV file (comma-separated values).

.. include:: /includes/steps/activity-feed-download.rst


Acknowledge an Open Alert
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-acknowledge.rst

After you acknowledge the alert, |mms| sends no further notifications to the
alert's distribution list until the acknowledgement period has passed or
until the alert is resolved. The distribution list receives *no*
notification of the acknowledgment.

If the alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |mms| sends a
notification of the resolution. For example, if you acknowledge a
host-down alert and the host comes back up during the acknowledgement
period, |mms| sends you a notification that the host is up.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident
management service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty
dashboard.

Unacknowledge an Acknowledged Alert

View Closed Alerts
++++++++++++++++++

To view closed alerts, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then select
:guilabel:`Closed Alerts`. The :guilabel:`Closed Alerts` page displays
alerts that users have closed explicitly or where the metric has dropped
below the threshold of the alert.
