This procedure uses the :program:`mongodump` and
:program:`mongorestore` tools to migrate data from a
|service| Free Tier cluster to a |service| Paid Tier cluster.

Considerations
--------------

``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore`` version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the 3.4 versions of the ``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore`` tools
for this procedure. To download the tools, see
`<http://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

:program:`mongodump` captures any configured indexes, but does not dump the
indexed data. The destination Paid Tier cluster performs foreground index
builds of any configured indexes once the migration procedure completes. You
may see lower query performance while the Paid Tier cluster rebuilds any
configured indexes.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   If using a :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` machine to execute this
   procedure, use :program:`mongodump.exe` and :program:`mongorestore.exe`.

You must be logged in to a |service| account associated to the Free Tier
cluster for this procedure. To log into |service|, go to
`https://www.cloud.mongodb.com
<https://www.cloud.mongodb.com/user/login?jmp=atlasdocs>`_ and enter your
credentials.
