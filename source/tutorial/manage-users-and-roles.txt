Overview
--------

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   MongoDB 2.6 introduces a new :ref:`authorization model
   <authorization>`.

MongoDB employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine access
for users. A user is granted one or more :ref:`roles <roles>` that
determine the user's access or privileges to MongoDB :ref:`resources
<resource-document>` and the :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>`
that user can perform. A user should have only the minimal set of
privileges required to ensure a system of :term:`least privilege`.

Each application and user of a MongoDB system should map to a distinct
application or user. This *access isolation* facilitates
access revocation and ongoing user maintenance. 

This tutorial provides examples for user and role management under the
MongoDB's authorization model.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. important::

   If you have :doc:`enabled access control
   </tutorial/enable-authentication>` for your deployment, you must
   authenticate as a user with the required privileges specified in each
   section. A user administrator with the
   :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role, or :authrole:`userAdmin` role
   in the specific databases, provides the required privileges to perform
   the operations listed in this tutorial. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for details on adding user
   administrator as the first user.

.. _add-new-user:

Add a User
----------

To create a user, specify the user name, password, and :ref:`roles
<roles>`. For users that authenticate using external mechanisms
[#external-auth-mechanisms]_, you do not need to provide the password
when creating users.

When assigning roles, select the roles that have the exact required
:ref:`privileges <privileges>`. If the correct roles does not exist,
you can :ref:`create new roles <create-user-defined-role>`.

.. [#external-auth-mechanisms] See :ref:`security-auth-x509`,
   :ref:`security-auth-kerberos`, and :ref:`security-auth-ldap`

.. _create-user-defined-role:

Create a User-Defined Role
--------------------------

Roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. MongoDB provides a
number of :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` that
administrators can use to control access to a MongoDB system. However,
if these roles cannot describe the desired set of privileges, you can
create new roles in a particular database.

.. include:: /includes/fact-roles-privileges-scope.rst

To create a new role, use the :method:`db.createRole()` method,
specifying the privileges in the ``privileges`` array and the inherited
roles in the ``roles`` array.

MongoDB uses the combination of the database name and the role name to
uniquely define a role. Each role is scoped to the database in which
you create the role, but MongoDB stores all role information in the
:data:`admin.system.roles` collection in the ``admin`` database.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/access-create-role.rst

.. _create-role-to-manage-ops:

Create a Role to Manage Current Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a role named ``manageOpRole`` which
provides only the privileges to run both :method:`db.currentOp()` and
:method:`db.killOp()`. [#built-in-roles1]_

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-role-manage-ops.rst

.. [#built-in-roles1] 
   The built-in role :authrole:`clusterMonitor` also provides the
   privilege to run :method:`db.currentOp()` along with other
   privileges, and the built-in role :authrole:`hostManager` provides
   the privilege to run :method:`db.killOp()` along with other
   privileges.

.. _create-role-for-mongostat:

Create a Role to Run ``mongostat``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a role named ``mongostatRole`` that
provides only the privileges to run :binary:`~bin.mongostat`.
[#built-in-roles2]_

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-role-mongostat.rst

.. [#built-in-roles2] The built-in role
   :authrole:`clusterMonitor` also provides the privilege to run
   :binary:`~bin.mongostat` along with other
   privileges.
