   |service| supports :doc:`creating </create-new-cluster>` ``M10+`` 
   paid tier clusters with the following MongoDB versions:

   - MongoDB 3.4
   - MongoDB 3.6
   - MongoDB 4.0

   ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared tier clusters only support
   MongoDB 4.0.

   As new maintenance releases become available, |service|
   automatically upgrades to these releases via a rolling process to
   maintain cluster availability.

   You can upgrade an existing |service| cluster to a newer major
   MongoDB version, if available, when you 
   :ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you 
   cannot downgrade a cluster's MongoDB version.

   .. important::

      If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
      that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
      cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that
      version unless you delete the custom role.
