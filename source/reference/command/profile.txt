.. dbcommand:: profile

   Use the :dbcommand:`profile` command to enable, disable, or change
   the query profiling level. This allows administrators to capture
   data regarding performance. The database profiling system can
   impact performance and can allow the server to write the contents
   of queries to the log.  Your deployment should carefully consider the
   security implications of this.
   Consider the following prototype syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { profile: <level> }

   The following profiling levels are available:

   =========  ==============================================
   **Level**  **Setting**
   ---------  ----------------------------------------------
     -1       No change. Returns the current profile level.
      0       Off. No profiling.
      1       On. Only includes slow operations.
      2       On. Includes all operations.
   =========  ==============================================

   You may optionally set a threshold in milliseconds for profiling using
   the ``slowms`` option, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { profile: 1, slowms: 200 }

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes the output of the database profiler to the
   ``system.profile`` collection.

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` records queries that take longer than
   the :setting:`slowms` to the server log even when the database profiler is
   not active.

   .. seealso:: ":method:`db.getProfilingStatus()`" and
                ":method:`db.setProfilingLevel()`" provide wrappers
                around this functionality in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
                shell.

   .. note::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and will
      block other operations until it has completed.  However, the write
      lock is only held while enabling or disabling the
      profiler.  This is typically a short operation.
