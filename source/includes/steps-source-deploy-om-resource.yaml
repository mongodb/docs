  Verify that each member of the Replica Set has one |tls| certificate named with the following format:

  ``<resource-name>db<index>-pem``

  Where ``<index>`` is a 0-based index number to the total amount of
  members minus one. (``0`` to ``n-1``)

  Create a new Secret from these files:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create secret generic appdb-certs \
             --from-file=om-appdb-0-pem \
             --from-file=om-appdb-1-pem \
             --from-file=om-appdb-2-pem

  ``kubectl`` creates one Secret containing the three certificates.

  You need to provide a |certauth| certificate when the |certauth| that
  signed the certificates might be not "recognized" as an official
  authority. Recognized and valid certificates can be created with
  `cert-manager <https://cert-manager.io/docs/>`__ or `HashiCorp Vault
  <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`__.

  If you signed the certificates using a |k8s| certicate management
  tool like `cert-manager <https://cert-manager.io/docs/>`__ or
  `HashiCorp Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`__, you must create a
  |k8s-configmap| containing the |certauth|\'s certificate file.

  If you output the certificate as a file, name this file ``ca-pem``.
  This simplifies creating the |k8s-configmap|.

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create configmap appdb-ca --from-file=ca-pem

  This creates a |k8s-configmap| named ``appdb-ca``. This
  |k8s-configmap| contains one entry called ``ca-pem`` with the
  contents of the |certauth| file.
