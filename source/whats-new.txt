.. _rust-version-3.2:

What's New in 3.2
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v3.2 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- :red:`Important:` The next minor release will drop support for MongoDB
  Server version 4.0 and raise the minimum supported version to 4.2. We
  recommend making changes to your application to accommodate breaking changes.
  See the :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes/>` section in the Server manual to
  learn more about upgrading.

- Increases the Minimum Supported Rust Version to 1.71.1. To learn more
  about driver compatibility, see the :ref:`rust-compatibility` guide.

- Marks the in-use encryption feature as stable with the same backwards
  compatibility guarantees as the driver. The feature flag is named
  ``in-use-encryption``. This is a policy change and the API is not
  changed from the previous release.

- Allows SRV hostnames with fewer than three parts.

- Allows you to supply a sort option when performing update operations.

- Adds OIDC authentication support for Kubernetes environments.
  
  To use OIDC to authenticate from a Kubernetes environment, set the
  ``authMechanismProperties`` connection option to ``ENVIRONMENT:k8s``
  in your connection string. You can use this feature when connecting to
  an environment running in Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service, Google
  Kubernetes Engine, or Azure Kubernetes Service.

To learn more about this release, see the `v3.2 Release Notes
<{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v3.2.0>`__ on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-3.1:

What's New in 3.1
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v3.1 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds support for more than one Key Management Service (KMS) provider of the same type.
  To learn more about KMS providers, see
  :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>` in the {+server+}
  manual.
- Adds support for v2 of the Queryable Encryption range protocol. Range indexes for
  Queryable Encryption are now GA.
- Adds the ``type`` field to the ``SearchIndexModel`` type to allow
  programmatic creation of Atlas Search and Vector Search indexes. To learn
  more, see the :ref:`rust-atlas-search-indexes` guide.
- Implements the Happy Eyeballs algorithm for managing
  TCP connections. To learn more about this algorithm, see the Rust documentation
  for the `happy_eyeballs <https://docs.rs/happy_eyeballs/0.2.0/happy_eyeballs/>`__ crate.
- The driver publishes a ``TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent`` event when a topology
  closes.

To learn more about this release, see the `v3.1 Release Notes <{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v3.1.0>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-3.0.1:

What's New in 3.0.1
---------------------

The {+driver-short+} v3.0.1 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Fixes an issue in which aggregations wouldn't compile when run within explicit
  sessions and also implemented custom types.

- Fixes an issue in which the ``Collection::watch()`` method didn't use the type
  parameter of the ``Collection`` instance it was run on.

To learn more about this release, see the `v3.0.1 Release Notes <{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v3.0.1>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-3.0:

What's New in 3.0
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v3.0 release includes the following features, improvements, and fixes:

- Implements a fluent API, which introduces the following syntax changes for passing options and
  starting sessions:

  - To set asynchronous method options, chain option builder methods directly to the method call
    instead of passing an options struct parameter.
  
  - To set synchronous method options, chain option builder methods to the method call, then
    call the ``run()`` method.
  
  - If you must construct a separate options struct, chain the ``with_options()``
    method to the method call and pass your options struct as a parameter.

  - To start a session, chain the ``session()`` method to the method call instead of using a separate
    method that has a ``_with_session`` suffix.

- Adds support for bulk write operations. To learn more about these operations, see the 
  :ref:`rust-bulk-guide` guide.

- Introduces the ``EventHandler`` type to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for event monitoring. 
  For examples that use the ``EventHandler`` type, see the :ref:`rust-monitoring` guides.

- Removes support for the ``async-std`` asynchronous runtime. To learn more about this change, see
  the :ref:`rust-runtimes-configure-async` section of the Asynchronous and Synchronous APIs guide.

- Requires the use of a ``compat`` feature if a {+driver-short+} application is compiled with
  the ``no-default-features`` command line flag. The ``rustls`` and ``dns-resolution`` features
  are now optional.

- Removes support for the ``bson-*`` driver features. You can select these features by including
  ``bson`` as a direct dependency in your application.

- Removes support for read and write concern constants. Instead, use helper methods to set ``ReadConcern`` and
  ``WriteConcern`` values.

- Adds ``Send + Sync`` constraints to the ``Collection<T>`` type.

- Removes the ``ClientOptions::compressor`` field if no compressor features are enabled.

- Changes the type of ``ReadPreferenceOptions`` fields. These fields now have a ``Option<ReadPreferenceOptions>`` type.

- Removes the ``CollectionOptions::human_readable_serialization`` option. Instead, use the ``bson::HumanReadable``
  wrapper type to serialize user data into human-readable form.

- Adds support for value conversion through the ``Into`` trait for all option struct builders.

- Renames the ``comment_bson`` field to ``comment`` for ``AggregateOptions``, ``FindOptions``, and ``FindOneOptions``
  structs. 

To learn more about this release, see the `v3.0 Migration Guide
<{+driver-source+}/blob/main/migration-3.0.md>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-2.8:

What's New in 2.8
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.8 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds MongoDB Atlas Search index management methods. To learn more about
  these methods, see the :ref:`rust-atlas-search-indexes` guide.

- Improves network connectivity and operation reliability by implementing the
  following behaviors:

  - Performs retries on a greater range of error types that the driver
    encounters.

  - Avoids retries for ``mongos`` instances experiencing
    network connectivity issues.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v2.8.0 Release Highlights
<{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v2.8.0>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-2.7:

What's New in 2.7
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.7 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds the ``human_readable_serialization`` option to the
  ``CollectionOptions`` struct. This option instructs the
  driver to serialize values passed to CRUD methods as a human-readable
  format. The default value of this option is ``false``.

  .. warning::

     If you set the value of ``human_readable_serialization`` to
     ``true``, your insert operations might run more slowly.

- Adds the ``run_cursor_command()`` method to run a database command and
  retrieve the response as a ``Cursor`` type. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`rust-run-command` guide.

- Adds SDAM event logging when you use the ``tracing-unstable`` feature
  flag.

- Adds the following configurations for ``Client`` and connection management:

  - ``max_connecting``: an option that you can set in a ``ClientOptions``
    struct to specify how many connections you can establish in
    parallel. To learn more about this option, see
    :ref:`rust-performance-pool` in the Performance Considerations
    guide.

  - ``Client::warm_connection_pool()``: a method that you can use to create
    new connections in the connection pool to provide more
    predictable performance. When you use this method, the driver
    attempts to create connections up to the number specified in the
    ``min_pool_size`` setting.

  - ``Client::shutdown()``: a method that you can use to stop background
    tasks and wait for handlers to drop. This method can be helpful if
    you use event handlers to reference external resources, as these
    handlers might be used in tasks even after the ``Client`` is
    closed.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v2.7.0 Release Highlights
<{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v2.7.0>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-2.6:

What's New in 2.6
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.6 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Supports AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) roles for service accounts, such as Elastic Kubernetes
  Service (EKS) accounts.

- Supports GCP-attached service accounts when using the Cloud Key
  Management System (KMS).

- Supports fetching on-demand CSFLE credentials from the Azure KMS.

- Implements the ``FromStr`` trait for the ``Namespace`` struct.
  This change allows you to parse a string that includes a database and
  collection name, such as ``"testdb.testcollection"`` into a
  ``Namespace`` instance.

- Includes the ``server_id`` in a ``ConnectionInfo`` struct as an
  ``i64`` type.

- Removes most type constraints on values referenced by a ``Cursor``.

- Updates the ``libmongocrypt`` version in the driver dependencies in
  order to use the Queryable Encryption feature with equality queries.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v2.6.0 Release Highlights
<{+driver-source+}/releases/tag/v2.6.0>`__
