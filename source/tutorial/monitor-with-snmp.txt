.. note:: Enterprise Feature

   SNMP is only available in `MongoDB Enterprise
   <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`_.

.. |mongod-program| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod`

Overview
--------

MongoDB Enterprise can provide database metrics via SNMP, in
support of centralized data collection and aggregation. This procedure
explains the setup and configuration of a |mongod-program| instance
as an SNMP subagent, as well as initializing and testing of SNMP
support with MongoDB Enterprise.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/tutorial/troubleshoot-snmp` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/monitor-with-snmp-on-windows` for
   complete instructions on using MongoDB with SNMP on Windows
   systems.

Considerations
--------------

- SNMP support is only available in :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
  Other MongoDB tools such as :binary:`~bin.mongos` do not support SNMP.
- :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not support the use of SNMP traps.

Configuration Files
-------------------

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/monitor-with-snmp.rst

Optional: Run MongoDB as SNMP Master
------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-snmp-run-mongodb-as-snmp-master.rst

.. code-block:: sh

   cp mongod.conf.master /etc/snmp/mongod.conf

.. note::

   To bind your master to a non-localhost IP address, add that IP
   address to the ``agentaddress`` field in the
   ``/etc/snmp/mongod.conf`` file, and update the appropriate network
   security ACLs to permit a valid address range. An address
   range of 10.0.0.0/8 with a security name of "mynetwork" has been
   provided in the master configuration file as an example.

Then, start |mongod-program| with the
:option:`snmp-master <mongod --snmp-master>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --snmp-master
