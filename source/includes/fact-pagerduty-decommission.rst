   PagerDuty `decommissioned <https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/rest-api-v1/v1-rest-api-decommissioning-faq/>`__ 
   their v1 |api| key in October 2018. If you have a v1 key, you can continue 
   to use that key with |mms|. All new PagerDuty keys use their v2 |api|,
   but |mms| does not support their v2 key. If you don't have their v1 
   key, use Webhook instead of PagerDuty.
