   |service| supports :doc:`creating <create-new-cluster>` ``M10+`` paid
   tier clusters with the following MongoDB versions:

   - MongoDB 3.2 
   - MongoDB 3.4
   - MongoDB 3.6 

   ``M0`` Free Tier and ``M2/M5`` shared tier clusters only support

   As new maintenance releases become available, |service|
   automatically upgrades to these releases via a rolling process to
   maintain cluster availability.
