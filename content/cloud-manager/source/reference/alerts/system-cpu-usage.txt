``System CPU`` alerts indicate that the CPU usage of the MongoDB
process has reached a specified threshold. This threshold is specified
when the alert is created.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:ref:`System: CPU (Steal) % <system-disk-alerts>`
  Occurs when the percentage of time the CPU is in a state of
  "involuntary wait" exceeds the specified threshold. CPU
  steal percentage is the percentage by which the CPU usage exceeds
  the guaranteed baseline CPU credit accumulation rate.

  .. note::

     This alert typically triggers when all credits have been
     consumed on an `AWS burstable performance instance
     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.

:ref:`System: CPU (User) % <system-disk-alerts>`
  Occurs when the CPU usage of the MongoDB process, as normalized by
  the number of CPUs, exceeds the specified threshold.

Common Triggers
---------------

:manual:`Unoptimized queries </core/query-optimization/>` might lead to 
``System CPU`` alerts.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider adding one or more :manual:`indexes </indexes/>` to improve 
query performance. For details on calculating suggested indexes, see
:doc:`Calculate Suggested Indexes </tutorial/suggest-indexes/>`.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Consider scaling your cluster with additional servers to reduce the CPU
usage percentage utilized by the current workload. For example, you
could :doc:`convert a replica set to a sharded cluster
</tutorial/convert-replica-set-to-sharded-cluster>`. To learn more about
sharded clusters, see :manual:`Sharding </sharding/>`. 

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

View the :guilabel:`Normalized System CPU` chart to monitor CPU 
usage of all processes on the node, scaled to a range of 0-100% by 
dividing by the number of CPU cores.

Monitor CPU usage to determine whether data is retrieved from disk 
instead of memory.

To learn more, see :ref:`View Cluster Metrics 
<monitor-cluster-metrics>`.
