You can use the ``returnScope`` option to set the context of the query
and return arrays of objects as individual documents.  

Requirements 
------------

To retrieve nested objects as individual documents using ``returnScope``,
you must: 

- Index the arrays of objects as the :ref:`embeddedDocuments
  <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` type.  
- Define :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` for the
  nested fields that you want to retrieve. |fts| only returns fields
  defined in the ``storedSource``. 
- Set the :ref:`returnStoredSource <fts-return-stored-source-option>`
  option to ``true`` in the query.

Syntax 
------

``returnScope`` has the following syntax in your queries:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: $search Syntax
      :tabid: search

      .. code-block:: json
         :emphasize-lines: 6 - 8

         {
           $search: {  
            "<operator>": { 
               <operator-specification>,
            },
            "returnScope": {
               "path": "<embedded-documents-field-to-retrieve>"
            },
            "returnStoredSource": true
           }
         }

   .. tab:: $searchMeta Syntax
      :tabid: search-meta

      .. code-block:: json
         :emphasize-lines: 3 - 5

         {
           $searchMeta: {  
            "returnScope": {
               "path": "<embedded-documents-field-to-retrieve>"
            },
            "returnStoredSource": true
           },
           "facet": {
             "<operator>": { 
               <operator-specification>,
            },
             "facets": {
               <facet-definition>
             }
           }
         }

To learn more about query syntax, see :pipeline:`$search`.

Behavior
--------

The ``returnScope`` option sets the retrieval context for the query. If
you specify ``returnScope`` in your query, |fts| scores, sorts, and
counts each embedded document as if it were an individual document. 

Considerations
--------------

When you use the ``returnScope`` option, |fts| only returns the fields
that you configured as ``storedSource`` within the ``embeddedDocument``.
Fields outside of the ``embeddedDocument`` path (such as fields at the
root level) and fields that are not configured as ``storedSource`` are
not returned.

In your operator specification, you must specify the full path to the
field that you want to query. When you use the ``returnScope`` option, you
must make sure all operator specifications paths are nested under the 
``returnScope.path``. To query on a field outside the ``returnScope.path``,
you must use either the ``hasAncestor`` or ``hasRoot`` operator.
To learn more, see:

- :ref:`<has-ancestor-ref>`
- :ref:`<has-root-ref>`

Examples 
--------

The following examples demonstrate how to use the ``returnScope`` option
in queries. The examples use the ``sample_training.companies`` sample
dataset. If you load the data on your cluster and create the sample index
on the fields in the collection, you can try the following queries 
against the sample data.

The following sections demonstrate sample queries that use the
``returnScope`` option to retrieve fields in ``embeddedDocuments``
type fields that were stored on ``mongot``.
