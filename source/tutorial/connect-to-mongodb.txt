==================
Connect to MongoDB
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| provides connection information for each managed MongoDB deployment. To
connect to a deployment, retrieve the hostname and port information from
the |mms| console and then use a MongoDB client, such as the
:program:`mongo` shell or a :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>`, to
connect to MongoDB. You can connect to a :term:`sharded cluster`, a
:term:`replica set`, or an individual MongoDB instance.

Considerations
--------------

Firewall rules and user authentication affect your access to a MongoDB
deployment.

Your access to the MongoDB deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) depends
in part on the :ref:`security group <security-group>` used on the
deployment's AWS server.

Retrieve a Command to Connect to the Deployment from its own Server

The |mms| console provides a :program:`mongo` command that lets you connect to the
deployment directly from the deployment's own server.
