Most UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux and OS X, provide
ways to limit and control the usage of system resources such as
threads, files, and network connections on a per-process and per-user
basis. These limits prevent single users from using too many system
resources. Sometimes, these limits have low default values that can
cause a number of issues in the course of normal MongoDB operation.

.. _system-resource-utilization:

Resource Utilization
--------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` each use threads and file
descriptors to track connections and manage internal operations. This
section outlines the general resource utilization patterns for MongoDB.
Use these figures in combination with the actual information about your
deployment and its use to determine ideal ``ulimit`` settings.

Generally, all :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, like
other processes:

- track each incoming connection with a file descriptor *and* a
  thread.

- track each internal thread or *pthread* as a system process.

``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~

- 1 file descriptor for each data file in use by the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

- 1 file descriptor for each journal file used by the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance when :setting:`journal` is ``true``.

- In replica sets, each :binary:`~bin.mongod` maintains a connection to
  all other members of the set.

:binary:`~bin.mongod` uses background threads for a number of internal
processes, including :ref:`TTL collections <ttl-collections>`,
replication, and replica set health checks, which may require a small
number of additional resources.

.. _mongos-connection-use information:

``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the threads and file descriptors for client
connections, :binary:`~bin.mongos` must maintain connects to all config
servers and all shards, which includes all members of all replica
sets.

For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, consider the following behaviors:

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances maintain a connection pool to each shard
  so that the :binary:`~bin.mongos` can reuse connections and quickly
  fulfill requests without needing to create new connections.

- You can limit the number of incoming connections using
  the :setting:`maxConns` run-time option:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     :option:`--maxConns <mongos --maxConns>`

  By restricting the number of incoming connections you can prevent a
  cascade effect where the :binary:`~bin.mongos` creates too many
  connections on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

Review and Set Resource Limits
------------------------------

``ulimit``
~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``ulimit`` command at the system prompt to check
system limits, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ulimit -a
   -t: cpu time (seconds)         unlimited
   -f: file size (blocks)         unlimited
   -d: data seg size (kbytes)     unlimited
   -s: stack size (kbytes)        8192
   -c: core file size (blocks)    0
   -m: resident set size (kbytes) unlimited
   -u: processes                  192276
   -n: file descriptors           21000
   -l: locked-in-memory size (kb) 40000
   -v: address space (kb)         unlimited
   -x: file locks                 unlimited
   -i: pending signals            192276
   -q: bytes in POSIX msg queues  819200
   -e: max nice                   30
   -r: max rt priority            65
   -N 15:                         unlimited

``ulimit`` refers to the per-*user* limitations for various
resources. Therefore, if your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance executes as a
user that is also running multiple processes, or multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes, you might see contention for these
resources. Also, be aware that the ``processes`` value (i.e. ``-u``)
refers to the combined number of distinct processes and sub-process
threads.

You can change ``ulimit`` settings by issuing a command in the
following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   ulimit -n <value>

For many distributions of Linux you can change values by substituting
the ``-n`` option for any possible value in the output of ``ulimit
-a``. On OS X, use the ``launchctl limit`` command.  See your
operating system documentation for the precise procedure for changing
system limits on running systems.

.. note::

   After changing the ``ulimit`` settings, you *must* restart the
   process to take advantage of the modified settings. You can use the
   ``/proc`` file system to see the current limitations on a running
   process.

   Depending on your system's configuration, and default settings, any
   change to system limits made using ``ulimit`` may revert following
   system a system restart. Check your distribution and operating
   system documentation for more information.

``/proc`` File System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This section applies only to Linux operating systems.

The ``/proc`` file-system stores the per-process limits in the
file system object located at ``/proc/<pid>/limits``, where ``<pid>``
is the process's :term:`PID` or process identifier. You can use the
following ``bash`` function to return the content of the ``limits``
object for a process or processes with a given name:

.. code-block:: sh

   return-limits(){

        for process in $@; do
             process_pids=`ps -C $process -o pid --no-headers | cut -d " " -f 2`

             if [ -z $@ ]; then
                echo "[no $process running]"
             else
                for pid in $process_pids; do
                      echo "[$process #$pid -- limits]"
                      cat /proc/$pid/limits
                done
             fi

        done

   }

You can copy and paste this function into a current shell session or
load it as part of a script. Call the function with one the following
invocations:

.. code-block:: sh

   return-limits mongod
   return-limits mongos
   return-limits mongod mongos

The output of the first command may resemble the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   [mongod #6809 -- limits]
   Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
   Max cpu time              unlimited            unlimited            seconds
   Max file size             unlimited            unlimited            bytes
   Max data size             unlimited            unlimited            bytes
   Max stack size            8720000              unlimited            bytes
   Max core file size        0                    unlimited            bytes

   Max file locks            unlimited            unlimited            locks
   Max pending signals       192276               192276               signals
   Max msgqueue size         819200               819200               bytes

   Max realtime timeout      unlimited            unlimited            us

Recommended Settings
--------------------

Every deployment may have unique requirements and settings; however,
the following thresholds and settings are particularly important for
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` deployments:

- ``-f`` (file size): ``unlimited``
- ``-t`` (cpu time): ``unlimited``
- ``-v`` (virtual memory): ``unlimited``
- ``-n`` (open files): ``64000``
- ``-m`` (memory size): ``unlimited`` [#resident-memory-size]_
- ``-u`` (processes/threads): ``32000``

Always remember to restart your :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances after changing the ``ulimit`` settings to
make sure that the settings change takes effect.

.. [#resident-memory-size] If you limit the resident memory size on a
   system running MongoDB the operating system will refuse to honor
   additional allocation requests.
