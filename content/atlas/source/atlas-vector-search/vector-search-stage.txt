   An {+avs+} query takes the form of an :manual:`aggregation pipeline
   </aggregation>` that uses :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` as the first
   stage. This guide explains the syntax, options, and behavior of the
   :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. 

   .. pipeline:: $vectorSearch

      The ``$vectorSearch`` stage performs a semantic search for a query
      vector on the specified field or fields. The field or fields must
      be indexed as the {+avs+} :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type
      inside a :ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index.

   .. note:: 

      .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-requirements-cluster-version-ann-enn.rst

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-clients:

   Supported Clients
   -----------------

   You can run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries by using the 
   {+atlas-ui+}, {+mongosh+}, and any :driver:`MongoDB driver </>`.

   You can also use {+avs+} with local |service| deployments that you
   create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see :atlascli:`Create a
   Local Atlas Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

   :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` is supported only on |service| {+clusters+}
   running the following MongoDB versions: 

   - v6.0.11
   - v7.0.2 and later (including :abbr:`RCs (Release Candidates)`). 

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-syntax:

   Syntax 
   ------

   The field that you want to search must be indexed as {+avs+}
   :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type inside a :ref:`vectorSearch 
   <avs-types-vector-search>` index type. 

   A ``$vectorSearch`` pipeline has the following prototype form: 

   .. code-block:: json 

      {
        "$vectorSearch": {
          "exact": true | false,
          "filter": {<filter-specification>},
          "index": "<index-name>",
          "limit": <number-of-results>,
          "numCandidates": <number-of-candidates>,
          "path": "<field-to-search>",
          "queryVector": [<array-of-numbers>],
          "explainOptions": {
            "traceDocumentIds": [<array-of-documentIDs>]
          },
	  "searchNodePreference": {
	    "key": <preference-string>
	  }
        }
      }

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-options:

   Fields 
   ------

   The ``$vectorSearch`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

   .. list-table:: 
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 15 15 50

      * - Field 
        - Type 
        - Necessity 
        - Description

      * - ``exact``
        - boolean
        - Optional 
        - This is required if ``numCandidates`` is omitted. 

          Flag that specifies whether to run |enn| or |ann| search. Value
          can be one of the following: 
    
          - ``false`` - to run |ann| search 
          - ``true`` - to run |enn| search

          If omitted, defaults to ``false``. 

          .. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-requirements-cluster-version-ann-enn.rst
          
          To learn more about these search types, see
          :ref:`vectorSearch-agg-pipeline`.

      * - ``filter``
        - document
        - Optional
        - :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` expression that
          compares an indexed field to use as a pre-filter. 
          You can filter on {+avs-filter-types+}.

          To learn which MQL operators {+avs+} supports
          in your filter, see :ref:`vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter`.

      * - ``index`` 
        - string 
        - Required 
        - Name of the {+avs+} index to use.
          
          {+avs+} doesn't return results if you misspell the index name or 
          if the specified index doesn't already exist on the {+cluster+}.

      * - ``limit`` 
        - number 
        - Required 
        - Number (of type ``int`` only) of documents to return in the
          results. This value can't exceed the value of ``numCandidates`` if
          you specify ``numCandidates``.

      * - ``numCandidates``
        - number 
        - Conditional 
        - This field is required if ``exact`` is ``false`` or omitted.
          
          Number of nearest neighbors to use during the search. Value must 
          be less than or equal to (``<=``) ``10000``. You can't specify a
          number less than the number of documents to return (``limit``).
          
          We recommend that you specify a number at least 20 times higher than the 
          number of documents to return (``limit``) to increase accuracy.
          
          This overrequest pattern is the recommended way to 
          trade off latency and :term:`recall` in your |ann| searches, 
          and we recommend tuning this parameter based on your specific dataset 
          size and query requirements.

          To learn more about other variables that might impact this parameter, see :ref:`avs-num-candidates`.

      * - ``path``
        - string 
        - Required 
        - Indexed :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type field to search.

      * - ``queryVector``
        - array of numbers 
        - Required 
        - Array of numbers of ``float32``, |bson|
          :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with subtype
          ``float32``, or |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` 
          vectors with subtype ``int1`` or ``int8`` type that represent the
          query vector. 

          To learn more about generating |bson| ``binData``
          vectors with subtype ``float32``, ``int8``, ``int1``,
          see :ref:`avs-bindata-vector-subtype`. 

          The array size must match the number of vector ``dimensions`` 
          specified in the :ref:`index definition <avs-types-vector-search>`  
          for the field. 

          You must embed your query with the same model that you used to
          embed the data.

          You can query your embeddings with full-fidelity vectors,
          as long as the vector subtype is the same. This is only possible with
          ``binData`` vectors with subtype ``float32``. If you use any other
          subtype (``int8`` or ``int1``), {+avs+} doesn't return any results or errors.

      * - ``explainOptions``
        - document
        - Optional 
        - Trace a list of vectors (identified by theirs ``_id``) in an
          :ref:`explain <avs-explain-ref>` ``executionStats`` query. You
          can't use this option without ``explain``. To learn more, see
          :ref:`avs-explain-ref`. 

      * - | ``explainOptions.``
          | ``traceDocumentIds``
        - array of document IDs

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline:

   Vector Search Types
   -------------------

   When you define a :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage, you can use the
   ``exact`` field to specify whether to run an |ann| or |enn| search. 

   .. _vectorSearch-ann:

   ANN Search
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   For Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search, {+avs+} finds vector
   embeddings in your data that are closest to the vector embedding in
   your query based on their proximity in multi-dimensional space and
   based on the number of neighbors that it considers. It uses the
   |hnsw| algorithm and finds the vector embeddings most similar to the
   vector embedding in your query without scanning every vector.
   Therefore, |ann| search is ideal for querying large datasets without
   significant filtering.

   .. note:: 

      .. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-avs-recall.rst

   .. _avs-num-candidates:

   ``numCandidates`` Selection
   ```````````````````````````

   You must specify the ``numCandidates`` field to run |ann| search.
   This field determines how many nearest neighbors {+avs+} considers
   during the search.

   We recommend that you specify a ``numCandidates`` number at least 20
   times higher than the number of documents to return (``limit``) to
   increase accuracy and reduce discrepancies between your |enn| and
   |ann| query results. For example, if you set ``limit`` to return
   ``5`` results, consider setting ``numCandidates`` to ``100`` as a
   starting point. To learn more, see :ref:`avs-improve-results`. 

   This overrequest pattern is the recommended way to trade off latency
   and :term:`recall` in your |ann| searches. However, we recommend
   tuning the ``numCandidates`` parameter based on your specific dataset
   size and query requirements. To ensure that you get accurate results,
   consider the following variables:

   - **Index Size**: Larger collections typically require higher
     ``numCandidates`` values to maintain recall. A collection with
     millions of vectors might need significantly more candidates than
     one with thousands of vectors.

   - **Limit Value**: Because ``numCandidates`` is highly correlated
     with the index size, low ``limit`` values require proportionally
     higher ``numCandidates`` values to maintain recall.

   - **Vector Quantization**: :ref:`Quantized vectors
     <avs-quantization>` reduce storage at the cost of accuracy. Using
     quantized vectors (``int8`` or ``int1`` subtypes) might require
     higher ``numCandidates`` values compared to full precision
     ``float32`` vectors to maintain similar recall.

   .. _vectorSearch-enn:

   ENN Search
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   For an Exact Nearest Neighbors (ENN) search, {+avs+} exhaustively
   searches all the indexed vector embeddings by calculating the
   distance between all the embeddings and finds the exact nearest
   neighbor for the vector embedding in your query. This is
   computationally intensive and might negatively impact query latency.
   Therefore, we recommend |enn| searches for the following use-cases:

   - You want to determine the :term:`recall` and accuracy of your |ann| query
     using the ideal, exact results for the |enn| query.
   - You want to query less than 10000 documents without having to tune the 
     number of nearest neighbors to consider.
   - Your want to include selective pre-filters in your query against
     collections where less than 5% of your data meets the given pre-filter.

   If you enable automatic quantization, {+avs+} uses only the full-fidelity
   vectors for |enn| queries.

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-behavior:

   Behavior 
   --------

   - :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` must be the first stage of any pipeline where it
     appears. 

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-limitations:

   Limitations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` can't be used in 
   :manual:`view definition </core/views/>` and the following pipeline
   stages:  

   - :pipeline:`$lookup` sub-pipeline [*]_
   - :pipeline:`$facet` pipeline stage

   .. [*] You can pass the results of :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
          to this stage.

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-index:

   {+avs+} Indexing
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You must index the fields to search using the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
   stage inside a :ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index
   definition. You can index the following types of fields in a {+avs+}
   :ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index definition: 

   - Fields that contain vector embeddings as :ref:`vector
     <avs-types-vector-search>` type.  
   - Additional fields as the :ref:`filter <avs-types-vector-search>` 
     type to enable vector search on pre-filtered data.

   To learn more about these {+avs+} field types, see
   :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`. 

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score:

   {+avs+} Scoring
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   {+avs+} assigns a score, in a fixed range from ``0`` to ``1`` 
   (where ``0`` indicates low similarity and ``1`` indicates high
   similarity), to every document that it returns. 

   The score is calculated according to the ``similarity`` function that
   you specify in the {+avs+} :ref:`index definition
   <avs-types-vector-search-options>`. To learn more about the
   ``similarity`` options you can choose from, see
   :ref:`avs-similarity-functions`.

   Each returned document includes the score as metadata. To return each
   document's score along with the result set, use a
   :pipeline:`$project` stage in your aggregation pipeline and configure
   the ``score`` as a field to project. In the ``score`` field, specify a
   :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression
   with the value ``vectorSearchScore``. The syntax is as follows: 

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 11

      db.<collection>.aggregate([
        {
          "$vectorSearch": {
            <query-syntax>
          }
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "<field-to-include>": 1,
            "<field-to-exclude>": 0,
            "score": { "$meta": "vectorSearchScore" }
          }
        }
      ]) 

   .. note:: 

      You can use ``vectorSearchScore`` as a ``score`` :manual:`$meta
      </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression only after the
      :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` pipeline stage. If you use
      ``vectorSearchScore`` after any other query, MongoDB logs a warning
      starting in MongoDB v8.2.

   .. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-avs-pre-filtering-score-impact.rst

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter:

   {+avs+} Pre-Filtering
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option matches |bson|
   {+avs-filter-types+}.

   You **must** index the fields that you want to filter your data by as the 
   :ref:`filter <avs-types-vector-search>` type in a :ref:`vectorSearch
   <avs-types-vector-search>` type index definition. Filtering your data is 
   useful to narrow the scope of your semantic search and ensure that not
   all vectors are considered for comparison. 

   {+avs+} supports the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option for
   the following {+mql+} :manual:`operators
   </reference/operator/query/>`:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Type
        - {+mql+} operator

      * - Equality
        - :query:`$eq`, :query:`$ne`

      * - Range
        - :query:`$gt`, :query:`$lt`, :query:`$gte`, :query:`$lte`

      * - In set
        - :query:`$in`, :query:`$nin`

      * - Existence
        - :query:`$exists`

      * - Logical
        - :query:`$not`, :query:`$nor`, :expression:`$and`, :expression:`$or`

   .. note:: 

      The :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` ``filter`` option doesn't support
      other :manual:`query operators </reference/operator/query/>`,
      :manual:`aggregation pipeline operators
      </reference/operator/aggregation/>`, or :ref:`{+fts+} operators
      <operators-ref>`.

   Filtering Considerations
   ````````````````````````

   - {+avs+} supports the short form of :query:`$eq`. In the short
     form, you don't need to specify ``$eq`` in the query. 
     
     For example, consider the following filter with ``$eq``: 

     .. code-block:: json
        :copyable: false 

        "filter": { "_id": { "$eq": ObjectId("5a9427648b0beebeb69537a5") }

     This is equivalent to the following filter, which uses the short
     form of ``$eq``:

     .. code-block:: json
        :copyable: false 

        "filter": { "_id": ObjectId("5a9427648b0beebeb69537a5") }

   - You can use the :expression:`$and` {+mql+} operator to specify an
     array of filters in a single query.

     For example, consider the following pre-filter for documents with a
     ``genres`` field equal to ``Action`` and a ``year`` field with the
     value ``1999``, ``2000``, or ``2001``:

     .. code-block:: json
        :copyable: false 

        "filter": {
          "$and": [
            { "genres": "Action" },
            { "year": { "$in": [ 1999, 2000, 2001 ] } }
          ]
        }

   - For advanced filtering capabilities such as fuzzy search, phrase
     matching, location filtering, and other analyzed text, use the
     :ref:`vectorSearch <fts-vectorSearch-ref>` operator in a
     :pipeline:`$search` stage.

   .. _vectorSearch-concurrent-queries:

   Parallel Query Execution Across Segments 
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   We recommend dedicated :ref:`Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>`
   to isolate vector search query processing. You might see improved query 
   performance on the dedicated Search Nodes. Note that the high-CPU systems
   might provide more performance improvement. When {+avs+} runs on search
   nodes, {+avs+} parallelizes query execution across segments of data. 

   Parallelization of query processing improves the response time in many
   cases, such as queries on large datasets. Using intra-query parallelism
   during {+avs+} query processing utilizes more resources, but improves
   latency for each individual query. 

   .. note:: 

      {+avs+} doesn't guarantee that each query will run concurrently. For
      example, when too many concurrent queries are queued, {+avs+} might
      fall back to single-threaded execution.

      You might see inconsistent results for the same successive queries.
      To mitigate this, increase the value of ``numCandidates`` in your
      :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries.

   .. _vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-egs:

   Examples 
   --------

   The following queries search the sample
   :ref:`sample_mflix.embedded_movies <mflix-embedded_movies>`
   collection using the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. The queries
   search the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field, which contains
   embeddings created using the ``voyage-3-large`` embedding model from
   |voyage|.

   Prerequisites
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Before you run these examples, perform the following actions:

   - Add the :ref:`sample collection <mflix-embedded_movies>` to your |service|
     {+cluster+}.

   - Create {+avs+} indexes for the collection. For instructions, see
     the :ref:`avs-create-index` procedure and copy the configurations
     for the basic or filter examples in your desired language.
     
   .. note:: 

      If you use {+mongosh+}, pasting the ``queryVector`` from the sample code 
      into your terminal might take a while depending on your machine.
