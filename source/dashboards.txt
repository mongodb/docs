Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display.

.. _dashboards-tab:

Dashboards Tab
--------------

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab shows all dashboards you have access to
view. For more information on dashboard permissions in |charts|, see
the :ref:`Dashboard Permissions <dashboard-permissions>` page.

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

Refresh Dashboard Data
----------------------

You can refresh dashboard data to update all charts on the dashboard
with the most current data from their respective data sources. When
|charts| loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently query
the data source for each chart. Instead, |charts| queries the data
source when the dashboard first loads, and that data
is stored in the browser cache and used to render the charts.

|charts| provides options to both manually refresh dashboard data and
configure the dashboard to automatically refresh at a specified time
interval.  These options allow you to control how current the data
displayed on your dashboard is. By default, when you first create a
dashboard, it is configured to refresh its data every hour. The
:guilabel:`Auto` text next to the :icon:`refresh` icon signifies that
auto refresh is enabled.

Manually Refresh Dashboard Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manually refresh dashboard data, first select a dashboard from the
:guilabel:`Dashboards` tab, then click the :icon:`refresh` button at the
top-right of the dashboard.

.. _configure-auto-refresh:

Configure Auto Refresh Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure auto refresh settings to change the interval at which
the dashboard data is refreshed. The dashboard shows the time its data
was last updated and when the next update will occur at the top-right
of the view.

To configure auto refresh settings for a dashboard:

1. From the dashboard view, click the arrow next to the :icon:`refresh`
   button and click :guilabel:`Auto Refresh Settings`.

#. Select the desired refresh interval.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. note::

   Auto refresh settings are stored in the local browser state.
   Settings dictating whether auto refresh is enabled and its
   configured interval are not persisted with the dashboard or
   shared with other users.

Disable and Enable Auto Refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable auto refresh, click the arrow next to the :icon:`refresh`
button and click :guilabel:`Disable Auto Refresh`.

To enable auto refresh, click the arrow next to the :icon:`refresh`
button and click :guilabel:`Enable Auto Refresh`.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen View
---------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and exapands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To open a dashboard in fullscreen view, first select a dashboard from
the :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab, then click the expanding arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard:

.. figure:: /images/charts/full-screen-view.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Fullscreen Arrows

.. note::

   You can still :ref:`remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
   <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
   <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`access editing
   <dashboard-edit-chart>` for charts in fullscreen view by hovering
   over the desired chart.

   Additionally, in fullscreen view you can still configure
   auto-refresh settings and manually refresh chart data using the
   refresh button.

To exit fullscreen view, either click the contracting arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard or press the escape key.
