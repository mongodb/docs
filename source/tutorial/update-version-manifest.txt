You can use Automation to install and upgrade MongoDB instances in your
deployment. You need to give |onprem| a list of which versions can be
installed. The complete list of all possible MongoDB versions is called
the :term:`version manifest`.

The :term:`version manifest` can be updated in three ways:

- If your |onprem| installation is connected to the internet, the 
  :term:`version manifest` is updated automatically from MongoDB, Inc. 

- If you can connect to the internet and your |onprem| installation
  at the same time, you can update the :term:`version manifest` 
  through the |application| via your web browser.

- If you can connect only to the internet or your |onprem| 
  installation at the same time, you can download the 
  :term:`version manifest` from the internet then install it into your 
  |application|.
