Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about **Codecs** and the supporting classes that
handle the encoding and decoding of Java objects to and from BSON data
in the MongoDB Java driver. The ``Codec`` abstraction allows you to map any Java type to
a corresponding BSON type. You can use this to map your domain objects
directly to and from BSON instead of using an intermediate map-based object such
as ``Document`` or ``BsonDocument``.

You can learn how to specify custom encoding and decoding logic using
the ``Codec`` abstraction and view example implementations in the following
sections:

- :ref:`Codec <codecs-codec>`
- :ref:`CodecRegistry <codecs-codecregistry>`
- :ref:`CodecProvider <codecs-codecprovider>`
- :ref:`Custom Codec Example <codecs-custom-example>`

If you are customizing encoding and decoding logic for plain old Java objects
(POJOs), read our guide on :doc:`POJO Customization </fundamentals/data-formats/pojo-customization>`.

.. _codecs-codec:

Codec
-----

The ``Codec`` interface contains abstract methods for serializing and
deserializing Java objects to BSON data. You can define your conversion logic
between BSON and your Java object in your implementation of this interface.

To implement the ``Codec`` interface, override the ``encode()``, ``decode()``,
and ``getEncoderClass()`` abstract methods.

The ``encode()`` method requires the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Parameter Type
     - Description

   * - ``writer``
     - An instance of a class that implements ``BsonWriter``, an interface type
       that exposes methods for writing a BSON document. For example, the
       ``BsonBinaryWriter`` implementation writes to a binary stream of data.
       Use this instance to write your BSON value using the appropriate
       write method.

   * - ``value``
     - The data that your implementation encodes. The type must match the type
       variable assigned to your implementation.

   * - ``encoderContext``
     -  Contains meta information about the Java object data that it encodes
        to BSON including whether to store the current value in a
        MongoDB collection.

This method uses the ``BsonWriter`` instance to send the encoded value to
MongoDB and does not return a value.

The ``decode()`` method returns your Java object instance populated with the
value from the BSON data. This method requires the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Parameter Type
     - Description

   * - ``bsonReader``
     - An instance of a class that implements ``BsonReader``, an interface type
       that exposes methods for reading a BSON document. For example, the
       ``BsonBinaryReader`` implementation reads from a binary stream of data.

   * - ``decoderContext``
     - Contains information about the BSON data that it decodes to a Java
       object.

The ``getEncoderClass()`` method returns a class instance of the Java class
since Java cannot infer the type due to type erasure.

.. _codecs-powerstatus-codec:

See the following code examples that show how you can implement a custom
``Codec``.

The ``PowerStatus`` enum contains the values "ON" and "OFF" to represent
the states of an electrical switch.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/PowerStatus.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

The ``PowerStatusCodec`` class implements ``Codec`` in order to convert
the Java ``enum`` values to corresponding BSON boolean values. The
``encode()`` method converts a ``PowerStatus`` to a BSON boolean and the
``decode()`` method performs the conversion in the opposite direction.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/PowerStatusCodec.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

You can add an instance of the ``PowerStatusCodec`` to your ``CodecRegistry``
which contains a mapping between your ``Codec`` and the Java object type to
which it applies. Continue to the :ref:`CodecRegistry <codecs-codecregistry>`
section of this page to see how you can include your ``Codec``.

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:

.. _codecs-codecregistry:

CodecRegistry
-------------

A ``CodecRegistry`` is an immutable collection of ``Codec`` instances that
encode and decode the Java classes they specify. You can use any of the
following ``CodecRegistries`` class static factory methods to construct a
``CodecRegistry`` from the ``Codec`` instances contained in the associated
types:

- ``fromCodecs()``
- ``fromProviders()``
- ``fromRegistries()``

The following code snippet shows how to construct a ``CodecRegistry`` using
the ``fromCodecs()`` method:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   CodecRegistry codecRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(new IntegerCodec(), new PowerStatusCodec());

In the preceding example, we assign the ``CodecRegistry`` the following ``Codec``
implementations:

- ``IntegerCodec``, a ``Codec`` that converts ``Integers`` and is part of the BSON package.
- :ref:`PowerStatusCodec <codecs-powerstatus-codec>`, our sample ``Codec``
  that converts certain Java strings to BSON booleans.

You can retrieve the ``Codec`` instances from the ``CodecRegistry`` instance
from the prior example using the following code:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Codec<PowerStatus> powerStatusCodec = codecRegistry.get(PowerStatus.class);
   Codec<Integer> integerCodec = codecRegistry.get(Integer.class);

If you attempt to retrieve a ``Codec`` instance for a class that is not
registered, the ``get()`` method throws a ``CodecConfigurationException``
exception.

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:

- `CodecRegistries <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/configuration/CodecRegistries.html>`__
- `IntegerCodec <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/IntegerCodec.html>`__

.. _codecs-codecprovider:

CodecProvider
-------------

A ``CodecProvider`` is an interface that contains abstract methods that create
``Codec`` instances and assign them to a ``CodecRegistry`` instance. Similar
to the ``CodecRegistry``, the BSON library uses the ``Codec`` instances
retrieved by the ``get()`` method to convert between Java and BSON data types.

However, in cases in which you add a class that contains fields that require
corresponding ``Codec`` objects, you need to ensure that you instantiate the
``Codec`` objects for the class fields before you instantiate the
``Codec`` for the class. You can use the ``CodecRegistry`` parameter in
the ``get()`` method to pass any of the ``Codec`` instances that the
``Codec`` relies on.

The following code example shows how you can implement ``CodecProvider`` to
pass the ``MonolightCodec`` any ``Codec`` instances it needs in a
``CodecRegistry`` instance such as the ``PowerStatusCodec`` from our prior
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MonolightCodecProvider.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To see a runnable example that demonstrates read and write operations using
these ``Codec`` classes, see the :ref:`Custom Codec Example <codecs-custom-example>`
section of this guide.

When working with POJOs, consider using the  ``PojoCodecProvider`` to
minimize duplicate code to convert commonly-used data types and customize
their behavior. See our
:doc:`POJO Customization guide </fundamentals/data-formats/pojo-customization>`
for more information.

.. _codecs-default-codec-registry:

Default Codec Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default codec registry is a set of ``CodecProvider`` classes that
specify conversion between commonly-used Java and MongoDB types. The
driver automatically uses the default codec registry unless you specify
a different one.

.. _codecs-override:

If you need to override the behavior of one or more ``Codec`` classes, but
keep the behavior from the default codec registry for the other classes,
you can specify all of the registries in order of precedence. For example,
suppose you wanted to override the default provider behavior of a ``Codec`` for
enum types with your custom ``MyEnumCodec``, you must add it to the registry
list prior to the default codec registry as shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   CodecRegistry newRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(
       CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(new MyEnumCodec()),
       MongoClientSettings.getDefaultCodecRegistry());

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see
the following API documentation sections:

- `CodecProvider <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/configuration/CodecProvider.html>`__
- `Default codec registry <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html#getDefaultCodecRegistry()>`__


BsonTypeClassMap
----------------

The ``BsonTypeClassMap`` class contains a recommended mapping between BSON
and Java types. You can use this class in your custom ``Codec`` or
``CodecProvider`` to help you manage which Java types to decode your BSON
types to container classes that implement ``Iterable`` or ``Map`` such as
the ``Document`` class.

You can add or modify the ``BsonTypeClassMap`` default mapping by passing a
``Map`` containing new or replacement entries.

The following code snippet shows how you can retrieve the Java class type
that corresponds to the BSON type in the default ``BsonTypeClassMap``
instance:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   BsonTypeClassMap bsonTypeClassMap = new BsonTypeClassMap();
   Class<?> clazz = bsonTypeClassMap.get(BsonType.ARRAY);
   System.out.println("Java type: " + clazz.getName());

This code outputs the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Java type: java.util.List

You can modify these mappings in your instance by specifying replacements in the
``BsonTypeClassMap`` constructor. The following code snippet shows how
you can replace the mapping for ``ARRAY`` in your ``BsonTypeClassMap``
instance with the ``Set`` class:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Map<BsonType, Class<?>> replacements = new HashMap<BsonType, Class<?>>();
   replacements.put(BsonType.ARRAY, Set.class);
   BsonTypeClassMap bsonTypeClassMap = new BsonTypeClassMap(replacements);

   Class<?> clazz = bsonTypeClassMap.get(BsonType.ARRAY);
   System.out.println("Java type: " + clazz.getName());

This code outputs the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Java type: java.util.Set

For a complete list of the default mappings, see the
`BsonTypeClassMap <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/BsonTypeClassMap.html>`__ API Documentation.

For an example of how the ``Document`` class uses ``BsonTypeClassMap``, see
the driver source code for the following classes:

- :github:`DocumentCodecProvider <mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/master/bson/src/main/org/bson/codecs/DocumentCodecProvider.java>`
- :github:`DocumentCodec <mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/master/bson/src/main/org/bson/codecs/DocumentCodec.java>`

.. _codecs-custom-example:

Custom Codec Example
--------------------

In this section, we show how you can implement ``Codec`` and ``CodecProvider``
to define the encoding and decoding logic for a custom Java class. We also show
how you can specify and use your custom implementations to perform insert
and retrieve operations.

The following code snippet shows our example custom class called ``Monolight``
and its fields that we want to store and retrieve from a MongoDB collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Monolight.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

This class contains the following fields, each of which we need to assign a
``Codec``:

- ``powerStatus`` describes whether the light is switched "on" or "off" for
  which we use the :ref:`PowerStatusCodec <codecs-powerstatus-codec>` that
  converts specific enum values to BSON booleans.
- ``colorTemperature`` describes the color of the light and contains an
  ``Integer`` value for which we use the ``IntegerCodec`` included in the
  BSON library.

The following code example shows how we can implement a ``Codec`` for the
``Monolight`` class. Note that the constructor expects an instance of
``CodecRegistry`` from which it retrieves the ``Codec`` instances it needs
to encode and decode its fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MonolightCodec.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To ensure we make the ``Codec`` instances for the fields available for
``Monolight``, we implement a custom ``CodecProvider`` shown in the following
code example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MonolightCodecProvider.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

After defining the conversion logic, we can perform the following:

- Store data from instances of ``Monolight`` into MongoDB
- Retrieve data from MongoDB into instances of ``Monolight``

The following example class contains code that assigns the
``MonolightCodecProvider`` to the ``MongoCollection`` instance by passing it
to the ``withCodecRegistry()`` method. The example class also inserts and
retrieves data using the ``Monolight`` class and associated codecs:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MonolightCodecExample.java
   :start-after: start class
   :end-before: end class
   :language: java
   :dedent:

If you run the preceding example, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [Monolight [powerStatus=ON, colorTemperature=5200]]
