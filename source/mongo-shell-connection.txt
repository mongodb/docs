The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog for a cluster provides the details to
connect to a cluster via the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell.

* For MongoDB 3.2 clusters, use the 3.2.6 or later version of the
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell with TLS/SSL support.

* For MongoDB 3.4 clusters, use the 3.4.0 or later version of the
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell with TLS/SSL support.

* For MongoDB 3.6 clusters, use the 3.6.0 or later version of the
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell with TLS/SSL support.


Prerequisites
-------------

TLS/SSL
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service| cluster.

   Clients must have support for the `SNI
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3>`_ TLS extension to connect
   to an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared starter cluster.
   The :abbr:`SNI (Server Name Indication)` TLS extension is
   supported by version 3.4 of the :manual:`mongo shell </mongo>` and
   up.
