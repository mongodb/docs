The :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>` operator performs a search 
for a word or phrase that contains a sequence of characters from an 
incomplete input string. The fields that you intend to query with the 
``autocomplete`` operator must be indexed with the :ref:`autocomplete
<bson-data-types-autocomplete>` data type in the collection's index
definition.
