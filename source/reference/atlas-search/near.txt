Description
-----------

The ``near`` operator supports querying and scoring 
numeric and date values. This operator can be used to 
perform a search over:

- Number fields of BSON ``int32``, ``int64``, and ``double`` data types. 
- Date fields of BSON ``date`` type in 
  :manual:`ISODate </reference/glossary/#term-isodate>` format.
- Geographic location fields defined using latitude and longitude 
  coordinates.

You can use the ``near`` operator to find results that are near a 
number or a date. The ``near`` operator scores the |fts| results by 
proximity to the number or date.

.. _near-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``near`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      $searchBeta: {
         "near": {
            "path": "<field-to-search>",
            "origin": <date-or-number>,
            "pivot": <pivot-distance>,
            "score": <score-options>
         }
      }
   }

.. _near-options:

Options 
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 60 10 
   
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Required?

   * - ``origin``
     - date, number, or geo
     - The number, date, or geographic :manual:`point </reference/geojson/#point>` 
       to search near. This is the origin from which the proximity of the results 
       is measured.

       - For number fields, the value must be of BSON ``int32``, ``int64``, 
         or ``double`` data types.
       - For date fields, the value must be an 
         :manual:`ISODate </reference/glossary/#term-isodate>` formatted 
         date.
       - For :ref:`geo <bson-data-types-geo>` fields. the value must be a 
         :manual:`GeoJSON point </reference/geojson/#point>`.

     - yes

   * - ``path``
     - string or array of strings
     - The indexed field or fields to search. See :ref:`Path
       Construction <ref-path>` for more information.
     - yes

   * - ``pivot``
     - number
     - The value to use to calculate scores of |fts| result documents. 
       Score is calculated using the following formula:

       .. code-block:: text
          :copyable: false

                        pivot
          score = ------------------
                   pivot + distance 

       where ``distance`` is the difference between ``origin`` and the 
       indexed field value.

       Results have a score equal to ``1/2`` (or ``0.5``) when their 
       indexed field value is ``pivot`` units away from ``origin``.  The 
       value of ``pivot`` must be greater than (i.e. ``>``) ``0``.
       
       If ``origin`` is a:

       - Number, ``pivot`` can be specified as an integer or floating 
         point number.
       - Date, ``pivot`` must be specified in milliseconds and can be 
         specified as a 32 or 64 bit integer. For example:

         - 1 minute is equal to ``60,000 ms`` 
         - 1 hour is equal to ``3,600,000 ms``
         - 1 day is equal to ``86,400,000 ms``
         - 1 month (or 30 days) is equal to ``2,592,000,000 ms``

       - GeoJSON point, ``pivot`` is measured in meters and must be specified 
         as an integer or floating point number. 

     - yes

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - A measure of the proximity of the |fts| results to ``origin``. The 
       ``score`` is scaled between ``0`` and ``1`` with ``1`` being an exact 
       match and ``0`` being a distant match. Score is equal to ``0.5`` when 
       the distance of the |fts| result from ``origin`` is equal to the 
       distance away from origin as calculated using ``pivot``.

       Score is calculated using the following formula:

       .. code-block:: text
          :copyable: false

                        pivot
          score = ------------------
                   pivot + distance 

       where ``distance`` is the difference between ``origin`` and the 
       indexed field value.
     
       You can modify the score of the matching search results using 
       the following options:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.

       For more information on using ``score`` in your query, see 
       :ref:`scoring-ref`.

     - no

Limitation
----------

You cannot use the ``near`` operator to query numeric or date values
stored in an array. |fts| cannot index numeric or date values if they
are part of an array.

.. _near-ref-egs:

Examples
--------

The :ref:`number <near-number-eg>` and :ref:`date <near-date-eg>` examples use 
the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. The :ref:`GeoJSON 
point <near-geo-point-eg>` example uses the ``listingsAndReviews`` collection 
in the ``sample_airbnb`` database. If you loaded the :ref:`sample dataset 
<available-sample-datasets>` on your cluster, you can create the static indexes 
using the index definitions in the examples below or the default index and run 
the queries on your cluster. The :ref:`fts-tutorial-ref` contains instructions 
for loading the :ref:`sample dataset <available-sample-datasets>`, creating an 
:ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`, and running |fts| queries.

.. _near-number-eg:

Number Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``near`` operator to query a number field. 

.. example::

   The following index definition named ``runtimes`` indexes the 
   ``runtime`` field values in the ``movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "mappings": {
            "dynamic": false,
            "fields": {
               "runtime": {
                  "type": "number"
               }
            }
         }
      }

   The following query searches for documents in the ``movies`` collection 
   with a ``runtime`` field value that is near 279. It includes a 
   :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit 
   the output to 7 results and a :manual:`$project 
   </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to:
   
   - Exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``runtime``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` is calculated using ``pivot``. 

   .. code-block:: json

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $searchBeta: {
               "index": "runtimes",
               "near": {
                  "path": "runtime",
                  "origin": 279,
                  "pivot": 2
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $limit: 7
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "runtime": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following results:

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false

      { "runtime" : 279, "title" : "The Kingdom", "score" : 1 }
      { "runtime" : 279, "title" : "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst", "score" : 1 }
      { "runtime" : 280, "title" : "Shoah", "score" : 0.6666666865348816 }
      { "runtime" : 281, "title" : "Les Misèrables", "score" : 0.5 }
      { "runtime" : 277, "title" : "Tokyo Trial", "score" : 0.5 }
      { "runtime" : 276, "title" : "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale", "score" : 0.4000000059604645 }
      { "runtime" : 283, "title" : "Scenes from a Marriage", "score" : 0.3333333432674408 }

   In the above |fts| results, the movies ``The Kingdom`` and ``The 
   Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst`` receive a score of ``1.0`` 
   because their ``runtime`` field value of ``279`` is an exact match. 
   The movies ``Les Misèrables`` and ``Tokyo Trial`` receive a score of 
   ``0.5`` because their ``runtime`` field value is ``2`` units away from 
   ``279``. 

.. _near-date-eg:

Date Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``near`` operator to query a date field. 

.. example::

   The following index definition named ``releaseddate`` indexes 
   the ``released`` field values in the ``movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "mappings": {
            "dynamic": false,
            "fields": {
               "released": {
                  "type": "date"
               }
            }
         }
      }

   The following query searches for movies released near September 13, 1915. 
   It includes a :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage 
   to limit the output to 3 results and a :manual:`$project 
   </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to:
   
   - Exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``released``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` of results is calculated using ``pivot``. Note that ``pivot`` 
   is measured here in milliseconds, and ``7,776,000,000 ms`` is equal to 
   approximately three months. 

   .. code-block:: json

      db.movies.aggregate([
         {
            $searchBeta: {
               "index": "releaseddate",
               "near": {
                  "path": "released",
                  "origin": ISODate("1915-09-13T00:00:00.000+00:00"),
                  "pivot": 7776000000 
               }
            }
         },
         {
            $limit: 3
         },
         {
            $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1,
               "released": 1,
               score: { $meta: "searchScore" }
            }
         }
      ])

   The above query returns the following search results:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      { "title" : "Regeneration", "released" : ISODate("1915-09-13T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 1 }
      { "title" : "The Cheat", "released" : ISODate("1915-12-13T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 0.49723756313323975 }
      { "title" : "Hell's Hinges", "released" : ISODate("1916-03-05T00:00:00Z"), "score" : 0.34090909361839294 }

   In the above |fts| results, the movie ``Regeneration`` receives a score of 
   ``1`` because the ``released`` field value of ``1915-09-13`` is an exact 
   match. The movie ``The Cheat``, which was released on ``1915-12-13``, 
   receives a score of approximately ``0.5`` because the ``released`` field 
   value distance from ``origin`` is approximately ``7,776,000,000`` milliseconds 
   from ``1915-09-13``.

.. _near-geo-point-eg:

GeoJSON Point Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses a GeoJSON point object to query the 
``address.location`` field in the ``listingsAndReviews`` collection in the 
``sample_airbnb`` database. 

.. example::

   The following index definition indexes the ``address.location`` field 
   in the ``listingsAndReviews`` collection.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "mappings": {
          "fields": {
            "address": {
              "fields": {
                "location": {
                  "type": "geo"
                }
              },
              "type": "document"
            }
          }
          "type": "document"
        }
      }

   The following query searches for properties in Portugal. It includes a 
   :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit 
   the output to 3 results and a :manual:`$project 
   </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to:
   
   - Exclude all fields except ``name`` and ``address``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   The ``score`` of results is calculated using ``pivot``. Note that ``pivot`` 
   is measured here in meters and 1000 meters is equal to 1 kilometer.

   .. code-block:: json

      db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
        {
          "$searchBeta": {
            "near": {

                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-8.61308, 41.1413]
              },
              "pivot": 1000,
              "path": "address.location"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          $limit: 3
        },
        {
