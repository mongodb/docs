Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure **monitoring** in the
{+driver-long+}.

Monitoring involves collecting information about the activities of a running
program, which you can use with an application performance management
library.

Monitoring the {+driver-short+} lets you understand the driver's resource usage
and performance. This information can help you make informed decisions when designing and
debugging your application.

In this guide, you can learn how to perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`Monitor Command Events <ruby-command-monitoring>`
- :ref:`Monitor Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) Events <ruby-cluster-monitoring>`
- :ref:`Monitor Connection Pool Events <ruby-connection-pool-monitoring>`

This guide shows how to use information about the activity of the driver in code.
To learn how to record events in the driver, see the {+driver-short+}'s 
:ref:`Logging <ruby-logging>` guide. 

.. _ruby-command-monitoring:

Monitor Command Events
----------------------

A command event is an event related to a MongoDB database command. You can
access one or more command monitoring events using the driver by subscribing to
them in your application.

To learn more about MongoDB database commands, see the
:manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Subscribe to Command Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access details about command events by subscribing to them in your 
application. You can subscribe to events at a global level, 
which monitors all clients of a cluster, or at the client level. This example 
demonstrates the following actions: 

- Instantiates a ``CommandLogSubscriber``
- Uses the ``Mongo::Monitoring::Global.subscribe`` method to subscribe to command events at the global level
- Uses the ``Mongo::Client.subscribe`` method to subscribe to command events at the client level

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/command-monitoring.rb
   :language: ruby

Event Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subscribe to any of the following command monitoring events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - `CommandStarted <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/CommandStarted.html>`__
     - Created when a command is started.

   * - `CommandSucceeded <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/CommandSucceeded.html>`__
     - Created when a command succeeded.

   * - `CommandFailed <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/CommandFailed.html>`__
     - Created when a command failed.

.. _ruby-cluster-monitoring:

Monitor Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) Events
-----------------------------------------------------

The {+driver-short+} creates topology events, also known as SDAM events, when
there is a change in the state of the instance or cluster that you connected to.
For example, the driver creates an event when you establish a new connection or
if the cluster elects a new primary node.

To learn more about topology events, see the :manual:`Replication </replication>` guide in the Server Manual.

The following sections demonstrate how to record topology changes in your application
and explore the information provided in these events.

Subscribe to SDAM Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the {+driver-short+}'s ``subscribe`` method to subscribe to events. 
Pass a monitoring topic, which defines the monitoring event type, and a subscriber 
object as arguments to the ``subscribe`` method. You can subscribe to events at a global level, 
which monitors all clients of a cluster, or at the client level.

This example demonstrates the following actions: 

- Instantiates a ``ServerOpeningLogSubscriber`` subscriber 
- Uses the ``Mongo::Monitoring::Global.subscribe`` method to subscribe to ``ServerOpening`` events at the global level
- Uses the ``Mongo::Client.subscribe`` method to subscribe to ``ServerOpening`` events at the client level

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-available-subscriber
   :end-before: end-available-subscriber
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The following table provides available subscribers and their monitoring topic: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 37 20 43

   * - Subscriber Name
     - Monitoring Topic
     - Description 

   * - `ServerClosedLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/ServerClosedLogSubscriber.html>`__
     - ``SERVER_CLOSED``
     - Subscribes to ``ServerClosed`` events and logs them.

   * - `ServerDescriptionChangedLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/ServerDescriptionChangedLogSubscriber.html>`__
     - ``SERVER_DESCRIPTION_CHANGED``
     - Subscribes to ``ServerDescriptionChanged`` events and logs them.

   * - `ServerOpeningLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/ServerOpeningLogSubscriber.html>`__ 
     - ``SERVER_OPENING``
     - Subscribes to ``ServerOpening`` events and logs them.

   * - `TopologyChangedLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/TopologyChangedLogSubscriber.html>`__
     - ``TOPOLOGY_CHANGED``
     - Subscribes to ``TopologyChanged`` events and logs them.

   * - `TopologyClosedLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/TopologyClosedLogSubscriber.html>`__
     - ``TOPOLOGY_CLOSED``
     - Subscribes to ``TopologyClosed`` events and logs them.

   * - `TopologyOpeningLogSubscriber <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/TopologyOpeningLogSubscriber.html>`__
     - ``TOPOLOGY_OPENING``
     - Subscribes to ``TopologyOpening`` events and logs them.

You can find a table of SDAM event descriptions in the :ref:`Event Descriptions <SDAM-event-descriptions>` 
section on this page. 

Custom SDAM Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a custom SDAM subscriber to access details about server
and topology events. Create a separate class for each event type, as available
data for each event varies. 

For all events, the subscriber calls the ``succeeded`` method and passes the event
as an argument. A simple SDAM logging subscriber can look 
like the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-sdam
   :end-before: end-sdam
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To subscribe to events, create the appropriate subscriber and 
subscribe to the correct monitoring topic. The following code shows how 
to subscribe to SDAM events globally:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-sdam-subscriber-global
   :end-before: end-sdam-subscriber-global
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The following code shows how to subscribe to SDAM events for a single client 
by using the ``sdam-proc`` client option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-sdam-subscriber-client
   :end-before: end-sdam-subscriber-client
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. note::

  The ``:sdam_proc`` client option applies only to the given client. 
  When certain client options are changed by using the
  ``Client#with`` call, the driver may create a new cluster with
  a default set of event subscribers. If this happens, the provided
  ``:sdam_proc`` is not called, and the application may miss events.

When you run the application, your subscriber records the SDAM event and 
outputs messages such as the following:

.. code-block:: none
  :copyable: false

Server Heartbeats
`````````````````

You can also create a custom subscriber to monitor server heartbeats, which occur 
when the server monitor sends a ``hello`` command to the server.

Custom server heartbeat subscribers differ from other SDAM subscribers,
as they must implement the following three methods: 

- ``started``: Invoked when the listener receives the heartbeat
- ``succeeded``: Response for a successful heartbeat outcome
- ``failed``: Response for a failed heartbeat outcome

The following example shows a heartbeat event subscriber:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-heartbeat
   :end-before: end-heartbeat
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

You can subscribe to heartbeat events globally or for a specific client, 
as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/sdam-monitoring.rb
   :start-after: start-heartbeat-subscribe
   :end-before: end-heartbeat-subscribe
   :language: ruby
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

When you run the application, your subscriber records the heartbeat event and 
outputs messages such as the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   D, [2018-09-23T13:44:10.707018 #1739] DEBUG -- : HEARTBEAT | 127.0.0.1:27027 | STARTED
   D, [2018-09-23T13:44:10.707778 #1739] DEBUG -- : HEARTBEAT | 127.0.0.1:27027 | SUCCEEDED | 0.000772381s

.. _ruby-connection-pool-monitoring:

Monitor Connection Pool Events
------------------------------

A connection pool is a set of open TCP connections your driver maintains with a
MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the number of network handshakes
your application needs to perform and can help your application run faster.

The following sections demonstrate how to record connection pool events in your
application and explore the information provided in these events.

Subscribe to Connection Pool Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access details about all connection pool events by subscribing to them in your application. 
You can subscribe to events at a global level, which monitors all clients of a cluster, 
or at the client level:

This example demonstrates the following actions: 

- Instantiates a ``CmapLogSubscriber`` subscriber 
- Uses the ``Mongo::Monitoring::Global.subscribe`` method to subscribe to all connection pool events at the global level
- Uses the ``Mongo::Client.subscribe`` method to subscribe to all connection pool events at the client level

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring-logging/cp-monitoring.rb
   :language: ruby

Event Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subscribe to any of the following connection pool monitoring events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - `ConnectionCheckOutFailed <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/Cmap/ConnectionCheckOutFailed.html>`__
     - Created when an operation fails to acquire a connection for
       execution.

   * - `ConnectionCheckOutStarted <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/Cmap/ConnectionCheckOutStarted.html>`__

     - Created when a connection is created, but not necessarily
       when it is used for an operation.

   * - `ConnectionReady <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Monitoring/Event/Cmap/ConnectionReady.html>`__
     - Created after a connection has successfully completed a
       handshake and is ready to be used for operations.
