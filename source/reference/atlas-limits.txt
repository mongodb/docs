|service| Service Limits

.. please check the related procedures in the following Server docs 
.. page(s) to see if they require changes as well:

|service| limits how many of each kind of component you can create, and
the number of connections allowed to {+database-deployments+}. For
{+clusters+}, the number of connections allowed is based on {+cluster+}
tier. The following tables outline component and connection limits.

.. important::

   If any of these limits present a problem for your organization,
   contact :doc:`Atlas support </support/>`.

{+Cluster+} Limits

   * - :manual:`Shards </sharding/>` in Single-region clusters
     - No hard limit, but contact :ref:`MongoDB Support
       <request-support>` for more than 70 shards.  

   * - :ref:`Cross-region network permissions <faq-cross-region>`
       for a Multi-Region Cluster
     - 40

       If any project's {+cluster+} spans more than 40 regions, you can't create
       a multi-region {+cluster+} in this project.

       Replica Set or Shard

       Tier (minimum and maximum)
     - ``M30``

.. _connection-limits:

Connection Limits and Cluster Tier
----------------------------------

|service| sets the :setting:`limits for concurrent incoming connections
<net.maxIncomingConnections>` based on the {+cluster+} tier and
:ref:`class<storage-class-ui>`. |service| connection limits apply per node. For
:manual:`sharded {+clusters+} </sharding/>`, |service| connection limits apply per
:manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>` router. The number of
:manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>` routers is equal to
the number of replica set nodes across all shards. 

Your :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>` also contributes to the
total number of connections |service| can allocate for a given query.

.. example::
  Your ``M10`` cluster has three nodes with a 1500 connection limit per node.
  |service| reserves 10 connections per node. If you set your :manual:`read preference
  </core/read-preference/>` to :manual:`secondary
  </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondary>`, |service| can read from
  the two secondary nodes for a combined 2980 connection limit.

Increase Connection Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to increase the number of connections your |service| cluster can handle,
consider upgrading your :ref:`cluster tier <scale-cluster-instance>`.

If your application dynamically creates additional connections, as it might if,
for example, your database worker pool is elastic, consider enabling 
:ref:`Cluster Autoscaling <cluster-autoscaling>` to ensure that your |service| 
cluster can accomodate your dynamic connection count requirement.

be able to deploy more ``M0`` {+clusters+} per project. To learn more, 
contact a MongoDB sales representative.

Label Limits

|service| limits the length of particular labels for components.

.. [1] If you have :ref:`peering-only mode enabled 
       <atlas-faq-azure-gcp-peering-only>`, the {+cluster+} name
       character limit is 23.

.. [2] |service| uses the first *23 characters* of a {+cluster+} name.
       These characters must be unique within the containing project.
       Cluster names with fewer than 23 characters can't end with a hyphen
       (``-``). Cluster names with more than 23 characters can't have a
       hyphen as the 23rd character. 

.. [3] Organization and Project names can include any Unicode letter or
       number plus the following punctuation: ``-_.(),:&@+'``.
