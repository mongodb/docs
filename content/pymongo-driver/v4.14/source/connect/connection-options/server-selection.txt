Overview
--------

All MongoDB drivers follow a defined algorithm when selecting a server to read or write
from. By using the ``server_selector`` property of ``MongoClient``, you can customize this
algorithm to choose the server that works best for your application.

.. important::

   Customizing the server-selection algorithm can have unintended consequences,
   such as degraded read or write performance.

Customized Selection Algorithm
------------------------------

When {+driver-short+} executes a read operation, it performs the following steps,
in order, to select a MongoDB deployment:

1. From the list of known servers, {+driver-short+} selects all servers
   that match the active read preference.

#. If at least one readable server exists, {+driver-short+} calls the user-defined
   server-selector function and passes in the list from the previous step.

#. {+driver-short+} applies the ``localThresholdMS`` connection setting to the list of
   servers returned from the function.

#. {+driver-short+} selects a server at random from the servers still on the list and
   executes the operation against this server.

When {+driver-short+} executes a write operation, it begins by selecting all writeable
servers, not just those that match the active read preference. The remaining steps are
identical.

To learn more about the default server-selection algorithm, which the driver follows
when you don't use the ``server_selector`` argument, see
:manual:`Server Selection Algorithm </core/read-preference-mechanics/>` in the
MongoDB Server manual.

Example: Select Servers on ``localhost``
----------------------------------------

When using a sharded cluster with multiple ``mongos`` servers, you might want to prefer
deployments running on ``localhost``. Operations against these deployments
usually have lower latency and higher throughput.
This example shows how to customize the server-selection algorithm to favor
servers running on ``localhost``. 

First, write a Python function to select your preferred servers.
The server-selection function must meet the following criteria:

- Accepts a list of ``ServerDescription`` objects as a parameter
- Returns the list of ``ServerDescription`` objects suitable for the read or write operation
- Doesn't create or modify any ``ServerDescription`` objects

The following example defines a function named ``prefer_local`` that accepts and returns a list of
``ServerDescription`` objects:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3
   
   def prefer_local(server_descriptions):
       ... 
       return servers  # list containing preferred servers

Next, implement your server-selection logic in the function body. You can use any
property defined in the ``ServerDescription`` class to select your preferred servers.
To return only MongoDB deployments running on ``localhost``, this example loops on the
servers in ``server_descriptions`` and checks the ``address`` property of each server
for the value ``"localhost"``:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4
   
   def prefer_local(server_descriptions):
       servers = [
           server for server in server_descriptions if server.address[0] == "localhost"
       ]
       return servers 

Next, consider the case when your algorithm finds no matching servers. If your function
returns an empty list, your application can't communicate with MongoDB. Therefore,
return a list containing at least one ``ServerDescription`` object from your function.

In this example, if no matching server is found, the ``prefer_local`` function returns
the list of servers originally passed as an argument:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 6-7

   def prefer_local(server_descriptions):
       servers = [
           server for server in server_descriptions if server.address[0] == "localhost"
       ]

       if not servers:
           return server_descriptions
       return servers 

Finally, instruct {+driver-short+} to use your function. To do so, call the ``MongoClient``
constructor and pass the ``server_selector`` argument with your function name as the value.
Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding
code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python

         client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>",
                                      server_selector=prefer_local)
   
   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python

         client = pymongo.AsyncMongoClient("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>",
                                           server_selector=prefer_local)
