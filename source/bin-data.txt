Bin Data
--------

|charts| supports binning date, numeric, and string fields in your
data. Binning breaks continuous data into discrete groups called
*bins*, with each bin containing a contiguous subset of the original
values. For example, you might group users into bins by the decade they
were born, or group timestamped calendar events by the month of their
start date.

.. _continuous-discrete-data:

.. example:: Continuous vs Discrete Data

   Continuous data can occupy any value over a continuous range.
   Some examples of continuous data include height, temperature, or
   the time a person was born.

   Alternatively, discrete data is data which can only take certain
   values, categorized into a classification. Examples of discrete
   data include eye color and the number of students in a class.

   .. tab:: Bin Date Fields
      :tabid: bin-date-fields

      When handling dates, this data often comes in a continuous form.
      It can be useful to split this data into a specific windows of
      time to uncover additional trends and patterns. |charts| supports
      the following bins for dates:

      .. hlist::
         :columns: 2

         * Year
         * Month
         * Week of Year
         * Date of the Month
         * Day of the Week
         * Hour
         * Minute
         * Second

      To use binning for dates:

      1. Drag a date field (signified by a calendar icon in the
         :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder) to a
         :guilabel:`category`
         :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>`.

         By default, binning is enabled as indicated by the
         :guilabel:`Binning On` toggle.

      #. Use the dropdown to select the bin size for your dates.

      .. _periodic-setting:

      3. Toggle the :guilabel:`Periodic` setting as desired.

         - If enabled, |charts| creates bins relative to the next
           highest time period and repeats each bin to cover the
           timeframe spanned in the data field.

         - If disabled, the bins |charts-short| creates do not repeat.

         .. example::

            Consider a date field containing data spanning 5 years, and
            a bin selection of :guilabel:`Month`. If
            :guilabel:`Periodic` is disabled, |charts-short| adds the 60
            months in the dataset to the visualization.

            Alternatively, if :guilabel:`Periodic` is enabled,
            |charts-short| only plots the 12 calendar months, and
            visualizes the total aggregated results from each calendar
            month.

         .. note::

            - The :guilabel:`Periodic` setting is always enabled when
              selecting a bin size of :guilabel:`Day of the Week`.

            - The :guilabel:`Periodic` setting is always disabled when
              selecting a bin size of :guilabel:`Year`, because year is
              the largest time period available in |charts-short|.

      To disable binning, toggle the :guilabel:`Binning` setting
      to off. In this case, each date from the field is added to the
      visualization with no grouping performed.

      .. example::

         The following chart visualizes historical sales data for an
         office supply store. Every sale is represented by a document in
         the ``supplySales`` collection. Each document in the collection
         includes the date of the sale as ``salesDate`` and a list of
         items included in the sale as the ``items`` array.

         The ``saleDate`` field contains :ref:`continuous
         <continuous-discrete-data>` timestamp data. The field
         is binned by :guilabel:`Date of the Month` with the
         :guilabel:`Periodic` setting enabled. This means that over the
         course of the several years the data spans, |charts| plots the
         :guilabel:`mean` value of sales from each individual date of
         the
         month:

         .. figure:: /images/charts/charts-binning-by-day.png
            :figwidth: 680px
            :alt: Charts binning by day example

      Compare Periods
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      When you use binned date data, you have the option to compare data
      across periods of time. You can display cumulative totals or
      changes in value. 

      To use the compare periods feature, a chart must have:

      - A :ref:`category channel <charts-channel-type-table>` with a
        :ref:`binned, non-periodic date field <bin-date-fields>`
        encoded.

      - An :ref:`aggregation <building-charts-aggregation>` channel.

      If the conditions are met, the aggregation card has a toggle
      switch labeled :guilabel:`Compare Periods`. When toggled on, a
      dropdown menu appears with options for :guilabel:`Cumulative
      Total` and :guilabel:`Change in Value`.

      On a :guilabel:`Cumulative Total` chart, each successive data
      point is calculated by adding its own value added to the preceding
      chronological data point. You can also specify a baseline value to
      serve as the initial value of the cumulative total. The default
      baseline value is ``0``.

      On a :guilabel:`Change in Value` chart, each successive data point
      shows the difference between it and the preceding chronological
      data point. The first data point in the chart will always be
      blank, because there is no previous period to compare against.

      The following types of charts can use the compare periods feature:

      - :ref:`Bar and Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`
      - :ref:`Discrete Line and Area <discrete-charts>`

      .. note::

         The cumulative data option is not available with
         :ref:`multi-series charts <multi-series-charts>`.

      .. example::

         The following column chart visualizes yearly sales for an
         office supply store as a cumulative total across five years.
         Each document in the collection includes the date of the sale
         as ``salesDate`` and a ``quantity`` field with a count of items
         included in the sale.

         The ``saleDate`` field is binned by year. The ``items`` field
         is an array in which each item has a ``quantity`` field, which
         is added to the cumulative total with a ``SUM`` aggregation
         operation.

         .. figure:: /images/charts/cumulative-total.png
            :figwidth: 680px
            :alt: Charts cumulative total example

      .. include:: /includes/fact-empty-bins.rst

   .. tab:: Bin Numeric Fields
      :tabid: bin-numeric-fields

      |charts| can bin numeric fields from a continuous set into
      groups of a specified size.

      To use binning for numeric fields:

      1. Drag a numeric field (signified by the number sign icon in the
         :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder) to a
         :guilabel:`category` :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>`.

         By default, binning is enabled as indicated by the toggle
         stating :guilabel:`Binning On`.

      #. Enter the desired bin size in the :guilabel:`Bin Size` input.

      To disable binning, toggle the :guilabel:`Binning` setting to off.
      In this case, each individual value from the field is added to the
      visualization, rather than being grouped into bins.

      .. example::

         The following chart visualizes historical sales data for an
         office supply store. Every sale is represented by a document in
         the ``supplySales`` collection. Each sale document contains a
         ``customer`` object, which contains information on the customer
         purchasing the item(s).

         The following chart applies binning to the ``customer.age``
         field. The ``age`` field contains continuous numeric data and
         is binned by decade. Each ``age`` value is placed into the
         appropriate bin and |charts-short| counts the number of ages in
         each bin to provide a high-level overview of the age
         distribution of store customers.

         .. figure:: /images/charts/charts-numeric-binning.png
            :figwidth: 680px
            :alt: Charts numeric binning example

      .. include:: /includes/fact-empty-bins.rst

   .. tab:: Bin String Values
      :tabid: bin-string-values

      You can select and bin string categories for greater flexibility
      over how data is grouped in your chart. When you add categories to
      a bin, |charts| aggregates data from each selected category to
      render the data for that bin.

      Use Cases
      ~~~~~~~~~

      By binning selected categorical strings together, you can group
      items with a common theme without needing to change your
      underlying data. You can consolidate a fixed, large set of values
      into a smaller, more manageable set.

      Consider:

      - A dataset with information pertaining to countries throughout
        the world, and you want to group countries by continent.

      - A dataset on various artists throughout history that you want to
        group by artistic period (for example, Renaissance, Romantic, Modern).

      - A dataset containing fine-grained version numbers (e.g. ``2.3.0``,
        ``2.3.1``, ``2.3.2-rc1``, ``2.4.0``) which you'd like to analyze
        in coarser-grained groups (e.g. ``2.3``, ``2.4``).

      Create a Bin from String Values
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      1. Drag a string field to a :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel.

      #. Toggle :guilabel:`Binning` for the field to :guilabel:`On`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Add Bin`.

      #. In the :guilabel:`Add Bin` window, give your bin a title.

      At this point you can either create a bin from a list of category
      strings or define a regular expression to match string values.
      You can use the list of category strings if you want to choose the
      exact values for each bin. A regular expression is a better choice
      if you want to pattern-match a larger range of potential values.

      To create a bin from selected category strings:

      1. Click the :guilabel:`Select` radio button.

      #. Select the categories to include in your bin. 
         
      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. The :guilabel:`Bins` window shows the
         bins you have created and how many categories belong to each
         bin.

      .. note::

         - Each value can only be added to one bin. Any values that have
           already been added to other bins show as disabled, and are
           appended with the name of the bin they have been added to.

         - The list of checkboxes and values comes from a sample of the
           data and may not include every value that exists in the data.
           You can manually add additional values to the list.

      To create a bin from a regular expression:

      1. Click the :guilabel:`Regex` radio button. 

      #. Enter a regular expression in the :guilabel:`Insert regex` text
         box.

      #. Select any desired flags from the dropdown menu to the right of
         the text box. You can use any combination of the four available
         flags:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 20 80

            * - Flag
              - Description

            * - ``i``
              - Case insensitive search

            * - ``m``
              - Multiline mode

            * - ``x``
              - Extended mode

            * - ``s``
              - Single line mode

      #. A sample of matching documents appears. If there are no matching
         documents, you can still save the bin.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. The :guilabel:`Bins` window shows the
         bins you have created. Bins created from a regular expression
         are noted with a :guilabel:`.*` icon.

      You can add another bin by clicking the :guilabel:`Add Bin` link,
      or close the :guilabel:`Bins` window by clicking the :guilabel:`X`
      in the upper right corner.

      Edit and Remove Existing Bins
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To edit existing category bins, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button
      next to the :guilabel:`Binning` toggle. The :guilabel:`Bins`
      window appears. The badge next to each bin shows how many
      categories belong in that bin.

      .. figure:: /images/charts/bin-window.png
         :figwidth: 300px
         :alt: Example bin grouping movie categories

      To edit a bin, click the :guilabel:`Pencil Icon`. You can rename
      the bin and change the categories belonging in that bin.

      To remove a bin, click the :guilabel:`Trash` icon.

      Examples
      ~~~~~~~~

      The following chart groups genres from the
      :ref:`Movies Sample Data <charts-sample-data>` into broader bins:

      - :guilabel:`Historical Movies`, which includes the genres
        Documentary, Biography, History, and War.

      - :guilabel:`Light-Hearted Movies`, which includes the genres
        Comedy, Romance, and Family.

      - :guilabel:`Scary Movies`, which includes the genres Drama,
        Thriller, Horror, and Mystery.

      Movies of a genre not included in these bins are grouped into the
      :guilabel:`Other Values` bin.

      The chart shows the mean ``imdb.rating`` rating for movies
      belonging to each bin. The chart is sorted alphabetically by
      category name.

      .. figure:: /images/charts/nominal-binning-complete.png
         :figwidth: 700px
         :alt: Chart containing binned category data

      The following chart looks through the ``description`` field of the
      ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection for certain words
      and compares the mean prices. It uses bins to group documents based
      on whether the ``description`` field contains a string matching the
      pattern specified by the regular expression.
      
      .. figure:: /images/charts/nominal-binning-regex.png
         :figwidth: 700px
         :alt: Chart containing binned description data

      Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~

      - Values can only belong to only one category bin, but they can belong
        to any number of regex bins.

      - Any values shown on the chart that have not been added to any
        bins are automatically added to a default bin called
        :guilabel:`Other Values`.

      - The order in which bins appear in the :guilabel:`Bins` window is
        significant. Each value is rendered in the chart as part of the
        highest-ranked bin it appears in.

        .. note::

           You can reorder your bins by dragging and dropping them in the
           :guilabel:`Bins` window.

.. _charts-sort-data:

Sort Data
---------

Use the :guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown in the Chart Builder to sort
chart data by either:

- Category
- Value
- Series field (for :ref:`multi-series charts <multi-series-charts>`)

If you sort a multi-series chart generically by :guilabel:`Value`
without sorting by a specific series, |charts| sorts your data based on
the sum of all values in your series.

To toggle between ascending or descending sort order, click the ``a-z``
button to the right of the :guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown.

By default, |charts-short| sorts data based on :guilabel:`Value`
in descending order.

Sort Multi-Series Charts by Series Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you create a :ref:`multi-series chart <multi-series-charts>` using a
different field per series, you can sort the chart by a specific series
field.

.. example::

   The following charts use the
   :ref:`Sample Data: Movies <charts-sample-data>`
   data source to compare the mean number of ``fresh`` and ``rotten``
   Rotten Tomato ratings for movies in each genre.

   This chart is sorted by the mean ``fresh`` value in descending
   order:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/sort-by-series-fresh-desc.png
      :figwidth: 550px
      :alt: Chart sorted by fresh rating in descending order

   This chart is sorted by the mean ``rotten`` value in ascending
   order:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/sort-by-series-rotten-asc.png
      :figwidth: 550px
      :alt: Chart sorted by rotten rating in ascending order
   
.. _charts-limit-data:

Limit Data
----------

You can apply a limit to the :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel
to only include a specified number of categories in your visualization.
The categories included are the *first* matching categories based on
the :ref:`sort order <charts-sort-data>` specified. Limiting data can
be useful when visualizing data with so many categories it becomes
difficult to create a meaningful chart.

When you limit your data, you may additionally enable 
:guilabel:`Show "All Others"` to create a new category called 
"All others" that combines the values of categories omitted by your 
limit.

.. example::

   The following chart shows the average
   `IMDb <https://www.imdb.com/>`_ rating of movies from a
   particular country:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/charts-movie-ratings-by-country.png
      :figwidth: 720px
      :alt: Movie ratings by country

   The dataset contains movies from many different countries, but it
   would be most interesting to see which countries produce the
   highest-rated movies. We can accomplish this by applying a limit to
   only show countries with the 10 highest average ratings for movies.

   Switch the :guilabel:`Limit Results` toggle to ``On`` and leave the
   :guilabel:`Show` input at the default value of 10. 
   
   Check :guilabel:`Show "All Others"` to create an 11th column 
   representing the average rating of movies from countries that aren't 
   in the top 10. 

   The chart is now
   much easier to understand, and we have a clear view of the countries
   with the highest-rated movies:
