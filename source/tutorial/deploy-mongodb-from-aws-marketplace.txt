Deploy MongoDB from AWS Marketplace
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If you installed MongoDB via the AWS Marketplace, refer to the instructions
below for :ref:`starting-mongodb`. For information on how the MongoDB with
Instance Storage AMI was configured, see :ref:`mongodb-ami`. For information
on how the MongoDB with EBS RAID storage was configured, see
:ref:`mongodb-ebs-raid-ami`. The :ref:`security-setup` section contains
information about the security group settings for these AMIs.

.. _starting-mongodb:

Starting MongoDB
----------------

The instance has been mostly configured, the only steps left are to set
MongoDB to start at system boot and then start :program:`mongodb-manual:mongod` up:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo chkconfig mongod on
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/mongod start
   Starting mongod:                                           [  OK  ]
   forked process: 1234
   all output going to: /log/mongod.log

In a few moments MongoDB will finish starting up and then you can
connect to MongoDB using the :program:`mongodb-manual:mongo` client:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mongo
   MongoDB shell version: 2.0.4
   connecting to: test
   >

If you have trouble connecting to the MongoDB daemon, check the log file
(either :file:`/var/log/mongo/mongod.log` or :file:`/log/mongod.log`) for
:program:`mongodb-manual:mongod` console output.

.. _security-setup:

Security Setup
--------------

By default, the instance starts up with a newly created security group
and that group specifies that only access via port 22 (SSH) is allowed.
In order to make MongoDB accessible to other instances, you'll need to
add an additional rule to your security group specifying access to port
27017 along with a source (this can be a specific IP address, instances
from within another security group or from an IP). Start by logging in
to the
`AWS EC2 Management Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_
and navigate to the Security Groups section. Next, find the group that
was created when you created your instance and add an Inbound Rule:

.. image:: ../images/security-group-rule.png

After the rule is applied, you will be able to access MongoDB running in
your instance from the source you specified.
Consult the
`AWS EC2 Security Groups documentation <http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html>`_
for more information about configuring access to your instance with
security groups.

Instance Configurations
-----------------------

.. _mongodb-ami:

MongoDB AMI
~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB was installed onto Amazon Linux using a subset of steps found in
the :ref:`install-and-configure-mongodb` section of
:ref:`install-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2`. Specifically, the 10gen repository
was created and MongoDB (along with sysstat tools) were then installed
via yum. This AMI uses a single EBS-backed volume as storage and does
not employ RAID10 or LVM. The data directory was set to :file:`/data` in
the MongoDB configuration file :file:`/etc/mongodb.conf`.

.. _mongodb-ebs-raid-ami:

MongoDB with EBS RAID AMI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the :ref:`install-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2` guide as a base, the EBS RAID AMI
was configured using a subset of the steps found in the
:ref:`deploy-a-single-node` section. This AMI was configured with `block
device mapping
<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html>`_
and uses 4 EBS volumes, each with 100GiB of storage.

The volumes were then setup as a single RAID10 device using
:program:`mdadm` and 3 logical volumes (data, log, journal) were created
using LVM.
With RAID10 the total available storage is 200GiB and within
that 180GiB is for :file:`/data`, 10GiB for :file:`/log` and 10GiB for
:file:`/journal`.
The MongoDB configuration file :file:`/etc/mongod.conf`
reflects the updated locations for these elements.
For more information on the specific steps, refer to the
:ref:`install-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2` guide.

More Information
----------------

storage setups, backups, etc.), refer to the :ref:`amazon-ec2` page or
