title: Connect to the MongoDB instance.
stepnum: 1
ref: connect
content: |
  Connect and authenticate to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for a
  single deployment, the primary ``mongod`` for a replica set, or a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` for a sharded cluster as an ``admin`` database
  user with the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

  text: Upgrade authentication schema.
ref: upgrade-auth-schema
stepnum: 2
pre: |
  Use the ``authSchemaUpgrade`` command in the ``admin``
  database to update the user data using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
 
  .. note:: 

     The command is available only in MongoDB versions 3.0 through 3.6.
     Refer to the specific version of the manual for details on on the
     command.
     
action:
  - heading: Run ``authSchemaUpgrade`` command.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.adminCommand({authSchemaUpgrade: 1});
    post: |
      In case of error, you may safely rerun the
      ``authSchemaUpgrade`` command.
  - heading: Sharded cluster ``authSchemaUpgrade`` consideration.
    pre: |
      For a sharded cluster *without* :ref:`shard local users
      <sharding-security>`, ``authSchemaUpgrade`` will, by
      default, upgrade the authorization data of the shards as well,
      completing the upgrade.

      You can, however, override this behavior by including
      ``upgradeShards: false`` in the command, as in the following
      example:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.adminCommand(
         {authSchemaUpgrade: 1, upgradeShards: false }
      );
    post: |
      If you override the default behavior or your cluster has shard
      local users, after running ``authSchemaUpgrade`` on a
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, you will need to connect to the
      primary for each shard and repeat the upgrade process after
      upgrading on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
