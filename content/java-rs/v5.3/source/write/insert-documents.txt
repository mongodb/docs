Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to add
documents to a MongoDB collection by performing insert operations.

An insert operation inserts one or more documents into a MongoDB collection.
You can perform an insert operation by using the ``insertOne()`` or
``insertMany()`` methods.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. 

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample
datasets, see the :ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>` tutorial.

The ``_id`` Field
-----------------

In a MongoDB collection, each document *must* contain an ``_id`` field
with a unique field value.

MongoDB allows you to manage this field in two ways:

- You can set this field for each document yourself, ensuring each
  ``_id`` field value is unique.
- You can let the driver automatically generate unique ``ObjectId``
  values for each document ``_id``. If you do not manually set an
  ``_id`` value for a document, the driver populates the field
  with an ``ObjectId``.

Unless you can guarantee uniqueness, we recommend
letting the driver automatically generate ``_id`` values.

.. note::

   Duplicate ``_id`` values violate unique index constraints, which
   causes the driver to return a ``WriteError`` from
   ``insertOne()`` or a ``BulkWriteError`` from ``insertMany()``.

To learn more about the ``_id`` field, see the
:manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique/>` guide in the MongoDB Server manual.

To learn more about document structure and rules, see the
:manual:`Documents </core/document>` guide in the MongoDB Server manual.

Insert One Document
-------------------

To add a single document to a MongoDB collection, call the ``insertOne()`` method
and pass the document you want to add. Then, pass the ``insertOne()`` result to the static
``Mono.from()`` method from ``Mono``. ``Mono`` is a class from the {+pr+} library. In {+java-rs+}, 
the driver methods return cold ``Publisher`` instances, which means that the
corresponding operation does not happen unless you subscribe to the returned
``Publisher``. This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume them. To learn more
about ``Mono``, see `Mono <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono>`__ in the
{+pr+} documentation.

The following example uses the ``insertOne()`` method to insert a document in which the ``name`` value is ``"Mongo's
Burgers"`` into the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Document document = new Document("name", "Mongo's Burgers");
    Publisher<InsertOneResult> insertPublisher = restaurants.insertOne(document);
    Mono.from(insertPublisher).block();

Insert Multiple Documents
-------------------------

To add multiple documents to a MongoDB collection, call the ``insertMany()`` method
and pass a list of documents you want to add. Then, pass the ``insertMany()`` result to the static
``Mono.from()`` method from ``Mono``. ``Mono`` is a class from the {+pr+} library. In {+java-rs+}, 
the driver methods return cold ``Publisher`` instances, which means that the
corresponding operation does not happen unless you subscribe to the returned
``Publisher``. This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume them. To learn more
about ``Mono``, see `Mono <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono>`__ in the
{+pr+} documentation.

The following example uses the ``insertMany()`` method to insert a list of documents into the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Document doc1 = new Document("name", "Mongo's Pizza");
    Document doc2 = new Document("name", "Mongo's Coffee");

    List<Document> documents = Arrays.asList(doc1, doc2);

    Publisher<InsertManyResult> insertPublisher = restaurants.insertMany(documents);
    Mono.from(insertPublisher).block();

Modify Insert Behavior
----------------------

The ``InsertOneOptions`` class contains methods that modify
the behavior of the ``insertOne()`` method. To use the ``InsertOneOptions``
class, construct a new instance of the class, then call one or more of its methods
to modify the insert operation. You can chain these method calls together.
To modify the behavior of the insert operation, pass the class instance and
chained method calls as the second argument to the
``insertOne()`` method.

You can similarly modify the ``insertMany()`` method by using the
``InsertManyOptions`` class.

You can use the following methods in the ``InsertOneOptions`` class
to modify the ``insertOne()`` method. All methods are optional.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation (Boolean bypassDocumentValidation)``
     - | If set to ``True``, allows the write to opt out of
         :manual:`document-level validation </core/schema-validation>`. 
       | Defaults to ``False``.

   * - ``toString()``
     - | If used, returns a string representation of the object.

   * - ``comment(BsonValue comment)``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         MongoDB Server manual.

The ``InsertManyOptions`` class contains the previous methods,
as well as the following ``ordered()`` method:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``ordered(Boolean ordered)``
     - | If set to ``True``, the driver sends documents to the
         server in the order provided. If an error occurs, the driver
         and server cancel all remaining insert operations.
       | Defaults to ``True``. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``insertMany()`` method to insert new
documents into the ``restaurants`` collection. It also sets the ``bypassDocumentValidation(true)`` option
to bypass document-level validation.

.. code-block:: java

   Document doc1 = new Document("name", "Mongo's Burgers");
   Document doc2 = new Document("name", "Mongo's Pizza");
   Document doc3 = new Document("name", "Mongo's Coffee");

   List<Document> documents = Arrays.asList(doc1, doc2, doc3);

  Publisher<InsertManyResult> insertPublisher =
          restaurants.insertMany(documents,
                  new InsertManyOptions().bypassDocumentValidation(true));
  
   Mono.from(insertPublisher).block();
