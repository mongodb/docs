  modal:

  a. Name your :term:`sharded cluster` components:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80
        :header-rows: 1
    
        * - Field
          - Action
    
        * - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`
          - Type the name of your new cluster. 
    
        * - :guilabel:`CSRS Name` (MongoDB 3.2 or later)
          - Type the name of the

     .. note::

        You cannot change these values after you click
        :guilabel:`Convert`.

  b. Set the following values for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
     in your :guilabel:`Config Servers`. All fields are required.

     .. note::
        You must deploy at least one configuration server.

     .. list-table::

          - From the menu, select an existing hostname or type a
            hostname in the search box above the list to find a host.

            If you need to add a new host:

            1. Click the :guilabel:`New Server` link.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. Follow the instructions to install a new
               {+aagent+} on that new host.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Verify Agent`.

            each :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

            The example path is ``/data``. 

            The :binary:`~bin.mongod`
            must have exclusive use of these paths on the specified
