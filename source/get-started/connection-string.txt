==========================
Create a Connection String
==========================

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas connection string

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <java-get-started-create-deployment>`,
      log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Clusters` section. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button
      for your new deployment, as shown in the following screenshot:

      Then, proceed to the :guilabel:`Connect your application` section. Select
      "Java" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.

   .. step:: Copy your connection string

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard, as shown in the following screenshot:

   .. step:: Edit your connection string placeholders

      Paste your connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and save this file to a safe location for later use. In your connection
      string, replace the ``<db_username>`` and ``<db_password>`` placeholders with
      your database user's username and password.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.
