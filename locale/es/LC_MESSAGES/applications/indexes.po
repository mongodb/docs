"The best indexes for your application must take a number of factors into "
"account, including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to"
" writes, and the amount of free memory on your system."

"When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep "
"understanding of your application's queries. Before you build indexes, "
"map out the types of queries you will run so that you can build indexes "
"that reference those fields. Indexes come with a performance cost, but "
"are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data set. "
"Consider the relative frequency of each query in the application and "
"whether the query justifies an index."

"The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety "
"of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be "
"running in production to see which configurations perform best.Inspect "
"the current indexes created for your collections to ensure they are "
"supporting your current and planned queries. If an index is no longer "
"used, drop the index."

"Generally, MongoDB only uses *one* index to fulfill most queries. "
"However, each clause of an :query:`$or` query may use a different index, "
"and starting in 2.6, MongoDB can use an :doc:`intersection </core/index-"
"intersection>` of multiple indexes."
