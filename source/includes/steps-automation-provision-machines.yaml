  When choosing your :guilabel:`Security Group`, it is important that
  the ports you use for your deployment are open within the security
  group. It is also required that the security group allow SSH access
  from all IPs.

  The security groups populated here come directly from your AWS
  account. If you would like a new group listed in this menu, you must
  create it in the AWS console. It cannot be created in MMS.

  When you complete your selections, click :guilabel:`Next`.

title: Select storage settings.
stepnum: 5
ref: confirm

  Select a :guilabel:`Root Volume Size (GiB)` large enough for the
  deployment's needs. We recommend a root volume of at least 25 GB.
  The root volume will be used to store downloaded MongoDB versions,
  as well as Automation Agent log files and the operating system itself.

  Set the path of :guilabel:`Data Directory` MongoDB uses to store data
  on the provisioned machines and choose the :guilabel:`Location of Data`.
  We do not recommend storing your data on the Root Volume.

  For machines in the "m1" or "m2" series, we recommend attaching an
  EBS Volume. For machines in the "c3" series, we recommend storing
  the data on the SSD instance stores.

  When you complete your entries, click :guilabel:`Provision Machine`.

  The machines can take several minutes to become fully operational.
