   This is a |yaml| file that you can modify to meet your desired
   configuration. The highlighted lines should be changed for your
   sharded cluster configuration.

   .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-sharded-cluster-minimal.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 5-7,9-17

   You will need to change the highlighted settings to match your 
   desired :term:`sharded cluster` deployment.
