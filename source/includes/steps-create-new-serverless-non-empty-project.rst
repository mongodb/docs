.. procedure::
   :style: normal
      
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
      
   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` Dialog.

      - If you already have one or more {+database-deployments+}, click
        :guilabel:`Create` to display the 
        :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      - If this is your first {+database-deployment+}:
        
        a. Click :guilabel:`Build a Database`.
        #. Click :guilabel:`advanced configuration options` at the top of
           the screen to display the
           :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog box.
      
   .. step:: Select a {+database-deployment+} type.
      
      Use the tabs at the top of the screen to select your 
      {+database-deployment+} type. You can deploy the following 
      {+database-deployments+}:
      
      {+Serverless-Instances+}
        {+Serverless-instances+} require minimal configuration and are best for
        applications that aren't critical and experience low or variable traffic. To learn
        more about {+serverless-instances+}, see :ref:`Choose a
        {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.
      
      {+Shared-Clusters+}
        {+Shared-clusters+} include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
        These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
        learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
        You can begin your project with a {+shared-cluster+} and upgrade to a
        production-ready tier at a future time.
      
      {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
        Dedicated clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
        ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
        and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
        datasets and high-traffic applications. Dedicated clusters can be
        deployed into a single geographical region or multiple geographical regions.
      
      Select :guilabel:`Serverless`, then proceed to the next step to customize the
      configuration prior to deployment.
      
      To create a {+shared-cluster+} or a {+dedicated-cluster+}, see
      :doc:`Create a New Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` for next steps.
      
   .. step:: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.

      The :doc:`choice of cloud provider and region </cloud-providers-regions>`
      affects the network latency for clients accessing your {+serverless-instance+},
      the geographic location of the nodes in your {+serverless-instance+}, and the
      :doc:`cost of running the {+serverless-instance+} </billing>`.
      
      {+Serverless-instances+} support fewer regions than {+clusters+}. To learn
      more, see the region information for :doc:`AWS </reference/amazon-aws>`,
      :doc:`Google Cloud </reference/google-gcp>` and :doc:`Azure </reference/microsoft-azure>`.
      
   .. step:: Configure backup for your {+serverless-instance+}.
      
      Select one of the following backup options:
      
      .. include:: /includes/list-table-serverless-backup-options.rst
      
   .. step:: Specify the :guilabel:`Serverless Instance Details`.
      
      From the :guilabel:`Serverless Instance Details` section, you can:
      
      - Specify the :guilabel:`Serverless Instance Name`.
       
        This is the {+serverless-instance+} name as it appears in 
        |service|. You can't change the {+serverless-instance+} name once 
        you deploy it.

   .. step:: Proceed to checkout.

      Click :guilabel:`Create Cluster` below the form and complete the 
      billing information only if it doesn't already exist. If your
      organization already has the billing information, |service| deploys
      your cluster.
