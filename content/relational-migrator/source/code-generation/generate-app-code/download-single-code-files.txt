Code Generation is a feature built into {+rel-mig+} that helps
automatically generate code files for your applications connected 
to MongoDB. This page details how to generate and download individual code files.

About this Task
---------------

Some templates also generate additional files which are not specific to 
a MongoDB collection. These files are called :guilabel:`Support files`. Click 
the :guilabel:`Support files` check box to indicate if you would like these 
files included in your downloads.

Steps
-----

You can view, download, or copy a single collections code file.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Code Generation` screen, in the left :guilabel:`Generate code` pane.
#. Select a :guilabel:`Language`.
#. Select a :guilabel:`Template`.
#. (Optional) Enter a keyword in the :guilabel:`Filter` text box to 
   filter the MongoDB collections.
#. Click the MongoDB collection name.
#. A tab displays for each code file. More than one code file per collection may be generated depending on the template. 
#. Click the :guilabel:`Copy` or :guilabel:`Download` buttons in the target code file to download or copy that files contents.
