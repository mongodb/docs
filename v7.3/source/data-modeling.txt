Data modeling refers to the organization of data within a database and
the links between related entities. Data in MongoDB has a
**flexible schema model**, which means:

- :term:`Documents <document>` within a single :term:`collection
  <collection>` are not required to have the same set of fields.
  
- A field's data type can differ between documents within a collection.

Generally, documents in a collection share a similar structure. To
ensure consistency in your data model, you can create :ref:`schema
validation rules <schema-validation-overview>`.

Use Cases
---------

The flexible data model lets you organize your data to match your
application's needs. MongoDB is a document database, meaning you can
embed related data in object and array fields.

A flexible schema is useful in the following scenarios:

- Your company tracks which department each employee works in. You can
  embed department information inside of the ``employee`` collection to
  return relevant information in a single query.

- Your e-commerce application shows the five most recent reviews when
  displaying a product. You can store the recent reviews in the same
  collection as the product data, and store older reviews in a separate
  collection because the older reviews are not accessed as frequently.

- Your clothing store needs to create a single-page application for a
  product catalog. Different products have different attributes, and
  therefore use different document fields. However, you can store all of
  the products in the same collection.

Schema Design: Differences between Relational and Document Databases
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you design a schema for a document database like MongoDB, there are
a couple of important differences from relational databases to consider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10

   * - Relational Database Behavior

     - Document Database Behavior

   * - You must determine a table's schema before you insert data.

     - Your schema can change over time as the needs of your application
       change.

   * - You often need to join data from several different tables to
       return the data needed by your application.
       
     - The flexible data model lets you store data to match the way your
       application returns data, and avoid joins. Avoiding joins across
       multiple collections improves performance and reduces your
       deployment's workload.

Plan Your Schema
----------------

To ensure that your data model has a logical structure and achieves
optimal performance, plan your schema prior to using your database at a
production scale. To determine your data model, use the following
:ref:`schema design process <data-modeling-schema-design>`:

#. :ref:`Identify your application's workload
   <data-modeling-identify-workload>`.

#. :ref:`Map relationships between objects in your collections
   <data-modeling-map-relationships>`.

#. :ref:`Apply design patterns <data-modeling-apply-patterns>`.

Link Related Data
-----------------

When you design your data model in MongoDB, consider the structure of
your documents and the ways your application uses data from related
entities.

To link related data, you can either:

- Embed related data within a single document.

- Store related data in a separate collection and access it with a
  :ref:`reference <data-modeling-reference>`.

Embedded Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded documents store related data in a single document structure. A
document can contain arrays and sub-documents with related data. These
**denormalized** data models allow applications to retrieve related data
in a single database operation.

For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model is optimal.

To learn about the strengths and weaknesses of embedding documents, see
:ref:`data-modeling-embedding`.

.. _data-modeling-reference:

References
~~~~~~~~~~

References store relationships between data by including links, called
**references**, from one document to another. For example, a
``customerId`` field in an ``orders`` collection indicates a reference
to a document in a ``customers`` collection.

Applications can resolve these references to access the related data.
Broadly, these are *normalized* data models.

.. include:: /images/data-model-normalized.rst

To learn about the strengths and weaknesses of using references, see
:ref:`data-modeling-referencing`.

Additional Data Modeling Considerations
---------------------------------------

The following factors can impact how you plan your data model.

Data Duplication and Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/data-modeling/data-duplication-overview.rst

For example, a ``products`` collection stores the five most recent
reviews in a product document. Those reviews are also stored in a
``reviews`` collection, which contains *all* product reviews. When a new
review is written, the following writes occur:

- The review is inserted into the ``reviews`` collection.

- The array of recent reviews in the ``products`` collection is updated
  with :update:`$pop` and :update:`$push`.

If the duplicated data is not updated often, then there is minimal
additional work required to keep the two collections consistent.
However, if the duplicated data is updated often, using a
:ref:`reference <data-modeling-reference>` to link related data may be a
better approach.

Before you duplicate data, consider the following factors:

- How often the duplicated data needs to be updated.

- The performance benefit for reads when data is duplicated.

To learn more, see :ref:`data-modeling-duplicate-data`.

Indexing
~~~~~~~~

To improve performance for queries that your application runs
frequently, create :ref:`indexes <indexes>` on commonly queried fields.
As your application grows, :ref:`monitor your deployment's index use
<indexes-measuring-use>` to ensure that your indexes are still
supporting relevant queries.

Hardware Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you design your schema, consider your deployment's hardware,
especially the amount of available RAM. Larger documents use more RAM,
which may cause your application to read from disk and degrade
performance. When possible, design your schema so only relevant fields
are returned by queries. This practice ensures that your application's
:term:`working set` does not grow unnecessarily large.

Single Document Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single
document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents
within a single document. This means that if an update operation
affects several sub-documents, either all of those sub-documents are
updated, or the operation fails entirely and no updates occur.

A denormalized data model with embedded data combines all related data
in a single document instead of normalizing across multiple documents
and collections. This data model allows atomic operations, in contrast
to a normalized model where operations affect multiple documents.

For more information see :ref:`data-model-atomicity`.
