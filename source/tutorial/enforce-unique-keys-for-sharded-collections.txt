===========================================
Enforce Unique Keys for Sharded Collections
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The :method:`unique <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` constraint on
indexes ensures that only one document can have a value for a field in
a :term:`collection`. For :ref:`sharded collections these unique indexes
cannot enforce uniqueness <limit-sharding-unique-indexes>` because
insert and indexing operations are local to each shard. 

MongoDB does not support creating unique new indexes in sharded clusters
and will not allow you to shard collections with unique indexes on
fields other than the ``_id`` field. 

If you need to ensure that a field is always unique in all
collections in a sharded environment, there are three options:

#. Enforce uniqueness of the :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.

   MongoDB *can* enforce uniqueness for the :term:`shard key`. For
   compound shard keys, MongoDB will enforce uniqueness on the
   *entire* key combination, and not for a specific component of the
   shard key.

   You cannot specify a unique constraint on a
   :ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>`.

#. Use a secondary collection to enforce uniqueness.

   Create a minimal collection that only contains the unique field and
   a reference to a document in the main collection. If you always
   insert into a secondary collection *before* inserting to the main
   collection, MongoDB will produce an error if you attempt to use a
   duplicate key.

   If you have a small data set, you may not need to shard this
   collection and you can create multiple unique indexes. Otherwise
   you can shard on a single unique key.

#. Use guaranteed unique identifiers. 
   
   Universally unique identifiers (i.e. UUID) like the ``ObjectId`` are
   guaranteed to be unique.

Procedures
----------

Unique Constraints on the Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sharding-pattern-unique-procedure-shard-key:

Process
```````

To shard a collection using the ``unique`` constraint, specify the
:dbcommand:`shardCollection` command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.users" , key : { email : 1 } , unique : true } );

Remember that the ``_id`` field index is always unique. By default, MongoDB
inserts an ``ObjectId`` into the ``_id`` field. However,
you can manually insert your own value into the ``_id`` field and
use this as the shard key. To use the
``_id`` field as the shard key, use the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.users" } )

Limitations
```````````

- You can only enforce uniqueness on one single field in the collection
  using this method.

- If you use a compound shard key, you can only enforce
  uniqueness on the *combination* of component keys in the shard
  key.

In most cases, the best shard keys are compound keys that include elements
that permit :ref:`write scaling <sharding-shard-key-write-scaling>`
and :ref:`query isolation <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`, as
well as :ref:`high cardinality <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>`.
These ideal shard keys are not often the same keys that require
uniqueness and enforcing unique values in these collections requires a
different approach.

Unique Constraints on Arbitrary Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you cannot use a unique field as the shard key or if you need to
enforce uniqueness over multiple fields, you must create another
:term:`collection` to act as a "proxy collection". This collection
must contain both a reference to the original document (i.e. its
``ObjectId``) and the unique key.

If you must shard this "proxy" collection, then shard on the unique
key using the :ref:`above procedure <sharding-pattern-unique-procedure-shard-key>`;
otherwise, you can simply create multiple unique indexes on the
collection.

Process
```````

Consider the following for the "proxy collection:"

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("...")
     "email" ": "..."
   }

The ``_id`` field holds the ``ObjectId`` of the :term:`document`
it reflects, and the ``email`` field is the field on which you want to
ensure uniqueness.

To shard this collection, use the following operation
using the ``email`` field as the :term:`shard key`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "records.proxy" ,
                    key : { email : 1 } ,
                    unique : true } );

If you do not need to shard the proxy collection, use the following
command to create a unique index on the ``email`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.proxy.ensureIndex( { "email" : 1 }, { unique : true } )

You may create multiple unique indexes on this collection if you do
not plan to shard the ``proxy`` collection.

To insert documents, use the following procedure in the
:ref:`JavaScript shell <mongo>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db = db.getSiblingDB('records');

   var primary_id = ObjectId();

   db.proxy.insert({
      "_id" : primary_id
      "email" : "example@example.net"
   })

   // if: the above operation returns successfully,
   // then continue:

   db.information.insert({
      "_id" : primary_id
      "email": "example@example.net"
      // additional information...
   })

You must insert a document into the ``proxy`` collection first. If
this operation succeeds, the ``email`` field is unique, and you may
continue by inserting the actual document into the ``information``
collection.

.. see:: The full documentation of: :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()`
   and :dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

Considerations
``````````````

- Your application must catch errors when inserting documents into the
  "proxy" collection and must enforce consistency between the two
  collections.

- If the proxy collection requires sharding, you must shard on the
  single field on which you want to enforce uniqueness.

- To enforce uniqueness on more than one field using sharded proxy
  collections, you must have *one* proxy collection for *every* field
  for which to enforce uniqueness. If you create multiple unique
  indexes on a single proxy collection, you will *not* be able to
  shard proxy collections.

Use Guaranteed Unique Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to ensure a field has unique values is to generate
universally unique identifiers (UUID,) such as MongoDB's '``ObjectId``
values.

This approach is particularly useful for the``_id`` field, which
*must* be unique: for collections where you are *not* sharding by the
``_id`` field the application is responsible for ensuring that the
``_id`` field is unique.
