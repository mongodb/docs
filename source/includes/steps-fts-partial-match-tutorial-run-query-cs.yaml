  a. Create a new directory called ``partial-match-example`` and
     initialize your project with the ``dotnet new`` command.

     .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir partial-match-example
        cd partial-match-example
        dotnet new console

  #. Add the .NET/C# Driver to your project as a dependency.

content: |
  a. Replace the contents of the ``Program.cs``  file with the
     following code.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Runs a query that uses:

       - :pipeline:`$search` stage to look for a term
       - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 5 results
       - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` 
          and ``plot``
     
     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
