Overview
--------

If |a-mms|-managed MongoDB process is not currently running, you
can restart it directly from the |mms| console.

.. note::

   If a :program:`mongos` process is not managed by |mms| Automation and if
   the process remains unreachable for 30 days, |mms| removes the process from
   the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab view. If you restart the :program:`mongos`
   process, |mms| will again detect it. For more information see the
   :alert:`is down` alert.

Procedure
---------

To restart a process:
