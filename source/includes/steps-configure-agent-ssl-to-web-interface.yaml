  Set or add the following properties where needed:

  .. list-table::
     :stub-columns: 1
     :widths: 20 10 70

     * - :asetting:`mmsBaseUrl`
       - Required
       - Set this value to match the |url| you entered in the
         :guilabel:`URL to Access Ops Manager` box.

     * - :asetting:`sslRequireValidMMSServerCertificates`
       - Conditional
       - Set this value to ``true`` if all of the following apply:

         - You want the agent to validate |tls-ssl| certificates of 
           |onprem|.
         - You signed the |tls-ssl| certificates of your |onprem| 
           hosts with a known external |certauth| or self-signed 
           |certauth|.

         .. note::

            If you set this value to ``true``, you must set 
            :asetting:`sslTrustedMMSServerCertificate`.

     * - :asetting:`sslTrustedMMSServerCertificate`
       - Conditional
       - If you are using your own self-signed |certauth| ``.pem`` 
         files, add this property and set it to the absolute path to 
         your |certauth| file on the MongoDB host.

         .. important::

            This |certauth| file must be in the same location on each
            MongoDB host in the same sharded cluster or replica set. 
            Any MongoDB host that does not have the file in the same 
            file location as the others may become unaccessible.

     * - :asetting:`sslMMSServerClientCertificate`
       - Conditional
       - If you set :guilabel:`Client Certificate Mode` in |onprem| to 
         ``Required for Agents Only`` or ``Required for All 
         Requests``, add this value and specify the absolute path to 
         the file containing the client's private key, certificate, and
         optional intermediate certificates in ``.pem`` format .

     * - :asetting:`sslMMSServerClientCertificatePassword`
       - Conditional
       - If you encrypted the
         :asetting:`sslMMSServerClientCertificate` ``.pem`` file, 
         provide the password needed to decrypt it.
