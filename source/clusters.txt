Clusters are |cloudgov|\-managed MongoDB deployments. A cluster can be
either a :atlas:`replica set 
</reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` or a :atlas:`sharded cluster 
</reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

-----------------------------------

- When you create a project, you can designate it as an |aws-fr-high| 
  region-only project. If you do not, that project is an 
  |aws-fr-moderate| region-only project. You may only deploy clusters 
  to the type of region that your project supports.

- You can only create clusters tier ``M20`` and above. Free and shared 
  tier clusters are not available.

See the |service| documentation to
:atlas:`Configure Clusters </cluster-configuration/>`.
