========================
Deploy a Sharded Cluster
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS can deploy and manage MongoDB :term:`sharded cluster`
deployments. Sharded clusters allow you to distribute a single data
set across a group of system to scale horizontally for larger data
sets and high throughput operations. See :manual:`Sharding
Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` for more information.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster managed by
MMS. Later, you can use MMS to add shards and perform other
maintenance on the deployment.
