The ``/query`` command assists in generating queries from a natural
language against a connected MongoDB cluster. The |copilot| provides
underlying schema information of the relevant collections to GitHub
Copilot to generate a response. If you do not specify a collection in
your prompt, the chat prompts you to select a relevant collection. 

When the LLM generates a query, you can open the query in a playground
file or run the query directly in your collection. 

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Generate a Query
````````````````

Consider the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
Each document in the collection has the following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: {
         "$oid": "59b99db4cfa9a34dcd7885b6"
      },
      name: "Kayden Washington",
      email: "KW@email.com",
      password: "11222021"
   }

Once you connect to the deployment that contains the ``users``
collection, you can ask the GitHub Copilot chat to generate a query that
finds the document in the ``users`` collection that has the ``name``
value of ``Kayden Washington``. 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /query In the sample_mflix database, find a document in the
   users collection with the name of Kayden Washington.

The GitHub Copilot Chat uses the |copilot| to
generate the following query using knowledge of your database schema:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   use(`sample_mflix`);
   db.getCollection('users').findOne({ name: 'Kayden Washington' });

Once the |copilot| generates the query, you can choose to run the query
directly or open the query in a playground.

Build an Aggregation Pipeline
`````````````````````````````

You can also use the |copilot| to build aggregation pipelines. Consider
the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
Each document in the collection has the following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: {
         "$oid": "59b99db4cfa9a34dcd7885b6"
      },
      name: "Kayden Washington",
      email: "KW@email.com",
      password: "11222021"
   }

Once you connect to the deployment that contains the ``users``
collection, you can ask the GitHub Copilot chat to generate an aggregation pipeline. 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /query Generate an aggregation pipeline on the users 
   collection that first sorts documents alphabetically by name and then 
   removes the password field from each document. 

The |copilot| generates the following aggregation pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use('sample_mflix');
   db.getCollection('users').aggregate([
      { $sort: { name: 1 } },
      { $project: { password: 0 } }
   ]);

Once the |copilot| generates the query, you can choose to run the pipeline
directly or open the pipeline in a playground.   

.. figure:: /images/copilot-agg-pipeline.png
   :figwidth: 700px
   :alt: Screenshot of copilot generating an aggregation pipeline

You can also iteratively build on your aggregation pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /query Add a stage to my pipeline that adds a username field 
   to each document containing the user's email without the 
   email domain. 

The |copilot| returns the following aggregation pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use('sample_mflix');
   db.getCollection('users').aggregate([
      { $sort: { name: 1 } },
      { $project: { password: 0 } },
      { $addFields: { username: { $arrayElemAt: [{ $split: ["$email", "@"] }, 0] } } }
   ]);
