Database replication ensures redundancy, backup, and automatic failover.
Replication occurs through groups of servers known as replica sets.

Replica Set Use and Operation
-----------------------------

Consider these higher level introductions to replica sets:

   /applications/replication
   /core/replication-internals

The following document describes master-slave replication, which is
deprecated. Use replica sets instead of master-slave in all new
deployments.

For documentation of MongoDB's operational segregation capabilities for
replica set deployments see the :doc:`/data-center-awareness`
