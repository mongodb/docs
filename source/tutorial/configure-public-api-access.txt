   To access the |mms| |api|, you must generate an |api| key for
   :ref:`programmatic access <mms-prog-api-key>` for an organization.

.. cond:: cloud

   To access the |mms| |api| using
   :ref:`applications <mms-prog-api-key>`,
   generate an |api| key for your organization.

.. admonition:: API Keys can't use the |mms| Console
   :class: note

   Organization-based |api| Keys aren't associated with user
   credentials. You can't use these |api| Keys to log in to the |mms|
   console.

(Optional) Require an API Access List for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| allows your {+admin-api+} keys to make requests from
any address on the internet unless you require an IP access list for
the {+admin-api+}. If you require an IP access list, your |api|
keys can make |api| requests only from the location-based IP or |cidr|
addresses that you specify in the IP access list. 

Each |api| key has its own IP access list. If you require an IP
access list for all {+admin-api+} requests, you must define at
least one IP access list entry for an |api| key before you can use the 
|api| key.

When you create a new organization using the |mms| UI, |mms| enables
the |api| access list requirement by default. To disable the IP
access list requirement when you :ref:`create an organization
<create-organization>`, toggle 
:guilabel:`Require IP Access List for {+admin-api+}`
to :guilabel:`OFF` when you :ref:`create an organization
<create-organization>`.

To set your organization to require IP access lists for every 
{+admin-api+} key after organization creation, follow these steps:

1. Log into |mms|.

#. Access the Organization using the :guilabel:`Context` picker in
   the top-left hand corner of the |mms| UI.

#. Click :guilabel:`Settings` from the left hand navigation.

#. Toggle the :guilabel:`Require IP Access List for {+admin-api+}`
   setting to :guilabel:`On`.

Manage Access to the API
------------------------

You can set API Keys for an entire organization or project.
