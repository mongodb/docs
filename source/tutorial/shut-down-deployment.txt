===========================
Shut Down MongoDB Processes
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can shut down selected :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
processes, or you can shut down all the processes at once for a
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set`. |mms| continues to monitor
the processes, and you can later :doc:`restart
</tutorial/restart-deployment>` them. If you no longer want |mms| to
monitor the processes, you can :doc:`remove them from monitoring
</tutorial/unmanage-deployment>`.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/shut-down-deployment.rst

Additional Information
----------------------

To restart processes after shutting them down, see
:doc:`/tutorial/restart-deployment`.

To remove processes from |mms| monitoring, see
:doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
