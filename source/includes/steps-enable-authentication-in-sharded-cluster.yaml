action:

      **Configuration File**

      If using a :doc:`configuration file

      set, start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``-keyFile``,
      ``--configsvr``, and ``--replSet`` parameters.

title: Create a Shard-Local User Administrator (Optional).
stepnum: 9
ref: shard-local-adduser
level: 4
pre: |
  .. important::
     The :ref:`localhost-exception` allows clients connected over the
     localhost interface to create users on a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
     enforcing access control. After creating the first user,
     the :ref:`localhost-exception` closes.

     The first user must have privileges to create other users, such
     as a user with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`. This ensures
     that you can create additional users after the :ref:`localhost-exception`
     closes.

     If at least one user does *not* have privileges to create users,
     once the localhost exception closes you may be unable to create
     or modify users with new privileges, and therefore unable to
     access certain functions or operations.

  For each shard replica set in the cluster, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell to the :term:`primary` member over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`. You must run the :binary:`~bin.mongo` on
  the same machine as the target :binary:`~bin.mongod` to use the localhost
  interface.

  Create a user with the ``userAdminAnyDatabase``
  role on the ``admin`` database. This user can create
  additional users for the shard replica set as necessary.
  Creating this user also closes the :ref:`localhost-exception`.

  The following example creates the shard-local user ``fred`` on the
  ``admin`` database.

  .. important::
     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
     and to prevent or delay malicious access.

  pre: |
