  From the :guilabel:`Replica Set Configuration` section, view the
  table under the :guilabel:`Replica Set Settings` heading. The
  :guilabel:`Process Name` column lists the hostname and port of each
  replica set member set. |mms| initially groups the processes under
  the replica set name. Click the :icon:`caret-right` icon to the left
  of the replica set name to list all members associated to the replica
  set.

  Configure the following settings for the
  :guilabel:`Process Name` that corresponds to the newly added member:

  1. From the :guilabel:`Deployment` view, click :guilabel:`Modify`. 
  #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Member Configuration` section.

     Removing the :term:`Primary` replica set member triggers
     an :manual:`election </core/replica-set-elections/>`. The
     replica set cannot process write operations until the election
     completes. For complete documentation on replica set elections,
     see :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`.

  Click :guilabel:`Save` to return to the :guilabel:`Deployment`
  screen. 

  Click :guilabel:`Review Changes` and then click
  :guilabel:`Confirm & Deploy`. |mms| converts the removed
  replica set member to a standalone cluster visible in the
  :guilabel:`Deployment` view.
