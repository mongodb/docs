.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: top

   The :dbcommand:`top` command returns raw usage of each database,
   and provides amount of time, in microseconds, used and a count of
   operations for the following event types:

   - total
   - readLock
   - writeLock
   - queries
   - getmore
   - insert
   - update
   - remove
   - commands

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { top: 1 }

.. dbcommand:: buildInfo

   The :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command returns a build summary for the current
   :program:`mongod`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { buildInfo: 1 }

    The information provided includes the following:

   - The version of MongoDB currently running.

   - The information about the system that built the
     ":program:`mongod`" binary, including a timestamp for the build.

   - The architecture of the binary (i.e. 64 or 32 bits.)

   - The maximum allowable :term:`BSON` object size in bytes (in the field ``maxBsonObjectSize``.)

   You must issue the :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command against the
   :term:`admin database`.
