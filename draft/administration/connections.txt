.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB is a database server. When you connect to MongoDB, MongoDB
creates a connection object. The connection object is instantiated once
and then reused for every operation during the lifetime of the
connection. This saves on the costs of setup and teardown on
connections.

You create a connection by starting the :program:`mongod` program.
The :program:`mongod` program then runs in the foreground or background
and waits for connections from the user.

When you start :program:`mongod`, MongoDB displays logging information
and then waits for a connection, as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: sh
