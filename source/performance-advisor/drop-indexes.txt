The Performance Advisor suggests dropping unused, redundant, and hidden 
indexes to improve write performance and increase storage space. 

.. seealso::

   To learn more about the impact of unnecessary indexes, see 
   :ref:`indexes-anti-pattern`.

Unused Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An index is unused if it doesn't support any queries.

The Performance Advisor flags an index as unused if it hasn't supported 
a query in 7 or more days after it was created or the server was 
restarted. 

.. note:: 

   The Performance Advisor inspects only the 20 most active 
   collections for unused indexes.

Redundant Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An index is redundant if another index supports any query that it could.

The Performance Advisor flags an index as redundant if it matches the 
prefix of another index in the same collection.

.. example::

   If a collection contains the indexes:

   - ``{ a: 1 }``
   - ``{ b: -1 }``
   - ``{ a: 1, b: -1 }``
   
   ``{ a: 1 }`` is redundant because it matches the prefix 
   ``{ a: 1, b: -1 }``.

   ``{ b: -1 }`` is not redundant because it does not match any prefix.

In the Performance Advisor, redundant indexes are marked with a red 
``Redundant`` badge. Below each redundant index, the Performance 
Advisor displays the related indexes that cover it.

.. note::
  
   Related indexes are displayed for you to verify that the redundant 
   index can be dropped safely. Related indexes are not recommended 
   for removal.

.. _hidden-indexes:

Hidden Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| doesn't use hidden indexes to support queries. 
They still impact write performance and consume storage space. To learn
more, see :manual:`Hidden Indexes </core/index-hidden/>`.

You can hide an index to evaluate the impact of dropping an 
index before you drop it. Unhiding an index also takes 
less time than rebuilding a dropped index. To hide and unhide an
index by using the {+atlas-ui+}, see :ref:`atlas-ui-indexes`.

The Performance Advisor always recommends dropping hidden indexes. 
If you determine that a hidden index is unnecessary, drop it.

.. note::
   
   The |service| Performance Advisor page displays hidden indexes from 
   your top 20 most active namespaces at the time you load the page. 
   If you have more than 20 namespaces, the Performance Advisor page might 
   not display all of your namespaces with hidden indexes.

Drop or Hide an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Consider :ref:`hiding indexes <hidden-indexes>` before you 
   drop them. |service| supports hidden indexes for
   MongoDB version 5.0 and higher.
