MongoDB Backup Service Tutorial
===============================

To get started with the MongoDB Backup Service, you need to:

- :ref:`register for the service <tutorial-register-backup-service>`, 

- :ref:`install the MongoDB Backup Service Agent
  <tutorial-install-backup-agent>`, and

- :ref:`enable the specific replica set(s) for backup
  <tutorial-enable-backup-for-replica-set>`.

Once you have set up the MongoDB Backup Service, you can:

- :ref:`restore from stored snapshots
  <tutorial-restore-from-stored-snapshot>` as well as

- :ref:`restore from any point in time within the last 24 hours
  <tutorial-restore-from-point-in-time>`.
