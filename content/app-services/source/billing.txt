Atlas App Services Apps are billed according to how much they're used on a
daily basis. There are four independently-measured usage types that determine
how much you pay each day:

- :ref:`App Services Requests <billing-requests>`, which measures the number of
  requests that App Services sends and receives from client
  applications and external services. Requests include function calls,
  trigger executions, and sync updates, but exclude user authentication
  and blocked or invalid requests.

- :ref:`App Services Compute <billing-compute>`, which measures the runtime and memory
  usage of all requests excluding sync and authentication.

- :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <billing-sync>`, which measures the total amount of time in
  which a client application is actively syncing.

- :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`, which measures the amount of
  data that App Services sends to external services and client applications.

.. note:: Track Your Usage
   
   You can track an application's usage for the current day from the
   application dashboard in the App Services UI.

Daily Free Tier
---------------

All App Services Apps in a MongoDB Atlas project share a single daily free
tier. All usage below the free tier thresholds in a given day is not billed.

Free Tier Thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services is free to use below the following daily free tier thresholds:

- 50,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>`
- 25 hours of :ref:`compute <billing-compute>`
- 30,000 minutes of :ref:`sync <billing-sync>` runtime
- 0.5 GB of :ref:`data transfer <billing-data-transfer>`

Invoicing and Payment
---------------------

App Services is billed as part of MongoDB Atlas. Invoices are sent monthly and
include all costs incurred from going over the daily free tier limits. 

All payment methods that work with Atlas can be used to pay for App Services, 
including prepaid Atlas Credits. Any costs associated with a linked Atlas data
source, such as database operations and backup, are billed separately
from App Services.

See :ref:`MongoDB Atlas Billing <atlas-billing>` for more information.

Usage Types
-----------

.. _billing-requests:

App Services Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services counts the number of requests that an application
receives and handles. Requests are billed at a set rate for each
request.

There are several types of requests:

- **Function Executions**, such as when a user calls a function from a client
  app, when a function calls an external service, or when a custom error 
  handler is invoked by a failed EventBridge trigger. If an executing function
  calls another function, App Services considers both executions as part of
  the same request.

- **Trigger Executions**, such as when a database trigger matches a change
  event, a scheduled trigger is configured to fire, or an authentication
  trigger responds to a user login. The request resulting from a trigger
  execution also includes all operations invoked by the trigger, including
  functions and EventBridge forwarding.

- **GraphQL Requests**, such as when a client application issues a
  GraphQL query operation or calls a custom resolver. (GraphQL is  
  deprecated. :ref:`Learn more <migrate-hosting-graphql>`) 

- **HTTPS Requests**, such as when an external service sends a notification
  event or interaction payload to an incoming webhook or HTTPS endpoint.

- **Sync Operations**, such as when a sync client uploads a :ref:`changeset
  <changesets>`, when App Services :ref:`resolves a conflict
  <operational-transformations>` in an uploaded changeset, or when
  App Services sends changesets to a connected sync client.
  
  For more information on sync operations, see :ref:`Atlas Device Sync Protocol
  <sync-protocol>`.

All incoming requests count toward your daily usage except for the
following:

- Requests to an authentication provider
- Requests blocked by an application's :ref:`IP Access List <manage-ip-access>`
- Requests to an invalid HTTP endpoint

.. _request-tier-pricing:

**Price:** $2.00 / 1,000,000 requests ($0.000002 / request)

**Formula:** (Function Executions + Trigger Executions + GraphQL/Webhook/HTTPS Endpoint Requests + Sync Updates) * $0.000002

**Free Tier Threshold:** 50,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>`, 25 hours of
:ref:`compute <billing-compute>`, and 30,000 minutes of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime 

.. example:: Estimate Your Usage
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the number of
   requests that your application will receive each day.
   
   **Triggers**
   
   - How many times does this trigger execute each day?
   
   **Functions/GraphQL**
   
   - How many requests do you receive each user session?
   - How many daily active users does your app have?
   - How many sessions does an average user open each day?
   
   **Atlas Device Sync Requests**
   
   - How many write operations do users issue each session?
   - How many updates do users receive each session?
   - How many devices or active users does your app have?

.. _billing-compute:

App Services Compute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services counts the total amount of time and memory that each non-sync
application request takes to process. Compute is billed at a set rate for each
millisecond of runtime. For large requests, this rate is multiplied by a factor
that reflects the amount of memory the request used.

The memory multiplier begins at 1 (i.e. it does not affect your billing rate)
and increases by 1 for every 32MB of memory that a given request uses.

**Price:** $10.00 / 500 runtime hours (~$0.000000005 / ms)

**Formula:** (Number of Requests) * (Runtime (ms)) * (Memory (MB) / 32MB) * $0.000000005 / ms

**Free Tier Threshold:** 50,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>`, 25 hours of
:ref:`compute <billing-compute>`, and 30,000 minutes of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime

.. example:: Estimate Your Usage
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   compute time that your application will use each day.
   
   **Runtime**

   - How many sessions does a user open each day?
   - How many requests do you receive each session?
   - How long does each request take?
   - What does each request do?
   - How many requests do you make to MongoDB Atlas or another service?
   - Does a request handle heavy data processing? 
   
   **Memory Usage**
   
   - How much in-memory data does your application process for each request?
   - How many MongoDB documents does a request affect?

.. _billing-sync:

Atlas Device Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services counts the total amount of time in which a client application
user has an active connection to the sync server even if they are not 
transferring data at the time. Sync is billed at a set rate for each 
millisecond of sync runtime per user.

**Price:** $0.08 / 1,000,000 runtime minutes ($0.00000008 / min)

**Formula:** (Number of Active Users) * (Sync Time (min / user)) * ($0.00000008 / min)

**Free Tier Threshold:** 50,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>`, 25 hours of
:ref:`compute <billing-compute>`, and 30,000 minutes of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime 

Device Sync pauses automatically after {+sync-inactive-app-pause-time+} 
of inactivity.

.. example:: Estimate Your Usage
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   sync time that your application will use each day.

   **Sync Sessions**
   
   - How many daily active users does your app have?
   - How much time is an average user online each day?

.. _billing-data-transfer:

Data Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services measures the total amount of data that your application sends
out to client applications and external services. Data transfer is billed at a
set rate for each gigabyte of data egress.

**Price:** $0.12 per GB

**Formula:** (Data Sent to Clients/Services (GB)) * ($0.12 / GB)

**Free Tier Threshold:** 10 GB

.. note:: MongoDB Atlas Data Transfer

  Data transfer from a linked MongoDB Atlas data source to App Services is billed as
  an Atlas Data Egress charge. To learn more about Atlas
  egress rates, read the :atlas:`Data Transfer </billing/data-transfer-costs/>`
  billing documentation.

.. example:: Estimate Your Usage
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   data that your application will transfer each day.
   
   **Data Transfer**
   
   - How many updates/requests does an average user issues each day? 
   - How much data is sent to users per update/request?
   - How often is data sent to external services?
   - How much data might be sent in each external service call?

Examples
--------

Mobile Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A group messaging application uses App Services to manage permissions and sync
messages between users in the same group. The app has the following usage:

- There are around 2,000 active group chats in any given day.

- The average group chat has 4 users that each send around 20 messages each
  day.

- Messages are usually small but may contain up to 2KB of data.

- The average user has the app open for about 1 hour each day.

The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for
one day:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Usage Type
     - Calculation
   
   * - :ref:`App Services Requests <billing-requests>`
     - - (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (20 messages / user) = 160,000 messages
       
       - (160,000 messages) * ((1 write + 3 reads) / message) = 640,000 requests
       
       - (640,000 requests) - (50,000 free tier requests) = 590,000 requests

       - (590,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = **$1.18**
   
   * - :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <billing-sync>`
     - - (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (1 hr / user) = 8000 active hrs
       
       - (8000 active hrs) * (60 mins / hr)  - (30,000 free tier minutes) = 450,000 active min

       - (450,000 active min) * ($0.00000008 / min) = **$0.036**
   
   * - :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`
     - - (160,000 messages) * (3 reads / message) = 480,000 reads
       
       - (480,000 reads) * (0.000002 GB / read) = 0.96 GB
       
       - (0.96 GB) - (0.5 free tier GB) =  0.46 GB

       - (0.46 GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = **$0.0552**

   * - **TOTAL**
     - $1.18 (requests) + $0.036 (sync) + $0.0552 (data transfer) = **$1.27 for the day**

.. note:: Free Tier Usage
   
   The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption
   each day. Consumption can look different on any individual day.
   
   The app would hit the requests, sync, and data transfer free tier thresholds.  
   
   The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:
   
   - **App Services Requests:** 50,000 requests
   - **Atlas Device Sync:** 30,000 minutes
   - **Data Transfer:** 0.5 GB

Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A hardware store uses a web application that allows customers to browse and
order items online. The app uses Atlas Functions to fetch
items based on a user's search, get detailed information for specific items, and
submit orders. The app has the following usage:

- There are around 3,000 visitors each day.

- An average visitor performs 2 searches, looks at 10 items, and submits an
  order 20% of the time.

- Search results, item data, and order requests contain 4KB or less.

The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for
one day:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Usage Type
     - Calculation

   * - :ref:`App Services Requests <billing-requests>`
     - - (2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor = 12.2 requests / visitor
       
       - (12.2 requests / visitor) * (3,000 visitors) = 36,600 requests

       - (36,600 requests) - (50,000 free tier requests) =  0 requests
       
       - (0 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = **FREE**

   * - :ref:`App Services Compute <billing-compute>`
     - - (3,000 visitors) * ((2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor) = 36,600 requests
       
       - (36,600 requests) * (100 ms / request) * 1 = 3,660,000 ms
         
         - *100 ms is a conservative runtime estimate for lightweight functions*
         - *4KB is well under 32MB, so the memory multiplier is 1*
       
       - (3,660,000 ms) - (90,000,000 free tier ms) = 0 ms
       
       - (0 ms) * ($0.000000005 / ms) = **FREE**

   * - :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`
     - - (36,600 requests) * (0.000002 GB / request) = 0.073 GB
       
       - (0.073 GB) - (0.50 free tier GB) = 0 GB
       
       - (0 GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = **FREE**

   * - **TOTAL**
     - $0 (requests) + $0 (compute) + $0 (data transfer) = **$0 for the day**

.. note:: Free Tier Usage

   The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption
   each day. Consumption can look different on any individual day.
   
   In this situation, the free tier covers all App Services expenses for the App.
   The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:
   
   - **App Services Requests:** 36,600 requests
   - **App Services Compute:** 1.02 hours
   - **Data Transfer:** 0.073 GB

Backend Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An international pizza chain uses App Services to handle orders for all of its
restaurants. The app has the following usage:

- The chain has 18,000 stores, and each store gets about 400 orders each day.

- The stores are in operation for 16 hours each day.

- For each order, a database trigger sends the customer an email receipt.
  Another trigger sends text message updates to the customer when their order is
  received, when it's sent out for delivery, and when it's about to be
  delivered.

- A scheduled trigger runs every 5 minutes to monitor delivery times. If a
  delivery is taking too long, it sends a text message update to the user. About
  10% of all deliveries take too long.

- Orders vary in size but are no larger than 4KB.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Usage Type
     - Calculation

   * - :ref:`App Services Requests <billing-requests>`
     - - (18,000 stores) * (400 orders / store) = 7,200,000 orders
       
       - (7,200,000 orders) * ((1 email + 3.10 texts + 3 scheduled triggers) / order) = 51,120,000 requests
       
       - (51,120,000 requests) - (50,000 free tier requests) = 51,070,000 requests

       - (51,070,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = **$102.14**

   * - :ref:`App Services Compute <billing-compute>`
     - - (51,120,000 requests) * (300 ms / request) * 1 =  15,336,000,000 ms
         
         - *300 ms is a runtime estimate for the trigger function. To get a
           better estimate, create a POC function and test how long it takes to
           connect to external services, etc.*
         - *4KB is well under 32MB, so the memory multiplier is 1*
       
       - (15,336,000,000 ms) - (90,000,000 free tier ms) = 15,246,000,000 ms

       - (15,246,000,000 ms) * ($0.000000005 / ms) = **$76.23**

   * - :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`
     - - (51,120,000 requests) * (0.000004 GB / request) = 204.48 GB
       
       - (204.48 GB) - (0.50 free tier GB) = 203.98 GB
       
       - (203.98 GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = **$24.48**

   * - **TOTAL**
     - $102.14 (requests) + $76.23 (compute) + $24.48 (data transfer) = **$202.85 for the day**

.. note:: Free Tier Usage

   The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption
   each day. Consumption can look different on any individual day.
   
   This is an example of a larger app with many users and a larger workload. 
   The app would hit the requests, compute, and data transfer free tier thresholds.

   The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:
   
   - **App Services Requests:** 50,000 requests
   - **App Services Compute:** 25 hours
   - **Data Transfer:** 0.5 GB
