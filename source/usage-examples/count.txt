Count Documents
===============

You can count the number of documents in a collection by calling one of
the following methods on a ``Collection`` instance:

- `count_documents() <{+api+}/struct.Collection.html#method.count_documents>`__:
  counts the number of documents that match a query filter. To learn
  more about creating query filters, see the :ref:`rust-query-guide`
  guide.

- `estimated_document_count() <{+api+}/struct.Collection.html#method.estimated_document_count>`__:
  estimates the total number of documents in a collection by using
  collection metadata.

Each method returns the count as a ``u64`` instance.

.. note::
   
   If you don't pass a filter to the ``count_documents()`` method,
   MongoDB counts the total number of documents in the collection.

Example
-------

This example counts documents in the ``restaurants`` collection of the
``sample_restaurants`` database. The example uses the ``estimated_document_count()`` method
to count the total number of documents in the collection. Then, the
example uses the ``count_documents()`` method to count the number of
documents in which the value of the ``name`` field includes the string ``"Sunset"``.

You can access the documents in the ``restaurants`` collection as instances
of the ``Document`` type or a custom data type. To specify which data type represents
the collection's data, replace the ``<T>`` type parameter on the highlighted
line with one of the following values:

- ``<Document>``: Represents collection documents as BSON documents
- ``<Restaurant>``: Represents collection documents as instances of the ``Restaurant``
  struct, defined at the top of the code
