If authentication is enabled, a user must have extraordinary access to run
|eval-object|. Providing such access is not recommended, but if your
organization requires a user to run |eval-object|, create a role that
grants :authaction:`anyAction` on :ref:`resource-anyresource`. Do not
assign this role to any other user.
