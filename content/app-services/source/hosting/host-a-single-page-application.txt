Overview
--------

Many web applications built with modern frameworks, like React, Vue, and
Angular, are single-page applications (SPAs) that dynamically handle
routing and rendering client-side instead of fetching each rendered page
from the server. You can use Atlas App Services to host your SPA and serve it to
clients.

To host your app, you need to specify that it's a SPA in App Services. By
default, App Services handles requests for a given resource by returning the
file hosted at the specified resource path or a 404 if no file matches
the path. However, SPAs render in a single, specific HTML file so all
requests should return that file regardless of the requested resource
path.

This guide covers how you can configure App Services Hosting to redirect all
resource requests to a single file to support the SPA pattern.

         .. step:: Upload Your Built Application to App Services

            Single-page applications render in a single, specific HTML file,
            typically ``/index.html``. The file should include the necessary
            JavaScript code to wire up and render your application, either inline
            in a ``<script>`` tag or imported from an external file. You'll also
            need to host any resources that you don't intend to access through a
            CDN.

            When you are ready to host your SPA, run your application's build
            script and then :doc:`upload the build folder
            </hosting/upload-content-to-app-services>` to App Services.


         .. step:: Configure App Services to Serve Your Application

            Once you've started hosting your application files, you can
            immediately access your SPA by requesting the root HTML file directly.
            However, a request to any path other than the root file will return a
            404. This can break the expected behavior of a SPA that uses a
            client-side router or otherwise relies on the URL path.

            To configure App Services to serve the SPA's root page for all requests:

            1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Hosting` page in the App Services UI and then
               click the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

            2. Ensure that you have not specified a custom 404 page. If custom 404
               is enabled, click the trash can icon (:icon-fa5:`trash-alt`) next
               to the specified 404 page.

            3. Next to :guilabel:`Single Page Application`, click :guilabel:`Choose
               File`. Choose the root HTML file for your SPA and then click
               :guilabel:`Select`.

            4. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To configure a single-page application with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a local copy
            of your application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Add Your Built Application Code

            Single-page applications render in a single, specific HTML file,
            typically ``/index.html``. The file should include the necessary
            JavaScript code to wire up and render your application, either inline
            in a ``<script>`` tag or imported from an external file. You'll also
            need to host any resources that you don't intend to access through a
            CDN.

            When you are ready to host your SPA, run your application's build
            script and then copy the output build folder into the
            ``/hosting/files`` directory of your application directory.


         .. step:: Configure App Services to Serve Your Application

            In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``default_response_code`` to ``200`` and set
            ``default_error_path`` to the :ref:`resource path <hosting-resource-path>` of
            your SPA's root HTML file. Make sure to save the file when you're done.

            .. code-block:: json
               :caption: hosting/config.json

               {
                 "enabled": true,
                 "default_response_code": 200,
                 "default_error_path": "/index.html",
               }


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Hosting Configuration

            Once you've updated and saved ``hosting/config.json`` you can push the updated
            config to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately supports your SPA on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>" --include-hosting
