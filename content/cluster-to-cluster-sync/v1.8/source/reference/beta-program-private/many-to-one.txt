Many-to-One Migrations

Syntax 
------

To sync multiple source clusters with one destination cluster, run the following 
commands when starting :ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>`: 

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/beta-program-private/many-to-one/1.sh
   :language: shell

To start the sync operation between the source clusters and the
destination cluster, see :ref:`c2c-quickstart-synchronize`.

When beginning your sync operation for a many-to-one migration, add
the following parameter to the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` requests: 

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/beta-program-private/many-to-one/1.txt
   :language: text

Setting ``"destinationDataHandling"`` to ``"ignorePreExistingNamespaces"`` 
allows each migration to write to the destination cluster that may have 
pre-existing namespaces from the other many-to-one migrations.

Behavior 
--------

A namespace is a ``database_name.collection_name`` combination. You can only 
sync namespaces that don't conflict. 
   
For example, consider this scenario:

- Two source clusters S1 and S2.
- A destination cluster D.
- Databases named ``inventory`` and ``sales`` on both S1 and S2.
- Collections named ``products``, ``orderLines``, ``orderStatus``, and 
  ``orders`` on both S1 and S2.
- You can sync both of these combinations:
  
  - ``inventory.products`` and ``sales.orderStatus`` on S1 with D.
  - ``inventory.orderLines`` and ``sales.orders`` on S2 with D.

- You cannot sync both of these combinations because they conflict:

  - ``inventory.products`` and ``inventory.orderLines`` on S1 with D. If D is 
    initially empty, you can sync S1 with D. ``inventory.products`` and 
    ``inventory.orderLines`` are copied from S1 to D.
  - ``inventory.products`` and ``inventory.orderLines`` on S2 with D. You cannot 
    sync S2 with D because ``inventory.products`` and ``inventory.orderLines`` 
    conflict with the namespaces already on D from the scenario in the previous 
    point.

Migration Name

.. _c2c-beta-many-to-one-example: 

Example 
-------

The following example connects source clusters running on port ``27000``
and ``27001`` with a destination cluster running on port ``35000``. The command 
also sets the ``--migrationName`` option to describe the operations and store 
migration metadata for each sync.

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/beta-program-private/many-to-one/2.sh
