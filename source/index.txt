The MongoDB {+osb+} allows you to deploy
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas <getting-started>` clusters with any platform
that supports the
`Open Service Broker API <https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/>`__,
such as :k8sdocs:`Kubernetes </home>`. The broker uses
:atlas:`Atlas Public API <reference/api-resources>` endpoints to
deploy replica set and sharded cluster deployments that |service|
manages. By integrating with the {+osb+}, cloud-native platforms can
fully automate the deployment and management of MongoDB |service|
clusters.

You provide the {+osb+} with the specifications for your MongoDB
cluster. The {+osb+} uses this information to tell |k8s| how to
configure that cluster including provisioning storage, setting up the
network connections, and configuring database users.
