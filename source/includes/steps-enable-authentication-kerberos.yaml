title: "Configure {{mechanism}} for the Agents."
content: |

  You can enable more than one authentication mechanism for your
  MongoDB deployment, but the |mms| Agents can only use *one*
  authentication mechanism. Select {{mechanism}} to connect to your
  MongoDB deployment.

  a. Select {{mechanism}} from the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism`
     drop-down menu.

  b. Enter Agent Credentials for the appropriate operating system: 

     .. tip::

        Only configure the Agents or functions you installed. For
        example, if you did not install {+bagent+}, do not configure
        {+bagent+}.

     If using Linux, configure:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting
          - Value

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Kerberos Principal`
          - The Kerberos Principal.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Keytab Path`
          - The path for the Agent's Keytab.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> LDAP Group DN`
          - Enter the Distinguished Name for the Agent's LDAP Group.

            The LDAP Group DN is then created as a role in MongoDB to
            grant the Agent the appropriate privileges.

            .. note::

               You only need to provide the Agent's LDAP Group DN if
               you use LDAP Authorization.

     If using Windows, configure:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting
          - Value

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Username`
          - The Active Directory user name.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Password`
          - The Active Directory password.

        * - :guilabel:`Domain`
          - The NetBIOS name of a domain in Active Directory Domain
            Services. Must be in all capital letters.

  c. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
