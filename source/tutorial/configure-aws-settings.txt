===================================
Configure MMS to Deploy AWS Servers
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If you have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you can configure MMS to
deploy EC2 servers to that account directly from the MMS interface. MMS
integrates with AWS to deploy EC2 instances that come with Automation
Agents pre-installed.

Considerations
--------------

If you attempt to provision larger AWS instances, be aware that Amazon
often has a limited number of larger instances in any given region, which
may prevent provisioning.

AWS accounts have restrictions that limit the number of instances you can
deploy. If you reach this limit, you must contact AWS support to raise
this limit.

.. LOCATION NO LONGER VALID: If you reach this limit MMS will
   provide an error message in the :guilabel:`Provision Machines
   Table`, which is located in the :guilabel:`Automation` tab's
   :guilabel:`Provisioning` page.

Prerequisites
-------------

Access Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~

You must provide the following keys when configuring AWS settings:

- The AWS account's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. To access the
  keys, click your username in the top right corner of AWS and select
  *Security Credentials*.

- An SSH public key for the computer that accesses MMS. When you
  :doc:`provision a server </tutorial/provision-aws-servers>`, AWS uses
  this key to create a shared private key, allowing you to connect to the
  server through SSH.

User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWS user associated with the access keys must have an attached IAM
policy with the permissions described in
:doc:`/reference/required-permissions-aws-user`. Without adequate
permissions, the user cannot provision AWS servers from MMS. This tutorial
includes a :ref:`procedure for setting these permissions
<configure-aws-permissions>`.

.. _security-group:

Security Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWS account must have at least one security group configured. At
minimum, the security group must have the following inbound rules:

- A custom TCP rule on all MongoDB ports that allows traffic from any
  member of the security group.

- An SSH rule on the SSH port, usually 22, and that allows traffic from
  all IPs.

Optionally, add additional rules to your security group as needed. For
example, to grant access to MongoDB from hosts in another security group,
add a custom TCP rule that specifies the MongoDB ports and the other
security group. To grant access from a specific IP address, such as the IP
address for a specific office, add a custom TCP rule that specifies the
MongoDB ports and the specific IP address.

VPC
~~~

If you are deploying into a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), the VPC must
exist before provisioning. If you are using a VPC that you created and not
a default AWS VPC, make sure that:

- The VPC property ``DNS hostname`` is ``yes``, which
  guarantees that each instance provisioned in the VPC receives a
  hostname.

- For all subnets created, that after clicking the ``Modify
  auto-assigned public IP`` button in the console, that the ``Enable
  auto-assign Public IP`` box is checked.

Procedures

Configure Permissions for the AWS User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWS user must have an attached IAM policy with certain :doc:`minimum
permissions </reference/required-permissions-aws-user>`. Use the
following procedure to set these permissions. Also consider the `AWS
Documentation`_ for the most current information on AWS processes.
