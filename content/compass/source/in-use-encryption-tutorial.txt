In-Use Encryption allows you to connect to your deployments using 
:v7.0:`{+qe+} </core/queryable-encryption/>`. This connection method
allows you to encrypt a subset of fields in your collections. 

You can also use :manual:`CSFLE </core/csfle/>` to encrypt a subset of fields 
in your collection. CSFLE encryption is enabled through the schema editor.

Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to connect to your deployment and collections using 
{+qe+}. 

This guide uses the `air_airlines.json <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/compass/air_airlines.json>`__
data set in the guided examples. The guide covers the process of importing 
your data set. 

Requirements and Limitations
----------------------------

- In-Use Encryption is an Enterprise/Atlas only feature. 

- You need a replica set to use this connection option. Your replica set can be 
  a single node or larger.

- You need to connect to your deployment on Compass using In-Use Encryption. For 
  more information on how to connect to your deployment, see :ref:`In-Use Encryption 
  Connection tab <in-use-encryption-tab>`.

Create Your Encrypted Collection
--------------------------------

Once your deployment is connected using In-Use Encryption, create your collection 
using {+qe+}. You can create a new database and collection or you 
can create a new collection in an existing database.

{+qe+} supports new collections only. You can't enable {+qe+} 
on existing collections.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Create a Database` button or the 
      :guilabel:`Create a Collection` button. 

      Enter the name of the database and/or collection.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Additional preferences` drop down. 

   .. step:: Check the :guilabel:`{+qe+}` box.

   .. step:: Specify your :guilabel:`Encrypted Fields`. 

      Change the ``path`` field value from ``encryptedField`` to the 
      name of the field you want encrypted. 

      .. figure:: /images/compass/example-encrypted-field.png
         :figwidth: 450px
         :alt: Encrypted Field Name 

      Here, the encrypted field is the ``base`` field of the ``air_airlines`` 
      data set.  

      For more information, see :v7.0:`Encrypted Fields </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/encrypt-and-query/>`.

   .. step:: (Optional) Specify :v7.0:`KMS Provider </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/kms-providers/>`.  

   .. step:: (Optional) Specify :v7.0:`Key Encryption Key </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/keys-key-vaults/>`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Database` or :guilabel:`Create Collection`.

Import Your Data
----------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click on your collection on the left-hand navigation banner.

      The collection has a :guilabel:`{+qe+}` badge next to 
      its name to indicate that fields in that collection are encrypted.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add Data`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Import File`.

   .. step:: Select File and Input File Type.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Import`.

      Your imported collection is displayed in the document view. The specified 
      encrypted field is marked by a key symbol next to the value.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/encrypted-field.png
         :figwidth: 400 px
         :alt: Encrypted Field 

      Here, the ``base`` field is marked with the key symbol.

Enable and Disable In-Use Encryption
------------------------------------

You can enable and disable In-Use Encryption in your deployment. 

When In-Use Encryption is **enabled**:

- You can modify encrypted values.

- You can insert documents and specified fields will be encrypted.

When In-Use Encryption is **disabled**:

- You cannot modify encrypted values. |compass-short| displays the values 
  of these fields as a series of asterisks.

- Inserted documents can not encrypt fields. 

Disable In-Use Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable In-Use Encryption:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click on :guilabel:`In-Use Encryption` on left-hand navigation bar.

     .. figure:: /images/compass/qe-connection-button.png
        :figwidth: 300 px
        :alt: In-Use Encryption Connection button

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Enable In-Use Encryption for this connection` 
      toggle.

      Disabling In-Use Encryption only affects how |compass-short| accesses your 
      data.
