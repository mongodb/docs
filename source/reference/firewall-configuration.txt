Accessible Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |application| must be able to connect to users and MongoDB
Agents over |http| or |https|. MongoDB Agents must be able to
connect to MongoDB client MongoDB databases.

Though |mms| only requires open |http| (or |https|) and MongoDB
network ports to connect with users and to databases, what ports are
opened on a firewall depend upon what capabilities are enabled:
encryption, authentication and monitoring.

This page defines which systems need to connect to which ports on
other systems.
