Read Concern ``"majority"``

For read operations not associated with :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"``
guarantees that the data read has been acknowledged by a majority of
the replica set members (i.e. the documents read are durable and
guaranteed not to roll back).

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.

Performance
-----------

Each replica set member maintains, in memory, a view of the data at the
majority-commit point; the majority-commit point is calculated by the
primary. To fulfill read concern ``"majority"``, the node returns data
from this view and is comparable in performance cost to other read
concerns.

Availability
------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for use with or
without causally consistent sessions and transactions.

You can disable read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` for a deployment
with a three-member primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture;
however, this has implications for change streams (in MongoDB 4.0 and
earlier only) and transactions on sharded clusters. For more
information, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.
            
Example

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.

Storage Engine Support
----------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is available for the
WiredTiger storage engine.

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

Read Concern ``"majority"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

.. note:: 

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level. To set the read concern for
   transactions, see :ref:`transactions-read-concern`.

For operations in :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, read concern ``"majority"`` provides its
guarantees only if the transaction commits with :ref:`write concern
"majority" <transactions-write-concern>`. Otherwise, the
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern provides no guarantees about the
data read in transactions.

Disable Read Concern Majority
-----------------------------

*For 3-Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Architecture*
   
You can disable read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` if you have a
three-member replica set with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA)
architecture or a sharded cluster with a three-member PSA shards.

.. note::
 
   If you are using a deployment other than a 3-member PSA, you do not
   need to disable read concern majority.

With a three-member PSA architecture, the cache pressure will increase
if any data bearing node is down. To prevent the storage cache pressure
from immobilizing a deployment with a PSA architecture, you can disable
read concern by setting either:

- :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern <mongod
  --enableMajorityReadConcern>` command line option to ``false``.

- :setting:`replication.enableMajorityReadConcern` configuration file
  setting to ``false``.

To check if read concern "majority" is disabled, You can run
:method:`db.serverStatus()` on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and
check the :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field.
If ``false``, read concern "majority" is disabled.

.. important::

   In general, avoid disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern
   unless necessary. However, if you have a three-member replica set
   with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded
   cluster with a three-member PSA shard, disable to prevent the
   storage cache pressure from immobilizing the deployment.
