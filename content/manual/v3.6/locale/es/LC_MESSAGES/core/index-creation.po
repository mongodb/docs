msgid ""
"By default, creating an index on a populated collection blocks all other "
"operations on a database. When building an index on a populated "
"collection, the database that holds the collection is unavailable for "
"read or write operations until the index build completes. Any operation "
"that requires a read or write lock on all databases (e.g. "
":command:`listDatabases`) will wait for the foreground index build to "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/index-creation.txt:60
msgid ""
"Background indexing operations run in the background so that other "

"If MongoDB is building an index in the background, you cannot perform "
"other administrative operations involving that collection, including "
"running :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, dropping the collection (i.e. "
":method:`db.collection.drop()`), and running :dbcommand:`compact`. These "
"operations will return an error during background index builds."

msgid "Performance"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/index-creation.txt:82
msgid ""
"The background index operation uses an incremental approach that is "
"slower than the normal \"foreground\" index builds. If the index is "
"larger than the available RAM, then the incremental process can take "
"*much* longer than the foreground build."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/index-creation.txt:87

"Building an index can have a severe impact on the performance of the "
"database. If possible, build indexes during designated maintenance "
"windows."

msgid ""
"You can build one or more indexes on a collection with the database "
"command :dbcommand:`createIndexes`. The default limit on memory usage for"
" a :dbcommand:`createIndexes` operation is 500 megabytes. You can "
"override this limit by setting the "
":parameter:`maxIndexBuildMemoryUsageMegabytes` server parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-index-build-default-memory-limit.rst:7
msgid ""
":dbcommand:`createIndexes` uses a combination of memory and temporary "
"files on disk to complete index builds. Once the memory limit is reached,"
" :dbcommand:`createIndexes` uses temporary disk files in a subdirectory "
"named ``_tmp`` within the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` directory "
"for additional scratch space. The higher the memory limit is set, the "
"faster the index build can complete, but be careful not to set this limit"
" too high relative to available RAM or your system can run out of free "
"memory."
