Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $sample

   Randomly selects the specified number of documents from the
   input documents.

   :pipeline:`$sample` stage syntax: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $sample: { size: <positive integer N> } }

   ``N`` is the number of documents to randomly select.
   Set ``N`` to an integer greater than or equal to ``1``.

Behavior
--------

If all of the following conditions are true, :pipeline:`$sample` uses a
pseudo-random cursor to select the ``N`` documents:

- :pipeline:`$sample` is the first stage of the pipeline.
- ``N`` is less than 5% of the total documents in the collection.

  .. note:: 

     You can't configure the threshold that :pipeline:`$sample` uses to
     determine when to scan the entire collection. The thresholds is 5%.
     If the size is greater than 5% of the total number of documents in
     the collection, :pipeline:`$sample` performs a 
     :ref:`top-k <sort-limit-results>` sort by a generated random value.
     The top-k sort could spill to disk if the sample documents are
     larger than 100MB. 

- The collection contains more than 100 documents.

If any of the previous conditions are false, :pipeline:`$sample`:

- Reads all documents that are output from a preceding aggregation
  stage or a collection scan.
- Performs a random sort to select ``N`` documents. Random sorts are 
  subject to the :ref:`sort memory restrictions <sort-memory-limit>`.

  .. note::

     :ref:`Views <views-landing-page>` are the result of aggregation 
     pipelines. When you use ``$sample`` on a view, MongoDB appends the stage
     to the end of the view's aggregation pipeline syntax. Therefore, the 
     ``$sample`` stage on a view is never the first stage and always 
     results in a collection scan.

If you use ``$sample`` in a :term:`sharded cluster`, each shard performs
the sample operation independently. :binary:`~bin.mongos` samples
the merged result of each shard's sample operation and returns the
requested number of documents.

Example
--------

This section shows an aggregation pipeline example that uses the 
following ``users`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertMany( [
      { _id : 1, name : "dave123", q1 : true, q2 : true },
      { _id : 2, name : "dave2", q1 : false, q2 : false  },
      { _id : 3, name : "ahn", q1 : true, q2 : true  },
      { _id : 4, name : "li", q1 : true, q2 : false  },
      { _id : 5, name : "annT", q1 : false, q2 : true  },
      { _id : 6, name : "li", q1 : true, q2 : true  },
      { _id : 7, name : "ty", q1 : false, q2 : true  }
   ] )

The following aggregation operation randomly selects ``3`` documents from the
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
      [ { $sample: { size: 3 } } ]
   )

The operation returns three random documents.
