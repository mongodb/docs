Overview
--------

To evaluate |onprem|, you can install the
:ref:`mms-application-package` and
:ref:`mms-application-database` on a single server. This setup provides
all the functionality of |onprem| monitoring and automation but
provides **no** failover or high availability.

Unlike a production installation, the simple test installation uses
only one :program:`mongod` for the |application| database. In
production, the database requires a dedicated :term:`replica set`.

This procedure includes optional instructions to activate the Backup
feature, in which case you would install :ref:`backup-database` on the
same server as the other |onprem| components. The backup database uses
only one :program:`mongod` and not a dedicated replica set, as it would
in production.

This procedure installs the test deployment on servers running either
**RHEL 6+** or **Amazon Linux**.
