Start and Stop MongoDB
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB runs as a standard program. You can start MongoDB from a command
line by issuing the :program:`mongod` command and specifying options.
Fora list of options, see :doc:`/reference/mongod`. MongoDB can also run
as a Windows service. For details, see
:ref:`tutorial-mongod-as-windows-service`. To install MongoDB, see
:doc:`/installation`.

The following examples assume the directory containing the
:program:`mongod` process is included in your system paths. The
:program:`mongod` process is the primary database process that runs on
an individual server. The sharding process is the :program:`mongos`
process. The administrative shell is run by the :program:`mongo`
process.

This page discusses the :program:`mongod` process.

Start ``mongod``
----------------

In default mode, MongoDB stores data in the ``/data/db`` directory. On
Windows MongoDB stores data in ``C:\data\db``. On all platforms, MongoDB
listens by default on port ``27017``.

To start MongoDB in default mode, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

Specify a Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you specify a data directory, the directory must already exist. If
it does not, create it and set its permissions appropriately.

To specify a data directory when starting MongoDB, use the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option. The following command
starts :program:`mongod` and stores data in the ``/var/lib/mongodb/``
directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb/

Specify a TCP Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run several :program:`mongod` processes on a single machine, you
must assign each a different port to listen on for client connections.
Only one can listen on the default port of ``27017``.

To specify the port, use the ``--port`` option. The following command
starts :program:`mongod` listening on port ``12345``:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 12345

Use the default port number whenever possible, to avoid any confusion.

If you use the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` or
:option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>` options, those options select an
appropriate port number automatically.

Run ``mongod`` as a Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To fork the :program:`mongod` process *and* redirect its output to a log
file, use the :option:`--fork <mongod --fork>` and :option:`--logpath <mongod
--logpath>` options. You must create the log directory ahead of time.
However, you need not create the log file. MongoDB will create the log
file if it does not exist.

The following command runs :program:`mongod` as a daemon and records log
output to ``/var/log/mongodb.log``. The command also uses the
:option:`--logappend <mongod --logappend>` option to ensure that
:program:`mongod` appends new entries to the end of the log file rather
than overwriting the content when the process restarts:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongodb.log --logappend

Additional Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an overview of common configurations and examples of best-practice
configurations for common use cases, see
:doc:`/administration/configuration`.

Stop ``mongod``
---------------

To stop a :program:`mongod` instance that is running in the foreground,
press ``Control+C``. MongoDB stops when all ongoing operations are
complete and does a clean exit, flushing and closing all data files.

To stop a :program:`mongod` instance running in the background or foreground,
issue the :method:`shutdownServer() <db.shutdownServer()>` method. Use the following sequence:

1. To open the :program:`mongo` shell for a :program:`mongod` instance
   running on the default port of ``27017``, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. To switch to the ``admin`` database and shutdown the :program:`mongod`
   instance, issue the following commands:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.shutdownServer()

This command works only from ``localhost`` or if the user is
authenticated.

Alternately, you can shut down the :program:`mongod` instance:

- using the :option:`--shutdown` option

- from a driver using the :dbcommand:`shutdown`. For details, see the
  :doc:`drivers documentation </applications/drivers>` for your driver.

``mongod`` Shutdown and Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :program:`mongod` is the :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica
set`, the :program:`mongod` will go through the following process:

1. Check how up-to-date the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` are.

#. If no secondary is within 10 seconds of the primary,
   :program:`mongod` will return a message that it will not shut down.
   You can pass the the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command a ``timeoutSecs``
   argument to wait for a secondary to catch up.

#. If there is a secondary within 10 seconds of the primary, the primary
   will step down and wait for the secondary to catch up.

#. After 60 seconds or once the secondary has caught up, the primary
   will shut down.

If there is no up-to-date secondary and you want the primary to shut
down, issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command with the ``force``
argument, as show in the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, force : true})

To keep checking the secondaries for a specified number of seconds if
none are immediately up-to-date, issue :dbcommand:`shutdown` with the
``timeoutSecs`` argument. MongoDB will keep checking the secondaries for
the specified number of seconds if none are immediately up-to-date. If
any of the secondaries catch up within the allotted time, the primary
will shut down. If no secondaries catch up, it will not shut down.

The following command issues :dbcommand:`shutdown` with ``timeoutSecs``
set to ``5``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({shutdown : 1, timeoutSecs : 5})

Alternately you can use the ``timeoutSecs`` argument with the
:method:`shutdownServer() <db.shutdownServer()>` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shutdownServer({timeoutSecs : 5})

Sending a UNIX INT or TERM Signal
---------------------------------

You can cleanly stop :program:`mongod` using a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal
on UNIX-like systems. Either ``^C``, ``kill -2 PID``, or ``kill -15
PID`` will work.

Sending ``kill -9`` will probably cause damage if :program:`mongod` is
not running with :term:`journaling <journal>`.

To recover data if MongoDB does not shut down cleanly and if
:term:`journaling <journal>` is disabled, see
:doc:`/tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown`.

Memory Usage
------------

MongoDB uses memory-mapped files to access data, which results in large
numbers being displayed in tools like ``top`` for the :program:`mongod`
process. This is not a concern and is normal when using memory-mapped
files. The size of mapped data is shown in the virtual size parameter.
Resident bytes shows how much data is being cached in RAM.

You can get a feel for the "inherent" memory footprint of MongoDB by
starting it fresh, with no connections, with an empty ``/data/db``
directory and looking at the resident bytes.
