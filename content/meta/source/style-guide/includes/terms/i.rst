   internet
     **Internet**
     **intranet**
     Capitalize *Internet* when referring to the world’s largest
     computer network; use lowercase letters when referring

     that are connected by routers. The World Wide Web is part of the
     Internet.

     .. note::
        An *intranet* is a network that usually uses applications that
        are associated with the Internet (such as web pages and an
        e-mail system), but the network is accessible only to people
        within a given company or organization.

   its
     **it's**
     *Its* is the possessive form of *it*. *It's* is the contraction
     of *it is*. To avoid confusion and mistakes, use *it is* instead
     of *it's*, or revise the sentence to eliminate *it's* or *it
     is*, which can lead to wordiness or ambiguity.
