  Follow the procedure in :ref:`Stop a Replica Set <stop-replica-set>`
  to confirm that replica set members are 
  :ref:`shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`.

  .. warning::
     
     This step requires downtime as all replica members will need to be 
     shut down.

title: Rename the replica set.

ref: rename-the-replica-set
content: |
  Perform the following steps for each replica set member:
  
  a. Update the replica set name. 

     - If using a :ref:`configuration file <conf-file>`, set 
       :setting:`replication.replSetName <replication.replSetName>` 
       to the new name. 

     - If using the :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command with 
       the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option, note down the 
       new replica set name for use in step f.
  
  #. Start the replica set member on a different port without the
     :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option. 
  
  #. Connect to the replica set member. 
 
  #. Update the replica set name in the :ref:`local database 
     <replica-set-local-database>` with the following commands:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        /* Set `newId` to the new replica set name */
        var newId = '<new replica set name>'

        var doc = db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.findOne()
        var oldId = doc._id
        doc._id = newId
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.save(doc)
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.remove({_id: oldId})

  #. :ref:`Shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>` the replica set 
     member.
 
  #. Start the replica set member on its original port. 
  
     - If using a configuration file, ensure that 
       :setting:`replication.replSetName <replication.replSetName>` is 
       set to the new replica set name.
     
     - If using the :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command with 
       the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option, pass the new 
       name of the replica set to the 
       :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option.
