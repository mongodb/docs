Although the recommended procedure to install is through the
:ref:`package manager <install-community-amazon-pkg>`, you can also
install by directly downloading the ``.tgz`` file. The following
tutorial downloads the ``.tgz`` tarball directly to install MongoDB
{+version+} Community Edition on Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2
systems.
