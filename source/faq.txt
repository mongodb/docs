.. _compass-faq-isolated:

What is the Compass Isolated Edition?
-------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-isolated-edition-firewall.rst

What is the performance impact of running this tool?
----------------------------------------------------

Testing has shown that |compass| has minimal impact in prototype
deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in
progress.

You should only execute queries that are indexed appropriately in the
database to avoid scanning the entire collection.

.. _compass-faq-confidential-data:

How does Compass handle confidential data?
------------------------------------------

|compass| stores and retrieves sensitive data such as passwords
using a credentials API specific to the operating system running
|compass-short|. The credentials API securely handles sensitive
information by encrypting and protecting access to your data.

|compass| stores the following data using the credentials API:

- MongoDB server passwords,

- SSH passwords for tunneling,

- :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`/:abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` passphrases

|compass| utilizes a node.js native add-on, `Keytar
<https://github.com/atom/node-keytar>`_, to communicate with and store
data in the operating system's credentials API. For more information on
how Keytar operates and the specific APIs it accesses, refer to the
`Keytar Github documentation <https://github.com/atom/node-keytar>`_.

.. _compass-faq-logs:

Does Compass Maintain Logs?
---------------------------

As part of normal operation, |compass| maintains a running log of
events. |compass-short| logs provide a history of operations and can
help diagnose errors. For more information on |compass-short| logs,
including their format and location, see :ref:`compass-logs`.

.. _compass-faq-non-genuine:

Why am I seeing a warning about a non-genuine MongoDB server?
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-non-genuine-warning.rst

What happens to long running queries?
-------------------------------------

As a precaution, Compass aborts long running queries to prevent
excessive querying on your database.

Slow Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All queries that Compass sends to your MongoDB instance have a timeout
flag set which automatically aborts a request if it takes longer than
the specified timeout. This timeout is currently set to 10 seconds. If
:ref:`sampling <compass-sampling>` on the database takes longer, Compass will 
notify you about the timeout and give you the options of (a) retrying 
with a longer timeout (60 seconds) or (b) running a different query.

.. note::

   Sampling time may be affected by a number of factors, like load on
   the server, number of documents and existence of a suitable index
   for your query.

It is recommended that you only increase the sampling timeout if you
are not connected to a production instance, as this may negatively
affect the performance and response time of your database.

Slow Schema Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the database returns documents faster than the specified timeout (10
or 60 seconds), but the schema analysis of the documents takes longer
than expected (due to complex, large documents), Compass gives you the
option to abort the analysis step and show the partial results.

Why are some features of |compass| not working?
-----------------------------------------------

If you can connect to your MongoDB instance using |compass| but some
features do not work as expected, your system firewall may be blocking
network requests required by |compass|. |compass| must connect to
external services to enable features such as:

- Third party mapping services

- Intercom

- Bugsnag for error reporting

To fix this issue, configure your system firewall to allow incoming
connections for |compass|. Ensure ports ``80`` and ``443`` are open
between |compass| and the host for the MongoDB deployment to which
Compass connects.

.. _faq-privacy-settings:

How do I view and modify my Privacy Settings?
---------------------------------------------

To view and modify your |compass| privacy settings, from the top-level
menu:

1. Click :guilabel:`MongoDB Compass`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Settings`.
#. Under :guilabel:`Settings`, click :guilabel:`Privacy`.

The privacy settings dialog allows you to toggle various
|compass| settings such as enabling automatic updates.
See the following screenshot for all available privacy settings options:

   :alt: Privacy settings

.. note::

   Automatic updates are not available in :guilabel:`Compass Isolated Edition`.

How do I enable geographic visualizations?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable geographic visualizations in |compass| in your
privacy settings. When :guilabel:`Enable Geographic Visualizations` is
selected, |compass| is allowed to make requests to a third-party
mapping service.
