  When you specify an ``upsert`` for an update operation to replace a
  document and no matching documents are found, MongoDB
  creates a new document using the equality conditions in the update
  conditions document, and replaces this document, except for the
  ``_id`` field if specified, with the update document.
action:
  - pre: |
      The following operation either updates a matching
      document by replacing it with a new document or adds a new
      document if no matching document exists.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.inventory.update( 
         { item: "TBD1" },
         {
           item: "TBD1",
           details: { "model" : "14Q4", "manufacturer" : "ABC Company" },
           stock: [ { "size" : "S", "qty" : 25 } ], 
           category: "houseware"
         },
         { upsert: true }
      )
  - pre: |
      The update operation returns a :method:`WriteResult` object which
      contains the status of the operation, including whether the
      :method:`db.collection.update()` method modified an existing
      document or added a new document.
    language: javascript
    code: |
       WriteResult({
           "nMatched" : 0,
           "nUpserted" : 1,
           "nModified" : 0,
           "_id" : ObjectId("53dbd684babeaec6342ed6c7")
       })
post: |
  The :data:`~WriteResult.nMatched` field shows that the operation
  matched ``0`` documents.

  The :data:`~WriteResult.nUpserted` of ``1`` shows that the operation
  added a document through an ``upsert``.

  The :data:`~WriteResult.nModified` of ``0`` specifies that no
  existing documents were updated.

  The ``_id`` field shows the generated ``_id`` field for the added
  document.

  When you specify an ``upsert`` for an update operation that modifies
  specific fields and no matching documents are found, MongoDB creates
  a new document using the equality conditions in the update conditions
  document, and applies the modification as specified in the
  update document.
action:
  - pre: |
      The following update operation either updates specific
      fields of a matching document or adds a new document if no
      matching document exists.
