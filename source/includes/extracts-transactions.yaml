   .. important::

      In most cases, multi-document transaction incurs a greater
      performance cost over single document writes, and the
      availability of multi-document transaction should not be a
      replacement for effective schema design. For many scenarios, the
      :ref:`denormalized data model (embedded documents and arrays)
      <data-modeling-embedding>` will continue to be optimal for your
      data and use cases. That is, for many scenarios, modeling your data
      appropriately will minimize the need for multi-document
      transactions. For additional transactions usage considerations
      (such as runtime limit and oplog size limit), see also
      :doc:`/core/transactions-production-consideration`.

   Starting in version 4.0, for situations that require atomicity for
   updates to multiple documents or consistency between reads to multiple
   documents, MongoDB provides :doc:`multi-document transactions
   </core/transactions>` for replica sets.
---
ref: transactions-faq
content: |
   Because a single document can contain related data that would otherwise
   be modeled across separate parent-child tables in a relational schema,
   MongoDB's atomic single-document operations already provide transaction
   semantics that meet the data integrity needs of the majority of
   applications. One or more fields may be written in a single operation,
   including updates to multiple sub-documents and elements of an array.
   The guarantees provided by MongoDB ensure complete isolation as a
   document is updated; any errors cause the operation to roll back so
   that clients receive a consistent view of the document.

   Starting in version 4.0, for situations that require atomicity for
   updates to multiple documents or consistency between reads to multiple
   documents, MongoDB provides :doc:`multi-document transactions
   </core/transactions>` for replica sets, and transactions for sharded
   clusters are scheduled for MongoDB 4.2.

ref: transactions-operations-restrictions
content: |
 
   The following operations are not allowed in multi-document
   transactions:

   - Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
     dropping a collection or an index. For example, a multi-document
     transaction cannot include an insert operation that would result
     in the creation of a new collection.

     The :dbcommand:`listCollections` and :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
     commands and their helper methods are also excluded.
 
   - Non-CRUD and non-informational operations, such as
     :dbcommand:`createUser`, :dbcommand:`getParameter`,
     :dbcommand:`count`, etc. and their helpers.

---
ref: transactions-operations-restrictions-info
content: |

   Informational commands, such as :dbcommand:`hello`,
   :dbcommand:`buildInfo`, :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` (and their
   helper methods) are allowed in transactions; however, they cannot be
   the first operation in the transaction.

---
ref: transactions-operations-retry
content: |
   The commit and abort transaction operations are :doc:`retryable write
   operations </core/retryable-writes>`. If the commit operation or the
   abort operation encounters an error, MongoDB drivers retry the
   operation a single time regardless of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is
   set to ``true``.
---
ref: transactions-operations-crud
content: |

   - You can specify read/write (CRUD) operations on **existing**
     collections. The collections can be in different databases. For a
     list of CRUD operations, see :ref:`transactions-operations-crud`.

   - You cannot read/write to collections in the ``config``, ``admin``,
     or ``local`` databases.

   - You cannot write to ``system.*`` collections.

   - You cannot return the supported operation's query plan (i.e. ``explain``).

   .. tip:: 

      When creating or dropping a collection immediately before
      starting a transaction, if the collection is accessed within the
      transaction, issue the create or drop operation with write
      concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` to ensure that the transaction
      can acquire the required locks.

---

ref: transactions-operations-write-concern

   Do not explicitly set the write concern for the operation if run in
   a transaction. To use write concern with transactions, see
   :ref:`transaction-options`.

---
ref: transactions-write-conflict
content: |

   If a multi-document transaction is in progress and a write
   outside the transaction modifies a document that an operation in the
   transaction later tries to modify, the transaction aborts because of
   a write conflict.
   
   If a multi-document transaction is in progress and has taken a lock
   to modify a document, when a write outside the transaction tries to
   modify the same document, the write waits until the transaction ends.

---
ref: transactions-stale-reads
content: |

   Read operations inside a transaction can return stale data. That is,
   read operations inside a transaction are not guaranteed to see
   writes performed by other committed transactions or
   non-transactional writes. For example, consider the following
   sequence: 1) a transaction is in-progress 2) a write outside the
   transaction deletes a document 3) a read operation inside the
   transaction is able to read the now-deleted document since the
   operation is using a snapshot from before the write.

   To avoid stale reads inside transactions for a single document, you
   can use the :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()` method. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      session.startTransaction( { readConcern: { level: "snapshot" }, writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } );

      employeesCollection = session.getDatabase("hr").employees;

      employeeDoc = employeesCollection.findOneAndUpdate( 
         { _id: 1, employee: 1, status: "Active" },
         { $set: { employee: 1 } },
         { returnNewDocument: true }
      );

   - If the employee document has changed outside the transaction, then
     the transaction aborts.

   - If the employee document has not changed, the transaction returns
     the document and locks the document.
