Distributed Transactions
------------------------

.. note:: Distributed Transactions and Multi-Document Transactions

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the two terms are synonymous. Distributed
   transactions refer to multi-document transactions on sharded
   clusters and replica sets. Multi-document transactions (whether on
   sharded clusters or replica sets) are also known as distributed
   transactions starting in MongoDB 4.2.

In version 4.2, MongoDB introduces distributed transactions.
Distributed transactions:

- Adds support for multi-document transactions on sharded clusters.

  - All members of the 4.2 sharded clusters must have
    :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` of ``4.2``.
  
  - Clients :red:`must` use MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 4.2

- Incorporates the existing support for transactions on replica sets.

  - All members of the 4.2 replica set must have
    :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` of ``4.2``.

  - Clients :red:`must` use MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 4.2

- Removes the 16MB total size limit for a transaction. In version
  4.2, MongoDB creates as many oplog entries (maximum size ``16MB``
  each) as necessary to encapsulate all write operations in a
  transaction. In MongoDB 4.0, MongoDB creates a single entry for
  all write operations in a transaction, thereby imposing a 16MB
  total size limit for a transaction.

- Extends transaction support to deployments whose secondary members
  use the :ref:`in-memory storage engine <storage-inmemory>`. That is,
  transactions are available for deployments that use the WiredTiger
  storage engine for the primary and either the WiredTiger or the
  in-memory storage engine for the secondary members. In MongoDB 4.0, 
  transactions are available for deployments that use the WiredTiger 
  storage engine only.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/transactions`.

   For a complete list of official 4.2+ compatible drivers with
   support for Client-Side Field Level Encryption, see
   :ref:`field-level-encryption-drivers`.

Retryable Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retryable reads allow MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers to automatically
retry certain read operations a single time if they encounter certain
network or server errors. See :ref:`retryable-reads` for more
information.

.. _4.2-security:

Security Improvements
---------------------

Resolved Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 includes fixes that resolve the following Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs):

- CVE-2019-2389 (See :issue:`SERVER-40563`)

- CVE-2019-2386 (See :issue:`SERVER-38984`)

.. _4.2-tls:

New ``TLS`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds ``TLS`` options for the :ref:`mongod
<tls-mongod-options>`, the :ref:`mongos <mongos-tls-options>`, and the
``mongo shell`` to replace the corresponding ``SSL`` options 
(deprecated in 4.2). The new TLS options provide **identical** 
functionality as the deprecated ``SSL`` options as MongoDB has always 
supported TLS 1.0 and later.

- For the command-line TLS options, refer to the :ref:`mongod
  <tls-mongod-options>`, :ref:`mongos <mongos-tls-options>`, and
  ``mongo`` shell pages.

- For the corresponding ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` configuration file
  options, refer to the :ref:`configuration file
  <net-tls-conf-options>` page.

- For the connection string ``tls`` options, refer to the
  :ref:`connection string <uri-options-tls>` page.

.. tip::

   Most of the new ``TLS`` option names are similar to the ``SSL``
   option name; e.g. :option:`--tlsMode <mongod --tlsMode>` instead of
   :option:`--sslMode <mongod --sslMode>`. The exceptions are:

   - :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` vs. :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile`
   - :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFilePassword` vs. :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyPassword`
   - :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFile <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>` vs.  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongod --sslPEMKeyFile>`
   - :option:`--tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword <mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile>` vs.  :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword <mongod --sslPEMKeyPassword>`

.. seealso::

   :ref:`4.2-tlsclustercafile`

Deprecated ``SSL`` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 deprecates the ``SSL`` options for the :ref:`mongod
<ssl-mongod-options>`, the :ref:`mongos <mongos-ssl-options>`, and the
``mongo`` shell as well as the corresponding
:ref:`net-ssl-conf-options` configuration file options.

Use the new :ref:`TLS <4.2-tls>` options instead.

New ``tls`` Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - New Parameter
     - Description

   * - :parameter:`tlsWithholdClientCertificate`

     - Available for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`,
       the parameter can be set to ``true`` to stop the instance from
       sending its ``TLS`` certificate when initiating intra-cluster
       communications with other :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or
       :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` instances. For details, see
       :parameter:`tlsWithholdClientCertificate`.

   * - :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`

     - Available for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`,
       the parameter can be set to an alternative certificate ``DN`` to
       use for :doc:`x.509 membership authentication
       </tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication>`. For details,
       see :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`.

       You can use this parameter for a rolling update of certificates
       to new certificates that contain a new ``DN`` value. See
       :doc:`/tutorial/rotate-x509-membership-certificates`.

.. _4.2-tlsclustercafile:

New ``tlsClusterCAFile`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the 
:option:`--tlsClusterCAFile <mongod --tlsClusterCAFile>` option/:setting:`net.tls.clusterCAFile` for
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`, which specifies a 
:file:`.pem` file for validating the TLS certificate from a client
establishing a connection. This lets you use separate Certificate Authorities
to verify the client to server and server to client portions of the TLS
handshake.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`4.2-tls`

Forward Secrecy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2 on Linux:

- If the platform's OpenSSL supports automatic curve selection for
  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, MongoDB enables support for
  :ref:`ecdhe`.
 
- If the platform's OpenSSL does not support automatic curve selection
  for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, MongoDB attempts to enable ECDHE
  support using ``prime256v1`` as the named curve.

- If support for ECDHE is enabled, MongoDB attempts to enable support
  for :ref:`dhe` if :ref:`dhe` is not explicitly enabled.

In earlier versions of MongoDB (3.6.14+ and 4.0.3+), MongoDB enables
support for Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) if, during
compile time, the Linux platform's OpenSSL supports automatic curve
selection of ECDH parameters.

On Windows and macOS, MongoDB's support for ECDHE and DH remain
unchanged from earlier versions; that is, support is implicit through
the use of the platform's respective native TLS/SSL OS libraries.

For more information, see :ref:`tls-forward-secrecy`.
     
``passwordPrompt()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createUser( { 
      user:"user123",
      pwd: passwordPrompt(),   // Instead of specifying the password in cleartext
      roles:[ "readWrite" ]
   } )

Keyfile Format Change to YAML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-keyfile-fmt.rst

The new format allows for rolling upgrade of the keys without downtime.
See :doc:`/tutorial/rotate-key-replica-set` and
:doc:`/tutorial/rotate-key-sharded-cluster`.

``libldap`` and ``libldap_r``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-libldap.rst

Encrypted Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-ese-key-rollover.rst

For more information, see :ref:`encrypted storage engine
<encrypted-storage-engine>` and :option:`--eseDatabaseKeyRollover
<mongod --eseDatabaseKeyRollover>`.

Client-Side Field Level Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official :ref:`MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers
<field-level-encryption-drivers>` provide a client-side field level
encryption framework. Applications can encrypt fields in documents
*prior* to transmitting data over the wire to the server. Only
applications with access to the correct encryption keys can decrypt and
read the protected data. Deleting an encryption key renders all data
encrypted with that key as permanently unreadable.

For a complete list of official 4.2+ compatible drivers with support
for client-side field level encryption, see 
:ref:`field-level-encryption-drivers`. 

For an end-to-end procedure for configuring field level encryption using
select MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers, see the 
:driver:`Client Side Field Level Encryption Guide
</security/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/>`.

Explicit (manual) encryption of fields
  Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers and the MongoDB 4.2 or later
  ``mongo`` shell support explicitly encrypting or decrypting
  fields with a specific data encryption key and encryption algorithm.

  Applications must modify any code associated with constructing read
  and write operations to include encryption/decryption logic via the
  driver encryption library. Applications are responsible for selecting
  the appropriate data encryption key for encryption/decryption on a
  per-operation basis.

  For more information, see
  :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption`.

Automatic encryption of fields
  .. include:: /includes/extracts/csfle-enterprise-atlas-only.rst

  Official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers and the MongoDB 4.2 or later
  ``mongo`` shell support automatically encrypting fields in
  read and write operations. 

  Applications must create a database connection object (e.g.
  ``MongoClient``) with the automatic encryption configuration settings.
  The configuration settings must include automatic encryption 
  encryption rules using a strict subset of the
  `JSON Schema Draft 4 standard syntax
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04>`_ and
  encryption-specific schema keywords. Applications do not have to 
  modify code associated with constructing the read/write operation.
  See :ref:`field-level-encryption-json-schema` for complete 
  documentation on automatic encryption rules.

  For more information, see
  :ref:`field-level-encryption-automatic`.


For complete documentation on client-side field level encryption,
see :ref:`manual-csfle-feature`.

General Security Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add :authaction:`serverStatus` to the :authrole:`backup` built-in
  role.

- To connect a client over TLS/SSL connection, MongoDB 4.2 supports
  matching by IP addresses as well as DNS for Subject Alternative Name
  (SAN) matching.
  
  For example, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance's x.509 certificate
  has the following SAN:
  
  .. code-block:: none
     :copyable: false

     X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
         DNS:hostname.example.com, DNS:localhost, IP Address:127.0.0.1
  
  Then, to connect a ``mongo`` shell to the instance, you
  can specify the host of ``127.0.0.1`` or the DNS names:

  - .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false
  
       mongo "mongodb:\\127.0.0.1:27017\test" --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem ...

  - .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false
 
       mongo "mongodb:\\hostname.example.com:27017\test" --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem ...

  - .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false

       mongo "mongodb:\\localhost:27017\test" --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem ...

  In previous versions, MongoDB only supported DNS entries for SAN
  matching.

  - .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false

       mongo "mongodb:\\hostname.example.com:27017\test" --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem ...

  - .. code-block:: none
       :copyable: false

       mongo "mongodb:\\localhost:27017\test" --tls  --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem ...


LDAP Query Template ``{PROVIDED_USER}`` Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB Enterprise adds a new token
``{PROVIDED_USER}`` that can be used in
:setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`. When used in the
template, MongoDB substitutes the supplied username, i.e. before either
authentication or :setting:`LDAP transformation
<security.ldap.userToDNMapping>`.

.. _4.2-agg:

Aggregation Improvements
------------------------

.. _4.2-agg-merge:

On-Demand Materialized View (``$merge`` Stage)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation stage.

With the new stage you can:

- Can output to a collection in the same or different database.

- Can incorporate results (merge documents, replace documents, keep
  existing documents, fail the operation, process documents with an
  custom update pipeline) into an existing collection.

- Can output to an existing sharded collection.

The new stage allows users to create :doc:`on-demand materialized views
</core/materialized-views>`, where the content of the output collection
can be incrementally updated each time the pipeline is run.

.. _4.2-trigonometry-expressions:

Aggregation Trigonometry Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds new
trigonometry expressions for use in aggregation pipelines.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/agg-operators-trigonometry.rst

.. _4.2-round-trig-expressions:

Aggregation Arithmetic Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the :expression:`$round` aggregation expression. 
Use :expression:`$round` to round numerical values to a specific
digit or decimal place.

MongoDB 4.2 adds expanded functionality and new syntax to
:expression:`$trunc`. Use :expression:`$trunc` with the new syntax
to truncate numerical values to a specific digit or decimal place.

.. _4.2-agg-regex-operators:

Aggregation Regular Expressions (regex) Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the following regular expression (regex) pattern
matching operators for use in the aggregation pipeline:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   
   * - Operator
     - Description
     
   * - :expression:`$regexFind`

     - Applies a regular expression (regex) to a string and returns
       information on the *first* matched substring.

   * - :expression:`$regexFindAll`

     - Applies a regular expression (regex) to a string and returns
       information on all matched substrings.

   * - :expression:`$regexMatch`

     - Applies a regular expression (regex) to a string and returns
       ``true`` if a match is found and ``false`` if a match is not
       found.

Prior to MongoDB 4.2, aggregation pipeline can only use the query
operator :query:`$regex` in the :pipeline:`$match` stage.
   
New Stages
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the following new aggregation pipeline stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - New Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$merge`

     - Writes the aggregation results to a collection. The
       :pipeline:`$merge` stage can incorporate results (merge
       documents, replace documents, keep existing documents, fail the
       operation, process documents with an custom update pipeline)
       into an existing collection.

   * - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats`
     
     - Provides :doc:`plan cache </core/query-plans>` information for a collection.
     
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-planCacheStats-pref.rst

       .. seealso::

          :ref:`4.2-deprecated-plan-cache`

   * - :pipeline:`$replaceWith`

     - Replaces the input document with the specified document. The
       operation replaces all existing fields in the input document,
       including the ``_id`` field. The new :pipeline:`$replaceWith`
       stage is an alias to the :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` stage.

   * - :pipeline:`$set`

     - Adds new fields to documents. The stage outputs documents that
       contains all existing fields from the input documents as well as
       the newly added fields. The new :pipeline:`$set` stage is an
       alias to the :pipeline:`$addFields` stage.

   * - :pipeline:`$unset`

     - Excludes fields from documents. The new :pipeline:`$unset` stage
       is an alias to the :pipeline:`$project` stage that excludes
       fields.

New Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the following new aggregation pipeline variables:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Variable
     - Description

   * - :variable:`NOW`

     - Returns the current datetime value.

   * - :variable:`CLUSTER_TIME`

     - Returns the current  timestamp value.

       *Only available on replica sets and sharded clusters.*

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use the aggregation pipeline for
updates in: 

.. include:: /includes/table-update-with-aggregation-availability.rst

For the updates, the pipeline can consist of the following stages:

.. include:: /includes/list-update-agg-stages.rst

Using the aggregation pipeline allows for a more expressive update
statement, such as expressing conditional updates based on current
field values or updating one field using the value of another field(s).

See the individual reference pages for details and examples.

.. seealso::

   - :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents-with-aggregation-pipeline`
   - :ref:`4.2-compat-agg`

.. _4.2-change-stream:

Change Stream
-------------

``startAfter`` Option for Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds ``startAfter`` as an option for :ref:`changeStreams`,
which starts a new change stream after the event indicated by a resume
token. With this option, you can start a change stream from an
:ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>`, thereby guaranteeing
no missed notifications after the previous stream was invalidated.

Change Streams Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 uses the version 1 (i.e. ``v1``) change streams
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`, introduced in
version 4.0.7.

Using the aggregation pipeline allows for a more expressive update
statement, such as expressing conditional updates based on current
field values or updating one field using the value of another field(s).

See the individual reference pages for details and examples.

Update and Hint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`update` command and the
associated ``mongo`` shell method
:method:`db.collection.update()` can accept a hint argument to specify
the index to use. See:

Sharded Collections and Replace Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-sharded-collection-replacement.rst

.. _wildcard-releasenotes:

Wildcard Indexes
----------------

MongoDB 4.2 introduces :ref:`wildcard indexes <wildcard-index-core>` for 
supporting queries against fields whose names are unknown or arbitrary.

.. include:: /includes/4.2-changes/wildcard-indexes-refactored.rst

You can create a wildcard index using the :dbcommand:`createIndexes` 
database command or its shell helpers 
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`db.collection.createIndexes()`. For examples of creating
a wildcard index, see :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-examples`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` command ``get_id`` and ``delete_id`` can accept
both ObjectId or non-ObjectId values for the ``_id``.

Bulk Operations for ``mongoimport`` and ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongoimport``
```````````````

Starting in version 4.2:

- :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` uses maximum batch size of 100,000 to
  perform bulk insert/upsert operations.

- :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` by default,
  continues when it encounters duplicate key and document
  validation errors.  To ensure that the program stops on these errors, specify ``--stopOnError``.

- Specifying ``--maintainInsertionOrder`` for :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`:
  
  - Maintains document insertion order using ordered bulk write   
    operations; i.e. both the batch order and document order within the batches are maintained.  In earlier versions, only the batch order is maintained; document order within batches are not maintained.

  - Enables ``--stopOnError`` and sets ``numInsertionWorkers`` to 1.

``mongorestore``
````````````````

Starting in version 4.2:

- :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` by default,
  continues when it encounters duplicate key and document
  validation errors.  To ensure that the program stops on these errors, specify ``--stopOnError``.

- Specifying ``--maintainInsertionOrder`` for :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`:
  
  - Maintains document insertion order using ordered bulk write   
    operations; i.e. both the batch order and document order within the batches are maintained.  In earlier versions, only the batch order is maintained; document order within batches are not maintained.
    
  - Enables ``--stopOnError`` and
    sets ``--numInsertionWorkersPerCollection`` to 1.

.. _4.2-finer-grained-locks-for-DDL:

Lock Optimization for Specific DDL Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.2, the following operations take an 
exclusive collection lock instead of an exclusive database lock:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Commands
     - Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`create`
     - :method:`db.createCollection()`

       :method:`db.createView()`

   * - :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
     - :method:`db.collection.createIndex()`
       
       :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()`

   * - :dbcommand:`drop`
     - :method:`db.collection.drop()`

   * - :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
     - :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()`

       :method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()`

   * - :dbcommand:`renameCollection`

     - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()`

Prior to MongoDB 4.2, these operations took an exclusive lock on the
database, blocking all operations on the database *and* its collections
until the operation completed.

.. _4.2-traffic-recorder:

In earlier versions, ``get_id`` and ``delete_id`` can only accept
ObjectId values for the ``_id``.


Monitoring
----------

Starting in version 4.2, the :ref:`Storage Node Watchdog
<storage-node-watchdog>` is available in both the MongoDB Community
edition and the MongoDB Enterprise edition.

In earlier versions, the feature is available in the MongoDB Enterprise
edition only.

Flow Control
------------

MongoDB 4.2 introduces a flow control mechanism to control the rate at
which the primary applies its writes in order to keep the
:data:`majority committed <replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>`
lag under a specified maximum value. 

Flow control is :parameter:`enabled <enableFlowControl>` by default.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-flow-control-requirements.rst

For more information, see :ref:`replication-flow-control`.

Logging and Diagnostics
-----------------------

Logging
~~~~~~~

- Added :data:`INITSYNC` component to log messages.

- Added :data:`ELECTION` component to log messages.

- For debug messages, include the verbosity level (i.e. ``D``\ [1-5]).
  For example, if verbosity level is 2, MongoDB logs ``D2``. In
  previous versions, MongoDB log messages only specified ``D`` for
  Debug level.
       
- When logging to :option:`syslog <mongod --syslog>`, the format of the
  message text includes the :ref:`component <log-message-components>`.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: none

     ...  ACCESS   [repl writer worker 5] Unsupported modification to roles collection ...

  Previously, the :option:`syslog <mongod --syslog>` message text did
  not include the component. For
  example:

  .. code-block:: none

     ... [repl writer worker 1] Unsupported modification to roles collection ...

- MongoDB 4.2 adds a ``usedDisk`` indicator to the :doc:`profiler log
  messages </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` and
  :doc:`diagnostic log messages </reference/log-messages>` for the
  :dbcommand:`aggregate` operation. The ``usedDisk`` indicates whether
  any stages of an :dbcommand:`aggregate` operation wrote data to
  temporary files due to memory restrictions. For more information on
  aggregation memory restrictions, see :ref:`agg-memory-restrictions`.

.. _slow-oplog:

- Starting in version 4.2 (also available starting in 4.0.6),
  secondary members of a replica set now log oplog entries that take
  longer than the slow operation threshold to apply. These messages are
  :option:`logged <mongod --logpath>` for the secondaries under the
  :data:`REPL` component with the text ``applied op: <oplog entry> took
  <num>ms``.

  .. code-block:: none

     2018-11-16T12:31:35.886-0500 I REPL   [repl writer worker 13] applied op: command { ... }, took 112ms

  The slow oplog application logging on secondaries are:

  - Not affected by the
    :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpSampleRate`; i.e. all slow
    oplog entries are logged by the secondary.

  - Not affected by the
    :parameter:`logLevel`/:setting:`systemLog.verbosity` level (or the
    :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.verbosity` level); i.e.
    for oplog entries, the secondary logs only the slow oplog entries.
    Increasing the verbosity level does not log all oplog entries.

  - Not captured by the :doc:`profiler
    </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` and not affected by the
    profiling level.

  For more information on setting the slow operation threshold, see 

  - :option:`mongod --slowms`

  - :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs`

  - The :dbcommand:`profile` command or
    :method:`db.setProfilingLevel()` shell helper method.

- Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`getLog` command truncates
  any event that contains more than 1024 characters. In earlier
  versions, :dbcommand:`getLog` truncates after 512 characters.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-log-storage.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-log-query-shapes-plan-cache-key.rst

  See :ref:`4.2-query-plans`.

.. _4.2-currentOp:

``currentOp``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds a new option ``idleCursors`` to the
:pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage in order to return information
on idle cursors.

In addition, MongoDB 4.2 adds the following new fields to the documents
returned from the :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage,
:dbcommand:`currentOp` command, and :method:`db.currentOp()` helper:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``$currentOp``
     - ``currentOp``/``db.currentOp()``
     - Description

   * - :data:`$currentOp.type`
     - :data:`currentOp.type`
   
     - Specifies whether the reported operation is an ``op``,
       ``idleSession``, or ``idleCursor``.

   * - :data:`$currentOp.cursor`
     - :data:`currentOp.cursor`

     - Specifies cursor details. Available when returning ``getmore``
       operations or ``idleCursor`` information. 

   * - :data:`$currentOp.effectiveUsers`
     - :data:`currentOp.effectiveUsers`

     - Specifies users associated with the operation.

   * - :data:`$currentOp.prepareReadConflicts`
     - :data:`currentOp.prepareReadConflicts`

     - Specifies the number of times the current operation had to wait
       for a prepared transaction with a write to commit or abort.

   * - :data:`$currentOp.runBy`
     - :data:`currentOp.runBy`

     - Specifies users that are impersonating the effective users for
       the operation.

   * - :data:`$currentOp.writeConflicts`
     - :data:`currentOp.writeConflicts`
   
     - Specifies the number of times the current operation conflicted
       with another write operation.

See also :ref:`4.2 current op compatibility changes <4.2-current-op-compat>`

``serverStatus`` Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command and the
``mongo`` shell method :method:`db.serverStatus()` include
the following output changes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Updates to

   * - :serverstatus:`transactions`
   
     - - Now available for :binary:`~bin.mongos` (previously only for
         :binary:`~bin.mongod`)

       
       - Added new fields for :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances:

         - :serverstatus:`transactions.totalPrepared`
         - :serverstatus:`transactions.totalPreparedThenCommitted`
         - :serverstatus:`transactions.totalPreparedThenAborted`
         - :serverstatus:`transactions.currentPrepared`

   * - :serverstatus:`logicalSessionRecordCache`

   * - :serverstatus:`locks`

     - Separate ``ParallelBatchWriterMode`` from ``Global``
       lock information.

       Add ``ReplicationStateTransition`` lock information.

Replica Set Status Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version MongoDB 4.2, :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` and its
``mongo`` shell helper :method:`rs.status()` return:

- The IP address, :data:`replSetGetStatus.members[n].ip` for the
  replica set members.

- ISODate-formatted date string fields that correspond to the various
  :data:`replSetGetStatus.optimes`.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - New ISODate-Formatted Date String Field
       - Corresponding Optime Field
    
     * - :data:`~replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedWallTime`
       - :data:`~replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime`

       - :data:`~replSetGetStatus.optimes.appliedOpTime`

     * - :data:`~replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastDurableWallTime`
       - :data:`~replSetGetStatus.optimes.durableOpTime`

MongoDB 4.2 deprecates the field
:data:`~replSetGetStatus.lastStableCheckpointTimestamp`.

Lock Diagnostics Reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-global-lock-reporting.rst

``collStats`` Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :pipeline:`$collStats` aggregation, the
:dbcommand:`collStats` command, and the ``mongo`` shell
helper :method:`db.collection.stats` return information on indexes that
are currently being built. 

For details, see:

- :data:`collStats.nindexes`
- :data:`collStats.indexDetails`
- :data:`collStats.indexBuilds`
- :data:`collStats.totalIndexSize`
- :data:`collStats.indexSizes`

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :pipeline:`$collStats` aggregation, the
:dbcommand:`collStats` command, and the ``mongo`` shell
helper :method:`db.collection.stats` return the ``scaleFactor`` used to
scale the various size data.

``dbStats`` Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`dbStats` command, and the
``mongo`` shell helper :method:`db.stats()` return
the ``scaleFactor`` used to scale the various size data.

General Improvements
--------------------

Externally Sourced Values for Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-expansion-directive-intro.rst

The following expansion directives are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Expansion Directive
     - Description

   * - :configexpansion:`__rest`
     - Allows users to specify a ``REST`` endpoint as the external source
       for configuration file options *or* the full configuration file.

   * - :configexpansion:`__exec`
     - Allows users to specify a shell or terminal command as the
       external source for configuration file options *or* the
       full configuration file.

For complete documentation, see :ref:`externally-sourced-values`.

``outputConfig`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the :option:`--outputConfig <mongod --outputConfig>`
option for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`. The option
outputs to ``stdout`` the :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos`
instance's configuration, in YAML format.

If the configuration uses any :ref:`externally-sourced-values`, the
option returns the resolved value for those options.

.. warning::
   
   This may include any configured passwords or secrets previously
   obfuscated through the external source.

For usage examples, see:

- :ref:`expansion-directive-output`

- :doc:`/tutorial/convert-command-line-options-to-yaml`

Remove Index Key Size Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion
<view-fcv>` set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the
:limit:`Index Key Limit`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still
applies.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`4.2 Indexes Compatibility Changes <4.2-index-compat-changes>`

Remove Index Name Length Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-index-names.rst

.. seealso::
   
   - :ref:`4.2 Indexes Compatibility Changes <4.2-index-compat-changes>`
   - :ref:`4.2-compatibility-enabled`

Improvements to ``dropIndexes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drop multiple indexes
`````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can specify multiple indexes to the
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command and its ``mongo`` shell
helper :method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()`. To specify multiple
indexes to drop, pass an array of index names to
:dbcommand:`dropIndexes`/:method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()`.

Kill related queries only
`````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-releaseNotes-dropIndexes-query-behavior.rst

``zstd`` Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB supports :term:`zstd` for:

- block compression. See
  :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.collectionConfig.blockCompressor`.
  
- journal compression. See
  :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.journalCompressor`.

- network compression. See :setting:`net.compression.compressors`.

  - For clients using the MongoDB drivers, they must use drivers
    updated for MongoDB 4.2.

  - The network compressors for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` default to both ``snappy,zstd,zlib``
    compressors, in that order. In version 4.0, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
    and :binary:`~bin.mongos` enable network compression by default
    with ``snappy`` as the compressor.

``bulkWrite()`` Error Handling inside Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-bulkWrite-txn-error-handling.rst

.. _4.2-query-plans:

Query Plan Improvements
-----------------------

Plan Cache States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the cache entry is associated with a state:

- :ref:`Missing <cache-entry-missing>`

- :ref:`Inactive <cache-entry-inactive>`

- :ref:`Active <cache-entry-active>`

Associating states with entries helps reduce the likelihood that
sub-optimal cache entries remain in the cache. For more information,
see :doc:`/core/query-plans`.

``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- .. _4.2-query-hash:

  ``queryHash``
        .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-query-shapes.rst

- .. _4.2-plan-cache-key:

  ``planCacheKey``
        .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-plan-cache-key.rst

        .. seealso::

           :ref:`plan-cache-key`

- The ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey`` are available in:

  - :doc:`profiler entry </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
    fields :data:`~system.profile.queryHash` and
    :data:`~system.profile.planCacheKey` the logged query operations.

  - :ref:`diagnostic log messages (i.e. mongod/mongos log
    messages)<log-message-slow-ops>` for the logged query operations.

  - :doc:`explain() output </reference/explain-results>` fields:
    :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.queryHash` and
    :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey`

The fields are also available in operations that return information
about the query plan cache:

- :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage (*New in MongoDB 4.2*)

- ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()``
  method/``planCacheListQueryShapes`` command (*Deprecated in MongoDB 4.2*)

- ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()``
  method/``planCacheListPlans`` command (*Deprecated in MongoDB 4.2*)
  
.. seealso::

   :ref:`4.2-deprecated-plan-cache`


``$regex`` and ``$not``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2 (and 4.0.7), :query:`$not` operator can perform logical
``NOT`` operation on :query:`$regex` operator expressions as well as
on regular expression objects (i.e. ``/pattern/``).

In 4.0 and earlier versions, you could use :query:`$not` operator with
regular expression objects (i.e. ``/pattern/``) but not with
:query:`$regex` operator expressions.

Kill Own Cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, users can always kill their own cursors,
regardless of whether the users have the privilege to
:authaction:`killCursors`. As such, the :authaction:`killCursors`
privilege has no effect starting in MongoDB 4.2.

In MongoDB 4.0, users required the :authaction:`killCursors` privilege
in order to kill their own cursors.
   
New Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds the parameter :parameter:`replBatchLimitBytes` to
configure the maximum oplog application batch size. The parameter is
also available starting in MongoDB 4.0.10.

Retryable Writes on Certain Single-Document Upserts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 will retry certain single-document upserts
(update with ``upsert: true`` and ``multi: false``) that encounter a 
duplicate key exception. See :ref:`retryable-update-upsert` for 
conditions.

Prior to MongoDB 4.2, MongoDB would not retry upsert operations
that encountered a duplicate key error.

``db.dropDatabase()`` and Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongODB 4.2, the ``mongo`` shell method
:method:`db.dropDatabase()` can take an optional write concern document.

``dropConnections``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`dropConnections` command drops the 
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's outgoing
connections to the specified hosts. The :dbcommand:`dropConnections`
must be run  against the ``admin`` database. 


Client Disconnection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |operation| replace:: following operations

For the following operations, if the issuing client disconnects before
the operation completes, MongoDB marks the |operation| for termination
(e.g. :dbcommand:`killOp` on the operation):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Command
     - ``mongo`` Shell Method
     - Notes
     
   * - :dbcommand:`aggregate`
    
     - :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`
     - Behavior only applies if the pipeline does not include :pipeline:`$out` and :pipeline:`$merge`

Map-Reduce
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-map-reduce-deprecation.rst

Rollback Time Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the rollback time limit is calculated between
the first operation after the common point and the last point in the
oplog for the member to roll back.

In MongoDB 4.0, the rollback time limit is calculated between the
common point and the last point in the oplog for the member to roll
back.

For more information, see :ref:`rollback-time-limit`.

``isInteractive()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 adds a new ``mongo`` shell method
``isInteractive()`` that returns a boolean indicating whether the
``mongo`` shell is running in interactive or script mode.

Change to ``explain`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the ``explain`` output can include a new
:data:`~explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline` field. For details,
refer to :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline`.

Change to ``isMaster`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the output for ``isMaster``, and the
``db.isMaster()`` helper method, returns the
``isMaster.connectionId`` for the
:binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's connection to
the client.

.. _4.2-index-builds:

Optimized Index Builds
----------------------

MongoDB index builds against a populated collection require an exclusive
read-write lock against the collection. Operations that require a read
or write lock on the collection must wait until the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the lock. MongoDB uses an optimized build
process that only holds the  exclusive lock at the beginning and end of
the index build. The rest of the build process yields to interleaving
read and write operations.

For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``4.2``,
MongoDB 4.2 index builds fully replace the index build processes
supported in previous MongoDB versions. MongoDB ignores the
``background`` index build option if specified to
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` or its shell helpers
:method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()`.

.. note:: Requires featureCompatibilityVersion 4.2


   For MongoDB clusters upgraded from 4.0 to 4.2, you must set the
   :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` to ``4.2``
   to enable the optimized build process. For more information on
   setting the fCV, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

   MongoDB 4.2 clusters running with fCV ``4.0`` only support 4.0 index
   builds.

For complete documentation on the index build process, see
:ref:`index-operations`.


Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/4.2-compatibility`.

.. _4.2-upgrade:

Upgrade Procedures
------------------

.. important:: Feature Compatibility Version

   To upgrade, the 4.0 instances must have
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``4.0``. To check the version:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   For specific details on verifying and setting the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` as well as information on other
   prerequisites/considerations for upgrades, refer to the individual
   upgrade instructions:

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-upgrade-standalone`

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-upgrade-replica-set`

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-upgrade-sharded-cluster`

If you need guidance on upgrading to 4.2, `MongoDB professional services
