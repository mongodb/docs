"In MongoDB, a write operation is atomic on the level of a single "
"document, even if the operation modifies multiple embedded documents "
"*within* a single document."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-multi-document-writes.rst:1
msgid ""
"When a single write operation modifies multiple documents, the "
"modification of each document is atomic, but the operation as a whole is "
"not atomic and other operations may interleave."

msgid "Transaction-Like Semantics"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-operations-atomicity.txt:22
msgid ""
"Since a single document can contain multiple embedded documents, single-"
"document atomicity is sufficient for many practical use cases. For cases "
"where a sequence of write operations must operate as if in a single "
"transaction, you can implement a :doc:`two-phase commit </tutorial"
"/perform-two-phase-commits>` in your application."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-operations-atomicity.txt:28
msgid ""
"However, two-phase commits can only offer transaction-*like* semantics. "
"Using two-phase commit ensures data consistency, but it is possible for "
"applications to return intermediate data during the two-phase commit or "
"rollback."

"For more information on two-phase commit and rollback, see "
":doc:`/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits`."

"Concurrency control allows multiple applications to run concurrently "
"without causing data inconsistency or conflicts."

#: ../source/core/write-operations-atomicity.txt:44
msgid ""
"One approach is to create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on a "
"field that can only have unique values. This prevents insertions or "
"updates from creating duplicate data. Create a unique index on multiple "
"fields to force uniqueness on that combination of field values. For "
"examples of use cases, see :ref:`update() and Unique Index <update-with-"
"unique-indexes>` and :ref:`findAndModify() and Unique Index <upsert-and-"
"unique-index>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-operations-atomicity.txt:52
msgid ""
"Another approach is to specify the expected current value of a field in "
"the query predicate for the write operations. The two-phase commit "
"pattern provides a variation where the query predicate includes the "
":ref:`application identifier <2-phase-commits-concurrency>` as well as "
"the expected state of the data in the write operation."
