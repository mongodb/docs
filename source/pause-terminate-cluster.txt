Considerations for Paused Clusters
----------------------------------

- You can't:

  - Modify the configuration of a paused cluster.
  - Read data from or write data to a paused cluster.

- For paused clusters, |service|:

  - Doesn't trigger configured alerts.
  - Stops all backups. Your existing snapshots remain until they
    expire.   

.. _pause-cluster:

Pause One Cluster
-----------------

Depending on your cluster tier, |service| either pauses clusters
automatically or when you initiate. 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: M10+
      :tabid: m10+

      You can pause ``M10`` or larger clusters:

      - If they do not use :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`. 
      - For up to 30 days. If you don't resume the cluster within 30 
        days, |service| resumes the cluster.
      
      |service| only charges paused clusters for storage. |service| does
      not charge for any other services or data transfer on paused
      clusters.

      To pause |a-service| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/pause-cluster.rst     

   .. tab:: M0
      :tabid: m0

      |service| automatically pauses ``M0`` clusters after 60 days of
      inactivity where the cluster experiences zero connections.
      |service| sends an email seven days before pausing the cluster.
      |service| sends another email after pausing the cluster.
      
      You can :ref:`resume <resume-cluster>` or :ref:`terminate
      <terminate-cluster>` an automatically paused
      cluster at any time. You can't initiate a pause for ``M0``
      clusters. 
      
.. _resume-cluster:

Resume One Cluster
------------------

To resume a paused |service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/resume-cluster.rst

.. note::

   If you don't resume an ``M10+`` cluster within 30 days, |service|
   resumes the cluster.

.. _terminate-cluster:

Terminate One Cluster
---------------------

To terminate |a-service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the cluster after completing any in-progress
deployment changes.

|service| bills for the hours that the cluster was active. To learn
more about |service| billing, see :doc:`/billing`.

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

.. note:: Public IP Reusable within 36 Hours

   When you terminate a cluster, |service| reserves the cluster's
   public |ipaddr| address, bound to its original cluster name, for 36
   hours. If, in that time frame, you create a new cluster with the
   same name, |service| reassigns the reserved public |ipaddr| address
   to that cluster.

   Cluster |ipaddr| addresses don't change when clusters are paused
   then resumed.
