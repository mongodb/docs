Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to remove documents with the MongoDB Java
driver.

You can remove documents by passing a query filter to the
``deleteOne()``, ``deleteMany()`` or ``findOneAndDelete()`` methods. 

The ``deleteOne()`` method deletes a single document. If the query
filter matches more than one document, the method will remove the first
occurrence of a match in the collection. 

The ``deleteMany()`` method deletes all documents that match the query
filter.

The ``findOneAndDelete()`` method atomically finds and deletes the first
occurrence of a match in the collection.

To specify a collation or hint an index, use ``DeleteOptions``
as a second parameter to the ``deleteOne()`` and ``deleteMany()`` methods. 

To specify a collation, hint an index, specify sort order, or specify a
projection on the returned document, use ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` 
as the second parameter to the ``findOneAndDelete()`` method.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples are about a paint store that sells eight different
colors of paint. The store had their annual online sale resulting in the
following documents in their ``paint_inventory`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
    { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 6 }
    { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 0 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Delete Many Documents
---------------------

The paint store website displays all documents in the
``paint_inventory`` collection. To reduce customer confusion, the store
wants to remove the colors that are out of stock.

To remove the out of stock colors, query the ``paint_inventory``
collection where the ``qty`` is ``0`` and pass the query to the
``deleteMany()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Delete.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin deleteManyExample
   :end-before: end deleteManyExample

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false  

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
    { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 6 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Delete a Document
-----------------

The store is donating the remaining quantity of their yellow paint. This
means that the ``qty`` for yellow is now ``0`` and we need to remove yellow
from the collection. 

To remove yellow, query the ``paint_inventory`` collection where the
``color`` is ``"yellow"`` and pass the query to the ``deleteOne()``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Delete.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin deleteOneExample
   :end-before: end deleteOneExample

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Find and Delete a Document
--------------------------

The store would like to raffle the remaining quantity of purple paint
and remove purple from the ``paint_inventory`` collection. 

To pick a color, query the ``paint_inventory`` collection where the
``color`` is ``"purple"`` and pass the query to the ``findOneAndDelete()``
method:  

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Delete.java
    :language: java
    :dedent:
    :start-after: begin findOneAndDeleteExample
    :end-before: end findOneAndDeleteExample

Unlike the other delete methods, ``findOneAndDelete()`` returns the
deleted document: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

    { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 8 }

.. note::

    If there are no matches to your query filter, no document gets
    deleted and the method returns ``null``. 

The following shows the documents remaining in the ``paint_inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false  

    { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
    { "_id": 8, "color": "black", "qty": 8 }

Delete Example: Full File
-------------------------

.. include:: /includes/crud/example-intro.rst

The following code is a complete, standalone file that performs a delete one
operation and a delete many operation: 

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/crud/Delete.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Deleted document count - query for one: 1
      Deleted document count - unlimited query: 4


The queries in these examples use the ``eq()`` and ``lt()`` filters to query documents. For more
information about filters, see the `Filters Class
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html>`__
API documentation.
