Introduction
------------

|service| provides the following ways to monitor your cluster's performance.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

|service| collects and displays metrics on the state of your cluster's
databases and on server usage. Metrics provide an indication of when you must
modify your database configuration or add server capacity. See
:doc:`monitor-cluster-metrics`.

Alerts
------

|service| notifies you when your database operations or server usage
reach thresholds that affect your cluster's performance. See:

- :doc:`/respond-to-alerts`

- :doc:`/configure-alerts`

MongoDB Logs
------------

Each :program:`mongod <bin.mongod>` and :program:`mongos <bin.mongos>` instance
keeps an account of its activity in its own log file. |service| retains the last
five days of :manual:`log messages </reference/log-messages>` for each instance in
a cluster.

.. note:: 
   
   Free Tier (M0) clusters do not provide downloadable logs.

To download the logs for a single instance in a given cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/download-logs.rst

For information on reading MongoDB logs, refer to the :manual:`Log Messages
</reference/log-messages>` documentation in the MongoDB manual.
