You can get started with |service| via the {+atlas-cli+} using a single
command: ``atlas setup``.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use ``atlas setup`` to: 

1. Sign up for an |service| account.
#. Authenticate with the new |service| account.
#. Create one free database.
#. Load :atlas:`sample data </sample-data/available-sample-datasets/>` 
   into your |service| database.
#. Add your IP address to your project's IP access list.
#. Create a MongoDB user for your |service| {+database-deployment+}.
#. Connect to your new {+database-deployment+} using the MongoDB Shell,
   {+mongosh+}.

You can also run ``atlas setup`` if you have an |service| account and
an organization/project but you haven't set up a {+cluster+}.

Complete The Prerequisites 
--------------------------

Before you begin, you must :ref:`install the {+atlas-cli+}<install-atlas-cli>`. 

Follow These Steps
------------------

Complete the following procedure to get started with |service|.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Run the ``atlas setup`` command in the terminal.

      .. code-block:: sh
      
         atlas setup
         
      After you run the command, enter :guilabel:`Y` to open the default browser. A browser window displays the :guilabel:`Create Your Account`
      screen.

      If you want to log into an existing |service| account, click
      :guilabel:`Log in now` and log in.

      If you're already logged into an existing |service| account,
      proceed to step 3.

   .. step:: Sign up and verify your account.

      Enter your account information and click :guilabel:`Sign Up`.
      Follow the prompts to verify your email or register using
      third-party authentication.

   .. step:: Verify your {+atlas-cli+} session.

      When you reach the :guilabel:`Activation` screen, copy the
      verification code from the {+atlas-cli+} and paste it into the
      browser. Then, click :guilabel:`Confirm Authorization` and return
      to the terminal window.

   .. step:: Accept the default {+cluster+} creation settings.

      After you verify your {+atlas-cli+} session, ``atlas setup``
      creates an ``M0`` cluster. ``M0`` clusters have some operational
      :ref:`limitations <atlas-free-tier>`.

      If you log into an existing account and have existing
      organizations and projects, ``atlas setup`` prompts you to select
      a default organization and default project. Select a default
      organization and project and press
      :guilabel:`Enter`.
      
      When the {+atlas-cli+} prompts ``Do you want to set up``
      ``your first free database in Atlas with default``
      ``settings? It's free forever!``, enter :guilabel:`Y` to create your {+cluster+} with the default settings.
            
      The command creates a sample ``M0`` shared-tier cluster with the 
      following default settings:
 
      - Cluster name: ``Cluster<number>``
      - Cloud provider and region: ``AWS - US_EAST_1``
      - Database Username: ``Cluster<number>``
      - Database User Password: ``abcdef12345``
      - Load Sample Data: ``Yes``
      - Allow connection from IP: ``<YourIPAddress>``
  
      .. io-code-block::
         
         .. input::
            :language: sh
            
            Do you want to set up your first free database in
            Atlas with default settings? It's free forever! Y

         .. output::
            :language: sh

            We are deploying Cluster9876543...

            Please store your database authentication access details in a secure location.
            Database User Username: Cluster9876543
            Database User Password: abcdef12345

            Creating your cluster... [Its safe to 'Ctrl + C']

Take the Next Steps
-------------------

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your |service| account.

Use the :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>` 
to connect to your cluster through {+mongosh+} or your application.

To view the status of your cluster, run the :ref:`atlas-clusters`
command.
