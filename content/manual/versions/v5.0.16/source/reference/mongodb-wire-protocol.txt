Introduction
------------

The MongoDB Wire Protocol is a simple socket-based, request-response
style protocol. Clients communicate with the database server through a
regular TCP/IP socket.

TCP/IP Socket
-------------

Clients should connect to the database with a regular TCP/IP socket.

Port
~~~~

The default port number for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances is 27017. The port number for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` is configurable and may vary.

Byte Ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All integers in the MongoDB wire protocol use little-endian byte order:
that is, least-significant byte first.

Messages Types and Formats
--------------------------

MongoDB uses the :ref:`OP_MSG <wire-op-msg>` opcode for both client
requests and database replies. There are several message formats used in
older versions of MongoDB which have been deprecated in favor of
``OP_MSG``.

.. note::

   - This page uses a C-like ``struct`` to describe the message
     structure.

   - The types used in this document (``cstring``, ``int32``, etc.) are
     the same as those defined in the `BSON specification
     <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_.

   - To denote repetition, the document uses the asterisk notation from
     the `BSON specification <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_.
     For example, ``int64*`` indicates that one or more of the
     specified type can be written to the socket, one after another.

   - The standard message header is typed as ``MsgHeader``. Integer
     constants are in capitals (e.g. ``ZERO`` for the integer value of
     0).

.. _wp-message-header:

Standard Message Header
-----------------------

In general, each message consists of a standard message header followed
by request-specific data. The standard message header is structured as
follows:

.. code-block:: c

   struct MsgHeader {
       int32   messageLength; // total message size, including this
       int32   requestID;     // identifier for this message
       int32   responseTo;    // requestID from the original request
                              //   (used in responses from db)
       int32   opCode;        // request type - see table below for details
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``messageLength``

     - The total size of the message in bytes. This total includes the
       4 bytes that holds the message length.

   * - ``requestID``

     - A client or database-generated identifier that uniquely
       identifies this message. For the case of client-generated
       messages (e.g. :ref:`OP_QUERY <wire-op-query>` and
       :ref:`OP_GET_MORE <wire-op-get-more>`), it will be returned in
       the ``responseTo`` field of the :ref:`OP_REPLY <wire-op-reply>`
       message. Clients can use the ``requestID`` and the
       ``responseTo`` fields to associate query responses with the
       originating query.

   * - ``responseTo``

     - In the case of a message from the database, this will be the
       ``requestID`` taken from the :ref:`OP_QUERY <wire-op-query>` or
       :ref:`OP_GET_MORE <wire-op-get-more>` messages from the client.
       Clients can use the ``requestID`` and the ``responseTo`` fields
       to associate query responses with the originating query.

   * - ``opCode``

     - Type of message. See :ref:`wp-request-opcodes` for details.

.. _wp-request-opcodes:

Request Opcodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   - Starting with MongoDB 2.6 and :data:`~hello.maxWireVersion` ``3``,
     MongoDB drivers use the :ref:`database commands<collection-commands>`
     :dbcommand:`insert`, :dbcommand:`update`, and :dbcommand:`delete`
     instead of ``OP_INSERT``, ``OP_UPDATE``, and ``OP_DELETE`` for
     acknowledged writes. Most drivers continue to use opcodes for
     unacknowledged writes.

   - In version 4.2, MongoDB removes the deprecated internal ``OP_COMMAND`` and
     ``OP_COMMANDREPLY`` protocol.

   - In version 5.0, MongoDB deprecates the following opcodes:

     - ``OP_REPLY``
     - ``OP_UPDATE``
     - ``OP_INSERT``
     - ``OP_QUERY`` [#op-query-footnote]_
     - ``OP_GET_MORE``
     - ``OP_DELETE``
     - ``OP_KILL_CURSORS``

     Instead of these opcodes, use :ref:`OP_MSG <wire-op-msg>`.

     .. [#op-query-footnote] 

        MongoDB 5.0 deprecates both ``OP_QUERY`` find operations and
        ``OP_QUERY`` commands. As an exception, ``OP_QUERY`` is still
        supported for running the :dbcommand:`hello` and ``isMaster``
        commands as part of the connection handshake.

MongoDB supports these ``opCode`` values:

Client Request Messages
-----------------------

.. _wire-op-msg:

OP_MSG
~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: MongoDB 3.6

``OP_MSG`` is an extensible message format designed to subsume the
functionality of other opcodes. This opcode has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   OP_MSG {
       MsgHeader header;          // standard message header
       uint32 flagBits;           // message flags
       Sections[] sections;       // data sections
       optional<uint32> checksum; // optional CRC-32C checksum
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Standard message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``flagBits``

     - An integer bitmask containing message flags, as described in
       :ref:`wire-msg-flags`.

   * - ``sections``

     - Message body sections, as described in :ref:`wire-msg-sections`.

   * - ``checksum``

     - An optional CRC-32C checksum, as described in
       :ref:`wire-msg-checksum`.

.. _wire-msg-flags:

Flag Bits
`````````

The ``flagBits`` integer is a bitmask encoding flags that modify the
format and behavior of ``OP_MSG``.

The first 16 bits (0-15) are *required* and parsers **MUST**
error if an unknown bit is set.

The last 16 bits (16-31) are *optional*, and parsers **MUST**
ignore any unknown set bits. Proxies and other message forwarders
**MUST** clear any unknown optional bits before forwarding messages.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 10 10 60

   * - Bit
     - Name
     - Request
     - Response
     - Description

   * - 0
     - ``checksumPresent``
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - The message ends with 4 bytes containing a CRC-32C [#f1]_
       checksum. See :ref:`wire-msg-checksum` for details.

   * - 1
     - ``moreToCome``
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - Another message will follow this one without further action from
       the receiver. The receiver **MUST NOT** send another message until
       receiving one with ``moreToCome`` set to 0 as sends may block,
       causing deadlock. Requests with the ``moreToCome``
       bit set will not receive a reply. Replies will only have this
       set in response to requests with the ``exhaustAllowed`` bit set.

   * - 16
     - ``exhaustAllowed``
     - |checkmark|
     -
     - The client is prepared for multiple replies to this request using
       the ``moreToCome`` bit. The server will never produce replies with
       the ``moreToCome`` bit set unless the request has this bit set.

       This ensures that multiple replies are only sent when the network
       layer of the requester is prepared for them.

       .. important::

          MongoDB 3.6 ignores this flag, and will respond with a single
          message.

.. _wire-msg-sections:

Sections
````````

An ``OP_MSG`` message contains one or more sections. Each section starts
with a ``kind`` byte indicating its type. Everything after the ``kind``
byte constitutes the section's payload.

The available kinds of sections follow.

Kind 0: Body
''''''''''''

A body section is encoded as a **single** :ref:`BSON object <bson-types>`.
The size in the BSON object also serves as the size of the section. This
section kind is the standard command request and reply body.

All top-level fields **MUST** have a unique name.

Kind 1: Document Sequence
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Type
     - Description

   * - int32
     - Size of the section in bytes.

   * - C String
     - Document sequence identifier. In all current commands this field
       is the (possibly nested) field that it is replacing from the body
       section.

       This field **MUST NOT** also exist in the body section.

   * - Zero or more BSON objects
     - - Objects are sequenced back to back with no separators.

       - Each object is limited to the ``maxBSONObjectSize`` of the
         server. The combination of all objects is not limited to
         ``maxBSONObjSize``.

       - The document sequence ends once ``size`` bytes have been consumed.

       - Parsers **MAY** choose to merge these objects into the body as
         an array at the path specified by the sequence identifier when
         converting to language-level objects.

.. _wire-msg-checksum:

Checksum
````````

Each message **MAY** end with a CRC-32C [#f1]_ checksum that covers all
bytes in the message except for the checksum itself.

Starting in MongoDB 4.2:

- :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell instances will exchange messages with
  checksums *if not* using TLS/SSL connection.

- :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, and
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell instances will skip the checksum if using
  TLS/SSL connection.
   
Drivers and older binaries will ignore the checksum if presented with
messages with checksum.

The presence of a checksum is indicated by the ``checksumPresent`` flag
bit.

.. _wire-op-update:

OP_UPDATE
~~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_UPDATE message is used to update a document in a collection. The
format of a OP_UPDATE message is the following:

.. code-block:: c

   struct OP_UPDATE {
       MsgHeader header;             // standard message header
       int32     ZERO;               // 0 - reserved for future use
       cstring   fullCollectionName; // "dbname.collectionname"
       int32     flags;              // bit vector. see below
       document  selector;           // the query to select the document
       document  update;             // specification of the update to perform
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``ZERO``

     - Integer value of 0.  Reserved for future use.

   * - ``fullCollectionName``

     - The full collection name; i.e. namespace. The full collection
       name is the concatenation of the database name with the
       collection name, using a ``.`` for the concatenation. For
       example, for the database ``foo`` and the collection ``bar``,
       the full collection name is ``foo.bar``.

   * - ``flags``

     - Bit vector to specify flags for the operation. The bit values
       correspond to the following:

       - ``0`` corresponds to Upsert. If set, the database will insert
         the supplied object into the collection if no matching
         document is found.

       - ``1`` corresponds to MultiUpdate.If set, the database will
         update all matching objects in the collection. Otherwise only
         updates first matching document.

       - ``2``-``31`` are reserved. Must be set to 0.

   * - ``selector``

     - BSON document that specifies the query for selection of the
       document to update.

   * - ``update``

     - BSON document that specifies the update to be performed. For
       information on specifying updates see the :doc:`Update
       Operations </tutorial/update-documents/>` documentation.

There is no response to an OP_UPDATE message.

.. _wire-op-insert:

OP_INSERT
~~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_INSERT message is used to insert one or more documents into a
collection. The format of the OP_INSERT message is

.. code-block:: c

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;             // standard message header
       int32     flags;              // bit vector - see below
       cstring   fullCollectionName; // "dbname.collectionname"
       document* documents;          // one or more documents to insert into the collection
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``flags``

     - Bit vector to specify flags for the operation. The bit values
       correspond to the following:

       - ``0`` corresponds to ContinueOnError. If set, the database
         will not stop processing a bulk insert if one fails (eg due to
         duplicate IDs). This makes bulk insert behave similarly to a
         series of single inserts, except lastError will be set if any
         insert fails, not just the last one. If multiple errors occur,
         only the most recent will be reported by getLastError.

       - ``1``-``31`` are reserved. Must be set to 0.

   * - ``fullCollectionName``

     - The full collection name; i.e. namespace. The full collection
       name is the concatenation of the database name with the
       collection name, using a ``.`` for the concatenation. For
       example, for the database ``foo`` and the collection ``bar``,
       the full collection name is ``foo.bar``.

   * - ``documents``

     - One or more documents to insert into the collection. If there
       are more than one, they are written to the socket in sequence,
       one after another.

There is no response to an OP_INSERT message.

.. _wire-op-query:

OP_QUERY
~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_QUERY message is used to query the database for documents in a
collection. The format of the OP_QUERY message is:

.. code-block:: c

   struct OP_QUERY {
       MsgHeader header;                 // standard message header
       int32     flags;                  // bit vector of query options.  See below for details.
       cstring   fullCollectionName ;    // "dbname.collectionname"
       int32     numberToSkip;           // number of documents to skip
       int32     numberToReturn;         // number of documents to return
                                         //  in the first OP_REPLY batch
       document  query;                  // query object.  See below for details.
     [ document  returnFieldsSelector; ] // Optional. Selector indicating the fields
                                         //  to return.  See below for details.
   }


.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``flags``

     - Bit vector to specify flags for the operation. The bit values
       correspond to the following:

       - ``0`` is reserved. Must be set to 0.

       - ``1`` corresponds to TailableCursor. Tailable means cursor is
         not closed when the last data is retrieved. Rather, the cursor
         marks the final object's position. You can resume using the
         cursor later, from where it was located, if more data were
         received. Like any "latent cursor", the cursor may become
         invalid at some point (CursorNotFound) – for example if the
         final object it references were deleted.

       - ``2`` corresponds to SlaveOk. Allow query of replica slave.
         Normally these return an error except for namespace "local".

       - ``3`` corresponds to OplogReplay. Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you 
         need not specify this flag because the optimization  
         automatically happens for eligible queries on the oplog. See 
         :ref:`oplogReplay <find-cmd-fields>` for more information.

       - ``4`` corresponds to NoCursorTimeout. The server normally
         times out idle cursors after an inactivity period (10 minutes)
         to prevent excess memory use. Set this option to prevent that.

       - ``5`` corresponds to AwaitData. Use with TailableCursor. If we
         are at the end of the data, block for a while rather than
         returning no data. After a timeout period, we do return as
         normal.

       - ``6`` corresponds to Exhaust. Stream the data down full blast
         in multiple "more" packages, on the assumption that the client
         will fully read all data queried. Faster when you are pulling
         a lot of data and know you want to pull it all down. Note: the
         client is not allowed to not read all the data unless it
         closes the connection.

       - ``7`` corresponds to Partial. Get partial results from a
         mongos if some shards are down (instead of throwing an error)

       - ``8``-``31`` are reserved. Must be set to 0.

   * - ``fullCollectionName``

     - The full collection name; i.e. namespace. The full collection
       name is the concatenation of the database name with the
       collection name, using a ``.`` for the concatenation. For
       example, for the database ``foo`` and the collection ``bar``,
       the full collection name is ``foo.bar``.

   * - ``numberToSkip``

     - Sets the number of documents to omit - starting from the first
       document in the resulting dataset - when returning the result of
       the query.

   * - ``numberToReturn``

     - Limits the number of documents in the first :ref:`OP_REPLY
       <wire-op-reply>` message to the query. However, the database
       will still establish a cursor and return the ``cursorID`` to the
       client if there are more results than ``numberToReturn``. If the
       client driver offers 'limit' functionality (like the SQL LIMIT
       keyword), then it is up to the client driver to ensure that no
       more than the specified number of document are returned to the
       calling application. If ``numberToReturn`` is ``0``, the db will
       use the default return size. If the number is negative, then the
       database will return that number and close the cursor. No further
       results for that query can be fetched. If ``numberToReturn`` is
       ``1`` the server will treat it as ``-1`` (closing the cursor
       automatically).

   * - ``query``
     - BSON document that represents the query. The query will contain
       one or more elements, all of which must match for a document to
       be included in the result set. Possible elements include
       ``$query``, ``$orderby``, ``$hint``, and ``$explain``.

   * - ``returnFieldsSelector``

     - Optional. BSON document that limits the fields in the returned
       documents. The ``returnFieldsSelector`` contains one or more
       elements, each of which is the name of a field that should be
       returned, and and the integer value ``1``. In JSON notation, a
       ``returnFieldsSelector`` to limit to the fields ``a``, ``b`` and
       ``c`` would be:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          { a : 1, b : 1, c : 1}

The database will respond to an OP_QUERY message with an
:ref:`OP_REPLY <wire-op-reply>` message.

.. _wire-op-get-more:

OP_GET_MORE
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_GET_MORE message is used to query the database for documents in a
collection. The format of the OP_GET_MORE message is:

.. code-block:: c

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;             // standard message header
       int32     ZERO;               // 0 - reserved for future use
       cstring   fullCollectionName; // "dbname.collectionname"
       int32     numberToReturn;     // number of documents to return
       int64     cursorID;           // cursorID from the OP_REPLY
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``ZERO``

     - Integer value of 0.  Reserved for future use.

   * - ``fullCollectionName``

     - The full collection name; i.e. namespace. The full collection
       name is the concatenation of the database name with the
       collection name, using a ``.`` for the concatenation. For
       example, for the database ``foo`` and the collection ``bar``,
       the full collection name is ``foo.bar``.

   * - ``numberToReturn``

     - Limits the number of documents in the first :ref:`OP_REPLY
       <wire-op-reply>` message to the query. However, the database
       will still establish a cursor and return the ``cursorID`` to the
       client if there are more results than ``numberToReturn``. If the
       client driver offers 'limit' functionality (like the SQL LIMIT
       keyword), then it is up to the client driver to ensure that no
       more than the specified number of document are returned to the
       calling application. If ``numberToReturn`` is ``0``, the db will
       used the default return size.

   * - ``cursorID``
     - Cursor identifier that came in the :ref:`OP_REPLY
       <wire-op-reply>`. This must be the value that came from the
       database.

The database will respond to an OP_GET_MORE message with an
:ref:`OP_REPLY <wire-op-reply>` message.

.. _wire-op-delete:

OP_DELETE
~~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_DELETE message is used to remove one or more documents from a
collection. The format of the OP_DELETE message is:

.. code-block:: c

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;             // standard message header
       int32     ZERO;               // 0 - reserved for future use
       cstring   fullCollectionName; // "dbname.collectionname"
       int32     flags;              // bit vector - see below for details.
       document  selector;           // query object.  See below for details.
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``ZERO``

     - Integer value of 0.  Reserved for future use.

   * - ``fullCollectionName``

     - The full collection name; i.e. namespace. The full collection
       name is the concatenation of the database name with the
       collection name, using a ``.`` for the concatenation. For
       example, for the database ``foo`` and the collection ``bar``,
       the full collection name is ``foo.bar``.

   * - ``flags``

     - Bit vector to specify flags for the operation. The bit values
       correspond to the following:

       - ``0`` corresponds to SingleRemove. If set, the database will
         remove only the first matching document in the collection.
         Otherwise all matching documents will be removed.

       - ``1``-``31`` are reserved. Must be set to 0.

   * - ``selector``

     - BSON document that represent the query used to select the
       documents to be removed. The selector will contain one or more
       elements, all of which must match for a document to be removed
       from the collection.

There is no response to an OP_DELETE message.

.. _wire-op-kill-cursors:

OP_KILL_CURSORS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The OP_KILL_CURSORS message is used to close an active cursor in the
database. This is necessary to ensure that database resources are
reclaimed at the end of the query. The format of the OP_KILL_CURSORS
message is:

.. code-block:: bash

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;            // standard message header
       int32     ZERO;              // 0 - reserved for future use
       int32     numberOfCursorIDs; // number of cursorIDs in message
       int64*    cursorIDs;         // sequence of cursorIDs to close
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``ZERO``

     - Integer value of 0.  Reserved for future use.

   * - ``numberOfCursorIDs``

     - The number of cursor IDs that are in the message.

   * - ``cursorIDs``

     - "Array" of cursor IDs to be closed. If there are more than one,
       they are written to the socket in sequence, one after another.

If a cursor is read until exhausted (read until :ref:`OP_QUERY <wire-op-query>`
or :ref:`OP_GET_MORE <wire-op-get-more>` returns zero
for the cursor id), there is no need to kill the cursor.

.. _wire-op-compressed:

OP_COMPRESSED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: MongoDB 3.4

Any opcode can be compressed and wrapped in an OP_COMPRESSED header.
The OP_COMPRESSED message contains the original compressed opcode
message alongside the metadata necessary to process and decompress it.

The format of the OP_COMPRESSED message is:

.. code-block:: bash

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;            // standard message header
       int32  originalOpcode;     // value of wrapped opcode
       int32  uncompressedSize;   // size of deflated compressedMessage, excluding MsgHeader
       uint8  compressorId;       // ID of compressor that compressed message
       char    *compressedMessage;  // opcode itself, excluding MsgHeader
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``MsgHeader``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``originalOpcode``

     - Contains the value of the wrapped opcode.

   * - ``uncompressedSize``

     - The size of the deflated ``compressedMessage``, which excludes
       the ``MsgHeader``.

   * - ``compressorId``

     - The ID of the compressor that compressed the message. A list of
       ``compressorId`` values is provided below.

   * - ``compressedMessage``

     - The opcode itself, excluding the ``MsgHeader``.

Each compressor is assigned a predefined compressor ID as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 25 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - compressorId
     - Handshake Value
     - Description

   * - ``0``

     - The content of the message is compressed using snappy.

   * - ``2``

     - zlib

     - The content of the message is compressed using zlib.

   * - ``3``

     - Reserved for future use.

Database Response Messages
--------------------------

.. _wire-op-reply:

OP_REPLY
~~~~~~~~

*Deprecated in MongoDB 5.0.*

The ``OP_REPLY`` message is sent by the database in response to an
:ref:`OP_QUERY <wire-op-query>` or :ref:`OP_GET_MORE
<wire-op-get-more>` message. The format of an OP_REPLY message is:

.. code-block:: bash

   struct {
       MsgHeader header;         // standard message header
       int32     responseFlags;  // bit vector - see details below
       int64     cursorID;       // cursor id if client needs to do get more's
       int32     startingFrom;   // where in the cursor this reply is starting
       int32     numberReturned; // number of documents in the reply
       document* documents;      // documents
   }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``header``

     - Message header, as described in :ref:`wp-message-header`.

   * - ``responseFlags``

     - Bit vector to specify flags. The bit values
       correspond to the following:

       - ``0`` corresponds to CursorNotFound. Is set when ``getMore`` is
         called but the cursor id is not valid at the server. Returned
         with zero results.

       - ``1`` corresponds to QueryFailure. Is set when query failed.
         Results consist of one document containing an "$err" field
         describing the failure.

       - ``2`` corresponds to ShardConfigStale. Drivers should ignore
         this. Only :binary:`~bin.mongos` will ever see this set, in which
         case, it needs to update config from the server.

       - ``3`` corresponds to AwaitCapable. Is set when the server
         supports the AwaitData Query option. If it doesn't, a client
         should sleep a little between getMore's of a Tailable cursor.
         Mongod version 1.6 supports AwaitData and thus always sets
         AwaitCapable.

       - ``4``-``31`` are reserved. Ignore.

   * - ``cursorID``

     - The ``cursorID`` that this OP_REPLY is a part of. In the event
       that the result set of the query fits into one OP_REPLY message,
       ``cursorID`` will be 0. This ``cursorID`` must be used in any
       :ref:`OP_GET_MORE <wire-op-get-more>` messages used to get more
       data, and also must be closed by the client when no longer
       needed via a :ref:`OP_KILL_CURSORS <wire-op-kill-cursors>`
       message.

   * - ``startingFrom``

     - Starting position in the cursor.

   * - ``numberReturned``

     - Number of documents in the reply.

   * - ``documents``

     - Returned documents.
