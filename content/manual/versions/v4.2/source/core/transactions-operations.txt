For transactions:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-crud.rst

Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
dropping a collection or an index, are not allowed in multi-document
transactions. For example, a multi-document transaction cannot include
an insert operation that would result in the creation of a new
collection. See :ref:`transactions-operations-ref-restricted`.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can update a document's shard key value
   (unless the shard key field is the immutable ``_id`` field) by
   issuing single-document update/findAndModify
   operations either in a transaction or as a :doc:`retryable write
   </core/retryable-writes>`. For details, see :ref:`update-shard-key`.
