cursor.skip()
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. method:: cursor.skip()

   Call the :method:`cursor.skip()` method on a cursor to control where MongoDB
   begins returning results. This approach may be useful in
   implementing "paged" results.

   .. note::

      You must apply :method:`cursor.skip()` to the cursor before
      retrieving any documents from the database.

   Consider the following JavaScript function as an example of the
   sort function:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      function printStudents(pageNumber, nPerPage) {
         print("Page: " + pageNumber);
         db.students.find().skip((pageNumber-1)*nPerPage).limit(nPerPage).forEach( function(student) { print(student.name + "<p>"); } );
      }

   The :method:`cursor.skip()` method is often expensive because it requires
   the server to walk from the beginning of the collection or index to
   get the offset or skip position before beginning to return
   result. As offset (e.g. ``pageNumber`` above) increases,
   :method:`cursor.skip()` will become slower and more CPU intensive. With
   larger collections, :method:`cursor.skip()` may become IO bound.

   Consider using range-based pagination for these kinds of
   tasks. That is, query for a range of objects, using logic within
   the application to determine the pagination rather than the
   database itself. This approach features better index utilization,
   if you do not need to easily jump to a specific page.
