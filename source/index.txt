The |k8s-op-full| enables `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__ to
manage typical lifecycle events for MongoDB that have strict policies
on data persistence and management. The Operator handles the creation
of MongoDB enterprise pods, coordinates configuration of MongoDB
deployments with |onprem-link|, and orchestrates MongoDB configuration
changes -- accomplished through the Kubernetes |api|, declarative
configuration in |yaml|, or other tooling.

The |k8s-op-full| works together with MongoDB |onprem|, which applies
final configurations to MongoDB clusters. When MongoDB is deployed and
running in Kubernetes, there are a number of tasks that may not relate
to Kubernetes operations. You can manage these tasks -- monitoring,
fine tuning database performance, database backups, index management,
etc. -- in |onprem|.

The Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions allow administrators to
configure resource types and access permissions in Kubernetes.
Developers deploy the MongoDB database in the same way as they deploy
the rest of the application services. DBAs can work within the familiar
|onprem| interface to help run MongoDB at optimal performance.
