Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-long+}, the
official driver for asynchronous stream processing. Download
the driver by following the :ref:`scala-install` guide, then set up a
runnable project by following the :ref:`scala-quickstart` guide.

- :ref:`scala-install`

- :ref:`scala-get-started`

- :ref:`scala-whats-new`

- :ref:`scala-tutorials`

- `Previous Versions Documentation <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/>`__

To access MongoDB by using Java instead of Scala, use the `Java Sync
Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/>`__ or
the asynchronous `Java Reactive Streams Driver
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/java/reactive-streams-driver/current/>`__.
