Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete a single document from a collection using the ``deleteOne()`` 
method on a ``MongoCollection`` object. The method accepts a query filter
that matches the document you want to delete. If you do not specify
a filter, MongoDB matches the first document in the collection. The 
``deleteOne()``` method only deletes the first document matched.

The ``deleteOne`` method returns an instance of ``DeleteResult`` which
contains information including how many documents were deleted as a result
of the operation.

If your delete operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``deleteOne()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes a single document from the ``movies``
collection of the ``sample_mflix`` database. The example uses the ``eq()`` 
filter to match movies with the title exactly matching the text
``'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie'``.

If you are using the **legacy API**, see the :doc:`FAQ </faq>` to determine 
what changes you need to make to this code example.

When you run the example, if the query filter you passed in your call to
``deleteOne()`` matches a document and removes it, you should see output
that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Deleted document count: 1

If your does query filter not match a document in your collection, no
documents are removed and your call to ``deleteOne()`` returns the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Deleted document count: 0
