Overview
--------

In this section, we show you how to call the write operations to **remove**
documents from a collection in your MongoDB database.

Delete
------

If you want to remove existing documents from a collection, you can
use ``deleteOne()`` to remove one document or ``deleteMany()`` for one or
more documents. These methods accept a query document that matches the
documents you want to delete.

You can specify the document or documents to be deleted by the
``deleteOne()`` or ``deleteMany()`` write operations in a JSON object as
follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const doc = {
     pageViews: {
       $gt: 10,
       $lt: 32768
     }
   };

To delete the first matching document using the ``deleteOne()`` method or
to delete all matching documents using the ``deleteMany()`` method, pass the
document as the method parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const deleteResult = await myColl.deleteOne(doc);
   const deleteManyResult = await myColl.deleteMany(doc);

You can print the number of documents deleted by the operation by
accessing the ``deletedCount`` field of the result for each of the
method calls above as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   console.dir(deleteResult.deletedCount);
   console.dir(deleteManyResult.deletedCount);

If the delete operation is successful, these statements print the number of documents
deleted by the associated operation.

examples for :doc:`deleteOne() </usage-examples/deleteOne>` and
