Change Standalone to WiredTiger
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engine of a
:term:`standalone` MongoDB instance to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`. It uses the :program:`mongodump` and
:program:`mongorestore` utilities to export and import data. Ensure that
these MongoDB package components are installed and updated on your
system.

.. note::

   Make sure you have sufficient drive space available for the
   :program:`mongodump` export file and the data files of your new
   :program:`mongod` instance running with WiredTiger.
