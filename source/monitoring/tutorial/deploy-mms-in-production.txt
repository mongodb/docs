=========================================
Deploy the Monitoring Agent in Production
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

For production deployments of |monitoring|, you will want to daemonize
the agent process and ensure that it restarts following a system restart.
Your operating system likely has a preferred method for managing daemon
processes.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must configure the networking rules of your deployment so that:

- the Monitoring Agent can connect to all :program:`mongod` and
  :program:`mongos` instances that you want to monitor.

.. only:: saas

   - the Monitoring agent can connect to ``mms.mongodb.com`` on port 443
     (i.e. ``https``.)

.. only:: hosted

   - the Monitoring agent can connect to |monitoring| server on port 443
     (i.e. ``https``.)

The |monitoring| server does not make *any* outbound connections to the agents
or to MongoDB instances. Any alerts set to check if your host is exposed to the
public Internet will attempt to connect to your servers occasionally as part of
a vulnerability check. See :doc:`/management/activity` to disable or create
these alerts and :ref:`Exposed Host Alerts FAQ <exposed-hosts-alert>` for
details about the alert.

Ensure all :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances are not
accessible to hosts outside your deployment.

Procedure

Next Steps
----------

Once the agent is running and configured to your satisfaction, see
:doc:`/monitoring/configuring`. Also see :doc:`/monitoring/usage`
for more information about the |monitoring| interface.

Additional Information
----------------------

The following resources provide documentation for creating control scripts:

- `Ubuntu Boot Up How To <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto>`_

- `Debian Linux Control/Init Scripts <http://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts>`_

- `Arch Linux rc.d Scripts <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Writing_rc.d_scripts>`_

Debian and Ubuntu Systems have an example control script located at
``/etc/init.d/skeleton`` that you can use as a template.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and related distributions (e.g. Fedora,
CentOS, etc.) provide example control scripts in the
``/usr/share/doc/initscripts-*/sysvinitfiles/`` directory.
