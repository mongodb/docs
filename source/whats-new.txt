.. _csharp-version-2.30:

What's New in 2.30
------------------

The 2.30 driver doesn't introduce new features or bug fixes. Its purpose is to ease
migration to v3.x of the {+driver-short+} by marking the public APIs that were removed in
v3.0 as obsolete.

.. _csharp-version-2.29:

What's New in 2.29
------------------

The 2.29 driver release adds support for {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 and
includes the following new features:

- Adds support for v2 of the Queryable Encryption range protocol.

- Adds support for range indexes for Queryable Encryption. For more information about
  Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>`
  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.29 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v2.29.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-2.28:

What's New in 2.28
------------------

.. warning:: Potential Breaking Change in v2.28

   - All {+driver-short+} components are strongly named. If your application
     has dependencies that reference multiple {+driver-short+}
     versions, you must create binding redirects to manage those dependencies.
     For more information, see :ref:`csharp-breaking-changes-2.28.0`.

The 2.28 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for additional numeric conversions involving ``Nullable<T>``.
- Adds support for the ``delegated`` option when using KMIP for :ref:`CSFLE or
  Queryable Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.28 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v2.28.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-2.27:

What's New in 2.27
------------------

The 2.27 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for the ``$sample`` aggregation operator.

- Implements the ``Equals()`` method for serializers in LINQ3.

- Ensures that read and write concerns are not applied to Atlas Search Index
  Helper commands to avoid errors.

- Disallows the use of the comma character in ``authMechanismProperties``
  connection string values when using the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication
  mechanism. 

- Fixes a translation bug that caused an error during serialization involving
  numbers of different sizes.

- Adds support for Linux distributions that use the ``libdl.so.2`` library.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.27 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v2.27.0>`.

  :ref:`csharp-mongodb-oidc-gcp-imds` in the Enterprise Authentication
  Mechanisms guide.

- Implemented signing of NuGet packages.

- Implemented read and write retries to other ``mongos`` instances when
  possible.

.. _version-2.25:
