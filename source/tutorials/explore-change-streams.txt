Follow this tutorial to learn how to create a change stream on a MongoDB
collection and observe the change events it creates.



Explore Change Streams
----------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Complete the Tutorial Setup

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/setup.rst

   .. step:: Connect to the Docker Container

      Create two interactive shell sessions on the tutorial Docker
      Container, each in a separate window.

      Run the following command from a terminal to start an interactive shell.

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      We will refer to this interactive shell as **ChangeStreamShell1** throughout this tutorial.

      Run the following command in a second terminal to start an interactive shell:

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      We will refer to this interactive shell as **ChangeStreamShell2** throughout this tutorial.

   .. step:: Open a Change Stream

      In **ChangeStreamShell1**, create a Python script to open a change
      stream using the PyMongo driver.

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         nano openchangestream.py

      Paste the following code into the file and save the changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/change-streams/openchangestream.py
         :language: python

      Run the Python script:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         python3 openchangestream.py

      The script outputs the following message after it starts successfully:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         Change Stream is opened on the Tutorial1.orders namespace.  Currently watching ...

   .. step:: Trigger a Change Event

      In **ChangeStreamShell2**, connect to MongoDB using ``mongosh``, the MongoDB
      shell, using the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         mongosh "mongodb://mongo1"

      After you connect successfully, you should see the following
      MongoDB shell prompt:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         rs0 [direct: primary] test>

      At the prompt, type the following commands:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: true

         use Tutorial1
         db.orders.insertOne( { 'test' : 1 } )

      After entering the preceding commands, switch to **ChangeStreamShell1** to view
      the change stream output, which should resemble the following:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/change-streams/output/change.json
         :language: json
         :copyable: true
         :emphasize-lines: 5

      To stop the script, press :kbd:`Ctrl+C`.

      By the end of this step, you've successfully triggered and observed a
      change stream event.

   .. step:: Open a Filtered Change Stream

      You can apply a filter to a change stream by passing it an aggregation
      pipeline.

      In **ChangeStreamShell1**, create a new Python script to open a filtered change
      stream using the PyMongo driver.

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         nano pipeline.py

      Paste the following code into the file and save the changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/change-streams/pipeline.py
         :language: python
         :copyable: true
         :emphasize-lines: 6

      Run the Python script:

      .. code-block:: python

         python3 pipeline.py

      The script outputs the following message after it starts successfully:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false

         Change Stream is opened on the Tutorial1.sensors namespace.  Currently watching for values > 100...

   .. step:: Observe the Filtered Change Stream

      Return to your **ChangeStreamShell2** session which should be connected to
      MongoDB using ``mongosh``.

      At the prompt, type the following commands:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use Tutorial1
         db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'temp', 'value':101 } )

      As indicated by the script output, the change stream creates a change
      event because it matches the following pipeline:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         [ { "$match": { "$and": [ { "fullDocument.type": "temp" }, { "fullDocument.value": { "$gte": 100 } } ] } } ]

      Try inserting the following documents in in **ChangeStreamShell2** to verify the
      change stream only produces events when the documents match the filter:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'temp', 'value': 99 } )
         db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'pressure', 'value': 22 } )

   .. step:: (Optional) Stop the Docker Containers

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/stop-containers.rst

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you created a change stream on MongoDB and observed the
output. The {+source-connector+} reads the change events from a change
stream that you configure, and writes them to a Kafka topic.

To learn how to configure a change stream and Kafka topic for a source
connector, proceed to the :ref:`<kafka-tutorial-source-connector>`
tutorial.
