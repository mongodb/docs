Security Checklist
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. |arrow| unicode:: U+27A4

This document provides a list of security measures that you should
implement to protect your MongoDB installation. The list is not meant
to be exhaustive.

Pre-production Checklist/Considerations
---------------------------------------

.. _checklist-auth:

|arrow| Enable Access Control and Enforce Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Enable access control and specify the authentication mechanism.
  You can use MongoDB's SCRAM or x.509 authentication mechanism or
  integrate with your existing Kerberos/LDAP infrastructure. Authentication
  requires that all clients and servers provide valid credentials
  before they can connect to the system.

  - :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`

.. _security-checklist-role-based-access-control:

|arrow| Configure Role-Based Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create a user administrator **first**, then create additional
  users. Create a unique MongoDB user for each person/application
  that accesses the system.
       
- Follow the principle of least privilege. Create roles that define the
  exact access rights required by a set of users. Then create
  users and assign them only the roles they need to perform their
  operations. A user can be a person or a client application.

  .. note::
  
     A user can have privileges across different databases. If a user
     requires privileges on multiple databases, create a single user
     with roles that grant applicable database privileges instead of
     creating the user multiple times in different databases.

  - :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles`

|arrow| Encrypt Communication (TLS/SSL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL for all incoming and outgoing
  connections. Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` components of a
  MongoDB deployment as well as between all applications and
  MongoDB.

|arrow| Encrypt and Protect Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Starting with MongoDB Enterprise 3.2, you can encrypt data in
  the storage layer with the WiredTiger storage engine's native
  :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest`.

- If you are not using WiredTiger's encryption at rest, MongoDB
  data should be encrypted on each host using file-system, device,
  or physical encryption (e.g. dm-crypt). Protect MongoDB data
  using file-system permissions. MongoDB data includes data files,
  configuration files, auditing logs, and key files.

- Collect logs to a central log store. These logs contain DB
  authentication attempts including source IP address.
       
       
|arrow| Limit Network Exposure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure that MongoDB runs in a trusted network environment and
  configure firewall or security groups to control inbound and
  outbound traffic for your MongoDB instances.

- Disable direct SSH root access.

- Allow only trusted clients to access the network interfaces and
  ports on which MongoDB instances are available.

  See also:

  - :doc:`/core/security-hardening` 

  - the :setting:`net.bindIp` configuration setting
     
  - the :setting:`security.clusterIpSourceWhitelist` configuration
    setting

  - the :ref:`authenticationRestrictions
    <db-createUser-authenticationRestrictions>` field to the
    :method:`db.createUser()` command to specify a per-user IP
    whitelist.


|arrow| Audit System Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Track access and changes to database configurations and data.
  `MongoDB Enterprise
  <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`_ 
  includes a system auditing facility that can record
  system events (e.g. user operations, connection events) on a
  MongoDB instance. These audit records permit forensic analysis
  and allow administrators to verify proper controls. You can set
  up filters to record specific events, such as authentication
  events.

  - :doc:`/core/auditing`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing`

|arrow| Run MongoDB with a Dedicated User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Run MongoDB processes with a dedicated operating system user
  account. Ensure that the account has permissions to access data
  but no unnecessary permissions.

  |

  See also: :doc:`/installation`

.. _security-checklist-javascript:

|arrow| Run MongoDB with Secure Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MongoDB supports the execution of JavaScript code for certain
  server-side operations: :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, :query:`$where`,
  :group:`$accumulator`, and :expression:`$function`. If you do
  not use these operations, disable server-side scripting by using
  the :option:`--noscripting <mongod --noscripting>` option on the
  command line.

- Keep input validation enabled. MongoDB enables input validation
  by default through the :setting:`net.wireObjectCheck` setting.
  This ensures that all documents stored by the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance are valid :term:`BSON`.

|arrow| Request a Security Technical Implementation Guide (where applicable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) contains
  security guidelines for deployments within the United States
  Department of Defense. MongoDB Inc. provides its STIG, upon
  request, for situations where it is required. Please `request a
  copy <http://www.mongodb.com/lp/contact/stig-requests>`_ for
  more information.

|arrow| Consider Security Standards Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For applications requiring HIPAA or PCI-DSS compliance, please
  refer to the `MongoDB Security Reference Architecture
  <https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-security-architecture>`_
  to learn more about how you can use the key security
  capabilities to build compliant application infrastructure.

Antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response Scanning 
------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/security/fact-antivirus-scan.rst

Periodic/Ongoing Production Checks
----------------------------------

- Periodically check for `MongoDB Product CVE
  <https://www.mongodb.com/alerts>`_ and upgrade your products .

- Consult the `MongoDB end of life dates
  <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy>`_ and upgrade your
  MongoDB installation. In general, try to stay on the latest
  version.

- Ensure that your information security management system policies
  and procedures extend to your MongoDB installation, including
  performing the following:

  - Periodically apply patches to your machine and review
    guidelines.

  - Review policy/procedure changes, especially changes to your
    network rules to prevent inadvertent MongoDB exposure to the
    Internet.

  - Review MongoDB database users and periodically rotate them.

Report Suspected Security Bugs
------------------------------

If you suspect that you have identified a security bug in any MongoDB products, 
please report the issue through the MongoDB `Bug Submission Form 
<https://www.mongodb.com/security>`_.
