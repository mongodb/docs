# library. Each YAML document has the following schema:
#
#    from: "the path to the redirected URL"
#    url-base: "the path to the new location for the resource"
#    type: "currently this script only supports 'redirect', and
#          ignores all documents with another type."
#    code: "the HTTP redirect code. Raises exception if not 301, 302, 303."
#    outputs: "a list of branches/paths beneath http://docs.mongodb.org/ to
#             place this redirect. 'all', 'before-<branch>' and
#             'after-<branch>' have special meaning.
#
# 'outputs' possibility:
#
# - 'all': generates redirects for all published branches, but *not* 'manual'. But giza will take care of manual as part of integration.yaml logic in redirects.py
#
# - '<branch>': generates redirects for a specific branch.
#
# - 'before-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that
#   reflect releases previous to the specified branch. (Inclusive.)
#
# - 'after-<branch>': generates redirects for all branches that
#   reflect releases after the specified branch. (Non-inclusive.)
#
# All paths are relative to the ``source/`` directory.
