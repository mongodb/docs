Definition
----------

.. method:: cursor.itcount()


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst


   Counts the number of documents remaining in a cursor.

   :method:`~cursor.itcount()` is similar to :method:`cursor.count()`, but
   actually executes the query on an existing iterator, exhausting its contents
   in the process.

   The :method:`~cursor.itcount()` method has the following
   prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find(<query>).itcount()

   .. seealso::

      :method:`cursor.count()`
