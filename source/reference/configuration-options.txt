Configuration File Options
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

Administrators and users can control :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` instances at runtime either directly from
:doc:`mongod's command line arguments </reference/program/mongod>` or using a
configuration file.

While both methods are functionally equivalent and all settings are
similar, the configuration file method is preferable. If you
installed from a package and have started MongoDB using your system's
:term:`control script`, you're already using a configuration file.

To start :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` using a config file,
use one of the following forms:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf
   mongod -f /etc/mongodb.conf
   mongos --config /srv/mongodb/mongos.conf
   mongos -f /srv/mongodb/mongos.conf

.. TODO What is the new form

   Declare all settings in this file using the following form:

   .. code-block:: sh

      <setting> = <value>

Ensure the configuration file uses ASCII encoding. :program:`mongod` does
not support configuration files with non-ASCII encoding, including UTF-8.
