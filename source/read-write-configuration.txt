Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **write concern**, **read concern**,
and **read preference** configurations to modify the way that MongoDB runs
create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on replica sets.

You can set these configurations at the following levels:

1. Client, which sets the default for all operation executions unless overridden
#. Transaction
#. Database
#. Collection

The preceding list is in increasing order of precedence. For example, if you set
read concerns at both the client and the database levels, the read
concern specified at the database level overrides the read concern at the
client level.

Write Concern
-------------

Write concern specifies the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for
write operations before the operation successfully returns. Operations that
don't specify an explicit write concern inherit the global default write concern
setting.

You can set the write concern by using the ``writeConcern()`` method on a
client or transaction, or by using the ``withWriteConcern()`` method
on a database or collection.

The ``writeConcern()`` and ``withWriteConcern()`` methods accept a
``WriteConcern`` instance as a parameter. You can specify the write concern by 
using one of the following values:

- ``WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED``: The write operation returns after the operation
  is written to memory.
- ``WriteConcern.W1``: The write operation returns after only the primary node acknowledges
  the write operation, without waiting for acknowledgement from secondary nodes.
- ``WriteConcern.W2``: The write operation returns after the primary node and
  at least one secondary node acknowledge the write operation.
- ``WriteConcern.W3``: The write operation returns after the primary node and
  at least two secondary nodes acknowledge the write operation.
- ``WriteConcern.MAJORITY``: The write operation returns after a majority of the
  replica set members acknowledge the write operation.
- ``WriteConcern.UNACKNOWLEDGED``: The write operation returns after the primary
  node processes the write operation.
- ``WriteConcern.JOURNALED``: The write operation returns after the primary node
  writes the data to the on-disk journal.

The following example sets the write concern to ``"majority"`` for an instance of
``MongoClient``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-write-concern-client
   :end-before: // end-write-concern-client
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

The following example sets the write concern to ``"majority"`` for a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-write-concern-collection
   :end-before: // end-write-concern-collection
   :language: java

.. note:: Collections and Databases are Immutable

   ``MongoDatabase`` and ``MongoCollection`` instances are immutable. When you
   set the write concern on a database or collection, the method returns a new
   instance and does not affect the original instance.

For more information about write concern, see :manual:`Write Concern
</reference/write-concern/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Read Concern
------------

Read concern specifies the following behaviors:

- Level of :manual:`causal consistency
  </core/causal-consistency-read-write-concerns>` across replica sets
- :manual:`Isolation guarantees </core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/>` maintained
  during a query

You can specify the read concern by using the ``readConcern()`` method on a
client or transaction, or by using the ``withReadConcern()`` method on
a database or collection. The ``readConcern()`` and ``withReadConcern()``
methods accept a single parameter that specifies the read concern level.

You can set the following read concern levels:

- ``ReadConcern.LOCAL``: The query returns the instance's most recent data. Provides no guarantee
  that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members.
- ``ReadConern.AVAILABLE``: The query returns the instance's most recent data.
  Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the
  replica set members. ``ReadConcern.AVAILABLE`` is not available for use with
  causally consistent sessions and transactions.
- ``ReadConcern.MAJORITY``: The query returns data that has been acknowledged by
  a majority of the replica set members.
- ``ReadConcern.LINEARIZABLE``: The query returns data that reflects all
  successful writes that completed prior to the start of the read operation.
  ``ReadConcern.LINEARIZABLE`` is not available for use with causally consistent
  sessions and transactions.
- ``ReadConcern.SNAPSHOT``: The query returns majority-committed data as it appears across shards, from a
  specific single point in the recent past.

For more information about the read concern levels, see :manual:`Read Concern
Levels </reference/read-concern/#read-concern-levels>` in the {+mdb-server+}
manual.

The following example sets the read concern to ``ReadConcern.MAJORITY`` for an instance of
``MongoClient``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-read-concern-client
   :end-before: // end-read-concern-client
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

The following example sets the read concern to ``ReadConcern.MAJORITY`` for a
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-read-concern-collection
   :end-before: // end-read-concern-collection
   :language: java

To learn more about read concern, see :manual:`Read Concern
</reference/read-concern>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Read Preference
---------------

Read preference determines which member of a replica set MongoDB reads when
running a query. You can set the read preference by using the ``readPreference()`` method
on a client or transaction, or by using the ``withReadPreference()``
method on a database or collection.

The ``readPreference()`` and ``withReadPreference()`` methods accept a read
preference mode as a parameter. You can set the read preference mode to one of
the following values:

- ``ReadPreference.primary()``: The query returns data from the primary node.
- ``ReadPreference.primaryPreferred()``: The query returns data from the primary node if
  available. Otherwise, the query returns data from a secondary node.
- ``ReadPreference.secondary()``: The query returns data from a secondary node.
- ``ReadPreference.secondaryPreferred()``: The query returns data from a secondary node if
  available, Otherwise, the query returns data from the primary node.
- ``ReadPreference.nearest()``: The query returns data from the node with the lowest
  network latency.

The following example sets the read preference to ``ReadPreference.secondary()``
for an instance of ``MongoClient``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-read-preference-client
   :end-before: // end-read-preference-client
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

The following example sets the read preference to ``ReadPreference.secondary()``
for a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-configuration.java
   :start-after: // start-read-preference-collection
   :end-before: // end-read-preference-collection
   :language: java

For more information about read preference, see :manual:`Read Preference
</core/read-preference/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
