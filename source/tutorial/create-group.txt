Manage Groups
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. index:: groups

Overview
--------

Groups provide users access to MMS and to deployments. Each group provides
access to a distinct set of deployments that share a Monitoring Agent.

You create the first MMS group when you register the first MMS user. Create
additional groups to monitor additional segregated systems or environments.
For example, your deployment might have two or more environments separated by
firewalls. In this case, you would need two or more separate MMS groups.

API and shared secret keys are unique to each group. Each group requires its
own Monitoring Agent with the appropriate API and shared secret keys. Within
each group, the agent needs to be able to connect to all hosts it monitors in
the group.

You can manage the users that have access to your |mms| :doc:`groups
</tutorial/create-group>` and assign :doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>` to
users to provide controlled access to MMS.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and cannot
monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a new group.
Having a second group makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second group and agent to monitor a different set of
MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate the hosts
within the MMS console. A user can only view data from the hosts monitored in
a single group at once.

After adding a second group, the MMS interface will have a drop-down list that
will allow you to change groups. Selecting a new group will refresh the
current page with the data available from the servers in this group.

When you create a new group, you are automatically added as the first user to
the group. The group is automatically assigned a set of :doc:`alert
configurations </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.
