Overview
--------

This guide describes the mechanisms you can use in the {+driver-short+} to authenticate
users to MongoDB.

.. important:: Percent-Encoding

   You must :wikipedia:`percent-encode <Percent-encoding>` a username and password before
   you include them in a MongoDB URI.

.. _c-scram-sha-256:

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

SCRAM-SHA-256, as defined by `RFC 7677 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7677>`__,
is the default authentication mechanism on MongoDB deployments
running MongoDB v4.0 or later.

To authenticate by using SCRAM-SHA-256, set the following connection options:

- ``username``: The username to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in the connection URI.
- ``password``: The password to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in the connection URI.
- ``authSource``: The MongoDB database to authenticate against. By default,
  the {+driver-short+} authenticates against the database in the connection
  URI, if you include one. If you don't specify an authentication database, it
  authenticates against the ``admin`` database.
- ``authMechanism``: Set to ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

You can set these connection options by using either a connection string or 
the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API. The following code example shows how to create a MongoDB
client that authenticates by using the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-scram-sha-256
         :end-before: // end-scram-sha-256

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-256-uri-api
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-256-uri-api

.. _c-scram-sha-1:

SCRAM-SHA-1
-----------

SCRAM-SHA-1, as defined by `RFC 5802 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5802>`__,
is the default authentication mechanism on MongoDB deployments
running MongoDB v3.6.

To authenticate with this mechanism, set the following connection options:

- ``username``: The username to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in the connection URI.
- ``password``: The password to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in the connection URI.
- ``authSource``: The MongoDB database to authenticate against. By default,
  the {+driver-short+} authenticates against the ``admin`` database.
- ``authMechanism``: Set to ``"SCRAM-SHA-1"``.

You can set these connection options by using either a connection string or 
the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API. The following code example shows how to create a MongoDB
client that authenticates by using the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-scram-sha-1
         :end-before: // end-scram-sha-1

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-1-uri-api
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-1-uri-api

.. _c-mongodb-x509:

MONGODB-X509
------------

If you compile the {+driver-short+} with TLS support, the {+driver-short+} can present
an X.509 client certificate to MongoDB to prove its identity during the TLS handshake. The
MONGODB-X509 authentication mechanism uses this certificate to authenticate the client.

To authenticate with this mechanism, perform the following steps:

1. Create a ``mongoc_ssl_opt_t`` structure. On this structure, set the ``pem_file`` field
   to the file path of the ``.pem`` file that contains your client certificate and private key.

#. In your connection URI, set the ``authMechanism`` connection option to ``"MONGODB-X509"``.

You can set this authentication method by using either a connection string or 
the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API. The following code example shows how to create a MongoDB
client that authenticates by using the MONGODB-X509 mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-x509
         :end-before: // end-x509

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-x509-uri-api
         :end-before: end-x509-uri-api

.. _c-mongodb-aws:

MONGODB-AWS
-----------

.. important::

   The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism requires MongoDB v4.4 or later.

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses AWS IAM (Amazon Web Services Identity and
Access Management) or AWS Lambda credentials to authenticate your application.
To use this mechanism to authenticate your application, first create a user with an
associated Amazon Resource Name (ARN) on the ``$external`` database. Then, specify the
``MONGODB-AWS`` authMechanism in the connection URI.

When you use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` mechanism, the {+driver-short+} attempts to
retrieve your AWS credentials from the following sources, in the order listed:

1. Named parameters passed to the connection URI
#. Environment variables
#. AWS EKS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity request
#. ECS container metadata
#. EC2 instance metadata

The following sections describe how to use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve credentials from
these sources and use them to authenticate your application.

.. _c-mongo-aws-connection-uri:

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, the {+driver-short+} checks whether you passed AWS credentials to the
``mongoc_client_t`` constructor as part of the connection
URI. To pass your credentials in the connection URI, set the following connection
options:

- ``username``: The AWS IAM access key ID to authenticate.
- ``password``: The AWS IAM secret access key.
- ``authMechanism``: Set to ``"MONGODB-AWS"``.

You can create a URI containing these connection options by using either a 
connection string or the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API. The following code example shows 
how to create a MongoDB client that authenticates by using the MONGODB-AWS
mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-connection-uri
         :end-before: // end-aws-connection-uri

      You can also include an AWS session token by passing it into the
      ``authMechanismProperties`` parameter:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: cpp
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-connection-uri-session
         :end-before: // end-aws-connection-uri-session

      .. include:: /includes/security/auth-properties-commas.rst

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-aws-connection-uri-api
         :end-before: end-aws-connection-uri-api

      You can also include an AWS session token by passing it into the
      ``authMechanismProperties`` parameter:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-aws-connection-uri-api-session
         :end-before: end-aws-connection-uri-api-session

.. _c-mongo-aws-environment:

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't include a username and password in your connection URI,
the {+driver-short+} tries to retrieve AWS credentials from the following
environment variables:

- ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``
- ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
- ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` (optional)

To use these environment variables to authenticate your application, first set
them to the AWS IAM values needed for authentication, as shown in the following
code example:

.. code-block:: sh

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS IAM access key ID>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS IAM secret access key>
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<AWS session token>

After you set these environment variables, set the ``authMechanism``
parameter in your connection URI to ``"MONGODB-AWS"`` by using either a 
connection string or the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API, as shown in the
following example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment-uri-api
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment-uri-api

.. _c-mongo-aws-ecs:

ECS Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application runs in an Elastic Container Service (ECS) container,
the {+driver-short+} can automatically retrieve temporary AWS credentials from an
ECS endpoint. To do so, specify the URI of the ECS endpoint in an environment variable called
``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI``, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<URI of the ECS endpoint>

After you set the environment variable, set the ``authMechanism``
parameter in your connection URI to ``"MONGODB-AWS"`` by using either a 
connection string or the ``mongoc_uri_t`` API, as shown in the
following example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment-uri-api
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment-uri-api

.. _c-mongo-aws-ec2:

EC2 Instance Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} can automatically retrieve temporary AWS credentials from an
Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instance. To use temporary credentials from
within an EC2 instance, set the ``authMechanism`` parameter in your connection
URI to ``"MONGODB-AWS"`` by using either a connection string or the
``mongoc_uri_t`` API, as shown in the following example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: mongo-client-settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment

   .. tab:: mongoc_uri_t API
      :tabid: mongo-url-builder

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
         :language: c
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: // start-aws-environment-uri-api
         :end-before: // end-aws-environment-uri-api

.. note::

   If you set any of the environment variables from the preceding AWS authentication
   methods, the {+driver-short+} attempts to retrieve credentials by using those
   methods before attempting to retrieve them from an EC2 instance. To attempt
   to retrieve credentials only from an EC2 instance, ensure that the
   environment variables are not set.

OIDC
----

The OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication mechanism allows you to authenticate to
MongoDB by using a third-party identity provider, such as Azure or Google Cloud
Platform (GCP). 

You can use this mechanism only when authenticating to MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB
Enterprise Advanced, and only when authenticating to {+mdb-server+} v7.0 or later.

.. tip:: OIDC Authentication

   To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas for OIDC authentication, see
   :ref:`Set up Workforce Identity Federation with OIDC <oidc-authentication-workforce>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
   
   For more information about using OIDC authentication with MongoDB, see
   :manual:`OpenID Connect Authentication </core/security-oidc/>` and
   :manual:`MongoDB Server Parameters </reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.oidcIdentityProviders>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following sections describe how to use OIDC authentication to
authenticate from various platforms.

Azure
~~~~~

If your application runs on an Azure VM, or otherwise uses the
`Azure Instance Metadata Service <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/instance-metadata-service>`__
(IMDS), you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in Azure
support.

The following example initializes a ``mongoc_client_t`` that uses OIDC authentication
with Azure:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/oidc-azure.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true

GCP
~~~

If your application runs on a Google Compute Engine VM, or otherwise uses the
`GCP Instance Metadata Service <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata>`__,
you can authenticate to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}'s built-in GCP
support.

The following example initializes a ``mongoc_client_t`` that uses OIDC authentication
with GCP:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/oidc-gcp.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true

Custom Callback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also provide a custom callback function to retrieve an OIDC token from
your identity provider, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/oidc-custom.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
