Update an Object
----------------

You can add, modify, or delete properties of a Realm object in the same way that
you would update any other JavaScript object. But, you must do it inside of a
:ref:`write transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`.

In the following example of a ``TaskItem`` component, we:

#. Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
#. Retrieve a task by calling ``useObject()`` with "Task" and the ``_id`` parameter of the component.
#. Create a component method ``incrementTaskProgress()`` that performs a write transaction and increments the task's ``progressMinutes``.
#. Render the task's ``name`` and ``progressMinutes`` in the UI.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the "increment" button that calls ``incrementTaskProgress()``.

.. tip:: Update Related and Embedded Objects
   
   To update a property of an :ref:`embedded object <react-native-embedded-objects>` or
   a :ref:`related object <react-native-relationships>`, modify the property with
   :mdn:`dot-notation or bracket-notation
   <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors>` as if it were in a
   regular, nested object.

.. _react-native-upsert-an-object:

Upsert an Object
----------------

To upsert an object within a write transaction, call :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.create()
<classes/Realm-1.html#create>` with the update mode set to ``modified``. The operation
either inserts a new object with the given primary key or updates an existing
object that already has that primary key.

.. note:: Upserting Requires ``Realm.create()``

   You **must** call ``Realm.create()`` within a write transaction to upsert an object. 
   This is different than creating a new :js-sdk:`Realm Objects <Realm.Object.html>` by
   calling the :mdn:`new <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new>` operator.

In the following example of a ``CreateTaskItem`` component we:

#. Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
#. Perform a write transaction, and :ref:`create <react-native-create-a-new-object>` a ``Task`` object with an ``_id`` value of ``1234``.
#. Call ``Realm.create()`` inside the write transaction to upsert a ``Task`` object by specifying the same ``_id`` and a different``progressMinutes`` and the update mode set to "modified".
#. Render the task's ``name`` and ``progressMinutes`` in the UI, showing the modified progress.

.. _react-native-bulk-update:

Bulk Update a Collection
------------------------

To apply an update to a collection of objects, iterate through the collection
(e.g. with :mdn:`for...of
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of>`). In the loop, update each object individually.

In the following example of a ``TaskDashboard`` component, we:

#. Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook
   within the component.
#. Retrieve all tasks in the realm instance by passing ``Task`` to the
   ``useQuery()`` hook.
#. Create a component method ``resetProgressOnAllTasks()`` that performs a
   write transaction. Within that write transaction, we bulk update all tasks
   by looping through them using ``for...of`` and set their
   ``progressMinutes`` to 0.
#. `Map <https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists>`__ through the tasks to
   render a list of ``Text`` components displaying each task's ``name`` and
   ``progressMinutes``.
