   The ability to provision MongoDB servers in :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web
   Services)` using |mms| has been retired.

   - Any existing clusters continue as they are.

   - :abbr:`DNS (Domain Name Service)` entries for any existing servers
     will continue to resolve to the same IP address that they currently
     resolve to until at least January 1, 2023. Servers that undergo a
     change of IP address due to maintenance or an instance stop/restart
     will no longer be resolvable via their ``mongodbdns.com`` hostname.

   - |mms| can manage hosts provisioned directly through :abbr:`AWS (Amazon
     Web Services)`. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-servers-automation`.

   - If you are interested in fully managed provisioning on 
     :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`, evaluate
     `MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`_.

If you want to continue using |cloud-short| to manage these deployments,
update the hostname for each host using one of the following methods for
a replica set:

- :ref:`rolling-resync-aws`
- :ref:`update-rs-hostnames`

Considerations
--------------

These procedures involve stepping down the old primary and triggering
at least one election for a new primary. All writes to the primary
fail during the period starting when the
:method:`rs.stepDown() <rs.stepDown>` method is received until either a
new primary is elected, or if there are no electable secondaries, the
original primary resumes normal operation. For MongoDB versions 4.0 and
earlier, all client connections are closed.
   
Consider performing this procedure during a maintenance window during
which applications stop all write operations to the cluster.

To learn more about elections, see
:ref:`step down behavior <rs.stepDown-behavior>` and
:ref:`replica-set-elections`.

Update a Replica Set's Hostnames

Follow the :ref:`replica-set-change-hostname-no-downtime` procedure in
the MongoDB manual.
