   :description: the fsync command flushes all pending writes from the storage layer to disk.

Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: fsync

   Flushes all pending writes from the storage layer to disk. When the ``lock``
   field is set to ``true``, it sets a lock on the server or cluster to prevent
   additional writes until the lock is released.

   .. |fsyncLockUnlock| replace:: the ``fsync`` and
      :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` commands
   .. include:: /includes/fsync-mongos

   As applications write data, MongoDB records the data in the storage layer
   and then writes the data to disk.

   Run ``fsync`` when you want to flush writes to disk.
   
   .. include:: /includes/checkpoints.rst

   .. include:: /includes/fsync-lock-command

   Use this command to block writes when you want to perform backup
   operations.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.fsyncLock` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip


Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        fsync: 1,
        lock: <Boolean>,
        fsyncLockAcquisitionTimeout: <integer>,
        comment: <any>
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``fsync``
     - integer
     - Enter "1" to apply :dbcommand:`fsync`.

   * - ``fsyncLockAcquisitionTimeoutMillis``
     - integer
     - Optional. Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds to wait to
       acquire locks. If the lock acquisition operation times out, the
       command returns a failed response.

       Default: ``90000``

       .. versionadded:: 7.0.2

   * - ``lock``
     - boolean
     - Optional. Takes a lock on the server or cluster and blocks all
       write operations. Each ``fsync`` with ``lock`` operation
       takes a lock.

   * - ``comment``
     - any
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/comment-content.rst

Impact on Larger Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 7.0.2

When the ``fsync`` command runs on :program:`mongos`, it performs the fsync
operation on the entire cluster. By setting the ``lock`` field to ``true``,
it sets a lock on the cluster, preventing additional writes.

To take a usable self-managed backup, before locking a sharded cluster:

- Ensure that no chunk migration, resharding, or DDL operations are active.

- Stop the balancer to prevent additional chunk migrations from starting.

Alternatives with Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :program:`mongod` has :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled, use
:ref:`a file system or volume/block level snapshot tool <backup-with-journaling>`
to create a backup of the data set and the journal together as a single unit.


Lock Count
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``fsync`` command returns a document includes a ``lockCount`` field. When
run on :program:`mongod`, the count indicates the number of fsync locks set on
the server.

When run on a sharded cluster, :program:`mongos` sends the fsync operation to
each shard and returns the results, which includes the ``lockCount`` for each.


.. note::

   If the ``lockCount`` field is greater than zero, all writes
   are blocked on the server and cluster. To reduce the lock
   count, use the :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` command.

Fsync Locks after Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fsync locks execute on the primary in a replica set or sharded cluster.

If the primary goes down or becomes unreachable due to network issues, the
cluster :ref:`elects <replica-set-elections>` a new primary from the available
secondaries. If a primary with an fsync lock goes down, the new primary does
**not** retain the fsync lock and can handle write operations. When elections
occur during backup operations, the resulting backup may be inconsistent or
unusable.

To recover from the primary going down:

#. Run the :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` command until the lock count reaches zero
   to release the lock on all nodes.

#. Issue the :dbcommand:`fsync` command to reestablish the fsync lock on the
   cluster.

#. Restart the backup.


Additionally, fsync locks are persistent. When the old primary comes online
again, you need to use the :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` command to release the lock
on the node.


Examples
--------

Fsync Lock
~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-fsync-lock-compatibility-command.rst

The ``fsync`` command can lock an individual :program:`mongod` instance or a
sharded cluster through :program:`mongos`. When run with the ``lock`` field
set to ``true``, the fsync operation flushes all data to the storage layer and
blocks all additional write operations until you unlock the instance or
cluster.

To lock the database, use the ``fsync`` command to set the ``lock`` field
to ``true``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsync: 1, lock: true } )

The operation returns a document that includes the status of the
operation and the ``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(1),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

When locked, write operations are blocked. Separate connections may continue
read operations until the first attempt at a write operation, then they also
wait until the sever or cluster is unlocked.


.. important::

   The fsync lock operation maintains a lock count.

   To unlock a server or cluster for writes, the lock count
   must be zero. That is, for the given number of times you perform an fsync
   lock, you must issue a corresponding number of unlock operations to unlock
   the server or cluster for writes.

Fsync Unlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To unlock a server of cluster, use the :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsyncUnlock: 1 } )

Repeat this command as many times as needed to reduce the lock count to zero.
Once the lock count reaches zero, the server or cluster can resume writes.

Check Lock Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the state of the fsync lock, use :method:`db.currentOp()`. Use
the following JavaScript function in the shell to test if the server or
cluster is currently locked:

.. code-block:: javascript

   serverIsLocked = function () {
                        var co = db.currentOp();
                        if (co && co.fsyncLock) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        return false;
                    }

After loading this function into your :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session,
call it with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   serverIsLocked()

This function will return ``true`` if the server or cluster is
currently locked and ``false`` if the server or cluster is not locked.
