   .. note::

      When selecting the `authorization success granularity <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`_
      of auditing for the ``authCheck`` event action, |service| does
      not support different selections for reads and writes. For example,
      you may not select :guilabel:`Successes and Failures` for :guilabel:`authCheck Reads`
      and :guilabel:`Failures` for :guilabel:`authCheck Writes`. If you
      select both :guilabel:`authCheck Reads` and :guilabel:`authCheck Writes`,
      |service| automatically applies your selected granularity to both.
