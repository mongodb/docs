In the general case, the upgrade from MongoDB 2.2 to 2.4 is a
binary-compatible "drop-in" upgrade: shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances and replace them with :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running
2.4. **However**, before you attempt any upgrade please familiarize
yourself with the content of this document, particularly the procedure
for :ref:`upgrading sharded clusters <2.4-upgrade-cluster>` and the
considerations for :ref:`reverting to 2.2 after running 2.4
<2.4-downgrade>`.

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklist
-------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

- For all deployments using authentication, upgrade the
  drivers (i.e. client libraries), before upgrading the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance or instances.

- To upgrade to 2.4 sharded clusters *must* upgrade following the
  :ref:`meta-data upgrade procedure <2.4-upgrade-cluster>`.

- If you're using 2.2.0 and running with :setting:`~security.authorization` enabled, you
  will need to upgrade first to 2.2.1 and then upgrade to 2.4. See
  :ref:`2.4-upgrade-auth-limitation`.

- If you have :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` documents
  (i.e. for :setting:`~security.authorization`) that you created before 2.4 you *must*
  ensure that there are no duplicate values for the ``user`` field in
  the :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection in
  *any* database.  If you *do* have documents with duplicate user
  fields, you must remove them before upgrading.

  See :ref:`2.4-unique-users` for more information.

.. _2.4-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.4 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shutdown your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary and restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`.


.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.4-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set from MongoDB 2.2 to MongoDB 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------

You can upgrade to 2.4 by performing a "rolling"
upgrade of the set by upgrading the members individually while the
other members are available to minimize downtime. Use the following
procedure:

#. Upgrade the :term:`secondary` members of the set one at a time by
   shutting down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and replacing the 2.2 binary
   with the 2.4 binary.  After upgrading a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance,
   wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
   before upgrading the next instance.
   To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

#. Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`rs.stepDown()` to
   step down the :term:`primary` to allow the normal :ref:`failover
   <replica-set-failover>` procedure.  :method:`rs.stepDown()`
   expedites the failover procedure and is preferable to shutting down
   the primary directly.

   Once the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed
   ``PRIMARY`` state, as observed in the output of
   :method:`rs.status()`, shut down the previous primary and replace
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the 2.4 binary and start the new
   process.

   .. note:: Replica set failover is not instant but will
      render the set unavailable to read or accept writes
      until the failover process completes. Typically this takes
      10 seconds or more. You may wish to plan the upgrade during
      a predefined maintenance window.

.. _2.4-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster from MongoDB 2.2 to MongoDB 2.4
---------------------------------------------------------

.. important:: Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.4 if **all** members
   of the cluster are currently running instances of 2.2. The only
   supported upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.0 is via 2.2.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Upgrading a :term:`sharded cluster` from MongoDB version 2.2 to 2.4
(or 2.3) requires that you run a 2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongos`
with the ``--upgrade`` option, described in
this procedure. The upgrade process does not require downtime.

The upgrade to MongoDB 2.4 adds epochs to the meta-data for all
collections and chunks in the existing cluster. MongoDB 2.2 processes
are capable of handling epochs, even though 2.2 did not require
them. This procedure applies only to upgrades from version 2.2. Earlier
versions of MongoDB do not correctly handle epochs. See
:ref:`2.4-sharded-cluster-meta-data-upgrade` for more information.

After completing the meta-data upgrade you can fully upgrade the
components of the cluster. With the balancer disabled:

- Upgrade all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the cluster.

- Upgrade all 3 :binary:`~bin.mongod` config server instances.

- Upgrade the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for each shard, one at a
  time.

See :ref:`2.4-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for more information.

.. _2.4-sharded-cluster-meta-data-upgrade:

Cluster Meta-data Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considerations
``````````````

Beware of the following properties of the cluster upgrade process:

- .. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-sharded-cluster-prereq.rst

- While the upgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
  collection meta-data. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
  perform:

  - :method:`sh.enableSharding()`,

  - :method:`sh.shardCollection()`,

  - :method:`sh.addShard()`,

  - :method:`db.createCollection()`,

  - :method:`db.collection.drop()`,

  - :method:`db.dropDatabase()`,

  - any operation that creates a database, or

  - any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
    way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list
    of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on
    the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the
    cluster meta-data.

- Once you upgrade to 2.4 and complete the upgrade procedure **do
  not** use 2.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes in
  your cluster. 2.0 process may re-introduce old meta-data formats
  into cluster meta-data.

The upgraded config database will require more storage space than
before, to make backup and working copies of the
:data:`config.chunks` and :data:`config.collections` collections.
As always, if storage requirements increase, the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
might need to pre-allocate additional data files. See
:ref:`faq-tools-for-measuring-storage-use` for more information.

.. _2.4-upgrade-meta-data:

Meta-data Upgrade Procedure
```````````````````````````

Changes to the meta-data format for sharded clusters, stored in the
:doc:`config database </reference/config-database>`, require a special
meta-data upgrade procedure when moving to 2.4.

Do not perform operations that modify meta-data while performing this
procedure. See :ref:`2.4-upgrade-cluster` for examples of prohibited
operations.

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-sharded-cluster-prereq.rst

   To check the version of your indexes, use :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()`.

   If any index **on the config database** is ``{v:0}``, you should
   rebuild those indexes by connecting to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` and
   either: rebuild all indexes using the
   :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` method, or drop and rebuild
   specific indexes using :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` and then
   :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`.  If you need to upgrade the
   ``_id`` index to ``{v:1}`` use :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`.

   You may have ``{v:0}`` indexes on other databases in the cluster.

#. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   :term:`sharded cluster`, as described in
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

   .. optional::

      For additional security during the upgrade, you can make a
      backup of the config database using :binary:`~bin.mongodump` or
      other backup tools.

#. Ensure there are no version 2.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes still active in the sharded
   cluster. The automated upgrade process checks for 2.0 processes,
   but network availability can prevent a definitive check. Wait 5
   minutes after stopping or upgrading version 2.0 :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   processes to confirm that none are still active.

#. Start a single 2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongos` process with
   :setting:`~sharding.configDB` pointing to the sharded cluster's :ref:`config
   servers <sharding-config-server>` and with the ``--upgrade``
   option.  The upgrade process happens before the
   process becomes a daemon (i.e. before
   :option:`--fork <mongos --fork>`.)

   You can upgrade an existing
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to 2.4 or you can start a new `mongos`
   instance that can reach all config servers if you need to avoid
   reconfiguring a production :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   Start the :binary:`~bin.mongos` with a command that resembles the
   following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongos --configdb <config servers> --upgrade

   Without the ``--upgrade`` option 2.4
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes will fail to start until the upgrade
   process is complete.

   The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
   during the upgrade process. If there are very many sharded
   collections or there are stale locks held by other failed processes,
   acquiring the locks for all collections can take
   seconds or minutes. See the log for progress updates.

#. When the :binary:`~bin.mongos` process starts successfully, the upgrade is
   complete. If the :binary:`~bin.mongos` process fails to start, check the
   log for more information.

   If the :binary:`~bin.mongos` terminates or loses its connection to the
   config servers during the upgrade, you may always safely retry the
   upgrade.

   However, if the upgrade failed during the short critical section,
   the :binary:`~bin.mongos` will exit and report that the upgrade will
   require manual intervention. To continue the upgrade process, you
   must follow the :ref:`upgrade-cluster-resync` procedure.

   .. optional::

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongos` logs show the upgrade waiting for the
      upgrade lock, a previous upgrade process may still be active or
      may have ended abnormally.  After 15 minutes of no remote
      activity :binary:`~bin.mongos` will force the upgrade lock. If you
      can verify that there are no running upgrade processes, you may
      connect to a 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos` process and force the lock
      manually:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo <mongos.example.net>

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getMongo().getCollection("config.locks").findOne({ _id : "configUpgrade" })

      If the process specified in the ``process`` field of this document
      is *verifiably* offline, run the following operation to force the
      lock.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getMongo().getCollection("config.locks").update({ _id : "configUpgrade" }, { $set : { state : 0 } })

      It is always more safe to wait for the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to
      verify that the lock is inactive, if you have any doubts about
      the activity of another upgrade operation.  In addition to the
      ``configUpgrade``, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` may need to wait for
      specific collection locks. Do not force the specific collection
      locks.

#. Upgrade and restart other :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes in the
   sharded cluster, *without* the ``--upgrade``
   option.

   See :ref:`2.4-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for more information.

#. :ref:`Re-enable the balancer
   <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`. You can now perform
   operations that modify cluster meta-data.

Once you have upgraded, *do not* introduce version 2.0 MongoDB
processes into the sharded cluster. This can reintroduce old meta-data
formats into the config servers. The meta-data change made by this
upgrade process will help prevent errors caused by cross-version
incompatibilities in future versions of MongoDB.

.. _upgrade-cluster-resync:

Resync after an Interruption of the Critical Section
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

During the short critical section of the upgrade that applies changes
to the meta-data, it is unlikely but possible that a network
interruption can prevent all three config servers from verifying or
modifying data. If this occurs, the :ref:`config servers
<sharding-config-server>` must be re-synced, and there may be problems
starting new :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes. The :term:`sharded cluster`
will remain accessible, but avoid all cluster meta-data changes until
you resync the config servers. Operations that change meta-data include:
adding shards, dropping databases, and dropping collections.

.. note::

   Only perform the following procedure *if* something (e.g. network,
   power, etc.) interrupts the upgrade process during the short
   critical section of the upgrade. Remember, you may always safely
   attempt the :ref:`meta data upgrade procedure
   <2.4-upgrade-meta-data>`.

To resync the config servers:

1. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   sharded cluster and stop all meta-data operations. If you are in the
   middle of an upgrade process (:ref:`2.4-upgrade-cluster`), you
   have already disabled the balancer.

#. Shut down two of the three config servers, preferably the last two listed
   in the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` string. For example, if your :setting:`~sharding.configDB`
   string is ``configA:27019,configB:27019,configC:27019``, shut down
   ``configB`` and ``configC``. Shutting down the last two config servers
   ensures that most :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances will have
   uninterrupted access to cluster meta-data.

#. :binary:`~bin.mongodump` the data files of the active config server
   (``configA``).

#. Move the data files of the deactivated config servers (``configB``
   and ``configC``) to a backup location.

#. Create new, empty :term:`data directories <dbpath>`.

#. Restart the disabled config servers with :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
   pointing to the now-empty data directory and :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
   pointing to an alternate port (e.g. ``27020``).

#. Use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to repopulate the data files on the
   disabled documents from the active
   config server (``configA``) to the restarted config servers on the new
   port (``configB:27020,configC:27020``). These config servers are now
   re-synced.

#. Restart the restored config servers on the old port, resetting the
   port back to the old settings (``configB:27019`` and ``configC:27019``).

#. In some cases connection pooling may cause spurious failures, as
   the :binary:`~bin.mongos` disables old connections only after attempted
   use. 2.4 fixes this problem, but to avoid this issue in version
   2.2, you can restart all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances (one-by-one,
   to avoid downtime) and use the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method
   before restarting each of the shard :term:`replica set`
   :term:`primaries <primary>`.

#. The sharded cluster is now fully resynced; however before you
   attempt the upgrade process again, you must manually reset the
   upgrade state using a version 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos`. Begin by
   connecting to the 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
   shell:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo <mongos.example.net>

   Then, use the following operation to reset the upgrade process:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getMongo().getCollection("config.version").update({ _id : 1 }, { $unset : { upgradeState : 1 } })

#. Finally retry the upgrade process, as in
   :ref:`2.4-upgrade-cluster`.

.. _2.4-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Upgrade Sharded Cluster Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have successfully completed the meta-data upgrade process
described in :ref:`2.4-upgrade-meta-data`, and the 2.4
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance starts, you can upgrade the other processes
in your MongoDB deployment.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the cluster, in any
  order.

- Upgrade all 3 :binary:`~bin.mongod` config server instances, upgrading
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, you can now :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`.

.. _2.4-upgrade-auth-limitation:

Rolling Upgrade Limitation for 2.2.0 Deployments Running with ``auth`` Enabled
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB *cannot* support deployments that mix 2.2.0 and 2.4.0, or
greater, components. MongoDB version 2.2.1 and later processes *can*
exist in mixed deployments with 2.4-series processes. Therefore you
cannot perform a rolling upgrade from MongoDB 2.2.0 to MongoDB
2.4.0. To upgrade a cluster with 2.2.0 components, use one of the
following procedures.

1. Perform a rolling upgrade of all 2.2.0 processes to the latest
   2.2-series release (e.g. 2.2.3) so that there are no processes in
   the deployment that predate 2.2.1. When there are no 2.2.0
   processes in the deployment, perform a rolling upgrade to 2.4.0.

2. Stop all processes in the cluster. Upgrade all processes to a
   2.4-series release of MongoDB, and start all processes at the same
   time.

Upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4
-----------------------

If you used a :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the 2.3 or 2.4-rc (release
candidate) series, you can safely transition these databases to 2.4.0
or later; *however*, if you created ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` indexes
using a :binary:`~bin.mongod` before v2.4-rc2, you will need to rebuild
these indexes. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.dropIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.dropIndex( "records_text" )

   db.records.ensureIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.ensureIndex( { records: "text" } )

.. _2.4-downgrade:

Downgrade MongoDB from 2.4 to Previous Versions
-----------------------------------------------

For some cases the on-disk format of data files used by 2.4 and 2.2
:binary:`~bin.mongod` is compatible, and you can upgrade and downgrade if
needed. However, several new features in 2.4 are incompatible with
previous versions:

- ``2dsphere`` indexes are incompatible with 2.2 and earlier
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

- ``text`` indexes are incompatible with 2.2 and earlier
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

- using a ``hashed`` index as a shard key are incompatible with 2.2 and
  earlier :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

- ``hashed`` indexes are incompatible with 2.0 and earlier
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

.. important:: Collections sharded using hashed shard keys, should
   **not** use 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, which cannot correctly
   support cluster operations for these collections.

   .. :issue:`SERVER_9776`

If you completed the :ref:`meta-data upgrade for a sharded cluster
<2.4-upgrade-cluster>`, you can safely downgrade to 2.2 MongoDB
processes. **Do not** use 2.0 processes after completing the upgrade
procedure.

.. note::

   In sharded clusters, once you have completed the :ref:`meta-data upgrade
   procedure <2.4-upgrade-cluster>`, you cannot use 2.0
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the same
   cluster.

   If you complete the meta-data upgrade, you can safely downgrade
   components in any order. When upgrade again, always
   upgrade :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances before :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

   **Do not** create ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` indexes in a cluster
   that has 2.2 components.

Considerations and Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you upgrade to MongoDB 2.4, and then need to run MongoDB 2.2 with
the same data files, consider the following limitations.

- If you use a ``hashed`` index as the shard key index, which is only
  possible under 2.4 you will not be able to query data in this
  sharded collection. Furthermore, a 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos` cannot
  properly route an insert operation for a collections sharded using a
  ``hashed`` index for the shard key index: any data that you insert
  using a 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos`, will not arrive on the correct shard
  and will not be reachable by future queries.

- If you *never* create an ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, you can
  move between a 2.4 and 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongod` for a given data set;
  however, after you create the first ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index
  with a 2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongod` you will need to run a 2.2
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>`
  option and drop any ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index.

Upgrade and Downgrade Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Downgrade and Upgrade
```````````````````````````

**Except** as described below, moving between 2.2 and 2.4 is a drop-in
replacement:

- stop the existing :binary:`~bin.mongod`, using the :option:`--shutdown
  <mongod --shutdown>` option as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data --shutdown

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

- start the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes with the same
  :setting:`~storage.dbPath` setting, for example:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

.. _2.4-downgrade-pdfile:

Downgrade to 2.2 After Creating a ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` Index
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you have created ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` indexes while running a
2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, you can downgrade at any time, by
starting the ``2.2`` :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the :option:`--upgrade
<mongod --upgrade>` option as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data/ --upgrade

Then, you will need to drop any existing ``2dsphere`` or ``text``
indexes using :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()`, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.dropIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.dropIndex( "records_text" )

.. warning::

   :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>` will run
   ``repairDatabase`` on any database where you have created
   a ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, which will rebuild *all*
   indexes.

Troubleshooting Upgrade/Downgrade Operations
````````````````````````````````````````````

If you do not use :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>`, when you
attempt to start a 2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongod` and you have created a
``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will return the
following message:

.. code-block:: none

   'need to upgrade database index_plugin_upgrade with pdfile version 4.6, new version: 4.5 Not upgrading, exiting'

While running 2.4, to check the data file version of a MongoDB
database, use the following operation in the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB('<databasename>').stats().dataFileVersion

The major data file [#pdfile-version]_ version for both 2.2 and 2.4 is
``4``, the minor data file version for 2.2 is ``5`` and the minor data
file version for 2.4 is ``6`` **after** you create a ``2dsphere`` or
``text`` index.

.. [#pdfile-version] The data file version (i.e. ``pdfile version``)
   is independent and unrelated to the release version of MongoDB.
