You can use the JDBC driver to connect to {+fdi+} and run SQL format 
queries on your {+fdi+} collections and views. The JDBC driver can 
be used to connect a Java application like a `Maven 
<https://maven.apache.org/>`__ project or a visualization tool like 
`Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__. To run SQL format queries, your 
collections or views must already have the relational schema set. See 
:ref:`query-with-sql` to learn more about automatically or manually 
generating and setting schemas for your collections and views. 

This page describes how to install and configure the JDBC driver for 
connecting to {+fdi+}.

Connect with Tableau

.. note:: 

   You can only connect to one database at a time. To query multiple 
   databases, you must create multiple connections or fully specified 
   SQL queries. When you use the JDBC driver to connect to {+fdi+} with 
   Tableau, you can only connect to the database specified in your 
   properties file.
