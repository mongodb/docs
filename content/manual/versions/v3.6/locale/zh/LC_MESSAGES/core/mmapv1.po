msgid ""
"MMAPv1 is MongoDB's original storage engine based on memory mapped files."
" It excels at workloads with high volume inserts, reads, and in-place "
"updates."

"MMAPv1 is not supported on big-endian architectures such as s390x. "
"MongoDB returns an error if you set MMAPv1 as the storage engine on a "
"big-endian system."

"Starting in MongoDB 3.2, the MMAPv1 is no longer the default storage "
"engine; instead, the :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` storage engine "
"is the default storage engine . See :ref:`3.2-storage-engine-"
"compatibility`."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:31
msgid ""
"In order to ensure that all modifications to a MongoDB data set are "
"durably written to disk, MongoDB, by default, records all modifications "
"to an on-disk journal. MongoDB writes more frequently to the journal than"
" it writes the data files."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-mmapv1-write-to-disk.rst:1
msgid ""
"In the default configuration for the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine "
"</core/mmapv1>`, MongoDB writes to the data files on disk every 60 "
"seconds and writes to the :term:`journal` files roughly every 100 "
"milliseconds."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-mmapv1-write-to-disk.rst:6

"To change the interval for writing to the data files, use the "
":setting:`storage.syncPeriodSecs` setting. For the journal files, see "

"These values represent the *maximum* amount of time between the "
"completion of a write operation and when MongoDB writes to the data files"
" or to the journal files. In many cases MongoDB and the operating system "
"flush data to disk more frequently, so that the above values represents a"
" theoretical maximum."

"The journal allows MongoDB to successfully recover data from data files "

msgid "Record Storage Characteristics"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:46
msgid ""
"All records are contiguously located on disk, and when a document becomes"
" larger than the allocated record, MongoDB must allocate a new record. "
"New allocations require MongoDB to move a document and update all indexes"
" that refer to the document, which takes more time than in-place updates "
"and leads to storage fragmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:55
msgid ""
"By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` so that every "
"document in MongoDB is stored in a *record* which contains the document "
"itself and extra space, or :term:`padding`. Padding allows the document "
"to grow as the result of updates while minimizing the likelihood of "
"reallocations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Record Allocation Strategies"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:66
msgid ""
"MongoDB supports multiple record allocation strategies that determine how"
" :binary:`~bin.mongod` adds padding to a document when creating a record."
" Because documents in MongoDB may grow after insertion and all records "
"are contiguous on disk, the padding can reduce the need to relocate "
"documents on disk following updates. Relocations are less efficient than "
"in-place updates and can lead to storage fragmentation. As a result, all "
"padding strategies trade additional space for increased efficiency and "
"decreased fragmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:75
msgid ""
"Different allocation strategies support different kinds of workloads: the"
" :ref:`power of 2 allocations <power-of-2-allocation>` are more efficient"
" for insert/update/delete workloads; while :ref:`exact fit allocations "
"<exact-fit-allocation>` is ideal for collections *without* update and "
"delete workloads."

msgid "Power of 2 Sized Allocations"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:88
msgid ""
"MongoDB 3.0 uses the power of 2 sizes allocation as the default record "
"allocation strategy for MMAPv1. With the power of 2 sizes allocation "
"strategy, each record has a size in bytes that is a power of 2 (e.g. 32, "
"64, 128, 256, 512 ... 2 MB). For documents larger than 2 MB, the "
"allocation is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 2 MB."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:94
msgid "The power of 2 sizes allocation strategy has the following key properties:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:97
msgid ""
"Can efficiently reuse freed records to reduce fragmentation. Quantizing "
"record allocation sizes into a fixed set of sizes increases the "
"probability that an insert will fit into the free space created by an "
"earlier document deletion or relocation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:102
msgid ""
"Can reduce moves. The added padding space gives a document room to grow "
"without requiring a move. In addition to saving the cost of moving, this "
"results in less updates to indexes. Although the power of 2 sizes "
"strategy can minimize moves, it does not eliminate them entirely."
msgstr ""

msgid "No Padding Allocation Strategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:115
msgid ""
"For collections whose workloads do not change the document sizes, such as"
" workloads that consist of insert-only operations or update operations "
"that do not increase document size (such as incrementing a counter), you "
"can disable the :ref:`power of 2 allocation <power-of-2-allocation>` "
"using the :dbcommand:`collMod` command with the :collflag:`noPadding` "
"flag or the :method:`db.createCollection()` method with the ``noPadding``"
" option."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:123
msgid ""
"Prior to version 3.0.0, MongoDB used an allocation strategy that included"
" a dynamically calculated :data:`padding <collStats.paddingFactor>` as a "
"factor of the document size."

msgid "Memory Use"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:132
msgid ""
"With MMAPv1, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory on the machine as"
" its cache. System resource monitors show that MongoDB uses a lot of "
"memory, but its usage is dynamic. If another process suddenly needs half "
"the server's RAM, MongoDB will yield cached memory to the other process."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:138
msgid ""
"Technically, the operating system's virtual memory subsystem manages "
"MongoDB's memory. This means that MongoDB will use as much free memory as"
" it can, swapping to disk as needed. Deployments with enough memory to "
"fit the application's working data set in RAM will achieve the best "
"performance."
