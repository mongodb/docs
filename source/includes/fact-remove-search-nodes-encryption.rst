   If you remove all Search Nodes, you lose 
   Search Node encryption with :ref:`customer-managed keys 
   <enable-search-node-encryption>`. Your data
   will still use |service|'s default encryption, but
   your search workloads and indexes will no longer be 
   encrypted with your customer-managed keys.
