===================================================
|fts| M0 ({+Free-Cluster+}), M2, and M5 Limitations
===================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The following limitations apply to |fts| on ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5``
clusters only:

- .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-shared-tier-limitations.rst
  
- When you reach the maximum number of indexes allowed for the cluster tier, 
  you can upgrade your cluster tier to create additional indexes. If you 
  upgrade your cluster tier, the indexes are rebuilt on the new cluster 
  tier. 

- An index definition JSON object cannot exceed 3KB in size.

- You cannot add analyzer definitions to your indexes on the cluster.
  The :guilabel:`Define Analyzers` button is visible, but disabled.
 
- Index builds with more than 300 fields fail.

- Lucene's default clause limit of 1024 applies to any ``BooleanQuery``
  created for searches.
