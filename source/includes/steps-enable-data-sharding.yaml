   There are a few possible errors that could happen when importing
   sharded collections.

   Overlapping ranges 
      |mms| does not support overlapped defined ranges.

      .. example::

         A compound shard key may appear to have overlapped ranges when
         it does not. This example explains the difference.

         A simple compound shard key comprises two integers with
         values between 1 and 10. The chunk ranges for a collection
         where each chunk is approximately 64 MB are:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 50,50

            * - min
              - max
            * - [$min, $min]
              - [1, 8]
            * - [1,8]
              - [3,1]
            * - [3,1]
              - [5,2]
            * - [5,2]
              - [5,10]
            * - [5,10]
              - [7,3]
            * - [7,3]
              - [$max,$max]

         The ranges are based on the two values *combined* (or
         compound) and *not* each value individually. The second value
         goes up and down in each chunk, but the combination always
         increases from minimum to maximum.

      You can use {+mongosh+} to resolve this issue on the 
      database directly.

      1. Check the :manual:`status of the shard ranges </reference/method/sh.status>`.

      2. Review the ranges for possible overlap.

      3. :manual:`Remove a Tag from the Shard Key Range </reference/method/sh.removeShardTag>`.

      4. :manual:`Add a new Tag to a Shard Key Range </reference/method/sh.addTagRange>`.

   Data type mismatch
      For each range, |mms| requires the minimum and maximum values of
      each field in a shard key to be the same BSON data type. A
      compound shard key in a range can use a different BSON type for
      each field in the key. |mms| verifies this when the sharded
      collections are imported and when ranges are created.

      .. note::
         The :guilabel:`Min` key and :guilabel:`Max` key are different
         data types and are the only exception to not mixing BSON data
         types in the range.

      You can use {+mongosh+} to resolve this issue on the database
      directly.

      1. Check the :manual:`status of the shard ranges </reference/method/sh.status>`.

      2. :ref:`check-types-in-shell` for the minimum and maximum values.

      3. :manual:`Remove a Tag from the Shard Key Range </reference/method/sh.removeShardTag>`.

      4. :manual:`Add a new Tag to a Shard Key Range </reference/method/sh.addTagRange>`.

   Data type invalid
      The minimum and maximum values for a range can only use eight BSON
      data types:

      * String
      * Integer
      * Double
      * Long
      * Date
      * Timestamp
      * ObjectId
      * MinKey / MaxKey

      .. seealso::
         Review information on the data types in the 
         `BSON specification <http://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`_.

      You can use {+mongosh+} to resolve this issue on the database
      directly.

      1. Check the :manual:`status of the shard ranges </reference/method/sh.status>`.

      2. :ref:`check-types-in-shell` for the minimum and maximum values.

      3. :manual:`Remove a Tag from the Shard Key Range </reference/method/sh.removeShardTag>`.
