"Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With "
"multiple copies of data on different database servers, replication protects "
"a database from the loss of a single server. Replication also allows you to "
"recover from hardware failure and service interruptions. With additional "
"copies of the data, you can dedicate one to disaster recovery, reporting, or"
" backup."
