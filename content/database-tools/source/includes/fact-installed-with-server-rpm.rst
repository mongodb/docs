.. note::

   If you have already installed the MongoDB Server via your system's
   package manager, you likely already have the {+dbtools-short+}
   installed. The following command will determine if the
   {+dbtools-short+} are already installed on your system:

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo yum list installed {+dbtools-pkg+}
