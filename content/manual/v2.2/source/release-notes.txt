Version Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three numbers in a MongoDB version:

``<major version number>.<release number>.<revision number>``

The second number, the release number, indicates release stability. An
odd release number indicates a release in a development series. Even
numbered releases indicate a stable, general availability, release.

Additionally, the three numbers indicate the following:

- ``<major version number>``: This rarely changes. A change to this number
  indicates very large changes to MongoDB.

- ``<release number>``: A release can include many changes, including
  new features and updates. Some changes may break backwards
  compatibility. See release notes for every version for compatibility
  notes. Even-numbered release numbers are stable
  branches. Odd-numbered release numbers are development branches.

- ``<revision number>``: This digit increments for every
  release. Changes each revision address bugs and security issues,

.. example:: Version numbers:

   - 1.0.0 : First stable release

   - 1.0.x : Bug fixes to 1.0.x. These releases carry low risk. Always
     upgrade to the latest revision in your release series.

   - 1.1.x : Development release. Includes new features not fully finished
     and other works-in-progress. Some things may be different than 1.0

   - 1.2.x : Second stable release. This is a culmination of the 1.1.x
     development series.
