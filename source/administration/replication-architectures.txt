Replication Architectures
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

There is no single :term:`replica set` architecture that is compatible
or ideal for every deployment or environment. Indeed the flexibility
of replica sets may be its greatest strength. This document outlines
and describes the most prevalent deployment patterns for replica set
administrators.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/administration/replica-sets`" and
   ":doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`."

Three Member Sets
------------------

The minimum *recommend* architecture for a :term:`replica set`
consists of:

- One :term:`primary <primary>` for the set.

- Two :term:`secondary members <secondary>`, which can become the
  primary at any time.

This makes :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` possible, and
ensures that there are two independent copies of the entire data set
at all times. Even if one member is inaccessible, the set will still
be able to elect another member as :term:`primary`, and continue
replication until the first member can recover.

.. note::

   The minimum *supported* configuration for replica sets includes one
   :term:`primary` node, one :term:`secondary` node, and one
   :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>`. The arbiter, requires fewer
   resources, and lowers the total cost of the replica set,
   at the cost of a great deal of redundancy and operational
   flexibility.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`."

Sets with More Than Three Members
---------------------------------

Add additional members to a replica set to increase redundancy or to
provide additional resources for distributing secondary read
operations.

In general, when deploying larger replica sets, ensure the following
architectural conditions are true:

- The set has an odd number of voting members.

  Deploy a single :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` if you have
  an even number of voting replica set members.

- The set has only 7 voting members at any time.

- Every member with a :data:`priority <members[n].priority>` greater
  than ``0`` can function as ``primary`` in a :term:`failover`
  situation. If a member does not have this capability (i.e. resource
  constraints,) set its ``priority`` value to ``0``.

- A majority of the set's members operate in the main data center.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`."

.. _replica-set-geographical-distribution:

Geographically Distributed Sets
-------------------------------

If you have infrastructure in more than one facility, you may want to
consider keeping one member of the replica set in a secondary
facility. Typically this member should have the :data:`priority
<members[n].priority>` :ref:`set <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`
to ``0`` to prevent the node from ever becoming primary.

In many circumstances, these deployments consist of the following:

- One :term:`primary <primary>` set member in the first (i.e. primary)
  data center.

- One :term:`secondary member <secondary>` in the first data center that
  can become primary at any time.

- One secondary node in another data center, that is ineligible to
  become primary (i.e. with a :data:`members[n].priority` value of
  ``0``.)

If the primary node should fail, the replica set will be able to elect a
new primary node as normal. If the connection between the data center
fails, any members in the second data center cannot become primary
independently, and the nodes in the primary data center will continue
to function.

If the primary data center fails, recovering from the database
instance in the secondary facility requires manual intervention. With
proper :term:`write concern` there will be no data loss and downtime
can be minimal.

For deployments that maintain three members the primary data center,
adding a node in a second data center will create an even number of
nodes, which may result in ties during elections for
:term:`primary`. In this situation deploy an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>` in your primary data center to ensure that a
primary is always electable.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/tutorial/deploy-geographically-distributed-replica-set`"

Hidden and Non-Voting Members
-----------------------------

In some cases it may be useful to maintain a member of the set that
has an always up-to-date copy of the entire data set, but that cannot
become primary. Often these members provide backups, support reporting
operations, or act as cold standbys. There are three settings relevant
for these kinds of nodes:

- **Priority**: These members have :data:`members[n].priority`
  settings so that they either cannot become :term:`primary`, or are
  *very* unlikely to become primary. In all other respects
  lower-priority nodes are identical any other replica set
  member. (:ref:`see also <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.)

- **Hidden**: These members cannot become primary *and* the set
  excludes them from the output of :func:`db.isMaster()` or the
  database command :dbcommand:`isMaster`, which prevents clients and
  drivers from using these nodes for secondary reads. (:ref:`see also
  <replica-set-hidden-members>`.)

- **Voting**: This changes the number of votes that a member of the
  set node has in elections for primary. In general use priority to
  control the outcome of elections, as weighting votes introduces
  operational complexities and risks set failure. Only modify the
  number of votes, if you need to have more than 7 members of a
  replica set. (:ref:`see also <replica-set-non-voting-members>`.)

.. note::

   All members of a replica set vote in elections *except* for
   :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>`
   members. Priority, hidden, or delayed status does not affect a
   member's ability to vote in an election.

Backups
~~~~~~~

For some deployments, keeping a replica set member for dedicated
backup purposes is operationally advantageous. Ensure this system is
close, from a networking perspective, to the primary node or likely
primary, and that the :term:`replication lag` is minimal or
non-existent. You may wish to create a dedicated :ref:`hidden node
<replica-set-hidden-members>` for the purpose of creating backups.

If this node has journaling enabled, you can safely use standard
:ref:`block level backup methods <block-level-backup>` to create a
backup of this node. Otherwise, if your underlying system does not
support snapshots, you can connect :program:`mongodump` to create a
backup directly from the secondary node. In these cases, use the
:option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to ensure a consistent
point-in-time dump of the database state.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/administration/backups`."

Delayed Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Delayed nodes <delayed member>` are special set members that
function in most cases like other replica set :term:`secondary`
members with the following operational differences: they are not
eligible for election to primary, do not receive secondary queries,
but *do* vote in :term:`elections <election>` for primary.

Delayed nodes, however, apply operations from the :term:`oplog` on a
delay, to provide running "historical" snapshot of the data set, or a
rolling backup. Typically these members provide protection against
human error, such as unintentionally deleted databases and
collections, or failed application upgrades or migrations.

See ":ref:`Replica Set Delayed Nodes <replica-set-delayed-members>` for
more information about configuring delayed nodes.

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~

Typically :term:`hidden nodes <hidden member>` provide a substrate for
reporting purposes, because the replica set segregates these instances
from the cluster. Since no secondary reads reach hidden members, they
receive no traffic beyond what replication requires. While hidden
nodes are not electable as primary, they are still able to *vote* in
elections for primary. If your operational parameters requires this
kind of reporting functionality, see ":ref:`Hidden Replica Set Nodes
<replica-set-hidden-members>`" and :data:`members[n].hidden` for more
information regarding this functionality.

Cold Standbys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some sets, it may not be possible to initialize a new members in a
reasonable amount of time. In these situations, it may be useful to
maintain a secondary with an up to date copy for the purpose of
replacing another node in the replica set. In most cases, these nodes
can be ordinary members of the replica set, but in large sets, with
varied hardware availability, or given some patterns of
:ref:`geographical distribution <replica-set-geographical-distribution>`,
you may want to use a node with a different :term:`priority`,
:term:`hidden <hidden member>`, or voting status.

Cold standbys may be valuable when your :term:`primary` and "hot
standby" :term:`secondaries <secondary>` members have a different
hardware specification or connect via a different network than the
main set. In these cases, deploy nodes with :term:`priority` equal to
``0`` to ensure that they will never become primary. These nodes will
vote in elections for primary, but will never be eligible for election
to primary. Consider likely failover scenarios, such as inter-site
network partitions, and ensure there will be members eligible for
election as primary *and* a quorum of voting members in the main
facility.

.. note::

   If your set already has ``7`` nodes, set the
   :data:`members[n].votes` value to ``0`` for these nodes, so that
   they won't vote in elections.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Secondary Only
   <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`," and ":ref:`Hidden Nodes
   <replica-set-hidden-members>`.

Arbiter Nodes
-------------

Always deploy an :term:`arbiter` to ensure that a replica set will
have a sufficient number of members to elect a :term:`primary`. While
having replica sets with 2 nodes is not recommended for production
environments, in these circumstances, and *any replica set with an
even number of members*, deploy an arbiter.

To add an arbiter, while connected to the *current primary* node in
the :program:`mongo` shell, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.addArb("[hostname]:[port]")

Because arbiters do not hold a copy of the data, they have minimal
resource requirements and do not require dedicated hardware. Do not
add an arbiter to a set if you have an odd number of voting nodes that
hold data, to prevent tied :term:`elections <election>`.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Arbiter Nodes <replica-set-arbiters>`,"
   ":setting:`replSet`," ":option:`mongod --replSet`, and
   ":func:`rs.addArb()`."
