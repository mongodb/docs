.. dbcommand:: removeShard

   Removes a shard from a :term:`sharded cluster`. When you run
   :dbcommand:`removeShard`, MongoDB drains the shard by using the balancer to
   move the shard's chunks to other shards in the cluster. Once the shard is
   drained, MongoDB removes the shard from the cluster.
   
   .. |command| replace:: ``removeShard``

Behavior
--------

You can only remove one shard at a time.
:dbcommand:`removeShard` returns an error if an existing
:dbcommand:`removeShard` operation is in progress.

Access Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You *must* run :dbcommand:`removeShard` while connected to a
:program:`mongos`. Issue the command against the ``admin`` database or
use the :method:`sh._adminCommand()` helper.

If you have :setting:`~security.authorization` enabled, you must have the
:authrole:`clusterManager` role or any role that
includes the :authaction:`removeShard` action.

Database Migration Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each database in a sharded cluster has a primary shard. If the shard you
want to remove is also the primary of one of the cluster's databases, then
you must manually move the databases to a new shard after migrating
all data from the shard. See the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command and
the :doc:`/tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster` for more information.

Chunk Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-remove-shard-balance-order.rst

Example
-------

From the :program:`mongo` shell, the :dbcommand:`removeShard`
operation resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { removeShard : "bristol01" } )

Replace ``bristol01`` with the name of the shard to remove. When you
run :dbcommand:`removeShard`, the command returns immediately,
with the following message:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "msg" : "draining started successfully",
       "state" : "started",
       "shard" : "bristol01",
       "ok" : 1
   }

The balancer begins migrating chunks from the shard named
``bristol01`` to other shards in the cluster. These migrations happens
slowly to avoid placing undue load on the overall cluster.

If you run the command again, :dbcommand:`removeShard` returns the
following progress output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "msg" : "draining ongoing",
       "state" : "ongoing",
       "remaining" : {
           "chunks" : 23,
           "dbs" : 1
       },
       "ok" : 1
   }

The ``remaining`` :term:`document` specifies how many chunks and databases
remain on the shard. Use :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` to list the
databases that you must move from the shard. Use the
:dbcommand:`movePrimary` to move databases.

After removing all chunks and databases from the shard, you can issue
:dbcommand:`removeShard` again see the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "msg" : "removeshard completed successfully",
       "state" : "completed",
       "shard" : "bristol01",
       "ok" : 1
   }
