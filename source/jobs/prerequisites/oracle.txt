To run sync jobs from an Oracle source database, the database may require 
some configuration changes. If Relational Migrator determines the 
database needs configuration changes, it automatically generates a 
SQL script with the required changes. It is recommended to have a 
Database Administrator (DBA) review the commands in this script and 
perform their execution on the database server. The 
Oracle configurations depend on the type of sync job:

:ref:`supported-databases`.

About this Task
---------------

- If you're migrating from an Oracle 12c instance, you must run commands as 
  the SYSDBA role.
- In Oracle 12c the concept of a pluggable database was introduced. Some
  of these commands can be run on PDB(plugable database) while commands 
  such as enabling ``ARCHIVELOG`` must be run on the
  CDB(container/master database). For details on each architecture, 
  see `Overview of Container Databases and Pluggable Databases
  <https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/multitenant-overview-container-database-cdb-12cr1>`__.
- Supplemental logging is not allowed in Oracle Express editions.

   .. tab:: Snapshot Jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Set up user permissions

            c. Grant additional permissions to the service account 
               to run continuous sync jobs:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  GRANT SET CONTAINER TO <user>;
                  GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO <user>;
                  GRANT LOGMINING TO <user>;
                  GRANT CREATE TABLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT LOCK ANY TABLE TO <user>;
                  GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO <user>; 
                  GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR TO <user>;
                  GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR_D TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOG TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOG_HISTORY TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOGMNR_LOGS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOGMNR_CONTENTS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOGMNR_PARAMETERS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$LOGFILE TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$ARCHIVED_LOG TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS TO <user>;
                  GRANT SELECT ON V$TRANSACTION TO <user>;

         .. step:: Turn on ``LogMiner`` at the database level
            
            To run continous jobs against Oracle, you must enable 
            ``LogMiner`` at the database level. The following code-block
            is an example of automatically-generated code, which you 
            can run manually by substituting your database name:

            .. code-block:: sql
                :copyable: true

                ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest_size = 10G;
                ALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '/opt/oracle/oradata/recovery_area' SCOPE=spfile;
                SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
                STARTUP MOUNT
                ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
                ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
            
            .. tip::

                To check if ``LogMiner`` is already enabled, run the 
                following query:

                .. code-block:: sql
                   :copyable: true

                    SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE; 
    
         .. step:: Enable supplemental logging

            a. To run continuous sync jobs against Oracle, you must 
               enable supplemental logging at the database level:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA; 

            #. You must also enable supplemental logging for every 
               table in the migration:

               .. code-block:: sql
                  :copyable: true

                  ALTER TABLE schemaName.tableName ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;
                  /* Additional ALTER TABLE STATEMENTS... */
