Overview
--------

In this guide, you will update data in MongoDB.

.. time:: 15

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

- Data inserted from :doc:`Insert Data into MongoDB </crud/insert>`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. tip::

         In this code block, there is a comment to replace the connection URI
         with your own. Replace the URI string with your own
         :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_update_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to query. In
      this case we will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection.

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_comets.rst

   .. step:: Update all documents in the ``comets`` collection.

      When you inserted documents into MongoDB, the ``Radius`` was in
      the metric system, while the other numeric fields were in the
      imperial system.

      The following example illustrates using a query filter to convert
      the ``Radius`` field from the metric system to the imperial system
      in all documents.

      .. include:: /includes/update_documents.rst

   .. step:: Display your results.

      The ``result`` contains some information about the update
      operation. To assure we updated documents, print the amount of
      documents the driver updated.

      .. include:: /includes/update_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_update_query.rst
