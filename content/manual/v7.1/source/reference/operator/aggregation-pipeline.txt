Aggregation Stages
==================

   :local:

   :class: singlecol

.. |fts-indexes| replace:: :atlas:`{+fts+} indexes </atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/#fts-indexes>`

In the :method:`db.collection.aggregate` method and
:method:`db.aggregate` method, :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipeline>` stages appear in an array. In the Atlas UI, you can arrange pipeline 
stages using the :ref:`aggregation pipeline builder <atlas-ui-agg-pipeline>`. Documents pass
through the stages in sequence.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: pipeline stages

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

db.collection.aggregate() Stages
--------------------------------

All stages except the :pipeline:`$out`, :pipeline:`$merge`,
:pipeline:`$geoNear`, :pipeline:`$changeStream`, and
:pipeline:`$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent` stages can appear multiple
times in a pipeline.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/operators-toc-explanation.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )

.. include:: /includes/extracts/agg-stages-db.collection.aggregate.rst

For aggregation expression operators to use in the pipeline stages, see
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`.

db.aggregate() Stages
---------------------

MongoDB also provides the :method:`db.aggregate` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )

.. include:: /includes/extracts/agg-stages-db.aggregate.rst

Stages Available for Updates
----------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use the aggregation pipeline for
updates in: 

.. include:: /includes/table-update-with-aggregation-availability.rst

For the updates, the pipeline can consist of the following stages:

.. include:: /includes/list-update-agg-stages.rst
