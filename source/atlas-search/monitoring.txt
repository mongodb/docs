The amount of CPU, memory, and disk resources that |fts| consumes
depends on several factors, including your index configuration and 
the complexity of your queries. :ref:`Atlas Search alerts
<atlas-search-alerts>` measure the amount of CPU and memory used by
|fts| processes. 

To fix and monitor |fts| issues, see the following pages:

- :ref:`Manage Atlas Search Alerts <atlas-search-alerts>`
- :ref:`review-atlas-search-metrics`

You can tag your |fts| to enable |service| to capture query analytics for
your search terms. You can then view metrics for your query terms in the 
{+atlas-ui+}. 

To tag your queries and view analytics, see the following pages:

- :ref:`fts-tracking-ref`
