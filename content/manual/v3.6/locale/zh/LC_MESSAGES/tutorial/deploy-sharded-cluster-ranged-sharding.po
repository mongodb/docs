"In ranged-based sharding, MongoDB automatically divides data into "
"contiguous ranges determined by the :term:`shard key` values. In this "
"model, documents with \"close\" shard key values are likely to be in the "
"same :term:`chunk` or :term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries "
"where read operations target documents within a contiguous range. "
"However, both read and write performance may decrease with poor shard key"
" selection. See :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`."
