MongoDB Cluster Management
``````````````````````````

- Supports managing, monitoring, and backing up MongoDB 7.0 deployments.
- Supports MongoDB 7.0 as a deployment option.

Backup
``````

- Exposes performance and snapshot metrics to admins.
  
  - Admins can now :ref:`use Prometheus <prometheus-integration-mms>`
    to view metrics graphs and query newly created collections in the 
    :ref:`admin-console`.

Alerting
````````

- Removes support for |snmp| alerts. 

  - You can monitor your clusters with |onprem| instead. To
    learn about other alert options, see :ref:`third-party-integrations`.

- Redacts third-party credentials.
  
  - |onprem| redacts credentials for third-party metrics and alert integrations 
    when you view or edit an alert through the UI or query third-party

    You can still edit these credentials. We recommend that you store these credentials outside of |onprem|.

  - Removes the ability to shard a collection, 
    manage the sharded cluster balancer, and manage sharded
