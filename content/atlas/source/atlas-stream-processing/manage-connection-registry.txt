Each {+SPW+} stores every configured connection to a streaming data
source or sink in its connection registry. The procedures on this page
walk you through creating and configuring your {+atlas-sp+}
connections.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

To create and configure connections, you must have the following:

- An |service| :ref:`project <manage-projects>`
- An |service| user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
  the :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role to manage a
  connection registry

  .. note::
     
     While both the :authrole:`Project Owner` and :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner`
     roles grant the privileges to create, view, edit and delete
     connections in the connection registry, the 
     :authrole:`Project Owner` role also allows users to perform tasks 
     such as creating database deployments, managing project access, and more. 

     See :ref:`Project Roles <project-roles>` to learn more about the 
     differences between these roles.

- An |service| {+cluster+}

Considerations
--------------

When configuring {+atlas-sp+} connections, ensure you select a
connection type suitable to your use case. {+atlas-sp+} supports the
following providers:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60 20

   * - Provider (:ref:`See note <asp-limitations>`)
     - Description
     - Connection Types

   * - Kafka Broker
     - Configurable server that receives and stores event streams,
       organizing them into partitioned topics.
     - Sink and Source

   * - {+service+} Clusters
     - Cloud-hosted MongoDB server providing both permanent storage
       and event-driven :ref:`Change Streams <changeStreams>`. 
     - Sink and Source

   * - {+aws+} |s3|
     - Object storage container hosted on {+aws+}.
     - Only Sink

   * - HTTPS
     - HTTPS request to retrieve data through an API
       endpoint each time a document passes through. {+atlas-sp+} then
       uses this data to enrich the document that triggered the request.  
     - Supplementary Source; must follow a :pipeline:`$source` stage.

   * - External Function Connections
     - {+atlas-sp+} supports embedding calls to `AWS Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`__ 
       resources within your {+atlas-sp+} pipeline. You can execute these calls 
       synchronously or asynchronously, and you can pass responses from synchronous calls 
       to subsequent stages in your pipeline. 

       To learn more, see the :ref:`{+atlas-sp+} External Functions <atlas-sp-agg-external-function>` 
       documentation.

.. tip::

   See :ref:`manual-timeseries-collection-limitations` for more information.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-add:

Add a Connection to the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

Each {+atlas-sp+} connection type has distinct configuration
requirements and procedures. To learn more, see :ref:`Add an Atlas
Stream Processing Connection <atlas-sp-add-connection>`.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-view:

View Connections in the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

To view a connection to your {+spw+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: view-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-list-and-describe.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: view-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-view-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: view-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides different endpoints for 
      retrieving one or all connections in a connection registry.

      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`View One Connection in a Connection Registry <getgroupstreamconnection>`

      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`List All Connections in a Connection Registry <listgroupstreamconnections>`

   .. tab:: ``mongosh``
      :tabid: view-connection-sh

      To list all available connections using ``mongosh``, use the
      ``sp.listConnections()`` method. It returns a list of documents
      describing each connection in the {+spw+}'s connection
      registry. It has the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sp.listConnections()

.. _manage-spi-connection-modify:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-modify:

Modify a Connection from the Connection Registry
------------------------------------------------

To modify a connection from a connection registry:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-edit-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for editing a 
      {+spw+}.

      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Update One Stream Connection <updategroupstreamconnection>`

.. _manage-spi-connection-delete:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-delete:

------------------------------------------------

To delete a connection from a connection registry:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: delete-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-delete-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: delete-connection-api
