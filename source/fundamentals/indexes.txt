   Atlas Search & Vector Search Indexes </fundamentals/indexes/atlas-search-indexes>

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to create
and manage **indexes**. Indexes are special data structures that improve
query performance in MongoDB.

If you perform a query on a collection without any indexes, MongoDB
scans every document to find matches. These collection scans are slow
and can negatively affect the performance of your application. When you
create an index that covers your query, MongoDB limits the number of
documents it inspects to find matches, which results in improved
performance. 

.. tip::

   You can use indexes in update operations, delete operations, and
   some aggregation pipeline stages. To learn more about using indexes
   in aggregations, see :manual:`Improve Performance with Indexes and Document Filters
   </core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/#improve-performance-with-indexes-and-document-filters>`
   in the Server manual.

Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the elements that you can include in a
MongoDB query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Element
     - Description

   * - Query
     - | *Required*
       | Specifies the fields and values to match

   * - Options
     - | *Optional*
       | Specify how the query executes

   * - Projection
     - | *Optional*
       | Specifies the fields that MongoDB returns in matched
         documents

   * - Sort
     - | *Optional*
       | Specifies the order of documents returned

When your query elements reference fields that are all included in the
same index, MongoDB can return results directly from the index.
These queries are called **covered queries**.

To learn how to ensure that your index covers your query, see
:manual:`Covered Query </core/query-optimization/#covered-query>` in
the Server manual.

.. important:: Sort Criteria

   Your sort criteria must match or invert the order of the index.

   Suppose a collection has the following index on the ``name`` field
   in ascending order (A-Z) and the ``age`` field in descending order (9-0):

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      name_1_age_-1

   MongoDB uses this index when you sort documents in either
   of the following configurations:

   - ``name`` ascending, ``age`` descending
   - ``name`` descending, ``age`` ascending

   If you specify the same sort order for both fields, MongoDB does not
   use the index and instead performs an in-memory sort.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve your query performance, create indexes on fields that appear
often in your queries. However, it is a good practice to track index
memory and disk usage for capacity planning, because each index consumes
disk space and memory. Additionally, if a write operation updates an
indexed field, MongoDB also must update the relevant index.

MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, so your application can query
against fields with unknown or variable names. If you are connected to
MongoDB Server version 4.2 or later, you can create wildcard indexes to
support these queries. To learn more about this index type, see
:manual:`Wildcard Indexes </core/indexes/index-types/index-wildcard/>`
in the Server manual.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports multiple index types to support your queries. The
following sections describe common index types and show how to create
each index type in a collection.

.. note:: Sample Collections
   
   The examples in this guide use collections from the Atlas sample
   data. To learn how to import this data, see the :atlas:`Load Sample
   Data </sample-data/>` tutorial in the Atlas documentation.

You can use the ``create_index()`` and
``create_indexes()`` methods to create indexes in a collection. The
``create_index()`` method takes an ``IndexModel`` struct parameter that
you can construct by using the type's ``builder()`` method.

To view a full list of index types, see
:manual:`Index Types </core/indexes/index-types>` in the Server manual.

.. _rust-single-field:

Single Field Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single field index holds a reference to a document field.

This index improves the performance of single field queries and sorts.
It also supports TTL indexes that automatically remove documents from a
collection after a certain amount of time. To learn more about TTL
indexes, see :manual:`TTL indexes </core/index-ttl/>` in the Server manual.

When you create a new collection, MongoDB automatically creates a
:ref:`unique <rust-unique>`, single field index on the ``_id`` field.

Example
```````

The following code creates an ascending index on the
``city`` field in the ``sample_training.zips`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
      :start-after: begin-single-field
      :end-before: end-single-field
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      city_1

.. _rust-compound:

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A compound index holds a reference to multiple document fields.

This index improves the performance of queries and sorts on multiple
fields. When you create a compound index, you must specify a direction for
each of the indexed fields.

You can create a multikey index by using the same syntax for creating a
:ref:`single field index <rust-single-field>`.

Example
```````

The following code creates a compound index on the
``city`` and ``pop`` fields in the ``sample_training.zips`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
      :start-after: begin-compound
      :end-before: end-compound
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      city_1_pop_-1

.. _rust-multikey:

Multikey Indexes (Array Field Indexes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A multikey index holds a reference to an array-valued field. This index
improves the performance of queries on array fields.

You can create a multikey index by using the same syntax for creating a
:ref:`single field index <rust-single-field>`.

Example
```````

The following code creates a multikey index on the
``tags`` field in the ``sample_training.posts`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
      :start-after: begin-multikey
      :end-before: end-multikey
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      tags_1

.. _rust-clustered:

Clustered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clustered indexes improve the performance of insert, update, and delete
operations on clustered collections. Clustered collections store
documents ordered by the clustered index key value. To learn more about
these collections, see :manual:`Clustered Collections
</core/clustered-collections/>` in the Server manual.

You can create a clustered index only when creating a collection.
To create a clustered collection, perform the following steps:

1. Create a ``ClusteredIndex`` instance.

#. Call the ``create_collection()`` method.

#. Chain the ``clustered_index()`` method to the ``create_collection()`` method,
   passing your ``ClusteredIndex`` instance as a parameter of ``clustered_index()``.

You must set the following fields of the ``ClusteredIndex`` struct:

- The ``key`` field, which specifies the key pattern. The value of this
  field must be ``{ _id: 1 }``.
- The ``unique`` field, which specifies the uniqueness of the index. The
  value of this field must be ``true``.

To create a ``ClusteredIndex`` instance that automatically uses the
required values, you can call the type's ``default()`` method.

Example
```````

The following code creates a clustered index with default configuration on the
``_id`` field when creating a new collection called ``items`` in the
``sample_training`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
   :start-after: begin-clustered
   :end-before: end-clustered
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. _rust-text:

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A text index supports text search queries on string content. This index
references a field with a string value or a string array value.
MongoDB supports text search for several languages. When you create a
text index, you can specify the default language as an option.

A collection can only contain one text index. To create a
text index on multiple text fields, you can create a :ref:`compound
index <rust-compound>`. When you run a text search after creating a
compound index, the search operation runs on all the text fields
in the compound index.

.. tip:: Atlas Full Text Search

   Text indexes are different from Atlas full text search indexes. To
   learn more about Atlas Search indexes, see the :ref:`rust-atlas-search-indexes`
   guide.

Example
```````

The following code creates a text index on the ``body`` field in the
``sample_training.posts`` collection. The code sets an option to specify
``"spanish"`` as the default language for the text index:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
      :start-after: begin-text
      :end-before: end-text
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      body_"text"

.. _golang-geo-indexes:

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries containing geospatial coordinate data by using
``2dsphere`` indexes. You can create a ``2dsphere`` index on a field
with GeoJSON object values.

This index type supports the following tasks:

- Queries on geospatial data to find inclusion, intersection, and proximity
- Calculation of distances on a Euclidean plane

.. important::

   You cannot create two geospatial indexes on the same field.

Example
```````

The following sample document in the ``sample_mflix.theaters``
collection contains the field ``location.geo``. This field has a GeoJSON
point value:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 7-11

   {
     "_id": ...,
     "theaterId": ...,
     "location": {
       "address": ...,
       "geo": {
         "type": "Point",
         "coordinates": [
           -93.24565,
           44.85466
         ]
       }
     }
   }

The following code creates a geospatial ``2dsphere`` index on the
``location.geo`` field in the ``sample_mflix.theaters`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
      :start-after: begin-geo
      :end-before: end-geo
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Created index:
      location.geo_"2dsphere"

.. _rust-unique:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A unique index ensures that the indexed fields do not store duplicate
values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique, single field index on the
``_id`` field when you create a collection.

To create a unique index, specify the field or combination of fields
that you want to maintain uniqueness for and set the ``unique`` option
to ``true``.

Example
```````

The following code shows how to set the ``unique`` field to ``true`` in an
``IndexOptions`` instance and pass these options when creating an
``IndexModel``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
   :start-after: begin-unique
   :end-before: end-unique
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

.. _rust-remove-index:

Remove an Index
---------------

You can remove, or drop, any indexes from a collection except the
default unique index on the ``_id`` field. To remove an index, pass the
name of the index to the ``drop_index()`` method.

.. tip:: Remove All Indexes
   
   You can remove all the indexes on a collection except for the
   ``_id`` index at once by using the ``drop_indexes()`` method.

The following example removes an index called ``city_1`` from the
``sample_training.zips`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/indexes/indexes.rs
   :start-after: begin-drop
   :end-before: end-drop
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
