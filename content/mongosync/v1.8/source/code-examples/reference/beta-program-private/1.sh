MongoDB restricts access to beta features via the beta build. Your use 
of the beta is governed by the language specified in the Cloud 
Subscription Agreement, Cloud Terms of Service, or other applicable 
agreement between you and MongoDB with respect to your use of 
mongosync.

You understand that features are available through the beta build, and 
flags are not generally available. All use of beta builds is at your own 
risk. Beta builds provide no stability guarantees; API, UI, options, and 
behaviors may change or be removed any time. MongoDB will never issue a 
Critical Advisory or notify about defects in beta builds. 

You should follow feature usage guidance provided by Field and R&D 
without deviation and should only use beta builds for one-time, human-
supervised migrations (e.g., not for continuous sync or automated 
migrations). Beta capabilities are not intended for use to migrate 
production workloads.
