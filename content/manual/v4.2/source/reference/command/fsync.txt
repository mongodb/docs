.. dbcommand:: fsync

   Forces the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process to flush all pending writes
   from the storage layer to disk and locks the *entire*
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to prevent additional writes until the
   user releases the lock with a corresponding
   :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock`. Optionally, you can use :dbcommand:`fsync`
   to lock the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and block write operations
   for the purpose of capturing backups.

   As applications write data, MongoDB records the data in the storage
   layer and then writes the data to disk within the :setting:`~storage.syncPeriodSecs`
   interval, which is 60 seconds by default. Run :dbcommand:`fsync` when
   you want to flush writes to disk ahead of that interval.
   

   The :dbcommand:`fsync` command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1, lock: <Boolean> }

   The :dbcommand:`fsync` command has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``fsync``
   
        - integer
   
        - Enter "1" to apply :dbcommand:`fsync`.
          
      * - ``lock``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. Takes a lock on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and blocks all
          write operations. Each :dbcommand:`fsync` with ``lock`` operation
          takes a lock.
          
          
   .. note::

      Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the MMAPv1-specific ``async`` option is
      obsolete and ignored.


   To run the :dbcommand:`fsync` command, use the
   :method:`db.adminCommand()` method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { fsync: 1, ... } )

Impact on Larger Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :dbcommand:`fsync` lock is only possible on *individual*
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances of a
sharded cluster, not on the entire cluster. To back up an entire sharded
cluster, please see :doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for
more information.

Alternatives with Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled,
please use :ref:`file system or volume/block level snapshot tool <backup-with-journaling>` to create a
backup of the data set and the journal together as a single unit.


``fsync`` with ``lock: true``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

   The ``{ fsync: 1, lock: true }`` command now returns a ``lockCount``
   in the return document.

After ``{ fsync: 1, lock: true }`` runs on a :binary:`~bin.mongod`, all
write operations will block. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides a
helper method :method:`db.fsyncLock()`.


.. note::

   The ``{ fsync: 1, lock: true }`` operation maintain a lock count.
   Each ``{ fsync: 1, lock: true }`` operation increments the lock
   count.

   To unlock a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for writes, the lock count
   must be zero. That is, for a given number of ``{ fsync: 1, lock:
   true }`` operation, you must issue a corresponding number of unlock
   operations in order to unlock the instance for writes. To unlock,
   see :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.

Examples
--------

Lock ``mongod`` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-fsync-lock-compatibility-command.rst

The primary use of :dbcommand:`fsync` is to lock the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance in order to back up the files within :binary:`~bin.mongod`\ 's :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.
The operation flushes all data to the storage layer and
blocks all write operations until you unlock the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

To lock the database, use the ``lock`` field set to ``true``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsync: 1, lock: true } )

The operation returns a document that includes the status of the
operation and the ``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(1),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

You may continue to perform read operations on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that has a
:dbcommand:`fsync` lock. However, after the first write operation all
subsequent read operations wait until you unlock the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. important::

   The ``{ fsync: 1, lock: true }`` operation maintain a lock count.

   To unlock a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for writes, the lock count
   must be zero. That is, for a given number of ``{ fsync: 1, lock:
   true }`` operation, you must issue a corresponding number of unlock
   operations in order to unlock the instance for writes.

Unlock ``mongod`` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To unlock the :binary:`~bin.mongod`, use :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fsyncUnlock();

Repeat the :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` to reduce the lock count to zero
to unlock the instance for writes.

Check Lock Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the state of the fsync lock, use :method:`db.currentOp()`. Use
the following JavaScript function in the shell to test if :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is
currently locked:

.. code-block:: javascript

   serverIsLocked = function () {
                        var co = db.currentOp();
                        if (co && co.fsyncLock) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        return false;
                    }

After loading this function into your :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell session
call it, with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   serverIsLocked()

This function will return ``true`` if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is
currently locked and ``false`` if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is not locked.
