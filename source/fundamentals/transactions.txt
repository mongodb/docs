Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to perform
**transactions**. :manual:`Transactions </core/transactions/>` allow
you to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the
transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction returns an
error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards all data changes
before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
:manual:`session </reference/server-sessions/>` is a grouping of related
read or write operations that you intend to run sequentially. Sessions
enable :manual:`causal consistency
</core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#causal-consistency>` for a
group of operations or allow you to execute operations in an
:website:`ACID transaction </basics/acid-transactions>`. MongoDB
guarantees that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a
``MongoClient`` instance as an ``IClientSession`` type. We recommend that you reuse
your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
instantiating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use an ``IClientSession`` only with the ``MongoClient`` (or associated
   ``MongoDatabase`` or ``MongoCollection``) that created it. Using an
   ``IClientSession`` with a different ``MongoClient`` results in operation
   errors.

Methods
-------

Create an ``IClientSession`` by using either the synchronous ``StartSession()`` or
the asynchronous ``StartSessionAsync()`` method on your ``MongoClient`` instance. 
You can then modify the session state by using the method set
provided by the ``IClientSession`` interface. Select from the following
:guilabel:`Synchronous Methods` and :guilabel:`Asynchronous Methods`
tabs to learn about the methods to manage your transaction:

            * - Method
              - Description

            * - ``StartTransaction()``
              - | Starts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on
                  this session. Throws an exception if there is already
                  a transaction in progress for the session. To learn more about
                  this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction() page
                  </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.

                | **Parameter**: ``TransactionOptions`` (optional)

            * - ``AbortTransaction()``
              - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Throws an exception
                  if there is no active transaction for the session or the
                  transaction has been committed or ended. To learn more about
                  this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction() page
                  </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
                |
                | **Parameter**: ``CancellationToken``

            * - ``CommitTransaction()``
              - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Throws an exception
                  if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
                  transaction was ended. To learn more about
                  this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction() page
                  </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
                |
                | **Parameter**: ``CancellationToken``

            * - ``WithTransaction()``
              - | Starts a transaction on this session and runs the given callback. To
                  learn more about this method, see the :manual:`withTransaction() page
                  </reference/method/Session.withTransaction/>` in the Server manual.

                :gold:`IMPORTANT:` When catching exceptions within the
                callback function used by
                ``WithTransaction()``, you  **must** rethrow the exception before
                exiting the try-catch block. Failing to do so can result in an
                infinite loop. For further details on how to handle exceptions in this
                case, see :manual:`Transactions </core/transactions/>` in the Server
                manual and select :guilabel:`C#` from the language dropdown to view

Example
-------

This example shows how you can create a session, create a
transaction, and insert documents into multiple collections within the transaction
through the following steps:

1. Create a session from the client by using the ``StartSession()`` method.
#. Use the ``StartTransaction()`` method to start a transaction.
#. Insert documents into the ``books`` and ``films`` collections.
#. Commit the transaction by using the ``CommitTransaction()`` method.

      If you're using {+mdb-server+} v8.0 or later, you can perform
      write operations on multiple namespaces within a single transaction by using
      the ``BulkWrite()`` or ``BulkWriteAsync()`` method. For more information,
      see :ref:`<csharp-bulk-write>`.
