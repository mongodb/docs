You can update a mapping rule after it is created. Edited mapping rules take 
effect the next time a migration job is run.

About this Task
---------------

Options available on the :guilabel:`edit` pane depend on the type of 
mapping rule you are editing. For an overview of each mapping rule 
option, see:

- :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>`

- :ref:`Embedded Array <rm-embedded-array>`

- :ref:`Embedded Documents <rm-embedded-documents>`

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane or :guilabel:`Diagram` view.

#. From the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, 
   click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon.

#. Define the options for the mapping rule. When defining the 
   mapping rule, you can:

   - Change the collection name. 
   - Change field names.
   - To include or exclude a field from your migration job, click the
     :icon-fa5:`check-square` icon next to the field name.

#. Optionally, if you want to select a BSON type or set null handling 
   rules for your mapping rule:

   I. Click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-left` icon next to the field 
      you want to customize.

   II. Select a :guilabel:`BSON type`.

   III. Select a :guilabel:`Null handling` option.

   - :guilabel:`Insert as null`: preserves null values, and nulls 
     are inserted into your destination collection.
   - :guilabel:`Omit`: skips any null values, and nulls are not 
     inserted into the destination collection.

   You can view a field's :guilabel:`Original name` and 
   :guilabel:`Original type` in the expanded customized field menu.

   .. note::

      For additional details on field customization and data type conversions,
      see :ref:`field customizations <rm-field-customizations>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close` to save your edits.
