Dashboards
==========

With |monitoring| dashboards, you can create customized collections of charts
for easier data analysis. You can configure |monitoring| to automatically load a
dashboard rather than the Hosts page from the MMS settings page.

You can create multiple dashboards as your needs dictate. Use the plus
icon at the top of the page to specify a name and create a new
dashboard, or select "New Dashboard..." when adding a chart to a
dashboard . You can rename or remove a dashboard from links on the
bottom of a dashboard page. Dashboards have the same :ref:`chart
controls <chart-controls>` as the host statistics pages.

Adding and Removing Charts from Dashboards
------------------------------------------

You can add any |monitoring| chart to any dashboard by selecting 
the plus sign (i.e. "``+``") in the chart toolbar of the desired chart
on the Host Statistics page.

To remove a chart from a dashboard, navigate to the dashboard and
select the "``x``" icon in the chart toolbar.

Advanced Dashboard Creation
---------------------------

When adding a new dashboard, you can select the "``+ ADD CHART``" button
to create a dashboard that includes a custom
selection of charts, or a collection of charts from a dynamically
assembled list of hosts. From this page, you may create new dashboards
or append new charts to existing dashboards. You can filter the
included processes by :ref:`host type <host-types>`.

Specify the list of hosts to include in this dashboard by selecting a
replica set or shard cluster or writing a regular expression to match
monitored processes' hostnames. If checked, the "Host Alias In Regexp"
check box allows you to use the regular expression to select the
*aliased* hostname you configured, rather than the actual hostname.
Below the host configuration options you may toggle an option to "group
hosts in chart," which creates a single composite chart for all
matching charts.

Below this, there are 17 chart types that you can use to select charts
for this dashboard. Below the chart selection, the final row of
buttons allows you to: (optionally) test the "host regexp" to ensure
that your regular expression is sufficiently selective; preview the
charts that this operation will add to the dashboard; and submit these
changes to the dashboards.

You can add and remove charts to these dashboards manually. You may
also add additional charts using the "advanced create dashboard"
functionality by specifying an existing dashboard in the
first field.
