=============
Run a Command
=============

You can run all raw database operations using the
``MongoDatabase.runCommand()`` method. A raw database operation is a
command you can execute directly on the {+mdb-server+} CLI. These
commands include administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching
server stats or initializing a replica set. Call the ``runCommand()``
method with a ``Bson`` command object on an instance of a ``MongoDatabase``
to run your raw database operation.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   We recommend using driver methods instead of executing database
   commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()``
   method inside the shell is the preferred way to issue database
   commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell and
   drivers.

The ``runCommand()`` method accepts a command in the form of a ``Bson`` object.
By default, ``runCommand`` returns an object of type
``org.bson.Document`` containing the output of the database command. You
can specify a return type for ``runCommand()`` as an optional second
parameter.

Example
-------

In the following sample code, we send the ``dbStats`` command to request
statistics from a specific MongoDB database.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Command.java
  :language: java


When you run the preceding command, you should see output similar to the
following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   dbStats: {"db": "sample_mflix", "collections": 5, "views": 0, "objects": 75595, "avgObjSize": 692.1003770090614, "dataSize": 52319328, "storageSize": 29831168, "numExtents": 0, "indexes": 9, "indexSize": 14430208, "fileSize": 0, "nsSizeMB": 0, "ok": 1}
