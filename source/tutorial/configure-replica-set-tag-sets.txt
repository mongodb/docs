Configure Replica Set Tag Sets
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Tag sets let you customize :term:`write concern` and :term:`read
preferences <read preference>` for a :term:`replica set`. MongoDB
stores tag sets in the replica set configuration object, which is the
document returned by :method:`rs.conf()`, in the :data:`members[n].tags
<local.system.replset.members[n].tags>` sub-document.

This section introduces the configuration of tag sets. For an
overview on tag sets and their use, see
:ref:`Replica Set Write Concern <replica-set-write-concern>` and
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets`.

Differences Between Read Preferences and Write Concerns
-------------------------------------------------------

Custom read preferences and write concerns evaluate tags sets in
different ways:

- Read preferences consider the value of a tag when selecting a
  member to read from.

- Write concerns do not use the value of a tag to select a member
  except to consider whether or not the value is unique.

For example, a tag set for a read operation may resemble the following
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "reporting" }

To fulfill such a read operation, a member would need to have both of these tags.
Any of the following tag sets would satisfy this requirement:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "reporting" }
   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "reporting", "rack": "a" }
   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "reporting", "rack": "d" }
   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "reporting", "mem": "r"}

The following tag sets would *not* be able to fulfill this query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "disk": "ssd" }
   { "use": "reporting" }
   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "production" }
   { "disk": "ssd", "use": "production", "rack": "k" }
   { "disk": "spinning", "use": "reporting", "mem": "32" }

Add Tag Sets to a Replica Set
-----------------------------

Given the following replica set configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id" : "rs0",
       "version" : 1,
       "members" : [
                {
                        "_id" : 0,
                        "host" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
                },
                {
                        "_id" : 1,
                        "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27017"
                },
                {
                        "_id" : 2,
                        "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27017"
                }
        ]
   }

You could add tag sets to the members of this replica set
with the following command sequence in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   conf = rs.conf()
   conf.members[0].tags = { "dc": "east", "use": "production"  }
   conf.members[1].tags = { "dc": "east", "use": "reporting"  }
   conf.members[2].tags = { "use": "production"  }
   rs.reconfig(conf)

After this operation the output of :method:`rs.conf()` would
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "_id" : "rs0",
        "version" : 2,
        "members" : [
                 {
                         "_id" : 0,
                         "host" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017",
                         "tags" : {
                                 "dc": "east",
                                 "use": "production"
                         }
                 },
                 {
                         "_id" : 1,
                         "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27017",
                         "tags" : {
                                 "dc": "east",
                                 "use": "reporting"
                         }
                 },
                 {
                         "_id" : 2,
                         "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27017",
                         "tags" : {
                                 "use": "production"
                         }
                 }
         ]
    }

Custom Multi-Datacenter Write Concerns
--------------------------------------

Given a five member replica set with members in two data centers:

1. a facility ``VA``  tagged ``dc.va``

2. a facility ``GTO`` tagged ``dc.gto``

Create a custom write concern to require confirmation from two
data centers using replica set tags, using the following sequence
of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

#. Create a replica set configuration JavaScript object ``conf``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf = rs.conf()

#. Add tags to the replica set members reflecting their locations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf.members[0].tags = { "dc.va": "rack1"}
      conf.members[1].tags = { "dc.va": "rack2"}
      conf.members[2].tags = { "dc.gto": "rack1"}
      conf.members[3].tags = { "dc.gto": "rack2"}
      conf.members[4].tags = { "dc.va": "rack1"}
      rs.reconfig(conf)

#. Create a custom
   :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorModes` setting to
   ensure that the write operation will propagate to at least one member
   of each facility:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf.settings = { getLastErrorModes: { MultipleDC : { "dc.va": 1, "dc.gto": 1}}

#. Reconfigure the replica set using the modified ``conf`` configuration
   object:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(conf)

To ensure that a write operation propagates to at least one member of
the set in both data centers, use the ``MultipleDC`` write concern
mode as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, w: "MultipleDC" } )

Alternatively, if you want to ensure that each write operation
propagates to at least 2 racks in each facility, reconfigure the
replica set as follows in the :program:`mongo` shell:

#. Create a replica set configuration object ``conf``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf = rs.conf()

#. Redefine the
   :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorModes` value to
   require two different values of both ``dc.va`` and ``dc.gto``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf.settings = { getLastErrorModes: { MultipleDC : { "dc.va": 2, "dc.gto": 2}}

#. Reconfigure the replica set using the modified ``conf`` configuration
   object:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(conf)

Now, the following write concern operation will only return after the
write operation propagates to at least two different racks in the
each facility:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, w: "MultipleDC" } )

Configure Tag Sets for Functional Segregation of Read and Write Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a replica set with tag sets that reflect:

- data center facility,

- physical rack location of instance, and

- storage system (i.e. disk) type.

Where each member of the set has a tag set that resembles one of the
following: [#read-and-write-tags]_

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"dc.va": "rack1", disk:"ssd", ssd: "installed" }
   {"dc.va": "rack2", disk:"raid"}
   {"dc.gto": "rack1", disk:"ssd", ssd: "installed" }
   {"dc.gto": "rack2", disk:"raid"}
   {"dc.va": "rack1", disk:"ssd", ssd: "installed" }

To target a read operation to a member of the replica set with a
disk type of ``ssd``, you could use the following tag set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { disk: "ssd" }

However, to create comparable write concern modes, you would specify a
different set of
:data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorModes`
configuration. Consider the following sequence of operations in
the :program:`mongo` shell:

#. Create a replica set configuration object ``conf``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf = rs.conf()

#. Redefine the
   :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorModes` value to
   configure two write concern modes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      conf.settings = {
                       "getLastErrorModes" : {
                               "ssd" : {
                                          "ssd" : 1
                               },
                               "MultipleDC" : {
                                       "dc.va" : 1,
                                      "dc.gto" : 1
                               }
                       }
                     }

#. Reconfigure the replica set using the modified ``conf`` configuration
   object:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(conf)

Now you can specify the ``MultipleDC`` write concern mode, as in the
following operation, to ensure that a write operation propagates to
each data center.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, w: "MultipleDC" } )

Additionally, you can specify the ``ssd`` write concern mode to ensure that a write operation propagates
to at least one instance with an SSD.

.. [#read-and-write-tags] Since read preferences and write concerns
   use the value of fields in tag sets differently, larger
   deployments may have some redundancy.
