  MMS provides several options for where to deploy MongoDB. The choice you
  make for your first deployment does not limit your choices for future
  deployments. For your first deployment, select from the following options:
action:
  - heading: Local
    pre: |
      Installs MongoDB directly to your local machine. This is useful for
      learning about MongoDB and testing applications.
  - heading: AWS
    pre: |
      Installs MongoDB on an existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
      You can use existing EC2 servers on the account or provision new
      ones through this setup process by providing your EC2 API keys when
      prompted. Running MongoDB on AWS is useful for both development and
      production and allows you to quickly and easily add servers as
      needed.
