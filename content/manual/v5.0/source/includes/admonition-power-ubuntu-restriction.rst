For earlier MongoDB Enterprise versions that support Ubuntu 16.04
POWER/PPC64LE:

Due to a lock elision bug present in older versions
of the ``glibc`` package on Ubuntu 16.04 for POWER, you must
upgrade the ``glibc`` package to at least ``glibc 2.23-0ubuntu5``
before running MongoDB. Systems with older versions of the
``glibc`` package will experience database server crashes and
misbehavior due to random memory corruption, and are unsuitable
for production deployments of MongoDB
