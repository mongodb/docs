This page outlines how to use |compass| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. admonition:: MongoDB Atlas
   :class: note

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_compass>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |compass-short| to your deployment.

If you need to install |compass-short|, see
:ref:`download-install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |compass-short| to a replica set, it is not
  recommended to connect directly to an individual replica
  set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a
  :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
  :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
  the result of an election, |compass-short| may either forcibly close
  the connection or display stale data.

  Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set
  :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` when 
  filling in your connection information.

Connect
-------

When you open |compass-short|, an initial connection dialog appears:

   :figwidth: 690px

|compass-short| provides two methods to connect to your deployment,
either providing your deployment connection string or filling in your
deployment information in specific fields.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Paste Connection String
      :tabid: paste-connection-string

      When you provide a connection string, |compass-short| supports
      most :manual:`Connection String Options
      </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
      supported by MongoDB.

      By default, |compass-short|'s default 
      :manual:`socketTimeoutMS </reference/connection-string/#urioption.socketTimeoutMS>`
      value is 60000, or 60 seconds. If you are frequently experiencing
      timeouts in |compass-short|, consider setting this option to a
      higher value in your connection string.

      For a complete list of the connection string options which
      |compass-short| supports, see the
      `Compass Connection README
      <https://github.com/mongodb-js/connection-model/blob/master/README.md#properties>`__
      on GitHub.

.. note::

  |compass| securely stores sensitive information entered in the
  connection form using an API that is specific to your operating
  system.

  For more information on how |compass-short| handles sensitive
  data, refer to the
  :ref:`FAQ page <compass-faq-confidential-data>`.

.. _disconnect:

Disconnect

.. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-compass.rst

Disconnecting from a MongoDB instance closes the Compass connection to
the active instance and returns the Compass view to the initial
connection dialog.
