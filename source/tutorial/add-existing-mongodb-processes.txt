|mms| provides a wizard for adding your existing MongoDB deployments to
monitoring and management. The wizard prompts you to:

- Install the {+mdbagent+} if you don't have it installed
- Identify the :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`, the :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`,
  or the :term:`standalone` to add. You can choose to add the deployment to
  :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>` or to both
  :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>` and
  :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments must have unique names within the projects.

.. include:: /includes/important-unique-names-deployment-items.rst

MongoDB Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automation doesn't support all MongoDB options, which can result in 
failed import attempts. To learn more, see 
:ref:`cm-unsupported-mdb-settings`.

|tls|
~~~~~

If you enable |tls|, the |fqdn| for the host serving a MongoDB process
must match the :abbr:`SAN (Subject Alternative Name)` for the |tls|
certificate on that host.

.. important::

   To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, keep the scope of |tls| certificates
   as narrow as possible. Although you can use one |tls| certificate with
   many :abbr:`SANs (Subject Alternative Names)`, or a wildcard |tls|
   certificate on each host, you should not. To learn more, see
   :rfc:`RFC 2818, section 3.1 <2818#section-3.1>`.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a preferred hostname if you:

- Require a specific hostname, |fqdn|, |ipv4| address or |ipv6|
  address to access the MongoDB process, or
- Must specify the hostname to use for hosts with multiple aliases.

To learn more, see the :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` setting
in :ref:`group-settings-page`.

Managing Windows MongoDB Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are adding an existing MongoDB process that runs as a Windows
Service to Automation, Automation:

- Stops and disables the existing service
- Creates and starts a new service

.. _auth-creds-on-source-and-destination:

Authentication Credentials on Source and Destination Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the |mms| project has MongoDB authentication settings enabled for its
deployments, the MongoDB deployment you import must support the project's
authentication mechanism.

We recommend that you import to a **new** destination project that has no
running processes and doesn't have authentication enabled.

If the source cluster uses authentication, and the destination |mms| project
doesn't have any existing managed processes, |mms| enables authentication
in the destination project, imports the existing keyfile from the source
cluster, and uses it to authenticate the user that conducts the import process.

If the source cluster and the destination |mms| project both use authentication,
and the project has processes, |mms| attempts to use existing authentication
settings in the destination project during the import process. For the
import process to succeed, authentication credentials on the source cluster
and the |mms| destination project must be the same.

To ensure that import is successful, before you start the import process,
add the |mms| destination project's credentials on the source cluster.

or :manual:`Rotate Keys for Sharded Clusters </tutorial/rotate-key-sharded-cluster/>`.

.. _add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth:

Authentication Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment requires authentication, when you add the
deployment to |mms| for monitoring, you must
:doc:`provide the necessary credentials </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials/>`.

- If the deployment doesn't use Automation, but *did* use Backup, Monitoring,
  or both, you can find those credentials where the credentials were
  before updating to the {+mdbagent+}.

- If the deployment doesn't use Automation, but *will* use Backup,
  Monitoring, or both:

  1. Create the credentials for the MongoDB Deployment. To learn more, see
     :ref:`Required Access for MongoDB Agent for Monitoring <mms-req-cred-monitoring>`
     and :ref:`Required Access for MongoDB Agent for Backup <mms-req-cred-backup>`.

  2. Add the credentials that you granted to those functions to |mms| after
     you add the MongoDB processes. To learn more, see
     :ref:`Add Credentials for Monitoring <add-auth-credentials-monitoring>`
     and :ref:`Add Credentials for Backup <add-auth-credentials-backup>`.

- If the deployment *uses* Automation, |mms| uses the credentials from
  the {+mdbagent+}. You can delete the credentials from the legacy Backup,
  and Monitoring Agents. The {+mdbagent+} uses those credentials for its
  Automation, Backup, and Monitoring functions.

- If the deployment *will* use Automation but didn't use it before you
  import it, add the ``mms-automation`` user to the database processes
  you imported and add the user's credentials to |mms|.

To learn more, see :ref:`add-auth-credentials-automation`.

Add Authentication Credentials to your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you add existing MongoDB process to |mms|, you might have to add
authentication credentials for the new deployments if authentication is
enabled for the project into which you imported the deployment. See
:ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth` to learn in which situations
you must add Automation, Monitoring, or Backup credentials for your new
deployment.
