Diagram Guidelines
==================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

Diagrams can help users visualize complex processes in a simplified
way. Sometimes, diagrams *can* be too simplistic, confusing rather than
helping the user. The decision about whether a diagram might be helpful
depends on the context of each document and the discretion of each
writer.

When to Use Diagrams
--------------------

Include diagrams in the following situations:

-  When there is evidence of a process, whether the process is
   automated or manual

-  When you need to clarify configurations and settings, such as the
   architecture for virtual servers

-  When you need to define a complex workflow within a MongoDB product

Do *not* include diagrams in the following situations:

-  When a workflow is simplistic, such as using the user interface to
   create a MongoDB user

-  When there is no interaction with a MongoDB product

Before You Create a Diagram
---------------------------

To create diagrams, you need to access the recommended software and
download the required icons and stencils.

Software
~~~~~~~~

Use `draw.io <https://www.draw.io/>`__ to create your diagrams. Draw.io
enables you to create diagrams directly in your web browser of choice.

To get started with draw.io, see the instructions in the
`Draw.io Online User Manual <https://support.draw.io/display/DO/Draw.io+Online+User+Manual>`__.

Icons, Stencils, and Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download MongoDB's library of product icons and stencils. These icons
and stencils are considered **objects**.

-  The product icons are under development.

-  Stencils are used to represent certain functions and hardware such
   as the world wide web or a server.

After you download the icons and stencils, you can being making
diagrams in Draw.io.

Diagram Checklist
-----------------

Use the following standards when creating diagrams:

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Each diagram property is located on the right side of the Draw.io
main screen under **Diagrams**.

-  **Paper size**: Set the paper size to **A4 (210 mm x 297 mm)**
   and **Landscape**.

-  **Background color**: Set the background color to **none**.

-  **File format**: Save all diagrams as editable SVG files, as
   follows:

   #. Click **File > Save As**.

   #. Type a descriptive name for the file, and replace ``.xml`` with
      ``.svg`` at the end of the file name. The file is saved to your
      local directory.

-  **File name**: Create unique and meaningful file names to
   differentiate diagrams.

Text Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Font**: Set the font to **Helvetica**.

-  **Titles:** Title must be **bolded**, aligned **left**, and be at
   least **24px** in size. Use headline-style capitalization.

Objects
~~~~~~~

-  **Product icons**: An icon represents its corresponding product.
   Product icons are always blue. Following is the Cloud Images icon.

   .. note::

      If you find a MongoDB product icon that is not blue, send an
      email to how-to@MongoDB.com and a member of our team will create
      a blue version of the icon.

-  **Stencils**: A stencil represents a concept or function. Stencils
   that are *not* MongoDB products should always appear in black.

-  **Labels**: Label all product icons, stencils, and shapes, according
   to their function within the diagram. Use sentence-style
   capitalization (that is, capitalize *only* terms that are proper or
   are normally capitalized).

Lines and Arrows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Line usage**: Use lines are used to connect and display a
   relationship between two or more objects.

-  **Line width**: Line width must be at least **2pt**. You can
   change the width of a line in the **Format Panel** under **Style**
   when you select the line.

-  **Line shape**: Keep lines straight unless a line needs to change
   direction.

-  **Rounded line corners**: If a line changes direction, the corner
   in which the change of direction occurs must be rounded. You can
   change to rounded corners by selecting the line, going to the
   **Format Panel** under **Style**, and selecting **Rounded** in the
   dropdown menu.

-  **Solid lines**: Use solid lines to show a direct relationship
   between objects, as shown in the following example.

   .. figure:: images/img/solid-lines.png
      :alt: Example of solid lines

-  **Dashed lines**: Use dashed lines to group objects that are
   connected through a network, as shown in the following example.

   .. figure:: images/img/dashed-lines.png
      :alt: Example of dashed lines

-  **Dotted lines**: Use dotted lines to show how data entered by
   the user travels, as shown in the following example.

   .. figure:: images/img/dotted-lines.png
      :alt: Example of dotted lines

-  **One-way and two-way arrows:** Use arrows to represent direct
   interactions between two or more stencils. If a stencil is attached
   to an arrow, it implies that the product represented by the stencil
   needs to interact with another piece of the diagram.

   In the following example, the CDN management service needs to
   interact with the CDN to perform its function. Similarly, the CDN
   needs to be managed by the CDN management service. The relationship
   is two-way, so the line has arrows on both ends pointed to both
   stencils.
