MongoDB supports creating indexes on a field, or set of fields, to
improve performance for queries. MongoDB supports :ref:`flexible schemas
<manual-data-modeling-intro>`, meaning document field names may differ
within a collection. Use wildcard indexes to support queries against
arbitrary or unknown fields.

To create a wildcard index, use the wildcard specifier (``$**``) as the
index key:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { "$**": <sortOrder> } )

You can use the following commands to create a wildcard index:

- :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
- :method:`db.collection.createIndex()`
- :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()`

Use Cases
---------

.. include:: /includes/indexes/wildcard-use-case-warning.rst

Consider using a wildcard index in the following scenarios:

- If your application queries a collection where field names vary
  between documents, create a wildcard index to support queries on all
  possible document field names.

- If your application repeatedly queries an embedded document field
  where the subfields are not consistent, create a wildcard index to
  support queries on all of the subfields.

- If your application queries documents that share common
  characteristics. A compound wildcard index can efficiently cover many
  queries for documents that have common fields. To learn more, see
  :ref:`wildcard-index-compound`.

Get Started
-----------

You can perform the following tasks with wildcard indexes:

- :ref:`create-wildcard-index-single-field`
- :ref:`create-wildcard-index-multiple-fields`
- :ref:`create-wildcard-index-all-fields`
- :ref:`Create a Compound Wildcard Index <create-wildcard-index-compound>`

.. _wildcard-index-details:

Details
-------

Wildcard indexes behave as follows:

- You can create multiple wildcard indexes in a collection.

- A wildcard index can cover the same fields as other indexes in the 
  collection.

- Wildcard indexes omit the ``_id`` field by default. To include the
  ``_id`` field in the wildcard index, you must explicitly include it in
  the ``wildcardProjection`` document by specifying ``{ "_id" : 1 }``.

- Wildcard indexes are :ref:`sparse indexes <index-type-sparse>` and
  only contain entries for documents that have the indexed field, even
  if the index field contains a null value.

- Wildcard indexes are distinct from and incompatible with
  :ref:`wildcard text indexes <create-wildcard-text-index>`. Wildcard
  indexes cannot support queries using the :query:`$text` operator.

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wildcard indexes can support a :ref:`covered query <covered-queries>`
only if **all** of the following conditions are true:

- The query planner selects the wildcard index to fulfill the query
  predicate.

- The query predicate specifies *exactly* one field covered by the wildcard
  index.

- The query projection explicitly excludes ``_id`` and includes *only*
  the query field.

- The specified query field is never an array.

Consider the following wildcard index on the ``employees`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.createIndex( { "$**" : 1 } )

The following operation queries for a single field ``lastName`` and
projects out all other fields from the resulting document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.find(
     { "lastName" : "Doe" },
     { "_id" : 0, "lastName" : 1 }
   )

If the specified ``lastName`` is never an array, MongoDB can use the
``$**`` wildcard index to support a covered query.
