|mms-full|, or its cloud-based counterpart, Cloud Manager, is a required
component for any Enterprise MongoDB deployment. |onprem| automates, monitors,
and performs backups of MongoDB databases. As shown in the following
diagram, the MongoDB Ops Manager consists of:

- The :term:`Ops Manager Application <Ops Manager Application>`, which is the
  main |onprem| component and the front-end UI application.
- The :term:`Application Database <application database>`, which is the backing
  MongoDB database for |onprem|.
- The :term:`Backup Daemon <Backup Daemon>`, which is the component supporting
  the |application| in backup and restore processes.

The |k8s-op-short| supports deploying |onprem| and its underlying {+appdb+}
on a single or multiple |k8s| clusters.

A multi-cluster deployment of the |application| and the {+appdb+} in
different zones, regions, or cloud providers increases availability and improves
resilience in case of disaster situations. To learn more, see :ref:`om-multi-k8s`.

Use the following resources to help you learn about and deploy the |application|
and the {+appdb+} using their |k8s-crds| in the |k8s-op-short|:
