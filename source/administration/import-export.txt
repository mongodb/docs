Full :doc:`database instance backups </administration/backups>` are
useful for disaster recovery protection and routine database backup
operation; however, some cases require additional import and export
functionality.

This document provides an overview of the import and export programs
included in the MongoDB distribution. These tools are useful when you
want to backup or export a portion of your data without capturing the
state of the entire database, or for simple data ingestion cases. For
more complex data migration tasks, you may want to write your own
import and export scripts using a client :term:`driver` to interact
with the database itself.

.. warning::

   Because these tools primarily operate by interacting with a running
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, they can impact the performance of your
   running database.

   Not only do these processes create traffic for a running
   database instance, they also force the database to read all data
   through memory. When MongoDB reads infrequently used data, it can
   supplant more frequently accessed data, causing a deterioration in
   performance for the database's regular workload.

   :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` and :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` do not reliably
   preserve all rich :term:`BSON` data types, because :term:`BSON` is
   a superset of :term:`JSON`. Thus, :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` cannot represent :term:`BSON` data
   accurately in :term:`JSON`. As a result data exported or imported
   with these tools may lose some measure of fidelity. See
   :doc:`/reference/mongodb-extended-json` for more information about
   MongoDB Extended JSON.

.. seealso:: See the ":doc:`/administration/backups`" document for
   more information on backing up MongoDB instances. Additionally,
   consider the following references for commands addressed in this
   document:

   - :doc:`/reference/mongoexport`
   - :doc:`/reference/mongorestore`
   - :doc:`/reference/mongodump`

   If you want to transform and process data once you've imported it
   in MongoDB consider the topics in :doc:`/aggregation`, including:

   - :doc:`/applications/map-reduce` and
   - :doc:`/applications/aggregation`.

.. _bson-json-type-conversion-fidelity:

Data Type Fidelity
------------------

:term:`JSON` does not have the following data types that exist in
:term:`BSON` documents: ``data_binary``, ``data_date``,
``data_timestamp``, ``data_regex``, ``data_oid`` and ``data_ref``. As
a result using any tool that decodes BSON :term:`documents <document>`
into JSON will suffer some loss of fidelity.

If maintaining type fidelity is important, consider writing a data
import and export system that does not force BSON documents into JSON
form as part of the process. The following list of types contain
examples for how MongoDB will represent how BSON documents render in
JSON.

- ``data_binary``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "$binary" : "<bindata>", "$type" : "<t>" }

  ``<bindata>`` is the base64 representation of a binary string. ``<t>``
  is the hexadecimal representation of a single byte indicating the
  data type.

- ``data_date``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     Date( <date> )

  ``<date>`` is the JSON representation of a 64-bit signed integer for
  milliseconds since epoch.

- ``data_timestamp``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     Timestamp( <t>, <i> )

  ``<t>`` is the JSON representation of a 32-bit unsigned integer for
  milliseconds since epoch. ``<i>`` is a 32-bit unsigned integer for
  the increment.

- ``data_regex``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     /<jRegex>/<jOptions>

  ``<jRegex>`` is a string that may contain valid JSON characters and
  unescaped double quote (i.e. ``"``) characters, but may not contain
  unescaped forward slash (i.e. ``/``) characters. ``<jOptions>`` is a
  string that may contain only the characters ``g``, ``i``,
  ``m``, and ``s``.

- ``data_oid``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId( "<id>" )

  ``<id>`` is a 24 character hexadecimal string. These representations
  require that ``data_oid`` values have an associated field named
  ":term:`_id`."

- ``data_ref``

  .. code-block:: javascript

     DBRef( "<name>", "<id>" )

  ``<name>`` is a string of valid JSON characters. ``<id>`` is a 24
  character hexadecimal string.

Data Import and Export and Backups Operations
---------------------------------------------

For resilient and non-disruptive backups,
use a file system or block-level disk snapshot function, such as the
methods described in the ":doc:`/administration/backups`" document. The
tools and operations discussed provide functionality that's useful in
the context of providing some kinds of backups.

By contrast, use import and export tools to backup a small subset of
your data or to move data to or from a 3rd party system. These backups may
capture a small crucial set of data or a frequently modified section of
data, for extra insurance, or for ease of access. No matter how you
decide to import or export your data, consider the following guidelines:

- Label files so that you can identify what point in time the
  export or backup reflects.

- Labeling should describe the contents of the backup, and reflect the
  subset of the data corpus, captured in the backup or export.

- Do not create or apply exports if the backup process itself will
  have an adverse effect on a production system.

- Make sure that they reflect a consistent data state. Export or backup
  processes can impact data integrity (i.e. type fidelity) and
  consistency if updates continue during the backup process.

- Test backups and exports by restoring and importing to ensure that
  the backups are useful.

Human Intelligible Import/Export Formats
----------------------------------------

This section describes a process to import/export your database, or a
portion thereof, to a file in a :term:`JSON` or :term:`CSV` format.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/reference/mongoimport` and
   :doc:`/reference/mongoexport` documents contain complete
   documentation of these tools. If you have questions about the
   function and parameters of these tools not covered here, please
   refer to these documents.

   If you want to simply copy a database or collection from one
   instance to another, consider using the :dbcommand:`copydb`,
   :dbcommand:`clone`, or :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` commands, which
   may be more suited to this task. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   provides the :method:`db.copyDatabase()` method.

These tools may also be useful for importing data into a MongoDB database
from third party applications.

Collection Export with :binary:`~bin.mongoexport`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` utility you can create a backup
file. In the most simple invocation, the command takes the following
form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoexport --collection collection --out collection.json

This will export all documents in the collection named
``collection`` into the file ``collection.json``. Without the
output specification (i.e. ":option:`--out collection.json
<mongoexport --out>`",) :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` writes output to
standard output (i.e. "stdout.") You can further narrow the results by
supplying a query filter using the ":option:`--query <mongoexport --query>`"
and limit results to a single database using the
":option:`--db <mongoexport --db>`" option. For instance:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoexport --db sales --collection contacts --query '{"field": 1}'

This command returns all documents in the ``sales`` database's
``contacts`` collection, with a field named ``field`` with a value
of ``1``. Enclose the query in single quotes (e.g. ``'``) to ensure
that it does not interact with your shell environment. The resulting
documents will return on standard output.

By default, :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` returns one :term:`JSON document`
per MongoDB document. Specify the
":option:`--jsonArray <mongoexport --jsonArray>`" argument to return
the export as a single :term:`JSON` array. Use the ":option:`--csv
<mongoexport --csv>`" file to return the result in CSV (comma
separated values) format.

If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is not running, you can use the
":option:`--dbpath <mongoexport --dbpath>`" option to specify the
location to your MongoDB instance's database files. See the following
example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoexport --db sales --collection contacts --dbpath /srv/MongoDB/

This reads the data files directly. This locks the data directory to
prevent conflicting writes. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` process must *not* be
running or attached to these data files when you run :binary:`~bin.mongoexport`
in this configuration.

The ":option:`--host <mongoexport --host>`" and ":option:`--port
<mongoexport --port>`" options allow you to specify a non-local host
to connect to capture the export. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoexport --host mongodb1.example.net --port 37017 --username user --password pass --collection contacts --file mdb1-examplenet.json

On any :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` command you may, as above specify username and
password credentials as above.

Collection Import with :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore a backup taken with :binary:`~bin.mongoexport`. Most of the
arguments to :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` also exist for
:binary:`~bin.mongoimport`. Consider the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoimport --collection collection --file collection.json

This imports the contents of the file ``collection.json`` into the
collection named ``collection``. If you do not specify a file with
the ":option:`--file <mongoimport --file>`" option,
:binary:`~bin.mongoimport` accepts input over standard input
(e.g. "stdin.")

If you specify the ":option:`--upsert <mongoimport --upsert>`" option,
all of :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` operations will attempt to update
existing documents in the database and insert other documents. This
option will cause some performance impact depending on your
configuration.

You can specify the database option :option:`--db <mongoimport --db>`
to import these documents to a particular database. If your
MongoDB instance is not running, use the ":option:`--dbpath
<mongoimport --dbpath>`" option to specify the location of your
MongoDB instance's database files. Consider using the
":option:`--journal <mongoimport --journal>`" option to ensure that
:binary:`~bin.mongoimport` records its operations in the journal. The
``mongod`` process must *not* be running or attached to these data
files when you run :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` in this configuration.

Use the ":option:`--ignoreBlanks <mongoimport --ignoreBlanks>`" option
to ignore blank fields. For :term:`CSV` and :term:`TSV` imports, this
option provides the desired functionality in most cases: it avoids
inserting blank fields in MongoDB documents.
