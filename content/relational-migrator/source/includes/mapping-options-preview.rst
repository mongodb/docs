You can preview how mapping rules affect your data model by viewing the 
blue dotted box in the MongoDB diagram pane. This allows you to preview 
the mapping rule before you apply it.

- If the collection entity doesn't exist, it is added to the 
  diagram with a preview state around the entire card.

- If the collection entity already exists, the embedded mappings are 
  added to the card with a preview state around the new fields.
