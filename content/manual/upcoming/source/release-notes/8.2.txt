General Changes 
---------------

WiredTiger Cache Size Configuration as a Percentage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.2, you can configure the
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` internal cache
size using a new percentage-based option. In addition to the existing
:option:`--wiredTigerCacheSizeGB <mongod --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB>`
and :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB`
gigabyte-based settings, you can now specify the cache size as a
percentage of the available memory with the
:option:`--wiredTigerCacheSizePct <mongod --wiredTigerCacheSizePct>`
and :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizePct` options.

New Inconsistency Type: Range Deletion Missing Shard Key Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MonogDB 8.2, a new inconsistency type
:data:`RangeDeletionMissingShardKeyIndex` is implemented. The
inconsistency type indicates that a sharded collection exists that
doesn't have an index compatible with the collection shard key and there
is at least one remaining range deletion task to complete.
