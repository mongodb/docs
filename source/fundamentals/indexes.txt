Overview
--------

Indexes are data structures that support the efficient execution of queries in
MongoDB. They contain copies of parts of the data in documents to make
queries more efficient.

Without indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a collection to find
the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can
negatively affect the performance of your application. By using an index to
limit the number of documents MongoDB scans, queries can be more efficient
and therefore return faster.


Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your query can include three
parts:

- query criteria that specify field(s) and value(s) you are looking for
- options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern)
- projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should return (optional)

When all the fields specified in the query criteria and projection of a
query are indexed, MongoDB returns results directly from the index
without scanning any documents in the collection or loading them into
memory.

For additional information on how to ensure your index covers your query
criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual articles on
:manual:`query coverage </core/query-optimization/#read-operations-covered-query>`
and :manual:`index intersection </core/index-intersection>`.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in
your application's queries and operations that return sorted results.
Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active so you
should track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition,
when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also has to update
the related index.

For more information on designing your data model and choosing indexes
appropriate for your application, see the MongoDB server documentation on
:manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#data-model-indexes>`.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying
your data. The following sections describe the most common index types
and provide sample code for creating each index type.

Single Field and Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Single field indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries
that specify ascending or descending sort order on a single field of a
document.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create an
ascending order index on the ``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/single-field.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index
created above.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/single-field.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query

See the MongoDB server manual section on
:manual:`single field indexes </core/index-single>` for more information.

**Compound indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that
specify ascending or descending sort order for *multiple* fields of
a document. You must specify the direction (ascending or descending) for
each field in the index.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a compound
index on the ``type`` and ``genre`` fields in the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/compound.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index
created above.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/compound.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query

See the MongoDB server manual section on
:manual:`Compound indexes </core/index-compound>` for more information.

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multikey indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that
specify ascending or descending indexes on fields that contain an array value.
You can define a multikey index using the same syntax as a single field or
compound index.

The following example use the ``createIndex()`` method to create an ascending
index on the ``cast`` field (array of names) in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/multikey.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index
created above.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/multikey.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query

Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of
query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. For a full
explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior
and limitations, refer to the :manual:`Multikey Indexes page
</core/index-multikey>` in the MongoDB manual.

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text indexes** support text search queries on string content. These indexes
can include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements.
MongoDB supports text search for various languages. You can specify the
default language as an option when creating the index. Read our guide on
:doc:`text search queries </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/text>` for more
information.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a
``text`` index on the ``fullplot`` field in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database and specifies ``english`` as the default
language.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/text.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index
created above. Note that the ``sort`` is omitted because text indexes do not
contain sort order.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/text.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query

For a full explanation of text search with MongoDB, refer to
:manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text>` in the MongoDB manual.

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using **2dsphere
indexes**. With a 2dsphere index, you can query the geospatial data for
inclusion, intersection, and proximity. For more information on querying
geospatial data with the MongoDB Node.js driver, read our
:doc:`Search Geospatial </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/geo>` guide.

To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains
only **GeoJSON objects**. For more details on this type, see the MongoDB
server manual page on :manual:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`.

The ``location.geo`` field in following sample document from the
``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database is a GeoJSON Point
object that describes the coordinates of the theater:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example uses the ``createIndexes()`` method to create a
``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field in the ``theaters``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database to enable geospatial searches.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/geo.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

MongoDB also supports ``2d`` indexes for calculating distances on a
Euclidean plane and for working with the "legacy coordinate pairs" syntax
used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. See the
:manual:`Geospatial Queries page </geospatial-queries>` in the MongoDB
server manual for more further information.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unique indexes ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate
values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the ``_id`` field
during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index, specify the
field or combination of fields that you want to prevent duplication on and
set the ``unique`` option to ``true``.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a unique
index on the ``theaterId`` field in the ``theaters`` collection of the
``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/unique.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

If you attempt to perform a write operation that stores a duplicate value
that violates the unique index, MongoDB will throw an error that resembles
the following:

.. code-block:: none

   E11000 duplicate key error index

Refer to the :manual:`Unique Indexes page </core/index-unique>` in the
MongoDB server manual for more information.
