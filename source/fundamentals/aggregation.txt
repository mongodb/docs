   Atlas Vector Search </fundamentals/aggregation/vector-search>

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform aggregation operations in
the {+driver-short+}.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections based on
specifications you can set in an **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation
pipeline consists of one or more **stages**. Each stage performs an
operation based on its expression operators. After the driver executes
the aggregation pipeline, it returns an aggregated result.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Compare Aggregation and Find Operations <rust-agg-compare>`
  describes the functionality differences between aggregation and find operations

- :ref:`Server Limitations <rust-agg-limitations>` describes the
  server limitations on memory usage for aggregation operations

- :ref:`Examples <rust-agg-examples>` provides examples of aggregations
  for different use cases

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-agg-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

Analogy
~~~~~~~

Aggregation operations function similarly to car factories with assembly
lines. The assembly lines have stations with specialized tools to
perform specific tasks. For example, when building a car, the assembly
line begins with the frame. Then, as the car frame moves through the
assembly line, each station assembles a separate part. The result is a
transformed final product, the finished car.

The assembly line represents the *aggregation pipeline*, the individual
stations represent the *aggregation stages*, the specialized tools
represent the *expression operators*, and the finished product
represents the *aggregated result*.

.. _rust-agg-compare:

Compare Aggregation and Find Operations
---------------------------------------

The following table lists the different tasks you can perform with find
operations, compared to what you can achieve with aggregation
operations. The aggregation framework provides expanded functionality
that allows you to transform and manipulate your data.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Rename fields
       | Compute new fields
       | Summarize data
       | Connect and merge data sets

.. _rust-agg-limitations:

Server Limitations
------------------

When performing aggregation operations, consider the following
limitations:

- Returned documents must not violate the :manual:`BSON document size
  limit </reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size>` of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If
  required, you can exceed this limit by setting the `allow_disk_use
  <{+api+}/options/struct.AggregateOptions.html#structfield.allow_disk_use>`__
  field in your ``AggregateOptions``.
- The :manual:`$graphLookup
  </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` operator
  has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores
  the ``allow_disk_use`` setting.

.. _rust-agg-examples:

Examples
--------

The examples in this section use the following sample documents. Each
document represents a user profile on a book review website and contains
information about their name, age, genre interests, and date that they
were last active on the website:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "name": "Sonya Mehta", "age": 23, "genre_interests": ["fiction", "mystery", "memoir"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z" } },
   { "name": "Selena Sun", "age": 45, "genre_interests": ["fiction", "literary", "theory"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-05-25T00:00:00.000Z" } },
   { "name": "Carter Johnson", "age": 56, "genre_interests": ["literary", "self help"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-05-31T00:00:00.000Z" } },
   { "name": "Rick Cortes", "age": 18, "genre_interests": ["sci-fi", "fantasy", "memoir"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z" } },
   { "name": "Belinda James", "age": 76, "genre_interests": ["literary", "nonfiction"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-06-11T00:00:00.000Z" } },

   { "name": "Thalia Dorn", "age": 21, "genre_interests": ["theory", "literary", "fiction"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-08-19T00:00:00.000Z" } },
   { "name": "Arthur Ray", "age": 66, "genre_interests": ["sci-fi", "fantasy", "fiction"], "last_active": { "$date": "2023-11-27T00:00:00.000Z" } }

Age Insights by Genre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example calculates the average, minimum, and maximum age of users
interested in each genre.

The aggregation pipeline contains the following stages:

- An ``$unwind`` stage to separate each array entry in the
  ``genre_interests`` field into a new document.
- A ``$group`` stage to group documents by the value of the
  ``genre_interests`` field. This stage finds the average, minimum, and
  maximum user age by using the ``$avg``, ``$min``, and ``$max`` operators.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation/aggregation.rs
      :start-after: begin-age-agg
      :end-before: end-age-agg
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      * { "_id": "memoir", "avg_age": 25.8, "min_age": 18, "max_age": 39 }
      * { "_id": "sci-fi", "avg_age": 42, "min_age": 18, "max_age": 66 }
      * { "_id": "fiction", "avg_age": 33.333333333333336, "min_age": 16, "max_age": 66 }
      * { "_id": "nonfiction", "avg_age": 53.5, "min_age": 31, "max_age": 76 }
      * { "_id": "self help", "avg_age": 56, "min_age": 56, "max_age": 56 }
      * { "_id": "poetry", "avg_age": 39, "min_age": 39, "max_age": 39 }
      * { "_id": "literary", "avg_age": 49.5, "min_age": 21, "max_age": 76 }
      * { "_id": "fantasy", "avg_age": 34.666666666666664, "min_age": 18, "max_age": 66 }
      * { "_id": "mystery", "avg_age": 24.666666666666668, "min_age": 20, "max_age": 31 }
      * { "_id": "theory", "avg_age": 33, "min_age": 21, "max_age": 45 }
      * { "_id": "art", "avg_age": 39, "min_age": 39, "max_age": 39 }
      * { "_id": "sports", "avg_age": 22.5, "min_age": 16, "max_age": 29 }

Group by Time Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example finds how many users were last active in each
month.

The aggregation pipeline contains the following stages:

- ``$project`` stage to extract the month from the ``last_active``
  field as a number into the ``month_last_active`` field
- ``$group`` stage to group documents by the ``month_last_active``
  field and count the number of documents for each month
- ``$sort`` stage to set an ascending sort on the month

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation/aggregation.rs
      :start-after: begin-lastactive-agg
      :end-before: end-lastactive-agg
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 1 }, "number": 3 }
      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 5 }, "number": 4 }
      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 6 }, "number": 1 }
      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 7 }, "number": 1 }
      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 8 }, "number": 2 }
      * { "_id": { "month_last_active": 11 }, "number": 1 }

Calculate Popular Genres
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example finds the three most popular genres based on how
often they appear in users' interests.

The aggregation pipeline contains the following stages:

- ``$unwind`` stage to separate each array entry in the
  ``genre_interests`` field into a new document
- ``$group`` stage to group documents by the ``genre_interests``
  field and count the number of documents for each genre
- ``$sort`` stage to set a descending sort on the genre popularity
- ``$limit`` stage to show only the first three genres

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation/aggregation.rs
      :start-after: begin-popular-agg
      :end-before: end-popular-agg
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      * { "_id": "fiction", "number": 6 }
      * { "_id": "memoir", "number": 5 }
      * { "_id": "literary", "number": 4 }
