title: Disable the Balancer.
level: 4
ref: 4.2-upgrade-disable-balancer
content: |

   Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in
   the sharded cluster, and run :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to
   disable the balancer:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.stopBalancer()

   .. note::

      If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
      in-progress migration before stopping the balancer. You can run
      :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check the balancer's current
      state.

   To verify that the balancer is disabled, run
   :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`, which returns false if the balancer
   is disabled:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.getBalancerState()

   For more information on disabling the balancer, see
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

   1. Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      a. Shut down the secondary :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace
         the |oldversion| binary with the |newversion| binary.

      #. Start the |newversion| binary with the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>`,
         :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`, and :option:`--port <mongod --port>`. 
         Include any other options as used by the deployment.

         .. code-block:: sh

            mongod --configsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

         If using a :doc:`configuration file

         specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: configsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`replication.replSetName`,
         :setting:`net.port`, and :setting:`net.bindIp`,

         Include any other settings as appropriate for your deployment.

      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's state,
         issue :method:`rs.status()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

         Repeat for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      a. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
         :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
         election of a new primary:

         
         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.stepDown()

      #. When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped
         down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down
         the stepped-down primary and replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary
         with the |newversion| binary.

      #. Start the |newversion| binary with the :option:`--configsvr
         <mongod --configsvr>`, :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
         :option:`--port <mongod --port>`, and :option:`--bind_ip

         options used by the previous deployment:

         .. code-block:: sh

            mongod --configsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

         If using a :doc:`configuration file

         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`replication.replSetName`,
         :setting:`net.port`, and :setting:`net.bindIp`,

   Replace each :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance with the |newversion| binary
   and restart. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your
   deployment.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-bind-ip-sharded-clusters.rst

   If upgrading from MongoDB 4.0.6 or earlier,
      Once a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance for the deployment is
      upgraded, that :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance starts to produce
      ``v1`` change stream resume tokens. These tokens cannot be used
      to resume a stream on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance which has
      not yet been upgraded.

      This command must perform writes to an internal system
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
      successfully, you can safely retry the command on the
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` as the operation is idempotent.
