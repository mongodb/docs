=======================================
Activate |backup| for a Sharded Cluster
=======================================

.. start-content

.. note::
   The sharded-cluster must be MongoDB version 2.4.3 or later.

To backup a cluster,

#. Go to :guilabel:`Backup`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Sharded Cluster Status` tab to see the list of your
   clusters and their backup details.

#. For the sharded cluster you want to enable, select :guilabel:`Start` in the
   :guilabel:`Action` column.
   
#. Specify which instances to use for the initial sync. To minimize the impact
   on the primaries, sync off of the secondaries.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-excluded-namespace.rst

#. Click the gear icon to the far right of the sharded cluster name to edit
   snapshot schedule, excluded namespaces, and credentials.

   - :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule` for backups. Take snapshots every 6, 8,
     12, or 24 hours and save for 2-5 days. Daily snapshots can be stored up to
     365 days. Weekly snapshots can be stored for 52 weeks. Monthly snapshots
     can be stored up to 36 months.
     
     By default, snapshots are taken every 6 hours with hourly snapshots saved
     for 2 days. Daily snapshots are saved for one week, weekly snapshots for
     one month, and monthly snapshots for a year.
     
     Changes to the snapshot schedule will affect your snapshot storage costs.
     
     Click the :guilabel:`Create a cluster checkpoint` checkbox to set a
     checkpoint for a selected period of time. A cluster checkpoint is a valid
     point in time when a sharded cluster can be restored. You must pause the
     sharded cluster balancer to create each checkpoint.

   - :guilabel:`Edit Excluded Namespaces`. Excluded namespaces are databases or
     collections that will not be backed up. This can be useful for namespaces
     containing log files or caches, for instance.

   - :guilabel:`Edit Credentials` to add authentication credentials used for
     backup, including whether or not to use SSL.

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified
instance for this sharded cluster.
