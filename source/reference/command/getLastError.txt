getLastError
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: getLastError

   The :dbcommand:`getLastError` command returns the error status of
   the last operation on the *current connection*. By default MongoDB
   does not provide a response to confirm the success or failure of a
   write operation, clients typically use :dbcommand:`getLastError` in
   combination with write operations to ensure that the write
   succeeds.

   Consider the following prototype form.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { getLastError: 1 }

   The following options are available:

   :param boolean j: If ``true``, wait for the next journal commit
                     before returning, rather than a full disk
                     flush. If :program:`mongod` does not have
                     journaling enabled, this option has no effect.

   :param integer w:
      The number of replica set members to replicate a write operation to
      before returning.  A value of ``1`` indicates to wait until the
      primary member acknowledges the write operation before returning.
      A ``w`` value of 2 includes the primary and at least one secondary, etc.
      If using ``w``, you should also use
      ``wtimeout``. Specifying a value for ``w`` without also
      providing a ``wtimeout`` may cause
      :dbcommand:`getLastError` to block indefinitely

   :param w:
      In place of a number, you may also set ``w`` to
      ``"majority"`` to indicate that the command should wait
      until the latest write propagates to a majority of
      replica set members.

   :param w:
      Alternately, ``w`` may be a string corresponding to a custom
      :data:`getLastErrorMode <local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorModes>`.
      See :ref:`tag-sets-custom-write-concern` and :ref:`custom-write-concerns`
      for information on defining and using custom tag sets and write concerns.

   :param boolean fsync: If ``true``, wait for :program:`mongod` to write this
                         data to disk before returning. Defaults to
                         false. In most cases, use the ``j`` option
                         to ensure durability and consistency of the
                         data set.

   :param integer wtimeout: Optional. Milliseconds. Specify a value in
                            milliseconds to control how long to
                            wait for write propagation to complete. If
                            replication does not complete in the given
                            timeframe, the :dbcommand:`getLastError`
                            command will return with an error status.
