- A compiler that supports C++11 (gcc, clang, or Visual Studio)
- `CMake <https://cmake.org>`__ 3.2 or later
- `boost <https://www.boost.org>`__ headers (optional)

If you encounter build failures or other problems with a platform configuration
that meets the above prerequisites, please file a bug report via
`JIRA <https://jira.mongodb.com/browse/CXX/>`__.

Installing
----------

To configure and install the driver, follow the instructions for your platform:

- :ref:`Configuring and installing on Windows <cpp-installation-windows>`
- :ref:`Configuring and installing on macOS <cpp-installation-macos>`
- :ref:`Configuring and installing on Linux <cpp-installation-linux>`

Advanced Options
----------------

- :ref:`Advanced Configuration and Installation Options <cpp-installation-advanced>`

Package Managers
----------------

The Mongo C++ driver is available in the following package managers.

- `Vcpkg <https://vcpkg.io/>`__ (search for mongo-cxx-driver)
- `Conan <https://conan.io/center/recipes/mongo-cxx-driver>`__
- `Homebrew <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mongo-cxx-driver>`__

Vcpkg Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not already have Vcpkg installed, install it with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   $ cd vcpkg
   $ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

Optionally, to install with Visual Studio integration:

.. code-block:: bash

   vcpkg integrate install

Install the driver. You may need to ``git pull`` to get the latest version of
the driver.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./vcpkg install mongo-cxx-driver

You can use the toolchain file, ``vcpkg.cmake``, to instruct CMake where to find
the development files, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/<path to vcpkg repo>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

You can find the header files in:

.. code-block:: none

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/include/

The library files are in:

.. code-block:: none

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/lib/

Conan Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package Specifier: ``mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0``

If you do not already have Conan installed, then install it and run the Conan
initalization command below:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install conan
   $ conan profile detect --force

Add the following to your ``conanfile.txt``:

.. code-block:: none

   [requires]
   mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0
   [generators]
   CMakeDeps
   CMakeToolchain

Install the driver via Conan, and build your project:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conan install conanfile.txt --output-folder=build --build=missing
   $ cmake \
     -B build \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   $ cmake --build build

Homebrew
~~~~~~~~

For MacOS users, homebrew is a convenient way to install the C++ driver.

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install mongo-cxx-driver
