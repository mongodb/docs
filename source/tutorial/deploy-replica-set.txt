====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial describes the process for deploying a three member
:term:`replica set` , with specific instructions for development and
test as well as for production systems.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/core/replication`" and
   ":doc:`/administration/replication-architectures`" for appropriate
   background.

Overview
--------

For most deployments, a simple 3 node replica set provides a
sufficient redundancy to survive most network partitions and other
system failures. A replica set of this size provides sufficient
capacity to host many distributed read operations. While MongoDB's
replica set functionality provides a great deal of flexibility and
specific definable node behaviors or types, it's best to avoid this
additional complexity your application requires the functionality.

Requirements
------------

Three distinct systems, so that each system can run its own instance
of :program:`mongod`. For test systems you can run all three instances
of the :program:`mongod` process on a local sys em.e. a laptop) or
within a virtual instance. For production environments, you should
endeavor to maintain as much separation between the nodes: Deploy
replica set members on distinct hardware, and on systems that draw
power from different circuits, to the greatest extent possible.

Procedure
---------

This procedure assumes that you already have instances of MongoDB
installed on all systems that you hope to have as members of your
replica set. If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the
:ref:`installation tutorials <tutorials-installation>`.

Development and Test Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begin by starting three instances of :program:`mongod`. For ephemeral
tests and the purposes of this guide, you may run the :program:`mongod`
instances in separate windows of GNU Screen. OS X and most Linux
distributions come with screen installed by default [#screen]_
systems.

Issue the following command to create the necessary data directories:
::

     mkdir -p /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 /srv/mongodb/rs0-2

Issue the following commands, each in a distinct screen window: ::

     mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 --replSet rs0
     mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 --replSet rs0
     mongod --port 27019 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-2 --replSet rs0

These command start members of a replica set named ``rs0``, each
running on a distinct port. Alternatively, if you are already using these
ports, you can select different ports. See the documentation of the
following options for more information: :option:`--port <mongod --port>`,
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, and :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`.

.. note::

   If you're running each :program:`mongod` instance on a distinct
   system, you can omit the :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
   option. YOu will also need to specify the :option:`--bind_ip
   <mongod --bind_ip>` option.

Log in with the :program:`mongo` shell to the first host. If you're
accessing this command remotely, modify the hostname.  using the
following command: ::

      mongo localhost:27017

Issue the following shell function to initiate a replica set
consisting of the current node, using the default configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.initiate()

Use the following shell function to display the current :doc:`replica
configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.conf()

Now, issue the following sequence of commands to add two nodes to the
replica set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("localhost:27018")
   rs.add("localhost:27019")

Congratulations, after these commands return you will have a fully
functional replica set. You may have to wait several moments for the
new replica set to successfully elect a :term:`primary` node.

See the documentation of the following shell functions for more
information: :func:`rs.initiate()`, :func:`rs.conf()`,
:func:`rs.reconfig()` and :func:`rs.add()`.

.. [#screen] `GNU Screen <http://www.gnu.org/screen/>`_ is packaged as
   ``screen`` on Debian-based, Fedira/Red Hat-based, and Arch Linux.

.. seealso:: You may also consider the "`simple setup script
   <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-snippets/blob/master/replication/simple-setup.Pu>`_"
   as an example of a basic automatically configured replica set.

Production Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Production replica sets are very similar to the development or testing
deployment described above, with the following differences:

- Each member of the replica set will reside on it's own machine, and
  the MongoDB processes will all bind to port ``27017``, or the
  standard MongoDB port.

- All runtime configuration will be specified in :doc:`configuration
  files </reference/configuration-options>` rather than as
  :doc:`command line options </reference/mongod>`.

- Each member of the replica set needs to be accessible by way of
  resolvable DNS or hostnames in the following scheme:

  - ``mongodb0.example.net``
  - ``mongodb1.example.net``
  - ``mongodb2.example.net``

  Configure DNS names appropriately, *or* set up your systems'
  ``/etc/host`` file to reflect this configuration.

Use the following configuration for each MongoDB instance.

.. code-block:: cfg

   port = 27017

   bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

   dbpath = /srv/mongodb/

   fork = true

   replSet = rs0/mongodb0.example.net,mongodb1.example.net,mongodb2.example.net

Modify the :setting:`bind_ip` to reflect a secure interface on
your system that will be able to access all other members of the set
*and* on which all other members of the replica set can access the
current node. The DNS or host names need to point and resolve to this
IP address. Configure network rules or a virtual private network
(i.e. "VPN") to permit this access.

.. note::

   The portion of the :setting:`replSet` following the ``/``
   provides a "seed list" of hosts that are known to be members of the
   same replica set, which is used for fetching changed configurations
   following restarts. It is acceptable to omit this section entirely,
   and have the :setting:`replSet` option resemble:

   .. code-block:: cfg

      replSet = rs0

Store this file on each system, located at ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` on
the file system. See the documentation of the configuration options
used above: :setting:`dbpath`, :setting:`port`,
:setting:`replSet`, :setting:`bind_ip`, and
:setting:`fork`. Also consider
any additional :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>`
that your deployment may require.

On each system issue the following command to start the
:program:`mongod` process:

.. code-block:: bash

     mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

.. note::

   In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
   :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this
   command. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

Log in with the :program:`mongo` shell to this host using the following
command: ::

      mongo

Issue the following shell function to initiate a replica set
consisting of the current node, using the default configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.initiate()

Use the following shell function to display the current :doc:`replica
configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.config()

Now, issue the following sequence of commands to add two nodes to the
replica set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
   rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")

Congratulations, after these commands return you will have a fully
functional replica set. You may have to wait several moments for the
new replica set to successfully elect a :term:`primary` node.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :func:`rs.initiate()`,
   - :func:`rs.conf()`,
   - :func:`rs.reconfig()`, and
   - :func:`rs.add()`.
