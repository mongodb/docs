==================
The MongoDB Manual
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! The Manual begins by introducing
MongoDB and continues to describe the query language, operational
considerations and procedures, administration, among other topics in
addition to a thorough reference.

This manual is under constant development, and will soon replace the
existing :ref:`MongoDB Wiki <mongodb-wiki>`. See the ":doc:`/about`"
page for an overview of the MongoDB Documentation project.  For now,
documentation resources coexist and link to one another. As you
explore the manual, expect to move between documentation sites.

Getting Started
---------------

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database designed for
ease of development and scalability, with particular emphasis on
Internet applications and infrastructure.  If you're new to
MongoDB, begin with the following resources:

- :doc:`Installing MongoDB </installation>`
- :doc:`The MongoDB Tutorial </tutorial/getting-started>`
- :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </faq/fundamentals>`
- :doc:`/release-notes`

If you're familiar with database systems that use SQL, consider the
following documents, which compare common MongoDB conventions and
operations with their SQL equivalents:

- :doc:`/reference/sql-comparison`
- :doc:`/reference/sql-aggregation-comparison`

MongoDB has an :wiki:`active community <community>`. You'll get a
quick response to any question posted to the `MongoDB User Mailing List`_

   - **For Developers**

     If you're new to MongoDB, consider the :doc:`/installation`
     document, the :doc:`/faq` section and particularly the
     :doc:`developer FAQs
     <faq/developers>`. :doc:`/applications/drivers` page lists the
     client libraries which all provide basic introductory
     tutorials. Nevertheless, MongoDB users should have a basic
     understanding several core concepts, including:

     - :doc:`/core/document`
     - :doc:`/core/read-operations`
     - :doc:`/core/write-operations`

     Once you have selected a programming :doc:`language and driver
     <applications/drivers>`, become familiar with the core
     :doc:`/crud` and :doc:`/applications` documents, in particular:

     - :doc:`/applications/create`,
     - :doc:`/applications/read`,
     - :doc:`/applications/update`, and
     - :doc:`/applications/delete`.

     As you use MongoDB more you should also be learn about
     :doc:`Indexing </indexes>`. Many users will also find MongoDB's
     :doc:`data aggregation </aggregation>` useful. Finally, the
     :doc:`use case </use-cases>` and :doc:`tutorials </tutorial>`
     documents provide examples and outline common processes and
     practices.

   - **For Administrators**

     If you're administering MongoDB, you'll need to know at least the
     basics of :doc:`querying </applications/read>` MongoDB and :wiki:`using
     the shell <Overview+-+The+MongoDB+Interactive+Shell>`. You can
     then the Manual's :doc:`administration </administration>`
     section, beginning with the :doc:`configuration
     </administration/configuration>` document.

     Most deployments consist of a single replica set. Scaling the
     database horizontally on existing hardware usually involves
     sharding, consider the documentation of these deployment options:

     - :doc:`Replication </replication>`
     - :doc:`Sharding </sharding>`

     As you begin deploying MongoDB in production environments,
     familiarize yourself with the :ref:`Administration Tutorials
     <tutorials-administration>` section and the following topics:

     - :doc:`Security </security>`
     - :doc:`Backups </administration/backups>`
     - :doc:`Monitoring </administration/monitoring>`
     - :doc:`Hardware and System Settings </administration/production-notes>`

Reference
---------

This manual features a detailed reference, including: a JavaScript
method reference, detailed documentation of all operators in the
MongoDB query language, manual pages for all MongoDB tools and
binaries, a reference of all database commands, and full glossary and
topic index.

- :doc:`/reference/javascript`
- :doc:`/reference/operators`
- :ref:`MongoDB Manual Pages <man-pages>`
- :doc:`/reference/commands`
- :doc:`/reference/glossary`
- :ref:`MongoDB Manual Topic Index <genindex>`

Also consider the full :doc:`outline of the MongoDB Manual
<contents>`, and an index of all :doc:`MongoDB tutorials <tutorial>`.

MongoDB Wiki
------------

This manual will eventually replace the :wiki:`MongoDB Wiki <>`. Until
then, you'll have to use both to get the best information on
MongoDB. The following pages from the wiki are especially useful:
