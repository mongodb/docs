Select a Shard Key
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document gives guidelines for selecting a shard key. Choosing the
correct shard key can have a great impact on the performance,
capability, and functioning of your database and cluster. Appropriate
shard key choice depends on the schema of your data and the way that
your application queries and writes data to the database.

Use the following guidelines when creating a shard key.

Create a Shard Key that is Easily Divisible
-------------------------------------------

An easily divisible shard key makes it easy for MongoDB to distribute
content among the shards. Shard keys that have a limited number of
possible values can result in chunks that are "unsplitable." See the
:ref:`sharding-shard-key-cardinality` section for more information.

Create a Shard Key that has High Randomness
-------------------------------------------

A shard key with high randomness prevents any single shard from becoming
a bottleneck and will distribute write operations among the cluster.

Conversely, a shard keys that has a high correlation with insert time is
a poor choice. For more information, see the
:ref:`sharding-shard-key-write-scaling`.

Create a Shard Key that Targets a Single Shard
----------------------------------------------

A shard key that targets a single shard makes it possible for the
:program:`mongos` program to return most query operations directly from
a single *specific* :program:`mongod` instance. Your shard key should be
the primary field used by your queries. Fields with a high degree of
"randomness" are poor choices for this reason. For examples, see
:ref:`sharding-shard-key-query-isolation`.

Create a Special Purpose or Compound Key
----------------------------------------

The challenge when selecting a shard key is that there is not always
an obvious choice. Often, an existing field in your collection may not be
the optimal key. In those situations, computing a special purpose
shard key into an additional field or using a compound shard key may
help produce one that is more ideal.
