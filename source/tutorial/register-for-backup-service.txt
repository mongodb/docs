=====================
Register for |backup|
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Overview
--------

You must register for |backup|. if you have not registered, the registration
page will appear when you access |backup|. You only need to register once.

Registration is a simple form plus a setup interface to help configure |backup|
easily in one series of tasks. The alternative is to perform setup tasks with
multiple pages in the |mms|.

If you do not use the setup interface, it is available as a :guilabel:`setup`
button at the top left of the application until you configure a host for backup.

Prerequisites
-------------

Basic registration requires only your contact information and a unique name for
your first group in the |mms|. To setup your |backup| account, or use the setup
interface, have this information available:

- A phone number to receive two-factor authentication sms messages, or
  configured the Google Authenticator application with mms.

- The mms monitoring agent installed. see :doc:`/tutorial/set-up-mms`.

   - Configure any firewalls to allow outbound connections to ``https://mms.mongodb.com``.

- Host type (replica set or sharded cluster), internal ``mongod`` host name (we
  recommend a unique name, not localhost), port, database username/password,
  and any SSL information if your MongoDBs support encrypted connections.

   - Credit card information to pay for billing.
