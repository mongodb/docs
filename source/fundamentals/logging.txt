Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to configure the driver logger which is responsible
for reporting events that occur while your application is running. You can
set the logger level, specify logging settings for individual classes, and
provide a custom logger implementation.

You should read this guide if you need to customize the default behavior of the
driver logger or want to explore the information provided by the logger.

Log Levels
----------

You can configure the driver to report logger messages at three different
levels as shown in the following table.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Logger Level
     - Description

   * - ``debug``
     - The most verbose logger level which shows all logger messages reported
       by the driver including those reported in the ``info`` and ``error``
       levels.

   * - ``info``
     - Include informational messages reported by the driver including those
       reported in the ``error`` level.

   * - ``error``
     - Only include error messages reported by the driver. This is the default
       setting.

The following example demonstrates how to set the logger to the ``debug``
level:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/logging/levels.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent: 4

Filter on a Specific Class
--------------------------

You can set the Logger to only produce log messages that are reported by
specific classes. The following example demonstrates how to log messages from
only the ``Db`` class.

.. code-block:: js

   async function main(client) {
     // Set debug level
     Logger.setLevel("debug");
     // Only log statements on "Db" class
     Logger.filter("class", ["Db"]);

     const db = client.db("sample_mflix");

     // Execute command { isMaster: true } against db
     await db.command({ isMaster: true });
   }

The driver classes that can be specified for filtering are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Class name
     - Description

   * - ``Db``
     - Information related to calls on a db instance

   * - ``Server``
     - Information related to a server instance (standalone instance,
       ``mongos`` instance, or replica set member).

   * - ``ReplSet``
     - Information related to a replica set.

   * - ``Mongos``
     - Information related to a ``mongos`` instance.

   * - ``Cursor``
     - Information related to a cursor.

   * - ``Pool``
     - Information related to a connection pool.

   * - ``Connection``
     - Information related to a single-instance connection.

   * - ``Ping``
     - Information related to a replica set ping operation.

You can add your own classes to the logger filter by creating your own logger
instances as shown in the following sample code.

.. code-block:: js

   const { Logger } = require("mongodb");

   class A {
     constructor() {
       this.logger = new Logger("A");
     }

     doSomething() {
       if (this.logger.isInfo()) {
         this.logger.info("logging A", {});
       }
     }
   }

   // Execute A
   const a = new A();
   a.doSomething();

Custom Logger
-------------

You can configure the behavior and format of the messages reported by the
logger by passing in a
:node-api:`logger callback function <Logger.html#~loggerCallback>` which
allows you to access and modify the message and metadata of the logger
message.

The following example demonstrates how to define a custom logger.

.. code-block:: js

   async function main(client) {
     // Set debug level
     Logger.setLevel("debug");

     // Set our own logger
     Logger.setCurrentLogger(function(msg, context) {
       // Add your custom logic here
       console.log(msg, context);
     });

     const db = client.db("sample_mflix");

     // Execute command { isMaster: true } against db to produce log messages
     await db.command({ isMaster: true });
   }

For more information on the methods available on the ``Logger``, see the
:node-api:`Logger API documentation <Logger.html>`.
