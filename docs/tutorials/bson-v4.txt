This tutorial discusses using the Ruby BSON library.

Installation
------------

The BSON library can be installed from `Rubygems <http://rubygems.org>`_
manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install bson -v '~> 4.0'

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'bson', '~> 4.0'

The BSON library is compatible with MRI >= 2.3 and JRuby >= 9.2.

Use With ActiveSupport
----------------------

Serialization for ActiveSupport-defined classes, such as TimeWithZone, is
not loaded by default to avoid a hard dependency of BSON on ActiveSupport.
When using BSON in an application that also uses ActiveSupport, the
ActiveSupport-related code must be explicitly required:

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'bson'
    require 'bson/active_support'

BSON Serialization
------------------

Getting a Ruby object's raw BSON representation is done by calling ``to_bson``
on the Ruby object, which will return a ``BSON::ByteBuffer``. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day".to_bson
  1024.to_bson

Generating an object from BSON is done via calling ``from_bson`` on the class
you wish to instantiate and passing it a ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  String.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  BSON::Int32.from_bson(byte_buffer)


Byte Buffers
------------

BSON library 4.0 introduces the use of native byte buffers in MRI and JRuby
instead of using ``StringIO``, for improved performance.

Writing
```````

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for writing (i.e. serializing to BSON),
instantiate ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with no arguments:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new

To write raw bytes to the byte buffer with no transformations, use
``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` methods. They take a byte string as the argument
and copy this string into the buffer. ``put_byte`` enforces that the argument
is a string of length 1; ``put_bytes`` accepts any length strings.
The strings can contain null bytes.

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_byte("\x00")

  buffer.put_bytes("\xff\xfe\x00\xfd")

.. note::

  ``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` do not write a BSON type byte prior to
  writing the argument to the byte buffer.

Subsequent write methods write objects of particular types in the
`BSON spec <http://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`_. Note that the type indicated
by the method name takes precedence over the type of the argument -
for example, if a floating-point value is given to ``put_int32``, it is
coerced into an integer and the resulting integer is written to the byte
buffer.

To write a UTF-8 string (BSON type 0x02) to the byte buffer, use ``put_string``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_string("hello, world")

Note that BSON strings are always encoded in UTF-8. Therefore, the
argument must be either in UTF-8 or in an encoding convertable to UTF-8
(i.e. not binary). If the argument is in an encoding other than UTF-8,
the string is first converted to UTF-8 and the UTF-8 encoded version is
written to the buffer. The string must be valid in its claimed encoding,
including being valid UTF-8 if the encoding is UTF-8.
The string may contain null bytes.

The BSON specification also defines a CString type, which is used for
example for document keys. To write CStrings to the buffer, use ``put_cstring``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_cstring("hello, world")

As with regular strings, CStrings in BSON must be UTF-8 encoded. If the
argument is not in UTF-8, it is converted to UTF-8 and the resulting string
is written to the buffer. Unlike ``put_string``, the UTF-8 encoding of
the argument given to ``put_cstring`` cannot have any null bytes, since the
CString serialization format in BSON is null terminated.

Unlike ``put_string``, ``put_cstring`` also accepts symbols and integers.
In all cases the argument is stringified prior to being written:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_cstring(:hello)
  buffer.put_cstring(42)

To write a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer to the byte buffer, use
``put_int32`` and ``put_int64`` methods respectively. Note that Ruby
integers can be arbitrarily large; if the value being written exceeds the
range of a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer, ``put_int32`` and ``put_int64``
raise ``RangeError``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_int32(12345)
  buffer.put_int64(123456789012345)

.. note::

  If ``put_int32`` or ``put_int64`` are given floating point arguments,
  the arguments are first coerced into integers and the integers are
  written to the byte buffer.

To write a 64-bit floating point value to the byte buffer, use ``put_double``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_double(3.14159)

To obtain the serialized data as a byte string (for example, to send the data
over a socket), call ``to_s`` on the buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new
  buffer.put_string('testing')
  socket.write(buffer.to_s)

.. note::

  ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
  There is no way to rewind the buffer for writing - ``rewind`` only affects
  the read position.


Reading
```````

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for reading (i.e. deserializing from BSON),
instantiate ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with a byte string as the argument:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new(string) # a read mode buffer.

Reading from the buffer is done via the following API:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.get_byte # Pulls a single byte from the buffer.
  buffer.get_bytes(value) # Pulls n number of bytes from the buffer.
  buffer.get_cstring # Pulls a null-terminated string from the buffer.
  buffer.get_double # Pulls a 64-bit floating point from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int32 # Pulls a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int64 # Pulls a 64-bit integer (8 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_string # Pulls a UTF-8 string from the buffer.

To restart reading from the beginning of a buffer, use ``rewind``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.rewind

.. note::

  ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
  ``rewind`` only affects the read position.


Supported Classes
-----------------

Core Ruby classes that have representations in the BSON specification and
will have a ``to_bson`` method defined for them are: ``Object``, ``Array``,
``FalseClass``, ``Float``, ``Hash``, ``Integer``, ``NilClass``, ``Regexp``,
``String``, ``Symbol`` (deprecated), ``Time``, ``TrueClass``.

In addition to the core Ruby objects, BSON also provides some special types
specific to the specification:


``BSON::Binary``
````````````````

Use ``BSON::Binary`` objects to store arbitrary binary data. The ``Binary``
objects can be constructed from binary strings as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.new("binary_string")
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101192900 type=generic data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

By default, ``Binary`` objects are created with BSON binary subtype 0
(``:generic``). The subtype can be explicitly specified to indicate that
the bytes encode a particular type of data:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101225420 type=user data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

Valid subtypes are ``:generic``, ``:function``, ``:old``, ``:uuid_old``,
``:uuid``, ``:md5`` and ``:user``.

The data and the subtype can be retrieved from ``Binary`` instances using
``data`` and ``type`` attributes, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
  binary.data
  => "binary_string"
  binary.type
  => :user

.. note::

  ``BSON::Binary`` objects always store the data in ``BINARY`` encoding,
  regardless of the encoding that the string passed to the constructor
  was in:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    str = "binary_string"
    str.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:US-ASCII>
    binary = BSON::Binary.new(str)
    binary.data
    # => "binary_string"
    binary.data.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>

UUID Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a UUID BSON::Binary (binary subtype 4) from its RFC 4122-compliant
string representation, use the ``from_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"
  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653612880 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

To stringify a UUID BSON::Binary to an RFC 4122-compliant representation,
use the ``to_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid)
  => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>
  binary.to_uuid
  => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

The standard representation may be explicitly specified when invoking both
``from_uuid`` and ``to_uuid`` methods:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :standard)
  binary.to_uuid(:standard)

Note that the ``:standard`` representation can only be used with a Binary
of subtype ``:uuid`` (not ``:uuid_old``).

Legacy UUIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data stored in BSON::Binary objects of subtype 3 (``:uuid_old``) may be
persisted in one of three different byte orders depending on which driver
created the data. The byte orders are CSharp legacy, Java legacy and Python
legacy. The Python legacy byte order is the same as the standard RFC 4122
byte order; CSharp legacy and Java legacy byte orders have some of the bytes
swapped.

The Binary object containing a legacy UUID does not encode *which* format
the UUID is stored in. Therefore, methods that convert to and from the legacy
UUID format take the desired format, or representation, as their argument.
An application may copy legacy UUID Binary objects without knowing which byte
order they store their data in.

The following methods for working with legacy UUIDs are provided for
interoperability with existing deployments storing data in legacy UUID formats.
It is recommended that new applications use the ``:uuid`` (subtype 4) format
only, which is compliant with RFC 4122.

To stringify a legacy UUID BSON::Binary, use the ``to_uuid`` method specifying
the desired representation. Accepted representations are ``:csharp_legacy``,
``:java_legacy`` and ``:python_legacy``. Note that a legacy UUID BSON::Binary
cannot be stringified without specifying a representation.

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid_old)
  => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

  binary.to_uuid
  # => ArgumentError (Representation must be specified for BSON::Binary objects of type :uuid_old)

  binary.to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
  # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"

  binary.to_uuid(:java_legacy)
  # => "77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988"

  binary.to_uuid(:python_legacy)
  # => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

To create a legacy UUID BSON::Binary from the string representation of the
UUID, use the ``from_uuid`` method specifying the desired representation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :csharp_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653650480 type=uuid_old data=0x3322110055447766...>

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :java_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653663960 type=uuid_old data=0x7766554433221100...>

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :python_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653686300 type=uuid_old data=0x0011223344556677...>

These methods can be used to convert from one representation to another:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid('77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988',:java_legacy).to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
  # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"


``BSON::Code``
``````````````

Represents a string of JavaScript code.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Code.new("this.value = 5;")

``BSON::CodeWithScope``
```````````````````````

.. note::

  The ``CodeWithScope`` type is deprecated as of MongoDB 4.2.1. Starting
  with MongoDB 4.4, support from ``CodeWithScope`` is being removed from
  various server commands and operators such as ``$where``. Please use
  other BSON types and operators when working with MongoDB 4.4 and newer.

Represents a string of JavaScript code with a hash of values.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::CodeWithScope.new("this.value = age;", age: 5)

``BSON::Document``
``````````````````

This is a subclass of ``Hash`` that stores all keys as strings, but allows
access to them with symbol keys.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Document[:key, "value"]
  BSON::Document.new

.. note::

  All BSON documents are deserialized into instances of BSON::Document,
  even when the invocation is made from the ``Hash`` class:
  
  .. code-block:: ruby
    
    bson = {test: 1}.to_bson.to_s
    loaded = Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new(bson))
    => {"test"=>1}
    loaded.class
    => BSON::Document


``BSON::MaxKey``
````````````````

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare higher to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MaxKey.new

``BSON::MinKey``
````````````````

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare lower to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MinKey.new

``BSON::ObjectId``
``````````````````

Represents a 12 byte unique identifier for an object on a given machine.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::ObjectId.new

``BSON::Timestamp``
```````````````````

Represents a special time with a start and increment value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Timestamp.new(5, 30)

``BSON::Undefined``
```````````````````

Represents a placeholder for a value that was not provided.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Undefined.new

``BSON::Decimal128``
````````````````````

Represents a 128-bit decimal-based floating-point value capable of emulating
decimal rounding with exact precision.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Instantiate with a String
  BSON::Decimal128.new("1.28")

  # Instantiate with a BigDecimal
  d = BigDecimal(1.28, 3)
  BSON::Decimal128.new(d)

``Symbol``
``````````

The BSON specification defines a symbol type which allows round-tripping
Ruby ``Symbol`` values (i.e., a Ruby ``Symbol``is encoded into a BSON symbol
and a BSON symbol is decoded into a Ruby ``Symbol``). However, since most
programming langauges do not have a native symbol type, to promote
interoperabilty, MongoDB deprecated the BSON symbol type and encourages
strings to be used instead.

.. note::

  In BSON, hash *keys* are always strings. Non-string values will be
  stringified when used as hash keys:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    Hash.from_bson({foo: 'bar'}.to_bson)
    # => {"foo"=>"bar"}

    Hash.from_bson({1 => 2}.to_bson)
    # => {"1"=>2}

By default, the BSON library encodes ``Symbol`` hash values as strings and
decodes BSON symbols into Ruby ``Symbol`` values:

.. code-block:: ruby

  {foo: :bar}.to_bson.to_s
  # => "\x12\x00\x00\x00\x02foo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00"

  # 0x02 is the string type
  Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new("\x12\x00\x00\x00\x02foo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00".force_encoding('BINARY')))
  # => {"foo"=>"bar"}

  # 0x0E is the symbol type
  Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new("\x12\x00\x00\x00\x0Efoo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00".force_encoding('BINARY')))
  # => {"foo"=>:bar}

To force encoding of Ruby symbols to BSON symbols, wrap the Ruby symbols in
``BSON::Symbol::Raw``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  {foo: BSON::Symbol::Raw.new(:bar)}.to_bson.to_s
  # => "\x12\x00\x00\x00\x0Efoo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00"

JSON Serialization
------------------

Some BSON types have special representations in JSON. These are as follows
and will be automatically serialized in the form when calling ``to_json`` on
them.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 105

   * - Object
     - JSON

   * - ``BSON::Binary``
     - ``{ "$binary" : "\x01", "$type" : "md5" }``

   * - ``BSON::Code``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = 5" }``

   * - ``BSON::CodeWithScope``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = value", "$scope" : { v => 5 }}``

   * - ``BSON::MaxKey``
     - ``{ "$maxKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::MinKey``
     - ``{ "$minKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::ObjectId``
     - ``{ "$oid" : "4e4d66343b39b68407000001" }``

   * - ``BSON::Timestamp``
     - ``{ "t" : 5, "i" : 30 }``

   * - ``Regexp``
     - ``{ "$regex" : "[abc]", "$options" : "i" }``


Time Instances
--------------

Times in Ruby can have nanosecond precision. Times in BSON (and MongoDB)
can only have millisecond precision. When Ruby ``Time`` instances are
serialized to BSON or Extended JSON, the times are floored to the nearest
millisecond.

.. note::

  The time as always rounded down. If the time precedes the Unix epoch
  (January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC), the absolute value of the time would
  increase:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    time = Time.utc(1960, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 999_999)
    time.to_f
    # => -315619199.000001
    time.floor(3).to_f
    # => -315619199.001

.. note::

  JRuby as of version 9.2.11.0 `rounds pre-Unix epoch times up rather than
  down <https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6104>`_. bson-ruby works around
  this and correctly floors the times when serializing on JRuby.

Because of this flooring, applications are strongly recommended to perform
all time calculations using integer math, as inexactness of floating point
calculations may produce unexpected results.


DateTime Instances
------------------

BSON only supports storing the time as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. Ruby's ``DateTime`` instances can be serialized to BSON,
but when the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as
``Time`` instances.

``DateTime`` class in Ruby supports non-Gregorian calendars. When non-Gregorian
``DateTime`` instances are serialized, they are first converted to Gregorian
calendar, and the respective date in the Gregorian calendar is stored in the
database.


Date Instances
--------------

BSON only supports storing the time as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. Ruby's ``Date`` instances can be serialized to BSON, but when
the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as ``Time`` instances.

When ``Date`` instances are serialized, the time value used is midnight
of the day that the ``Date`` refers to in UTC.


Regular Expressions
-------------------

Ruby regular expressions always have BSON regular expressions' equivalent of
'm' flag on. In order for behavior to be preserved between the two, the 'm'
option is always added when a Ruby regular expression is serialized to BSON.

There is a class provided by the bson gem, ``Regexp::Raw``, to allow Ruby users
to get around this. You can simply create a regular expression like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")

This code example illustrates the difference between serializing a core Ruby
``Regexp`` versus a ``Regexp::Raw`` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

  regexp_ruby = /^b403158/
  # => /^b403158/
  regexp_ruby.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf20ab8028>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00m\x00"
  regexp_raw = Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x007fcf21808f98 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
  regexp_raw.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf213622f0>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00\x00"


Please use the ``Regexp::Raw`` class to instantiate your BSON regular
expressions to get the exact pattern and options you want.

When regular expressions are deserialized, they return a wrapper that holds the
raw regex string, but do not compile it. In order to get the Ruby ``Regexp``
object, one must call ``compile`` on the returned object.

.. code-block:: ruby

  regex = Regexp.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  regex.pattern #=> Returns the pattern as a string.
  regex.options #=> Returns the raw options as a String.
  regex.compile #=> Returns the compiled Ruby Regexp object.


Key Order
---------

BSON documents preserve the order of keys, because the documents are stored
as lists of key-value pairs. Hashes in Ruby also preserve key order; thus
the order of keys specified in Ruby will be respected when serializing a
hash to a BSON document, and when deserializing a BSON document into a hash
the order of keys in the document will match the order of keys in the hash.


Duplicate Keys
--------------

BSON specification allows BSON documents to have duplicate keys, because the
documents are stored as lists of key-value pairs. Applications should refrain
from generating such documents, because MongoDB server behavior is undefined
when a BSON document contains duplicate keys.

Since in Ruby hashes cannot have duplicate keys, when serializing Ruby hashes
to BSON documents no duplicate keys will be generated. (It is still possible
to hand-craft a BSON document that would have duplicate keys in Ruby, and
some of the other MongoDB BSON libraries may permit creating BSON documents
with duplicate keys.)

Note that, since keys in BSON documents are always stored as strings,
specifying the same key as as string and a symbol in Ruby only retains the
most recent specification:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Document.new(test: 1, 'test' => 2)
  => {"test"=>2}

When loading a BSON document with duplicate keys, the last value for a
duplicated key overwrites previous values for the same key.
