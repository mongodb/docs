Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation 
stage is used when running the helper method :method:`db.currentOp()` 
with :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

Given this, in the 5.0 version of the shell and with mongosh,
:method:`db.currentOp()` result sets are not subject to the
:ref:`16MB BSON document return size<limit-bson-document-size>` 
document return size limit for documents of the previous legacy 
``mongo`` versions.
