If you find a bug in MongoDB or one of the related projects, you should
submit a report to that project's `JIRA <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_
issue tracker.

Your first step should be to search the existing set of open tickets
for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already
reported your problem, then you can :guilabel:`upvote` that report to
increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:

#. `Sign in to MongoDB JIRA. <https://jira.mongodb.org/login.jsp>`_ You
   will need to create an account if you do not have one.

#. `Go to the Create Issue screen and select the relevant project. <https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa>`_

#. Fill in the fields of :guilabel:`Summary`, :guilabel:`Description`,
   :guilabel:`Steps To Reproduce`, and :guilabel:`Affects Version` to the
   best you can. If the bug corresponds to a crash, attach the stack trace
   from the logs.

An excellent resource is `Elika Etemad's article on filing good bug
reports. <http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/>`_.

As a general rule of thumb, please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible.* Include steps to reproduce the problem.

- *Specific.* Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.

- *Unique.* Do not duplicate existing tickets.

- *Scoped to a Single Bug.* One bug per report.
