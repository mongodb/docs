When you stop backups for a replica set or sharded cluster |mms| stops
taking new snapshots but retains existing snapshots until their listed
expiration date.

If you later restart backups for replica set or cluster, |mms| might
perform an :term:`initial sync`, depending on how much time has elapsed.

If you **terminate** a backup, |mms| immediately **deletes all the
backup's snapshots.**

.. warning:: Terminating a backup triggers a full backup

   If you terminate a backup, |mms| immediately deletes the backup's
   snapshots. The next backup job runs as a full backup rather than an
   incremental backup.

Force Terminate a Deployment's Backups
--------------------------------------

If your attempt to terminate backups fails and you still need to
terminate regardless of any errors, you can force terminate the
backups.

.. note:: 

   If you wish to Force Terminate backups on a sharded cluster, you
   must repeat the following steps for each backup job on each shard
   or config server.

.. important::
   You should make sure that the Backup Job you want to terminate is
   in the :guilabel:`Terminating` state.
