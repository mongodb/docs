Firewalls
---------

Firewalls allow administrators to filter and control access to a system
by providing granular control over network communications. For
administrators of MongoDB, the following capabilities are important:
limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to specific systems and
limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts.

On Linux systems, the ``iptables`` interface provides access to the
underlying ``netfilter`` firewall. On Windows systems, ``netsh``
command line interface provides access to the underlying Windows
Firewall. For additional information about firewall configuration, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall` and

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`.

For best results and to minimize overall exposure, ensure that *only*
traffic from trusted sources can reach :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can only connect to trusted outputs.

Virtual Private Networks
------------------------

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two
networks over an encrypted and limited-access trusted
network. Typically, MongoDB users who use VPNs use TLS/SSL rather than
IPSEC VPNs for performance issues.

Depending on configuration and implementation, VPNs provide for
certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which
requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all
clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, by using a
VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can
prevent tampering and "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
