#   Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the client
#   stops using it for read operations. For details, see:
#   :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness`.
#
#   By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
#   secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation.
#
#   The minimum {{arg_name}} value is 90 seconds. Specifying a
#   value of less than 90 seconds will produce an error.
#
#   .. important::
#      To use ``maxStalenessSeconds``, all of the
#      MongoDB instances in your deployment must be using MongoDB 3.4 or
#      later. If any instances are on an earlier version of MongoDB, the
#      driver of :program:`mongos` will raise an error.
