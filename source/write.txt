Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that show common functions you
can use to write data to MongoDB with the {+driver-short+}.

.. tip::

  To learn more about any of the functions shown on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the :ref:`sample
application <c-write-sample>` or your own application. Be sure to replace all
placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<connection string URI>``, with the
relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.
