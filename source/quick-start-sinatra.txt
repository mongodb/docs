Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use {+odm+} in a new Sinatra web application,
connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and perform
read and write operations on the data in your cluster.

To learn how to integrate {+odm+} into an existing application, see the
:ref:`mongoid-add-to-existing` guide.

.. tip::

   If you prefer to connect to MongoDB by using the {+ruby-driver+} without
   {+odm+}, see the {+ruby-driver+} :ruby:`Quick Start guide
   </tutorials/quick-start/>`.

{+odm+} is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) framework for MongoDB in
{+language+}. By using {+odm+}, you can easily interact with your data and
create flexible data models.

Sinatra is a domain-specific language (DSL) for creating web
applications in {+language+}. Sinatra applications are simple to set up
and can provide faster request processing than other frameworks.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to create a sample {+odm+} web application
that connects to a MongoDB deployment.

.. tip:: Other Framework Tutorials

   If you prefer to use {+ror+} 8 as your web framework, see the
   :ref:`mongoid-quick-start-rails` guide.
