Use the following resources to configure and manage |service|
{+clusters+}. These settings don't apply to {+serverless-instances+}.

.. _create-cluster-instance:

Select {+Cluster+} Tier
-----------------------

Select your preferred {+cluster+} tier. The {+cluster+} tier dictates 
the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops| specification for each 
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the {+cluster+}.

.. note::

   You might see different values depending on your
   selected cloud provider and region.

.. _shared-tier-cluster:

{+Shared-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use {+Shared-clusters+} as economical {+clusters+} for getting started 
with MongoDB and for low-throughput applications. These {+clusters+} 
deploy to a shared environment with access to a subset of |service| 
features. To learn more about {+shared-cluster+} limitations, see 
:ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

You can deploy one ``M0`` {+cluster+} (free sandbox replica set 
cluster) per |service| project. You can :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` 
an ``M0`` {+free-cluster+} to an ``M2+`` {+shared-cluster+} at any time.

``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters (low-cost {+shared-clusters+}) provide the 
following added features compared to ``M0`` clusters:

- :ref:`Backups <m2-m5-snapshots>` for your {+cluster+} data

- Increased storage

- :doc:`API access </api>`

Considerations
``````````````

- |service| deploys MongoDB 6.0 for all 
  :term:`{+shared-clusters+} <shared cluster>` 
  (``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5``). However, {+shared-clusters+} don't 
  support all functionality in MongoDB version 6.0 and 
  later. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

- |service| supports {+shared-cluster+} deployment in a subset of cloud
  providers and regions. |service| grays out any {+shared-cluster+} 
  tiers that the selected cloud service provider and region doesn't 
  support. To learn more about the regions that support 
  {+shared-cluster+} deployments, see:

  - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
  - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
  - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

.. _atlas-low-traffic-tier:

{+Dedicated-Clusters+} for Low-Traffic Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``M10`` and ``M20`` {+cluster+} tiers support development environments 
and low-traffic applications.

These clusters support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
provide full access to |service| features.

.. note::

   ``M10`` and ``M20`` {+cluster+} tiers run on a burstable performance 
   infrastructure.

.. _atlas-high-traffic-tier:

{+Dedicated-Clusters+} for High-Traffic Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``M30+`` {+cluster+} tiers support production environments with
high-traffic applications and large datasets.

These clusters support replica set and sharded {+cluster+} deployments 
with full access to |service| features.

Some clusters have variants, denoted by the |angle| character. When you
select these clusters, |service| lists the variants and tags each
{+cluster+} to distinguish their key characteristics.

.. |angle| unicode:: U+276F

.. _nvme-storage:

NVMe Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For applications hosted on :ref:`AWS <amazon-aws>` or 
:ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>` that require
low-latency and high-throughput I/O, |service| offers storage options
using locally attached ephemeral |nvme| |ssd|\s.

.. include:: /includes/fact-nvme-fcbis.rst

.. note::
   
   |service| doesn't support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |gcp|.

NVMe Considerations
```````````````````

The following {+cluster+} tiers support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |aws|:

- ``M40``
- ``M50``
- ``M60``
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M400``

The following {+cluster+} tiers support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |azure|:

- ``M60``
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M300``
- ``M400``
- ``M600``

|service| supports |nvme| {+clusters+} in the following |azure| regions:

The fixed-value storage space and RAM for an |nvme| {+cluster+}
corresponds to its {+cluster+} tier. To learn more, see 
:ref:`Amazon Cluster Configuration Options
<amazon-aws-configuration-options>` and 
:ref:`Azure Cluster Configuration Options
<microsoft-azure-configuration-options>`.

Clusters with |nvme| storage use :doc:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s 
</backup/cloud-backup/overview>`. You can't disable backup on |nvme| 
clusters. If you want to use hourly backups, |service| limits backups 
on |nvme| clusters to once every 12 hours.

|nvme| clusters use a :manual:`hidden secondary node
</core/replica-set-hidden-member>` that consists of a provisioned 
volume with high throughput and |iops| to facilitate backup.

You can't :ref:`pause <pause-cluster>` an |nvme| {+cluster+}.

Scaling |nvme| clusters requires an :term:`initial sync` even with :ref:`auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>`.
|nvme| clusters auto-scale to the next higher tier when 90% of the available storage space is consumed.

.. include:: /includes/fact-nvme-fcbis.rst

NVMe Availability Zones
+++++++++++++++++++++++

|nvme| {+clusters+} in the following |azure| regions have two
:ref:`Availability Zones <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`:

- ``eastus2``
- ``centralus``
- ``southcentralus``

|nvme| {+clusters+} in all other |azure| regions that 
:ref:`indicate Availability Zones <microsoft-azure-supported-regions>`
have three Availability Zones.

Take the Next Steps
-------------------

You can manage {+clusters+} in the following ways:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Action
     - Description

   * - :doc:`/customize-storage`
     - Customize the storage capacity of your {+cluster+}. Each 
       {+cluster+} tier comes with a default set of resources. ``M10+`` 
       {+clusters+} provide the ability to customize your storage 
       capacity.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-autoscaling`
     - Configure the {+cluster+} tier ranges that |service| uses to
       automatically scale your {+cluster+} tier, storage capacity, or 
       both in response to {+cluster+} usage.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-additional-settings`
     - Configure additional {+cluster+} settings such as MongoDB 
       version, backup, and encryption options.

   * - :ref:`configure-resource-tags`
     - Use resource tags that you provide and manage to categorize 
       resources by purpose, environment, team, or billing center.

   * - :doc:`/scale-cluster`
     - Reconfigure an existing {+cluster+}. Modify any of the available 
       |service| configuration options.

   * - :doc:`/tutorial/major-version-change/`
     - Manage major version upgrades for your {+cluster+}. |service| 
       enables you to upgrade the major version of an |service| 
       {+cluster+} at any time.

   * - :doc:`/tutorial/cluster-maintenance-window/`
     - Configure maintenance windows for your {+cluster+}. You can set 
       the hour of the day that |service| should start weekly 
       maintenance on your {+cluster+}.

   * -  :doc:`/pause-terminate-cluster`
     - Pause, resume, or terminate an existing {+cluster+}. You can't 
       change the configuration of a paused {+cluster+}. Also, you 
       can't read data from or write data to a paused {+cluster+}.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution`
     - Configure multi-cloud distribution for increased availability.
       |service| offers options to improve the availability and 
       workload balancing of your {+cluster+}.

   * - :ref:`replica-set-tags`
     - Use pre-defined replica set tags that |service| provides to 
       direct queries from specific applications to specific node types 
       and regions. To use pre-defined replica set tags in your 
       connection string and direct queries to specific nodes, set the 
       tag in the ``readPreferenceTags`` connection string option.
