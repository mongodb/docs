  The :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab on the :guilabel:`Network Access`
  page lists each {+aws-pl+} connection you've created. The 
  :guilabel:`Atlas Endpoint Service Status` and 
  :guilabel:`Interface Endpoint Status` fields show the status of each 
  {+aws-pl+} connection.

  Refer to the following statuses to help you determine the state of
  your {+aws-pl+} connections:

     * - Creating private link
       - |service| is creating the network load balancer and |vpc| 
         resources. 

     * - Failed
       - A system failure has occurred. 

     * - Ready for connection requests
       - The |service| network load balancer and |vpc| endpoint service 
         are created and ready to receive connection requests.

     * - Not configured
       - |service| created the network load balancer and |vpc| endpoint 
         service, but |aws| hasn't yet created the |vpc| endpoint.
         Click :guilabel:`Edit` and complete the wizard to create the
         |vpc| endpoint.

     * - Pending acceptance
       - |aws| has received the connection request from your |vpc|
         endpoint to the |service| |vpc| endpoint service.
       
     * - Pending
       - |aws| is establishing the connection between your
         |vpc| endpoint and the |service| |vpc| endpoint service.

     * - Failed
       - |aws| failed to establish a connection between |service| 
         |vpc| resources to the |vpc| endpoint in your |vpc|. Click :guilabel:`Edit`, verify that the information you provided is 
         correct, and then create the private endpoint again.

     * - Available
       - |service| |vpc| resources are connected to the |vpc| endpoint 
         in your |vpc|. You can connect to |service| clusters in this
         region using {+aws-pl+}.

  a. For each resource that needs to connect to your |service| clusters
     using {+aws-pl+}, the resource's security group must allow outbound 
     traffic to the |vpc| endpoint's private IP(s) on all ports. 

     See :aws:`Adding Rules to a Security Group </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>`
     for more information.

  #. Your |vpc| endpoint security group must allow inbound traffic on 
     all ports from each resource that needs to connect to your 
     |service| clusters using {+aws-pl+}.
  
     :aws:`Whitelist instance IP addresses or security groups </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>` 
     to allow traffic from them to reach the |vpc| endpoint security 
     group.
