Charts provide visual representations of the data in your
:doc:`data source <data-sources>`. A chart maps to a *single*
data source, and can display correlations between several fields in the
data.

Chart Types
-----------

|charts| provides the following visualizations for
your data:

- :ref:`Bar Charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - Colored Bar

  - Stacked Bar

  - Grouped Bar

- :ref:`Column Charts <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - Colored Column

  - Stacked Column

  - Grouped Column

- :ref:`Line Charts <line-area-chart-ref>`

  - Discrete Line

  - Continuous Line

- :ref:`Area Charts <line-area-chart-ref>`

  - Stacked Discrete Area

  - Continuous Area

- Grid Charts

  - :ref:`Heatmap <heatmap-chart-ref>`

  - :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`

- :ref:`Donut Charts <donut-chart-ref>`

- Text Charts

  - :ref:`Data Tables <data-table-ref>`

  - :ref:`Number Charts <number-chart-ref>`

Create a Chart
--------------

To begin building a new chart:

1. From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab, select the dashboard where you
   wish to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard,
   see :doc:`Dashboards </dashboards>`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Add Chart` button at the top-right corner of
   the dashboard view.

#. In the :guilabel:`Data Source` dropdown, select the data source to
   be used for this chart. For information on adding data sources in
   MongoDB Charts, see
   :doc:`Data Sources <data-sources>`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown, select the type for this
   chart.

   .. note::

      Each chart type provides different visualization options
      for the fields in your data, reflected by various
      *encoding channels*. These channels dictate how your data is
      visualized and enable powerful
      :manual:`aggregations </reference/operator/aggregation/>` for
      your data. For details on the different encoding channel types,
      refer to the :ref:`Encoding Channels <encoding-channels>`
      page.

#. Drag fields from the :guilabel:`Fields` section to the desired
   :ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` below the
   :guilabel:`Chart Type` dropdown. The fields listed correspond to the
   fields in your data source. You can search for a specific field in
   your data source by using the :guilabel:`Filter` search bar at the
   top of the :guilabel:`Fields` section.

   .. note::

      For details on how MongoDB Charts handles embedded objects and
      embedded arrays in fields, see the
      :ref:`Embedded Objects and Arrays <embedded-objects-arrays>`
      page.

#. Give your chart a title by hovering over the
   :guilabel:`Enter a title for your chart` text clicking the
   :guilabel:`Pencil Icon`. Click the :guilabel:`Green Check Mark` to
   save your title.

#. Once you are satisfied with your chart, click
   :guilabel:`Save Changes`. This saves your chart to your dashboard
   and redirects you to the dashboard view.
