"The sort function requires that the entire sort be able to complete "

"To avoid this error, create an index to support the sort operation or use"
" :operator:`$orderby` in conjunction with :operator:`$maxScan` and/or "
":method:`cursor.limit()`. The :method:`cursor.limit()` increases the "
"speed and reduces the amount of memory required to return this query by "
"way of an optimized algorithm. The specified limit must result in a "
"number of documents that fall within the 32 megabyte limit."
