        :term:`write concern` or ``false`` if write concern was disabled    
      - ``deletedCount`` containing the number of deleted documents

Syntax
------

The :method:`~db.collection.deleteOne()` method has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.deleteOne(
       <filter>,
       {
         writeConcern: <document>,
         collation: <document>,
         hint: <document|string>,
         maxTimeMS: <int>,
         let: <document>
       }
   )

The :method:`~db.collection.deleteOne()` method takes the following
parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`filter <deleteOne-filter>`
     - document
     - .. _deleteOne-filter:
    
       Specifies deletion criteria using a :ref:`query predicate
       <query-predicates-ref>`. 
      
       Specify an empty document ``{ }`` to delete the first document returned in 
       the collection.
      
   * - :ref:`writeConcern <deleteOne-wc>`
     - document
     - .. _deleteOne-wc:
    
       Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern
       </reference/write-concern>`. Omit to use the default write concern.
      
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-write-concern.rst
      
   * - :ref:`collation <deleteOne-collation>`
     - document
     - .. _deleteOne-collation:
  
       Optional. 
      
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option.rst
      
   * - :ref:`hint <deleteOne-hint>`
     - document
     - .. _deleteOne-hint:
 
       Optional. A document or string that specifies the :ref:`index
       <indexes>` to use to support the :ref:`query predicate

       The option can take an index specification document or the
       index name string.
      
       If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation
       errors.

       For an example, see :ref:`ex-deleteOne-hint`.

     - integer
     - .. _deleteOne-maxTimeMS:
        
       Optional. Specifies the time limit in milliseconds for the
       delete operation to run before timing out.

       Optional.

       .. include:: /includes/let-variables-syntax.rst
 
       .. include:: /includes/let-variables-syntax-note.rst

       For a complete example using ``let`` and variables,
       see :ref:`updateMany-let-example`.

Behavior
--------

.. _deleteOne-deletion-order:

Deletion Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.collection.deleteOne` deletes the first document that matches 
the filter. Use a field that is part of a :term:`unique index` such as ``_id`` 
for precise deletions.


Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use :method:`db.collection.deleteOne` on a sharded collection:

- If you only target one shard, you can use a partial shard key in the query 
  specification.
- You do not need to provide the :term:`shard key` or ``_id`` field in the query 
  specification, because ``deleteOne()`` inherently uses a limit of 1.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-supported-operation.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-write-concern.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst

.. |operation| replace:: :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`

Oplog Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a ``db.collection.deleteOne()`` operation successfully deletes a
document, the operation adds an entry on the :term:`oplog` (operations
log). If the operation fails or does not find a document to delete, the
operation does not add an entry on the oplog. 

Examples
--------

.. _deleteOne-example-delete-single-document:

Delete a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``orders`` collection has documents with the following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertOne(
      {
         _id: ObjectId("563237a41a4d68582c2509da"),
         stock: "Brent Crude Futures",
         qty: 250,
         type: "buy-limit",
         limit: 48.90,
         creationts: ISODate("2015-11-01T12:30:15Z"),
         expiryts: ISODate("2015-11-01T12:35:15Z"),
         client: "Crude Traders Inc."
      }
   )
   
The following operation deletes the order with ``_id: 
ObjectId("563237a41a4d68582c2509da")`` : 

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      db.orders.deleteOne( { _id: ObjectId("563237a41a4d68582c2509da") } );
   } catch (e) {
      print(e);
   }
   
The operation returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }
   
The following operation deletes the first document with ``expiryts`` greater 
than ``ISODate("2015-11-01T12:40:15Z")``

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      db.orders.deleteOne( { expiryts: { $lt: ISODate("2015-11-01T12:40:15Z") } } );
   } catch (e) {
      print(e);
   }

The operation returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

deleteOne() with a Timeout and Query Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation deletes the document that matches the type
``buy-limit``, ``limit`` is less that the variable ``priceThreshold``,
and sets a time limit of 3 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      db.orders.deleteOne(
         { type: "buy-limit" },
         { $expr: { $eq: ["$limit", "$$priceThreshold"] } },
         {
            let: { priceThreshold: 49.00 },
            maxTimeMS: 3000
         }
      );
   } catch (e) {
      print(e);
   }

The operation returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }
   
.. _deleteOne-example-update-with-write-concern:

deleteOne() with Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a three member replica set, the following operation specifies a 
``w`` of ``majority``, ``wtimeout`` of ``100``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      db.orders.deleteOne(
          { _id: ObjectId("563237a41a4d68582c2509da") },
          { w: "majority", wtimeout: 100 }
      );
   } catch (e) {
      print (e);
   }

If the acknowledgment takes longer than the ``wtimeout`` limit, the following 
exception is thrown:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteConcernError({
      code: 64,
      errmsg: "waiting for replication timed out",
      errInfo: {
        wtimeout: true,
        writeConcern: {  
          w: "majority",
          wtimeout: 100,
          provenance: "getLastErrorDefaults"
        }
      }
   })

.. seealso::

   :data:`WriteResult.writeConcernError`

Specify Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst

.. include:: /includes/collation-data-setup.rst

The following operation includes the :ref:`collation <collation>`
option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.deleteOne( 
      { category: "cafe", status: "Open" }, 
      { collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } }
   )

The delete filter specifies a collation with ``strength: 1``, which
means the collation ignores differences between case and letter
variants. As a result, even though there is not a document that has an
exact match with the specified case and letter variants in the filter,
the operation still matches and deletes a document.

.. _ex-deleteOne-hint:

Specify ``hint`` for Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a ``students`` collection
with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.insertMany( [
      { _id: 1, student: "Richard", grade: "F", points: 0 },
      { _id: 2, student: "Jane", grade: "A", points: 60 },
      { _id: 3, student: "Adam", grade: "F", points:  0 },
      { _id: 4, student: "Ronan", grade: "D", points: 20 },
      { _id: 5, student: "Noah", grade: "F", points:  0 },
      { _id: 6, student: "Henry", grade: "A", points: 86 }
   ] )

Create the following index on the collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.createIndex( { grade: 1 } )

The following delete operation explicitly hints to use the index
``{ grade: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.deleteOne(
      { points: { $lte: 20 }, grade: "F" }, 
      { hint: { grade: 1 } }
   )

.. note::
   
   If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation errors.

The delete command returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

To view the indexes used, you can use the :pipeline:`$indexStats` pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate( [ { $indexStats: { } }, { $sort: { name: 1 } } ] )

The ``accesses.ops`` field in the :pipeline:`$indexStats` output
indicates the number of operations that used the index.

   :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()`
