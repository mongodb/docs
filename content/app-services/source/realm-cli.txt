The MongoDB Realm Command Line Interface (``realm-cli``) allows you to
programmatically manage your App Services Apps. With ``realm-cli``, you
can create or update Apps from a local directory as well as export
existing applications to a local directory.

There are two versions of ``realm-cli``. Find the appropriate version
for your use case below:

- :ref:`realm-cli@^1 <realm-cli-v1>`
- :ref:`realm-cli@^2 <realm-cli>`
