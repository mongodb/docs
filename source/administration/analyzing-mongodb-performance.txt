As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to
analyze the performance of the application and its database.
When you encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database
access strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database
connections.

Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of inadequate
or inappropriate indexing strategies, or as a consequence of poor schema
design patterns. :ref:`analyzing-performance-locks` discusses how these can
impact MongoDB's internal locking.

Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at
capacity and that it is time to add additional capacity to the
database. In particular, the application's working set should fit in
the available physical memory.

In some cases performance issues may be temporary and related to
abnormal traffic load. As discussed in :ref:`number-of-connections`, scaling
can help relax excessive traffic.

Database profiling can help you to understand what operations are
causing degradation.

.. _analyzing-performance-locks:

Locking Performance
-------------------

MongoDB uses a locking system to ensure data set consistency. If
certain operations are long-running or a queue forms, performance
will degrade as requests and operations wait for the lock.

Lock-related slowdowns can be intermittent. To see if the lock has been
affecting your performance, refer to the :ref:`server-status-locks`
section and the :ref:`globalLock` section of the
:dbcommand:`serverStatus` output.

.. note::
   Some ``serverStatus`` response fields are not returned on 
   {+atlas+} M0/M2/M5 clusters or {+flex-clusters+}. For more information, 
   see :ref:`free-shard-commands-with-limits` in the {+atlas+} 
   documentation.

Dividing :serverstatus:`locks.<type>.timeAcquiringMicros` by
:serverstatus:`locks.<type>.acquireWaitCount`
can give an approximate average wait time for a particular lock mode.

:serverstatus:`locks.<type>.deadlockCount` provide
the number of times the lock acquisitions encountered deadlocks.

If :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.total` is consistently high,
then there is a chance that a large number of requests are waiting for
a lock. This indicates a possible concurrency issue that may be affecting
performance.

If :serverstatus:`globalLock.totalTime` is
high relative to :serverstatus:`uptime`, the database has
existed in a lock state for a significant amount of time.

Long queries can result from ineffective use of indexes;
non-optimal schema design; poor query structure; system architecture issues; or
insufficient RAM resulting in disk reads.

.. _number-of-connections:

Number of Connections
---------------------

In some cases, the number of connections between the applications and the
database can overwhelm the ability of the server to handle requests. The
following fields in the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` document can provide insight:

- :serverstatus:`connections` is a container for the following
  two fields:

  - :serverstatus:`connections.current` the total number of
    current clients connected to the database instance.

  - :serverstatus:`connections.available` the total number of
    unused connections available for new clients.

If there are numerous concurrent application requests, the database may have
trouble keeping up with demand. If this is the case,
increase the capacity of your deployment.

For write-heavy applications, deploy :term:`sharding` and add one or more
:term:`shards <shard>` to a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute load among
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

Spikes in the number of connections can also be the result of
application or driver errors. All of the officially supported MongoDB
drivers implement connection pooling, which allows clients to use and
reuse connections more efficiently. An extremely high number of
connections, particularly without corresponding workload, is often
indicative of a driver or other configuration error.

Self-Managed Connection Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless constrained by system-wide limits, the maximum number of
incoming connections supported by MongoDB is configured with the
:setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections` setting. On Unix-based systems,
system-wide limits can be modified using the ``ulimit`` command, or by
editing your system's ``/etc/sysctl`` file. See :ref:`ulimit`
for more information.

{+atlas+} Connection Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+atlas+} sets the limit for concurrent incoming connections based on 
the cluster tier and class. To learn more, see :ref:`<connection-limits>` 
in the Atlas documentation.
