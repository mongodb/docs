|mms| bills customers at the organization level. Each organization has
its own account, plan, and billing method. All projects in an
organization share the same billing settings.

.. _pricing-information:

Pricing and Billing
-------------------

Visit :website:`MongoDB Pricing </pricing>` to learn about
current pricing.

|mms| charges your credit card once each month.

   * - Level
     - Monthly Charge Basis

   * - |mms| Standard
     - :ref:`Server Hours <server-pricing>` and :ref:`backup-pricing`

   * - |mms| Premium
     - :ref:`backup-pricing`

.. note::

   |mms| charges self-serve customers mid-month if they exceeded their
   ``PENDING_INVOICE_OVER_THRESHOLD``
   threshold. After successful payment, this threshold increases.

.. _server-pricing:

Server Pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These charges apply to |mms| Standard.

The monthly charges include a charge per billable host. |mms| charges
for a host if it runs a |mongod| process and bears data. |mms| doesn't
charges for config servers, arbiters and |mongos| routers.

|mms| annualizes the monthly rate per host then divides by ``365 *
24`` to calculate an **Hourly Server Rate** per host. |mms| samples
your account once every hour to determine the count of running hosts.

.. _backup-pricing:

Backup Pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following settings affect backup pricing:

- :ref:`Snapshot size <cm-price-snapshot-size>`
- :ref:`Snapshot frequency and retention <cm-price-snapshot-freq>`

.. note::

   Using :doc:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup>` doesn't
   affect your backup pricing.

.. _cm-price-snapshot-size:

Size
````

Monthly backup costs are based on the uncompressed size of your most
recent set of snapshots.

The cost per GB per month for backup pricing is as specified on
:website:`MongoDB Cloud Manager web site </cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`. The monthly
rate is annualized and then divided by 365 to arrive at a Daily Backup
Rate per GB. The first 1 GB per replica set is free.

The size of the snapshot is roughly equivalent to the size of all
documents and all indexes for all the databases backed up. To retrieve
the size of the documents and indexes for a given database in
gigabytes, you can issue the :method:`db.stats` method and
sum the ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize`` fields.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stats(1024*1024*1024).dataSize + db.stats(1024*1024*1024).indexSize

.. _cm-price-snapshot-freq:

Snapshot Frequency and Retention
````````````````````````````````

|mms| bases this rate on taking 28 snapshots at steady state:

- Six-hour snapshots are kept for two days
- Daily snapshots for one week
- Weekly snapshots for one month
- Monthly for one year

This creates a total **28** snapshots (``8 + 7 + 2 + 11``). |mms|
adjusts the backup rate each day based on the following formula:

.. code-block:: text

   backupRatePerMonth = $1.25 + ((snapshotAtSteadyState รท 28) ร $1.25)

.. seealso::

   :ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`.

Lowering the Monthly Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frequency and Retention Settings
````````````````````````````````

Lowering snapshot frequency or retaining fewer snapshots lowers the
cost per gigabyte. Retaining an increased number of snapshots or
increasing the snapshot retention increases the cost per gigabyte.

To change a backed-up deployment's schedule, see
:ref:`edit-snapshot-schedule`

Administrators can change
:ref:`snapshot frequency and retention <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`
through the
:doc:`snapshotSchedule resource </reference/api/snapshot-schedule>` in
the |api|. Lowering snapshot frequency increases how long it takes to
build a point-in-time restore.

Excluding Databases or Collections
``````````````````````````````````
To reduce the size of your snapshots, you can exclude non-mission
critical databases and collections from your backup.

   To learn how to exclude databases or collections, see
   :ref:`edit-namespaces-filter`.
