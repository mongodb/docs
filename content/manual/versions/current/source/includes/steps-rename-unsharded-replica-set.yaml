title: Shut down replica set members.
level: 4
ref: shutdown-replica-set
content: |
  Follow the procedure in :ref:`Stop a Replica Set <stop-replica-set>`
  to confirm that replica set members are 
  :ref:`shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`.

  .. warning::
     
     This step requires downtime as all replica members will need to be 
     shut down.

title: Rename the replica set.

ref: rename-the-replica-set
content: |
  Perform the following steps for each replica set member:
  
  a. Start the replica set member on a different port without the
     :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option. 
  
  #. Update the replica set name. 

     - If using a :ref:`configuration file <conf-file>`, set 
       :setting:`replication.replSetName <replication.replSetName>` 
       to the new name. 

     - If using the :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command with 
       the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option, note down the 
       new replica set name for use in step f.
  
  #. Connect to the replica set member. 

  #. Update the replica set name in the :ref:`local database 
     <replica-set-local-database>` with the following commands:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        /* Set `newId` to the new replica set name */
        var newId = '<new replica set name>'

        var doc = db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.findOne()
        var oldId = doc._id
        doc._id = newId
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.insertOne(doc)
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.deleteOne({_id: oldId})

  #. :ref:`Shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>` the replica set 
     member.

     .. note:: Ops Manager
      
         If you are using Ops Manager, you must stop Ops Manager
         from managing the replica set before you shut down the 
         replica set member. For more information on this procedure,
         see :opsmgr:`Remove a Process from Ops Management
         </tutorial/unmanage-deployment/#remove-a-process-from-management>`
      
 
  #. Start the replica set member on its original port. 
  
     - If using a configuration file, ensure that 
       :setting:`replication.replSetName <replication.replSetName>` is 
       set to the new replica set name.
     
     - If using the :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command with 
       the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option, pass the new 
       name of the replica set to the 
       :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option.
