db.cloneCollection()
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.cloneCollection(from, collection, query)

   :method:`db.cloneCollection()` provides a wrapper around
   :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` for copying data directly between
   MongoDB instances. :method:`db.cloneCollection()` does not allow
   you to clone a collection through a :program:`mongos`: you must
   connect directly to the :program:`mongod` instance.

   :param string from: A host name, of the MongoDB instance that holds
                       the collection you wish to copy

   :param string collection: A collection in the MongoDB instance that
                             you want to
                             copy. :method:`db.cloneCollection()` will
                             only copy the collection with this name
                             from *database* of the same name as the
                             current database the remote MongoDB
                             instance. If you want to copy a
                             collection from a different database name
                             you must use the
                             :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` directly.

   :param document query: Optional. A standard :ref:`MongoDB query
                          document <mongodb-query-document>` to limit
                          the documents copied as part of the
                          :method:`db.cloneCollection()` operation.
