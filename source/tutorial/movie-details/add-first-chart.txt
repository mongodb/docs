Column Chart Showing Directors with the most Awards
---------------------------------------------------

To discover which directors of films represented in this dataset have
won the most awards, use the ``directors`` and ``awards.wins`` database
fields in your chart. Additionally, you can see which genres the
award-winning films belong to stacking the ``genres`` field in the
columns. A column chart makes it easy to sort and compare
fields with numerical values, so it is a good choice for this use case.
