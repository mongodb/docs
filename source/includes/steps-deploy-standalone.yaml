  In the :guilabel:`Process Configuration` section, complete the

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     
     * - :guilabel:`Name`
       - Enter the name for your standalone MongoDB deployment.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Version`
       - Select the MongoDB version for your standalone MongoDB
         deployment.

         .. note:: 
            If the dropdown menu does not include the MongoDB version
            you want for your deployment, you must enable it in the
            :doc:`Version Manager 
            </tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version>`.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Auth Schema Version`
       - Select the schema for storing the user data for your
         deployment. MongoDB 3.0 uses a different schema for user data
         than previous versions. For compatibility information, see the
         :ref:`Security Changes <legacy-auth-model-removed>` 
         in the MongoDB 3.0 release notes.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Feature Compatibility` (Optional)
       - Select the :manual:`feature compatibility set
         </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`. This
         field appears if your deployment MongoDB version is
         ``3.4`` or later.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Hostname`
       - Enter the :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` for the

         port number for your MongoDB deployment. The default for
         MongoDB deployments is ``27017``.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Number of Cores`
       - Enter the number of CPU cores to bind to this deployment. If
         you set this value to ``0``, no action is taken and CPU core
         management is delegated to the operating system.
     
     * - :guilabel:`DB Directory Path`
       - Enter the system path to the 
         :setting:`database directory <storage.dbPath>` for this
         deployment. The default is ``/data/myProcess``.
     
     * - :guilabel:`Log File Path`
       - Enter the system path to the :setting:`log file
         <systemLog.path>` setting for this deployment. The default is
