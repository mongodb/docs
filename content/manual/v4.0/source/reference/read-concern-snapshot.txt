Read concern ``"snapshot"`` is only available for :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`.

- If the transaction is not part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, upon transaction commit with write concern
  :writeconcern:`"majority"`, the transaction operations are guaranteed
  to have read from a snapshot of majority-committed data.

- If the transaction is part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, upon transaction commit with write concern
  :writeconcern:`"majority"`, the transaction operations are guaranteed
  to have read from a snapshot of majority-committed data that provides
  causal consistency with the operation immediately preceding the
  transaction start.

Read Concern and Transactions
-----------------------------

Multi-document transactions support read concern
:readconcern:`"snapshot"` as well as :readconcern:`"local"`, and
:readconcern:`"majority"`.

.. note::

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level. To set the read concern for
   transactions, see :ref:`transaction-options`.

For a list of all operations that accept read concerns, see
:ref:`read-concern-operations`.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

:readconcern:`snapshot` is available for transactions that are part of
a causally consistent session.
