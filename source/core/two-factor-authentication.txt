Two-factor authentication provides a second layer of security for your
|mms| account.

   |mms| requires |2fa| to help users control access to their |mms|
   accounts.

.. cond:: onprem

   When enabled, |mms| requires |2fa| to help users control access to
   their |mms| accounts.

To log into |mms|, a user must provide their password ("something
you know"), as well as a second time-sensitive verification code,
delivered during authentication ("something you have"). By requiring
both factors, |mms| can grant authentication requests with a higher
degree of confidence.

After you enter your username and password, you are prompted for a
six-digit time-sensitive verification code. This code is sent to a
separate device, such as a mobile phone or security token, that you
can read and enter into |mms| and complete your login.

   .. note::

|mms| provides the following sources for |2fa| verification codes:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

     - id: phone
       name: Text/Voice
       content: |

         Text Messages (|sms|)
           When |mms| prompts you for a verification code,
           |mms| sends the 6-digit verification code using text
           (|sms|) to the provided phone number.

           The cellular carrier's |sms| rates apply.

         Automated Voice Calls (US / Canada only)
           When |mms| prompts you for a verification code,
           |mms| calls the provided phone number. An automated
           system repeats the 6-digit verification code a total of
           three times before hanging up.

           The cellular carrier's Voice Call rates apply.

           .. note::

             |mms| users who operate within a geographic region
             with limited cellular service coverage or reliability may
             encounter delays in receiving the |2fa| code via |sms| or
             Voice. Consider using a |2fa| app or device instead.

     - id: app
       name: 2FA App
       content: |

         When |mms| prompts you for a verification code, you can
         provide one that is generated in a |2fa| app. You must pair
         the |2fa| app with |mms| first.

         This tutorial uses the `Google Authenticator`_ mobile app.

         There are other mobile device apps and web browser plug-ins
         that provide |2fa| capabilities. You can use any that support
         the |totp|.

         You can pair only one app with |mms| at any one time.

     - id: token
       name: 2FA device
       content: |

         When |mms| prompts you for a verification code, you can
         provide one that is generated in a |2fa| |piv| device. You
         must pair the |piv| device app with |mms| first using a
         |2fa| app. These devices must support |totp|.

         This procedure uses a YubiKey security key, specifically
         those that work with
         `Authenticator Codes <https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006419-using-your-yubikey-with-authenticator-codes>`__.
         Other |2fa| |piv| hardware devices that use |totp| should
         work in a similar fashion.

         .. admonition:: Informational Reference only
            :class: note

            MongoDB does not endorse the aforementioned service, and
            its reference is intended only as informational. Defer to
            your organization's procedures in selecting the
            appropriate vendor or service for supporting |2fa| via
            smart card or similar device.

Two-Factor Authentication on a Shared Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A global team that shares the same |mms| account can use Google
Authenticator and use the same seed code for all team members. To
generate a common seed code that all team members can use, select the
:guilabel:`Can't scan the barcode?` link when
:ref:`Configuring Two-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator <two-factor-google-authenticator>`.


Generate New Recovery Codes
---------------------------

As a backup, you can generate recovery codes to use in place of a sent
code when you do not have access to a phone, |2fa| app or |2fa| device. Each recovery code is single-use, and you
should save these codes in a secure place. When you generate new
recovery codes, you invalidate previously generated ones.

.. include:: /includes/steps/two-factor-generate-recovery-codes.rst

Reset Two Factor Authentication
-------------------------------

.. important::

   Resetting |2fa| for an |mms| account disables |2fa| for that
   account. You can re-configure |2fa| after performing the reset
   procedure.

#. Log in to |mms| with your username and password.

#. When the |2fa| prompt displays:

   a. Click the :guilabel:`Reset your two factor authentication` link.

   .. cond:: onprem

      b. Click :guilabel:`Ops Manager user? Click here` at the
         bottom of the :guilabel:`Reset Two Factor Authentication`
         modal.

   .. cond:: cloud

      b. Click :guilabel:`Cloud Manager user? Click here` at the
         bottom of the :guilabel:`Reset Two Factor Authentication`
         modal.

#. Type your |mms| username.

#. Click :guilabel:`Reset Two Factor Authentication`.

   |mms| emails a link to the e-mail account associated with the |mms|
   username.

#. Check your email.

#. Click the link that |mms| sent to start the |2fa| reset procedure.

#. Follow the directions on the |2fa| reset page. After completing the
   reset procedure, |mms| allows you to log in to the |mms| account
   without requiring a :abbr:`2FA (Two Factor Authentication)` code.
