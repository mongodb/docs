Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $skip

   Skips over the specified number of :term:`documents <document>` that
   pass into the stage and passes the remaining documents to the next
   stage in the :term:`pipeline`.

   The :pipeline:`$skip` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $skip: <positive integer> }

   :pipeline:`$skip` takes a positive integer that specifies the
   maximum number of documents to skip.

Behavior
--------

Using $skip with Sorted Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using the :pipeline:`$skip` stage with any of:

- the :pipeline:`$sort` aggregation stage,
- the :method:`~cursor.sort()` method, or
- the ``sort`` field to the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command or the
  :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` shell method,

be sure to include at least one field in your sort that contains
unique values, before passing results to the :pipeline:`$skip` stage.

Sorting on fields that contain duplicate values may return a different
sort order for those duplicate fields over multiple executions,
especially when the collection is actively receiving writes.

The easiest way to guarantee sort consistency is to include the
``_id`` field in your sort query.

See the following for more information on each:

- :ref:`Consistent sorting with $sort (aggregation)
  <sort-aggregation-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the sort() shell method
  <sort-cursor-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the findAndModify command
  <findandmodify-command-consistent-sorting>`
- :ref:`Consistent sorting with the findAndModify() shell method
  <findandmodify-method-consistent-sorting>`

Example
-------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.article.aggregate([
       { $skip : 5 }
   ]);

This operation skips the first 5 documents passed to it by the
pipeline. :pipeline:`$skip` has no effect on the content of the
documents it passes along the pipeline.
