What kind of database is MongoDB?
---------------------------------

MongoDB is a :term:`document`\-oriented DBMS. Think of MySQL but with
:term:`JSON`-like objects comprising the data model, rather than RDBMS tables.
Significantly, MongoDB supports neither joins nor transactions. However, it
features secondary indexes, an expressive query language, and atomic writes on
a per-document level.

Operationally, MongoDB features master-slave replication with automated
failover and built-in horizontal scaling via automated range-based
partitioning.

.. note::

   MongoDB uses :term:`BSON`, a binary object format similar
   to, but more expressive than :term:`JSON`.

Do MongoDB databases have tables?
---------------------------------

Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in
:term:`collections <collection>`, which are the rough equivalent of RDBMS
tables. A collection holds one or more :term:`documents
<document>`, which corresponds to a record or a row in a relational
database table, and each document has
one or more fields, which corresponds to a column in a relational
database table.

Collections have important differences from RDBMS tables. Documents in a
single collection may have a unique combination and set of fields.
Documents need not have identical fields. You can add a field to some
documents in a collection without adding that field to all documents in
the collection.

.. see:: :doc:`/reference/sql-comparison`

.. _faq-schema-free:

Do MongoDB databases have schemas?
----------------------------------

MongoDB uses dynamic schemas. You can create collections without
defining the structure, i.e. the fields or the types of their values,
of the documents in the collection. You can change the structure of
documents simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones.
Documents in a collection need not have an identical set of fields.

In practice, it is common for the documents in a collection to have
a largely homogeneous structure; however, this is not a
requirement. MongoDB's flexible schemas mean that schema migration and
augmentation are very easy in practice, and you will rarely, if ever,
need to write scripts that perform "alter table" type operations,
which simplifies and facilitates iterative software development with
MongoDB.

.. see:: :doc:`/reference/sql-comparison`

What languages can I use to work with MongoDB?
----------------------------------------------

MongoDB :term:`client drivers <driver>` exist for all of the most
popular programming languages, and many other ones. See the
:ecosystem:`latest list of drivers </drivers>` for details.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/applications/drivers`."

Does MongoDB support SQL?
-------------------------

No.

However, MongoDB does support a rich, ad-hoc query language
of its own.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/reference/operators` and the
   :doc:`Query Overview </reference/operators>` pages.

What are typical uses for MongoDB?
----------------------------------

MongoDB has a general-purpose design, making it appropriate for a large
number of use cases. Examples include content management
systems, mobile app, gaming, e-commerce, analytics,
archiving, and logging.

Do not use MongoDB for systems that require SQL,
joins, and multi-object transactions.

Does MongoDB support transactions?
----------------------------------

MongoDB does not provide ACID transactions.

However, MongoDB does provide some basic transactional capabilities. Atomic
operations are possible within the scope of a single document: that
is, we can debit ``a`` and credit ``b`` as a transaction if they
are fields within the same document. Because documents can be rich,
some documents contain thousands of fields, with support for testing
fields in sub-documents.

Additionally, you can make writes in MongoDB durable (the 'D' in
ACID). To get durable writes, you must enable journaling,
which is on by default in 64-bit builds. You must also issue
writes with a write concern of ``{j: true}`` to ensure that the
writes block until the journal has synced to disk.

Users have built successful e-commerce systems using MongoDB,
but applications requiring multi-object commits with rollback
generally aren't feasible.

Does MongoDB require a lot of RAM?
----------------------------------

Not necessarily. It's certainly possible to run MongoDB
on a machine with a small amount of free RAM.

MongoDB automatically uses all free memory on the machine as its
cache. System resource monitors show that MongoDB uses a lot of
memory, but it's usage is dynamic. If another process suddenly needs
half the server's RAM, MongoDB will yield cached memory to the other process.

Technically, the operating system's virtual memory subsystem manages
MongoDB's memory. This means that MongoDB will use as much free memory
as it can, swapping to disk as needed. Deployments with enough memory
to fit the application's working data set in RAM will achieve the best
performance.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/faq/diagnostics` for answers to additional
   questions about MongoDB and Memory use.

How do I configure the cache size?
----------------------------------

MongoDB has no configurable cache. MongoDB uses all *free* memory on
the system automatically by way of memory-mapped files. Operating
systems use the same approach with their file system caches.

.. _faq-database-and-caching:

Does MongoDB require a separate caching layer for application-level caching?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. In MongoDB, a document's representation in the database is similar
to its representation in application memory. This means the database
already stores the usable form of data, making the data usable in both
the persistent store and in the application cache. This eliminates the
need for a separate caching layer in the application.

This differs from relational databases, where caching data is more
expensive. Relational databases must transform data into object
representations that applications can read and must store the
transformed data in a separate cache: if these transformation from
data to application objects require joins, this process increases the
overhead related to using the database which increases the importance
of the caching layer.

Does MongoDB handle caching?
----------------------------

Yes. MongoDB keeps all of the most recently used data in RAM. If you
have created indexes for your queries and your working data set fits
in RAM, MongoDB serves all queries from memory.

MongoDB does not implement a query cache: MongoDB serves all queries
directly from the indexes and/or data files.

Are writes written to disk immediately, or lazily?
--------------------------------------------------

Writes are physically written to the :doc:`journal </administration/journaling>`
within 100 milliseconds, by default. At that point, the write is "durable" in the
sense that after a pull-plug-from-wall event, the data will still be
recoverable after a hard restart. See :setting:`journalCommitInterval`
for more information on the journal commit window.

While the journal commit is nearly instant, MongoDB writes to the data
files lazily. MongoDB may wait to write data to the data files for as
much as one minute by default. This does not affect durability, as the journal
has enough information to ensure crash recovery. To change the interval
for writing to the data files, see :setting:`syncdelay`.

What language is MongoDB written in?
------------------------------------

MongoDB is implemented in C++. :term:`Drivers <driver>` and client libraries
are typically written in their respective languages, although some
drivers use C extensions for better performance.

.. _faq-32-bit-limitations:

What are the limitations of 32-bit versions of MongoDB?
-------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB uses :ref:`memory-mapped files <faq-storage-memory-mapped-files>`.
When running a 32-bit build of
MongoDB, the total storage size for the server, including data and
indexes, is 2 gigabytes. For this reason, do not deploy MongoDB to
production on 32-bit machines.

If you're running a 64-bit build of MongoDB, there's virtually no
limit to storage size. For production deployments, 64-bit builds and
operating systems are strongly recommended.

.. seealso:: "`Blog Post: 32-bit Limitations <http://blog.mongodb.org/post/137788967/32-bit-limitations>`_"

.. note::

   32-bit builds disable :term:`journaling <journal>` by default
   because journaling further limits the maximum amount of data that
   the database can store.
