===========================
MongoDB 3.0 and SCRAM-SHA-1
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 3.0 includes support for the :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1
<authentication-scram-sha-1>` challenge-response user authentication
mechanism. This changes how user credentials are stored and used.  If
your deployment uses authentication and authorization, you must
upgrade the authentication schema in addition to upgrading MongoDB
processes if you wish to make use of ``SCRAM-SHA-1``.

You may, alternatively, opt to continue to use the ``MONGODB-CR``
challenge-response mechanism and skip this upgrade. See the
:ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>` documentation for
further information on its advantages.

.. note::

   ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` represents a significant improvement in security
   over ``MONGODB-CR``, the previous default authentication mechanism,
   and you are strongly urged to upgrade. The next major version of
   MongoDB is likely to remove support for ``MONGODB-CR`` entirely.

The following scenarios are possible when upgrading from 2.6 to 3.0:

- If you are starting with a new 3.0 installation without any users
  or upgrading from a 2.6 database that has no users and wish to use
  ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, **no action is required**. All new users created in
  this situation will be created using the appropriate format for
  ``SCRAM-SHA-1``.

- If you are upgrading from a 2.6 database with existing data,
  including users, and wish to continue to use ``MONGODB-CR``, **no
  action is required**. All new users created under 3.0 will continue to
  use the same authentication model as users already in the database. You can
  execute the upgrade to ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` at any point in the future.

- If you are upgrading from a 2.6 database with existing data,
  including users, and wish to upgrade to ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, you may
  follow the steps under the heading :ref:`Upgrade a 2.6 Database to
  Use SCRAM-SHA-1 on 3.0 <2.8-upgrade-mongodb-cr-to-scram>`.

Upgrade a 2.6 Database to Use ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   This procedure **discards** the ``MONGODB-CR`` credentials used by
   2.6, and therefore is irreversible short of restoring from
   backups.

   This  procedure   disables  ``MONGODB-CR``  as   an  authentication
   mechanism.

Considerations
``````````````

Before upgrading the authentication model, you should
first upgrade MongoDB binaries to 3.0. For sharded clusters, ensure
that **all** cluster components are 3.0.

Timing
``````

Because downgrades are more difficult after you upgrade the user
authentication model, once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to
version 3.0, allow your MongoDB deployment to run for a day or two
before following this procedure.

This allows 3.0 some time to "burn in" and decreases the likelihood
of downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The
user authentication and access control will continue to work as
it did in 2.6.

If you decide to upgrade the user authentication
model immediately instead of waiting the recommended "burn in"
period, then for sharded clusters, you must wait at least 10 seconds
after upgrading the sharded clusters to run the authentication
upgrade command.

Replica Sets
````````````

For a replica set, it is only necessary to run the upgrade process on
the :term:`primary` as the changes will automatically replicate to
the secondaries.

Sharded Clusters
````````````````

For a sharded cluster, connect to a :program:`mongos` and run the
upgrade procedure to upgrade the cluster's authentication data. By
default, the procedure will upgrade the authentication data of the
shards as well.

To override this behavior, run the upgrade command with the
additional parameter ``upgradeShards: false``. If you choose to
override, you must run the upgrade procedure on the :program:`mongos`
first, and then run the procedure on the :term:`primary` members of
each shard.

For a sharded cluster, do **not** run the upgrade process directly
against the :doc:`config servers
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`. Instead, perform the upgrade
process using one :program:`mongos` instance to interact with the
config database.

Requirements
````````````

To upgrade the authentication model, you must have a user in the
``admin`` database with the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

Procedure
`````````

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.8-upgrade-mongodb-cr-to-scram.rst

Result
``````

After this procedure is complete, all users in the database will have
``SCRAM-SHA-1``-style credentials, and any subsequently-created users
will also have this type of credentials.
