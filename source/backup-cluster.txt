Considerations
--------------

Before selecting a backup method, consider the following factors:

Backup Options for M5 or Smaller Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodump-for-backup.rst

Only One Backup Method per Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/backup-selection-continuous.rst

Restores Limited to Same MongoDB Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup Methods
--------------

|service| offers two methods to back up your data.

:doc:`/backup/continuous-backups`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses incremental snapshots to continuously back up your
data. Continuous backup snapshots are typically just a few seconds
behind the operational system.

|service| ensures point-in-time backup of replica sets and consistent,
cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters.

For each |service| project with continuous snapshots enabled, |service|
stores the continuous backup snapshots in the backup data center
location that the *first* backup-enabled cluster created in that
project used.

Continuous snapshots support restoring from the full snapshot
or from a point-in-time between snapshots. You can also
:doc:`query a continuous snapshot </query-backup>`.

With |service| continuous backup, the total number of collections
across all databases in a |service| cluster cannot equal or exceed
``100,000``.

:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses the native snapshot capabilities of your cloud provider
to support full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot storage.

For each |service| cluster with cloud provider snapshots enabled,
|service| stores the snapshots in the same region as the snapshot
source replica set member.

|service| supports cloud provider snapshots on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google GCP <google-gcp>`
