.. dbcommand:: balancerStart

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Starts the balancer thread. The command does not wait for a
   balancing round to start. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`balancerStart` against the ``admin`` database.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { balancerStart: 1, maxTimeMS: <number> } )

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-balancerStart-field.rst

Example
-------

To start the balancer thread, connect to a :program:`mongos` instance
and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { balancerStart: 1 } )
