Aggregations Tab
----------------

*New in version 1.14.0*

The :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab in |compass| provides the ability to
create :manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to
process data. With aggregation pipelines, documents in a collection
pass through multiple stages where they are processed into a set of
aggregated results. The particular stages and results can be modified
depending on your application's needs.

When navigating to the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab, you are presented
with a blank aggregation pipeline. The :guilabel:`Preview of Documents in
the Collection` section of the :guilabel:`Aggregations` view displays
20 documents sampled from the current collection.

Create an Aggregation Pipeline
------------------------------

To create an aggregation pipeline:

1. In the aggregation pipeline pane in the bottom-left of the view,
   click the :guilabel:`Select...` dropdown and select the
   :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage
   </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` to use for the first
   stage of the pipeline:

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-select-stage.png
      :alt: Aggregation Builder select stage

   .. note::

      The pre-filled content of the pipeline stage changes based on the
      selected stage to provide syntactic guidelines.

2. Fill in your selected stage. As you modify the pipeline stage, the
   sample documents shown in the pane to the right of the stage
   update automatically to reflect the results of your pipeline as it
   progresses:

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-match-stage.png
      :alt: Aggregation Builder match stage example

3. Add additional aggregation stages as desired by clicking the
   :guilabel:`Add Stage` button below your last aggregation stage.
   Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage.

.. note::

   The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage
   dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling
   a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects
   whether or not that stage is included.

   .. example::

      The following pipeline excludes the first
      :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage
      and only includes the
      :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
      stage:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-exclude-stage-example.png
         :alt: Aggregation Builder exclude stage example

Save a Pipeline
---------------

To save a pipeline:

1. Name your pipeline using the
   :guilabel:`Enter a pipeline name` input at the top of the
   :guilabel:`Aggregations` view.

2. Click :guilabel:`Save Pipeline`.

Open a Saved Pipeline
---------------------

.. important::

   Opening a saved pipeline abandons any **unsaved** changes to the
   pipeline you are currently working on. If the circle at the
   top-right of the :guilabel:`Aggregations` view is orange, this
   means you have unsaved changes to your pipeline.

To open a previously saved pipeline:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Folder` icon to the left of the pipeline name
   input.

2. Hover over the pipeline you want to open and click :guilabel:`Open`.

3. In the ensuing dialog, click :guilabel:`Open Pipeline`.

Additional Pipeline Options
---------------------------

Click the :guilabel:`...` button to the right of the
:guilabel:`Save Pipeline` button to access additional pipeline
options:

.. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-additional-pipeline-options.png
   :alt: Aggregation Builder additional pipeline options

The following additional options are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - Copy Pipeline to Clipboard
     - Copy the current state of the pipeline to the clipboard as JSON.
       Only pipeline stages enabled using their respective toggles are
       included in the copied pipeline.
   * - Clone Pipeline
     - Creates a new version of the current pipeline by appending
       ``(copy)`` to the current pipeline name, retaining the current
       pipeline state. This allows you to modify and save a new version
       of the pipeline.
   * - New Pipeline
     - Resets the pipeline to its initial state.
   * - Sample Mode (Recommended)
     - Limits input documents to 100000 before $group, $bucket, and $bucketAuto stages.
   * - Comment Mode
     - Adds helper comments to each stage when being selected.

.. important::

   The :guilabel:`Clone Pipeline` and :guilabel:`New Pipeline` options
   do not save your current pipeline state. If you wish to save your
   current pipeline, you must do so before using one of these options.

   If the circle at the top-right of the :guilabel:`Aggregations` view
   is orange, this means you have unsaved changes to your pipeline.

Example
-------

The following pipeline has two aggregation stages:
:manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` and
:manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`. The
``$match`` stage returns documents with ``carrierFsCode`` equal to
``1I``, and the ``$group`` stage groups the documents returned from
the previous stage by the ``departureAirportFsCode`` property:

.. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-full-example.png
   :alt: Aggregation Builder Full Example

Using the :guilabel:`Copy Pipeline to Clipboard` feature, the following
JSON is copied to the system clipboard:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $match: {
       carrierFsCode: "1I"
     }
   },
   {
     $group: {
       _id: "$departureAirportFsCode",
       flights: { $push: "$flightId" }
     }
   }

Now that the pipeline is in the clipboard, we can execute it in the
:manual:`mongo shell <mongo>`. After launching and connecting to a
:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` instance, we switch to
the ``test`` database where our ``flightStats`` collection exists:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test

The following command executes the pipeline created in |compass|:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.flightStats.aggregate([
   {
     $match: {
       carrierFsCode: "1I"
     }
   },
   {
     $group: {
       _id: "$departureAirportFsCode",
       flights: { $push: "$flightId" }
     }
   }
   ])

The pipeline returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "EWR", "flights" : [ 543184347, 544589251, 544589200, 543183182, 545515483, 544595864 ] }
