The Realm Swift SDK supports connecting to an Atlas App Services App for 
a range of Apple operating systems depending on the Xcode version and 
Realm Swift SDK version. Connecting to an App Services App enables:

- Authentication and User Management
- Calling an Atlas Function
- Querying a MongoDB Atlas Data Source
- Device Sync

For current information about supported operating systems, refer to 
:ref:`swift-os-support`.

At this time, the Realm Swift SDK does not support connecting to an 
App Services App from watchOS.
