===========================
Install |onprem| on Windows
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This tutorial describes how to install the :ref:`mms-application-package`,
which monitors MongoDB deployments, and the optional :ref:`Backup
Daemon <backup-daemon>`, which creates and stores deployment snapshots.
This tutorial installs to Windows servers.

|onprem| supports :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>` and
:ref:`Backup <mms-backup-functional-overview>` on Windows but does not
support Automation on Windows.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prior to installation you must:

- Configure Windows servers that meet the :doc:`hardware and software
  requirements </core/requirements>`. Configure as many servers as needed for
  your deployment. For deployment diagrams, see :ref:`deployment-diagrams`.

- Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instances that store the
  :ref:`mms-application-database` and :ref:`backup-database`.
  Do not use MongoDB instances that store other data. Ensure that
  firewall rules allow access to the :doc:`ports </reference/firewall-configuration>` the
  instances runs on. See :doc:`/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.

- Optionally install an SMTP email server.

  .. todo:: The SMTP email server is optional, right?

Procedures
----------

You must have administrative access on the machines to which you install.

.. note::

   You cannot use |mms| to manage |mms|'s backing instances. You must
   deploy and manage the backing instances manually.

Install the Backup Daemon (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you use Backup, install the :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-install-backend-windows.rst

Next Step
---------

:doc:`Set up security </core/security>` for your |onprem| servers,
|onprem| agents, and MongoDB deployments.

.. note::

   To set up a deployment for a test environment, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/test-new-deployment`. The tutorial populates the
   replica set with test data, registers a user, and installs the
   Monitoring and Backup Agents on a client machine in order to monitor
   the test replica set.
