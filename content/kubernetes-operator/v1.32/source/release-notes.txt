|k8s-op-full| 1.32.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2025-03-06*

New Features
````````````

- **General Availability - Multi Cluster Sharded Clusters**: Support configuring 
  highly available MongoDB Sharded Clusters across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
  
  - ``MongoDB`` resources of type Sharded Cluster now support both single and 
    multi cluster topologies.
  - The implementation is backwards compatible with single cluster deployments 
    of MongoDB Sharded Clusters, by defaulting ``spec.topology`` to 
    ``SingleCluster``. Existing ``MongoDB`` resources do not need to be modified 
    to upgrade to this version of the |k8s-op-short|.
  - Introduces support for Sharded deployments across multiple |k8s| clusters 
    without requiring a Service Mesh, which you can achieve by enabling all 
    components of such a deployment (including mongos, config servers, and mongod) 
    to be exposed externally to the |k8s| clusters, which enables routing 
    via external interfaces.
  - To learn more, see the `public documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/reference/k8s-operator-specification/#sharded-cluster-settings>`__.

- **MongoDB**: Adds opt-out to anonymized telemetry for the |k8s-op-short|. The 
  data collected by telementry does not contain any Personally Identifiable 
  Information (PII) or even data that can be tied back to any specific customer 
  or company. See the `public documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/reference/meko-telemetry>`__ to learn more about:
  
  - What data is included in the telemetry
  - How to disable telemetry
  - What RBACs are added and why they are required

- **MongoDB**: Adds a new validation to Sharded Cluster deployments to ensure 
  the correctness of scaling operations,. This validation restricts scaling 
  different components in two directions simultaneously within a single change 
  to the YAML file. For example, it is not allowed to add more nodes (scaling up) 
  to shards while simultaneously removing (scaling down) config servers or mongos. 
  This restriction also applies to multi-cluster deployments. A simple change 
  that involves "moving" one node from one cluster to another—without altering 
  the total number of members—will now be blocked. It is necessary to perform 
  a scale-up operation first and then execute a separate change for scaling down.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Fixes the bug when status of ``MongoDBUser`` was being set to ``Updated`` 
  prematurely. For example, new users were not immediately usable following 
  ``MongoDBUser`` creation despite the operator reporting ``Updated`` state.
- Fixed a bug causing cluster health check issues when ordering of users and 
  tokens differed in Kubeconfig.
- Fixed a bug when deploying a Multi-Cluster sharded resource with an external 
  access configuration could result in pods not being able to reach each others.
- Fixed a bug when setting ``spec.fcv = AlwaysMatchVersion`` and ``agentAuth`` 
  to be ``SCRAM`` causes the operator to set the auth value to be ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` 
  instead of ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

.. _ent-op-1.31.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.31 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.31.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.31.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2025-02-11*

Bug Fixes
```````````

- Fixes handling proxy environment variables in the |k8s-op-short| Pod. 
  When you set the environment variables ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY``, or ``NO_PROXY``
  on the |k8s-op-short| Pod, you can propagate them to the {+mdbagent+}s by also 
  setting the environment variable :ref:`MDB_PROPAGATE_PROXY_ENV <mdb-propogate-proxy-env>` 
  to ``true``.

.. _ent-op-1.30.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.30 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.30.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.30.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-12-20*

New Features
```````````````

- **MongoDB**: Fixes and improves :ref:`multi-cluster-sharded-cluster` deployments (Public Preview).

- **MongoDB**: Supports :setting:`spec.shardOverrides` field for single-cluster topologies. 
  We recommend using this field for customizing settings for specific shards.

- **MongoDB**: Deprecates ``spec.shardSpecificPodSpec``. Use :setting:`spec.shardOverrides` 
  for customizing specific shards for both single- and multi-cluster topologies. 
  For an example, see the `mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes GitHub repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/samples/sharded_multicluster/shardSpecificPodSpec_migration.yaml>`__.


Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**: Fixes placeholder name for ``mongos`` in single-cluster sharded 
  deployments with an external domain set. This fix changes ``mongodProcessDomain`` 
  and ``mongodProcessFQDN`` to ``mongosProcessDomain`` and ``mongosProcessFQDN`` 
  respectively.

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**: If you lose a member cluster,
  you no longer receive validation errors if the failed cluster still exists in the ``clusterSpecList``. This allows you to more easily reconfigure your deployments 
  during disaster recovery.

.. _ent-op-1.29.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.29 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.29.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.29.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-11-11*

New Features
```````````````

- **AppDb**: Adds support for automated 
  expansion of storage by increasing the capacity of |k8s| 
  ``persistentVolumeClaims``. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-resize-storage`.

  Automated expansion of ``persistentVolumeClaims`` is only supported if the 
  underlying |k8s| ``storageClass`` supports |k8s| ``persistentVolume`` expansion.
  Ensure your ``storageClass`` supports in-place expansion without data loss.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**: Fixes a bug where specifying a 
  fractional number for a storage volume's size, such as ``1.7Gi``, breaks the 
  reconciliation loop for that resource with an error 
  ``Can't execute update on forbidden fields`` even if the underlying Persistent Volume Claim 
  is deployed successfully.
- **MongoDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster**, **OpsManager**, **AppDB**: Improves stability of 
  deployments during TLS rotations. In scenarios where the StatefulSet of the deployment 
  was reconciling and a TLS rotation happened, the deployment would reach a broken state. 
  Deployments will now store the previous TLS certificate alongside the new one.

.. _ent-op-1.28.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.28 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.28.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.28.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-10-02*

New Features
```````````````

- (Public Preview) **MongoDB** resource: Introduces support for sharded clusters 
  across |multi-clusters| by setting :setting:`spec.topology=MultiCluster <spec.topology>` 
  when creating a MongoDB resource with ``spec.type=ShardedCluster``. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`multi-cluster-sharded-cluster`.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Adds support for automated 
  expansion of storage by increasing the capacity of |k8s| 
  ``persistentVolumeClaims``. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-resize-storage`.

  - Automated expansion of ``persistentVolumeClaims`` is only supported if the 
    underlying |k8s| ``storageClass`` supports |k8s| ``persistentVolume`` expansion.
    Ensure your ``storageClass`` supports in-place expansion without data loss.

- **OpsManager** resource: Introduces support for Ops Manager 8.0.0.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Introduces support for MongoDB 8.0.0.

- **MongoDB** and **MongoDBMultiCluster** application database resources: Changes
  the default behaviour of :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` for the database:
  
  - When you upgrade your MongoDB version, the |k8s-op-short| sets :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` 
    to the version you are upgrading from to give you the option to downgrade if necessary.

  - If you want the feature compatibility version to match the new MongoDB version, 
    you must manually set ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to either the new MongoDB 
    version, or ``AlwaysMatchVersion``.

- Updates :ref:`container images <k8s-container-images>` to use 
  `Red Hat UBI 9 <https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers>`__ as the base image, 
  except ``mongodb-enterprise-database-ubi``, which remains on ``UBI8`` to support workloads 
  running on MongoDB 6.0.4 and earlier. 
  
  - The UBI8 image is only used for the default non-static architecture. For a full UBI9 setup, 
    use static containers. To learn more, see :ref:`static-containers`.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, and **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Fixes a bug where 
  the ``init`` container wasn't getting the default security context, which was then 
  flagged by security policies.

- **MongoDBMultiCluster** resource: Fixes a bug where resource validations weren't 
  performed as part of the reconcile loop.

.. _ent-op-1.27.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.27 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.27.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.27.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-08-27*

New Features
```````````````

- **MongoDB** resource: Adds support for enabling log rotation for MongoDB
  processes, monitoring agent, and backup agent. To learn more, see :ref:`mongodb-crd-logging-specification`.

  Use the following settings to configure logs rotation per component:

  - :setting:`spec.agent.mongod.logRotate` for the mongoDB processes.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.mongod.auditlogRotate` for the mongoDB processes audit logs.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.backupAgent.logRotate` for the backup agent.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.monitoringAgent.logRotate` for the monitoring agent.
  - :setting:`spec.agent.readinessProbe.environmentVariables` for the environment variables
    the readiness probe runs with. This setting also applies to settings
    related to the logs rotation. To learn more about the supported environment
    settings, see `Readiness Probe <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/logging.md#readinessprobe/>`__.

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.<component>.logRotate` for the Application Database.

  For sharded clusters, the |k8s-op-short| supports configuring log rotation
  only under the ``spec.Agent`` settings, and not per process type, such as
  ``mongos`` or ``configsrv``.

- **OpsManager** resource: Adds support for replacing the :ref:`logback.xml configuration file <onprem-own-logs>`,
  which configures general logging settings, such as log rotation for |onprem|
  and |onprem| backups.

  Use the following settings:
  
  - :setting:`spec.logging.logBackAccessRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    access configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. Name the ConfigMap's access key
    ``logback-access.xml``. This file configures access to the logging configuration
    file for |onprem|.
  - :setting:`spec.logging.logBackRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. This file
    configures the general logging behavior for |onprem|,
    including log rotation policies, log levels, and other logging parameters.
    Name the ConfigMap's access key ``logback.xml``.
  - :setting:`spec.backup.logging.logBackAccessRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    access configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. Name the ConfigMap's access key
    ``logback-access.xml``. This file configures access to the logging configuration
    file for |onprem| backups.
  - :setting:`spec.backup.logging.logBackRef` for the ConfigMap and access key with the ``logback``
    configuration file to mount on the |onprem| Pod. This file
    configures the general logging behavior for |onprem| backups,
    including log rotation policies, log levels, and other logging parameters.
    Name the ConfigMap's access key ``logback.xml``.

Deprecations
```````````````

- The ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate`` setting for the Application Database has been deprecated.
  Use :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.mongod.logRotate <spec.applicationDatabase.agent.<component>.logRotate>` instead.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **Agent** launcher: Fixes an issue where, under some resync scenarios,
  the journal data in ``/journal`` may have been corrupted. The Agent now ensures
  that no conflicting journal data exist and prioritizes the data from ``/data/journal``.
  To deactivate this behavior, set the environment variable ``MDB_CLEAN_JOURNAL``
  in the |k8s-op-short| to any value other than 1.

- **MongoDB**, **AppDB**, **MongoDBMulti** resources: Fixes an issue that ensures
  that external domains are used in the ``connectionString``, if you configure it.

- **MongoDB** resource: Removes panic response if you provide a Horizon
  configuration that is shorter than the number of members. The |k8s-op-short| now
  issues a descriptive error in the status of the MongoDB resource in such cases.

- **MongoDB** resource: Fixes an issue where, when creating a resource in a new
  project named as a prefix of another project would fail, preventing the
  MongoDB resource from being created.

.. _ent-op-1.26.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.26 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.26.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.26.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-06-21*

New Features
```````````````

- Improves CPU utilization and vertical scaling of the |k8s-op-short| and
  achieves faster reconciliation of all managed resources by allowing you
  to control the number of reconciliations the |k8s-op-short| can perform
  in parallel.

  You can set ``MDB_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`` for the |k8s-op-short| deployment
  or ``operator.maxConcurrentReconciles`` in the |k8s-op-short| installation
  Helm chart. If not provided, the default value is 1. The ability to control
  the number of reconciliations might lead to an increased load on the |onprem|
  and the |k8s| API server in the same time window. Observe the |k8s-op-short|
  resource usage and adjust ``operator.resources.requests`` and
  ``operator.resources.limits`` if needed. To learn more,
  see :k8s:`Resource Management for Pods and Containers </concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/>`
  in the |k8s| documentation.

- Adds support for OpenShift 4.15. To learn more, see :ref:`k8s-compatibility`.

Helm Chart Installation Changes
```````````````````````````````

- Adds an ``operator.maxConcurrentReconciles`` parameter that allows
  you to control the number of reconciliations the |k8s-op-short| can
  perform in parallel. The default value is 1.
- Adds the :ref:`operator.webhook.installClusterRole
  <webhook-install-cluster-role>` parameter that
  controls whether to install the cluster role allowing the |k8s-op-short|
  to configure admission webhooks. Set this parameter to ``false`` when
  the cluster roles aren't allowed. The default value is ``true``.

Bug Fixes
```````````

* **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where configuring a MongoDB resource
  with multiple entries in :setting:`spec.agent.startupOptions` would cause
  additional unnecessary reconciliation of the underlying ``StatefulSet``.
* **MongoDB, MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: Fixes a bug where
  the |k8s-op-short| wouldn't watch for changes in the X-509 certificates
  configured for {+mdbagent+} authentication.
* **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where boolean flags passed to
  the {+mdbagent+} can't be set to ``false`` if their default value is ``true``.

.. _ent-op-1.25.x:

|k8s-op-full| 1.25 Series
-------------------------

.. _ent_op-1.25.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.25.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2024-04-30*

Breaking Change
`````````````````

- **MongoDBOpsManager** resource. The |k8s-op-short| no longer supports
  |onprem| 5.0. Upgrade to a later version of |onprem|. While |onprem| 5.0
  may continue to work with the |k8s-op-short|, MongoDB won't test the
  |k8s-op-short| against |onprem| 5.0.

New Features
`````````````

- **MongoDBOpsManager** resource: Adds support for deploying the |application|
  on multiple |k8s| clusters. To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-om-multi-cluster`.
- (Public Preview) **MongoDB**, **OpsManager** resources: Introduces
  opt-in :ref:`static-containers` for all types of deployments.

  - In this release, use static containers only for testing purposes.
    Static containers might become the default in a later release.
  - To activate static containers mode, set the ``MDB_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE``
    environment variable at the |k8s-op-short| level to ``static``.
    Alternatively, annotate a specific ``MongoDB`` or ``OpsManager``
    custom resource with ``mongodb.com/v1.architecture: "static"``.
  - The |k8s-op-short| supports seamless migration between the static and
    non-static architectures. To learn more, see:

    - :ref:`Use Static Containers <static-containers>`
    - :ref:`Migrate to Static Containers <migrate-to-static-containers>`

- **OpsManager** resource: Adds the ``spec.internalConnectivity`` field
  to allow overrides for the service used by the |k8s-op-short| to ensure
  internal connectivity to the ``OpsManager`` resource-hosting Pods.

- **MongoDB** resource: You can recover a resource due to a broken
  Automation configuration in sharded clusters. In previous releases,
  you could recover other types of resources but not sharded clusters.
  To learn more, see :ref:`troubleshooting-automatic-recovery`.

- **MongoDB**, **MongoDBMultiCluster** resources: These resources now
  allow you to add placeholders in external services.

  - You can define |k8s-annotations| for external services managed by the |k8s-op-short|
    that contain placeholders which will be automatically replaced by the proper values.
    Previously, the |k8s-op-short| configured the same annotations for all
    external services created for each Pod. Starting with this release,
    you can add placeholders so that the |k8s-op-short| can customize
    annotations in each service with values that are relevant and unique
    for each particular Pod. To learn more, see:

    - ``MongoDB`` resource: :setting:`spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations`
    - ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` resource :ref:`spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations <multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice-annotations>`

- The |kubectl-mongodb|: Allows you to print build information when
  using the plugin.
- The ``setup`` command of the |kubectl-mongodb|: Adds the
  :ref:`registry.imagePullSecrets <imagePullSecrets>` setting.
  If specified, created service accounts reference the specified secret on
  the ``imagePullSecrets`` field.
- Improves handling of configurations when the |k8s-op-short| watches more
  than one namespace, and when you install the |k8s-op-short| in a namespace
  that differs from the namespace in which the |k8s-op-short| watches resources.

- Optimizes setting up roles and permissions in member |k8s| clusters
  using a single service account per |k8s| cluster with correctly configured
  roles and role bindings (no cluster roles are necessary) for each watched
  namespace.

- Extends the existing event-based reconciliation process by a time-based
  reconciliation that is triggered every 24 hours. This ensures that all
  {+monitoring-agent+}s are always upgraded in a timely manner.

- OpenShift and OLM Operator: Removes the requirement for cluster-wide
  permissions. Previously, the |k8s-op-short| needed these permissions to
  configure admission webhooks. Starting with this release, webhooks are
  automatically configured by `OLM <https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-tasks/adding-admission-and-conversion-webhooks/>`__.

- Adds an optional ``MDB_WEBHOOK_REGISTER_CONFIGURATION`` environment
  variable for the |k8s-op-short|. The variable controls whether the |k8s-op-short|
  should perform automatic admission webhook configuration. The default is ``true``.
  The variable is set to ``false`` for OLM and OpenShift deployments.

Helm Chart Installation Changes
`````````````````````````````````

- Changes the default ``agent.version`` to ``107.0.0.8502-1``. This changes
  the default Agent used in |k8s-op-short| deployments that you install using
  a Helm chart.

- Adds the ``operator.additionalArguments`` variable with the default of
  ``[]`` to allow you to pass additional arguments for the |k8s-op-short| binary.
- Adds the ``operator.createResourcesServiceAccountsAndRoles`` variable
  with the default of ``true`` to control whether to install roles and
  service accounts for ``MongoDB`` and ``OpsManager`` resources. When you
  use the |kubectl-mongodb| to configure the |k8s-op-short| for
  a multi-|k8s| cluster deployment, the plugin installs all necessary
  roles and service accounts. Therefore, to avoid clashes, in some cases
  don't install those roles using the |k8s-op-short| Helm chart.

Bug Fixes
```````````

- **MongoDBMultiCluster** resource: Fixes an issue where the |k8s-op-short|
  reported that ``spec.externalAccess.externalDomain`` and
  ``spec.clusterSpecList[*].externalAccess.externalDomains`` fields were
  required even though they weren't used. The |k8s-op-short| prematurely
  triggered a validation for these fields in cases where the custom resources
  contained a defined ``spec.externalAccess`` structure. Starting with this
  release, the |k8s-op-short| checks for uniqueness of external domains only
  when you define the external domains in ``spec.externalAccess.externalDomain``
  or ``spec.clusterSpecList[*].externalAccess.externalDomains`` settings.

- **MongoDB** resource: Fixes a bug where upon deleting a ``MongoDB`` resource,
  the ``controlledFeature`` policies remained set on the related |onprem| or
  |cloud-short| instance, making cleanup in the UI impossible in the case
  of losing the |k8s-op-short|.

- **OpsManager** resource: Fixes an issue where the ``admin-key`` secret
  was deleted when you removed the ``OpsManager`` custom resource.
  Fixing the ``admin-key`` secret deletion enables easier re-installation of |onprem|.

- **MongoDB Readiness Probe**: Fixes a misleading error message for the
  readiness probe: ``"... kubelet  Readiness probe failed:..."``. This affects
  all MongoDB deployments.

- **Operator**: Fixes cases where in some instances, while communicating with
  the ``OpsManager`` custom resource, the |k8s-op-short| skipped TLS verification,
  even if you enabled TLS.

Improvements
```````````````

- **Kubectl plugin**: The released |kubectl-mongodb| binaries are now signed, and the
  signatures are published with the `release assets <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/releases>`__.
  The public key is available at `this address <https://cosign.mongodb.com/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem>`__.
  The released |kubectl-mongodb| binaries are also notarized for MacOS.

- **Released Images signed**: All container images published for the |k8s-op-short|
  are cryptographically signed. This is visible in the MongoDB |quay| registry.
  You can verify the signatures using the MongoDB public key. Released images
  are available at `this address <https://cosign.mongodb.com/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes-operator.pem>`__.

Warnings and Breaking Changes
`````````````````````````````

- Aligns the component image version numbers with the |k8s-op-short| release tag so 
  it's clear which images go with which version of the |k8s-op-short|. 
  This affects the following images:

  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-database-ubi``
  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-init-database-ubi``
  - ``quay.io/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-init-appdb-ubi``

  To learn more, see :ref:`meko-op-install-settings-kubectl-oc` 
  and :ref:`meko-op-install-settings-helm`.

- Replaces ``spec.exposedExternally`` (deprecated in |k8s-op-short| 1.19) with 
  :setting:`spec.externalAccess`.

Bug Fixes
`````````

- Fixes an issue with scaling a replica set in a |multi-cluster| when a member 
  cluster has lost connectivity. The fix addresses both the manual and automated 
  recovery procedures.
- Fixes an issue where changing the names of the Automation Agent and MongoDB 
  audit logs prevented them from being sent to the |k8s| Pod logs. There are no 
  restrictions on the file names of MongoDB audit logs as of |k8s-op-short| 1.22.
- Allows the following new log types from the ``mongodb-enterprise-database`` 
  container to stream directly to |k8s| logs:

  - ``agent-launcher-script``
  - ``monitoring-agent``
  - ``backup-agent``

- Fixes an issue that prevented storing the ``MongoDBUser`` resource in the 
  namespace set in ``spec.mongodbResourceRef.namespace``.

.. _ent_op-1.22.0:

|k8s-op-full| 1.22.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Released 2023-09-21*

Breaking Changes
````````````````

The |k8s-op-short| no longer uses the ``Reconciling`` state for all custom resources.
In most cases this state has been replaced with ``Pending`` and a corresponding
message. If you use monitoring tools with the custom MongoDB resources deployed
with the |k8s-op-short|, you might need to adjust your dashboards and alerting rules
to use the ``Pending`` state name.

MongoDBOpsManager Resource
``````````````````````````

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Adds support for configuring :opsmgr:`logRotate </reference/cluster-configuration/#mongodb-instances>`
  on the {+mdbagent+} for the {+appdb+} by adding the following new fields
  to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.numTotal``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.numUncompressed``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.percentOfDiskspace``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.sizeThresholdMB``
  - ``spec.applicationDatabase.agent.logRotate.timeThresholdHrs``

- You can now configure the :manual:`systemLog </reference/configuration-options/#systemlog-options>`
  to send logs to a custom location other than the default ``/var/log/mongodb-mms-automation`` directory using the following new fields
  in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.path`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.logAppend`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.agent.systemLog.destination`

- Improves handling of {+appdb+} clusters in |multi-clusters|.
  
  In the last release, to scale down processes, the |k8s-op-short| required
  a connection to the |k8s| cluster. This could block the reconciliation
  process due to a full-cluster outage.

  In this release, the |k8s-op-short| successfully manages the remaining
  healthy clusters as long as they have a majority of votes to elect a primary.
  The |k8s-op-short| doesn't remove associated processes from the automation
  configuration and replica set configuration. The |k8s-op-short| deletes
  these processes only if you delete the corresponding cluster from
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList <spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList>`
  or change the number of the cluster members to zero. When the |k8s-op-short|
  deletes these processes, it scales down the replica set by removing
  processes tied to that cluster one at a time.

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Adds an automatic recovery mechanism for ``MongoDB``
  resources when a custom resource remains in a ``Pending`` 
  or ``Failed`` state for a longer period of time. In addition, 
  introduces the following environment variables:

  - :ref:`MDB_AUTOMATIC_RECOVERY_ENABLE <mdb-automatic-recovery-enable>`
  - :ref:`MDB_AUTOMATIC_RECOVERY_BACKOFF_TIME_S <mdb-automatic-backoff-time-s>`

  To learn more, see :ref:`troubleshooting-automatic-recovery`.

- Allows you to route the audit logs for the ``MongoDB`` resource to the |k8s|
  Pod logs. Ensure that you write the ``MongoDB`` resource's audit logs
  to the ``/var/log/mongodb-mms-automation/mongodb-audit.log`` file.
  The Pod hosting the resource monitors this file and appends its content
  to its |k8s| logs.
  
  To send audit logs to the |k8s| Pod logs, use the following example
  configuration in the ``MongoDB`` resource:

  .. code-block:: yaml
  
     spec:
       additionalMongodConfig:
         auditLog:
           destination: file
           format: JSON
           path: /var/log/mongodb-mms-automation/mongodb-audit.log
  
  The |k8s-op-short| tags audit log entries with the ``mongodb-audit`` key
  in the Pod logs. 

  To extract audit log entries, use a command similar to the following example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     kubectl logs -c mongodb-enterprise-database replica-set-0 | \
     jq -r 'select(.logType == "mongodb-audit") | .contents'

Bug Fixes
++++++++++

Fixes an issue where you couldn't set the :setting:`spec.backup.autoTerminateOnDeletion`
setting to ``true`` for sharded clusters. This setting controls whether the
|k8s-op-short| stops and terminates the backup when you delete a MongoDB
resource. If omitted, the default value is ``false``.

Breaking Changes
````````````````

- Renames the environment variable ``CURRENT_NAMESPACE`` to ``NAMESPACE``. This variable 
  tracks the namespace of the |k8s-op-short|. If you've set this variable by editing the 
  |k8s-mdbrscs|, update ``CURRENT_NAMESPACE`` to ``NAMESPACE`` while 
  :ref:`upgrading the Kubernetes Operator <upgrade-k8s-operator>`.
 
Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where ``StatefulSet`` override labels failed to override the ``StatefulSet``.
 
Improvements
````````````

- Supports configuring backups of the {+appdb+} and MongoDB for the |mongodb-multi|.
- Adds documentation for configuring a |mongodb-multis| deployment in a GitOps environment. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`multi-cluster-gitops`.
- Adds ``MetadataWrapper``, a label and annotations wrapper, to the |k8s-mdbrsc|, 
  |mongodb-multi| and ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources. The wrapper supports 
  overriding ``metadata.Labels`` and ``metadata.Annotations``.

MongoDBOpsManager Resource

Breaking Changes and Deprecations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The ``appdb-ca`` is not automatically added to the JVM trust store in |onprem|. The 
  ``appdb-ca`` is the |certauth| saved in the ConfigMap specified in 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.security.tls.ca`. This impacts you if:

  - You use the same custom certificate for the ``appdb-ca`` and your |s3| snapshot store.
  - You use a version of |k8s-op-short| earlier than 1.17.0 or you've mounted your own 
    trust store to |onprem|.
  
  If you need to use the same custom certificate for ``appdb-ca`` and the |s3| snapshot 
  store, specify the CA with :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs`.

- Deprecates the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificate` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificate` settings. Use 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificateSecretRefs` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs` instead.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

- Fixes an issue that prevented setting an arbitrary port number for 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity.port` when using the ``LoadBalancer`` service type 
  to expose |onprem| externally.
- Fixes an issue that caused |onprem| to reject certificates by enabling the |k8s-op-short| 
  to import the ``appdb-ca``, which is a bundle of CAs, into the |onprem| JVM trust store.

Improvements
++++++++++++

- Supports configuring the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource with a highly available 
  {+appdb+} across multiple |k8s| clusters by adding the following new fields
  to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource:

  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
  - :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.clusterSpecList`
  
  The default value for the new optional :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` 
  field is ``singleCluster``, and it is used if you omit the value. To upgrade to |k8s-op-short| 
  1.21, you don't need to update your ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resources. This makes the addition 
  of the :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` setting backward-compatible with 
  single |k8s| cluster deployments of the {+appdb+}. To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-om-container` and 
  the :ref:`k8s-om-specification`.
- Allows you to add a list of custom certificates for backups in the |s3| snapshot store 
  using the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs` and 
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificateSecretRefs` fields in the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` resource.
