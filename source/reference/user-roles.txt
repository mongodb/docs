|mms| roles allow you to grant users different levels of access to
|mms|. You can grant a user the privileges needed to perform a specific
set of tasks and no more.

If you use |ldap| authentication for |mms|, you must:

1. Create |ldap| groups for each available role that follows.
2. Assign users to these |ldap| groups.

Neither the |ldap| server nor |mms| synchronizes the groups and
roles without user intervention.

To assign user roles, see :ref:`assign-roles-to-users`. You can't
assign your own roles.

       role sets their project privileges.

       A :authrole:`Project User Admin` or
       :authrole:`Owner <Project Owner>` can add a new |mms| user to a
       project. This also adds this new |mms| user to that project's
       organization.
