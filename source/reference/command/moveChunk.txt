.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal administrative command that
   moves :term:`chunks <chunk>` between :term:`shards <shard>`.
   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
   command against the :term:`admin database` of a
   :program:`mongos` instance in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { moveChunk : <namespace> ,
                       find : <document> ,
                       to : <destination>,
                       <options> } )

   :param string moveChunk:

      The name of the :term:`collection` where the :term:`chunk`
      exists. Specify the collection's full namespace, including the
      database name.

   :param document find:

      A document contained in the chunk that will be selected for splitting.

      Do not use ``find`` on a collection with a :term:`hashed shard key`.

      You may specify either ``bounds`` or ``find`` but not both.

   :param array bounds:

      Specify the bounds of a specific chunk to move.  The array must
      consist of two documents specifying the lower and upper shard key
      values of a chunk to move.

      You may specify either ``bounds`` or ``find`` but not both.

      Use this option to move chunks in collections partitioned using
      a hashed shard key.

   :param string to:

      The name of the destination shard for the chunk.

   :param boolean _secondaryThrottle:

      Optional. Set to ``true`` by default.  When ``true``, the
      balancer waits for replication to :term:`secondaries
      <secondary>` while copying and deleting data during
      migrations. For details, see
      :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.

   The :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-chunk-migration>` section
   describes how chunks move between shards on MongoDB.

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` return the following if another
   metadata operation is taking place on the chunk's collection:

   .. code-block:: none

      errmsg: "The collection's metadata lock is already taken."

   If another process, such as a balancer process, changes meta data while
   ``moveChunk`` is running, you may see this error. You may retry the
   ``moveChunk`` operation without side effects

   .. note::

      Only use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` in special circumstances
      such as preparing your :term:`sharded cluster` for an initial
      ingestion of data, or a large bulk import operation.
      In most cases allow the balancer to create and balance chunks
      in sharded clusters.
      See
      :ref:`sharding-administration-create-chunks` for more information.
