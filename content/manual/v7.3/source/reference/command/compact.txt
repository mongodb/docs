Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: compact

   Rewrites and defragments all data and indexes in a collection. On
   :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` databases, this command
   releases unneeded disk space to the operating system.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst
   
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        compact: <string>, 
        force: <flag>, // Optional
        freeSpaceTargetMB: <int>, // Optional 
        comment: <any>, // Optional
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``compact``
     - string
     - The name of the collection.

   * - ``force``
     - flag
     - .. _compact-force-option:

       Optional. If specified, forces 
       ``compact`` to run on the :term:`primary` in 
       a :term:`replica set`. ``compact`` does not block 
       :ref:`crud` on the database it is compacting. 

   * - ``freeSpaceTargetMB`` 
     - Integer 
     - .. versionadded: 7.3 

       Optional. Specifies the minimum amount of storage space, in megabytes, 
       that must be recoverable for compaction to proceed. Compaction proceeds 
       only if the amount of free storage space available is greater than 
       ``freeSpaceTargetMB``.

       *Default:* 20
      
   * - ``comment``
     - any

.. _compact-authentication:

``compact`` Required Privileges
-------------------------------

For clusters enforcing :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
you must authenticate as a user with the :authaction:`compact` privilege
action on the target collection. The :authrole:`dbAdmin` role provides 
the required privileges for running ``compact`` against
non-system collections. 

For :ref:`system collections <metadata-system-collections>`, you must: 

1. Create a custom role that grants the ``compact`` action on 
   the system collection.
2. Grant that role to a new or existing user. 
3. Authenticate as that user to perform the ``compact`` 
   command.

For example, the following operations create a custom role that grants
the ``compact`` action against the specified database and
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.createRole(
     {
       role: "myCustomCompactRole",
       privileges: [
         {
           resource: { "db" : "<database>" , "collection" : "<collection>" },
           actions: [ "compact" ]
         }
       ],
       roles: []
     }
   )

For more information on configuring the ``resource`` document, see 
:ref:`resource-document`.

To add the :authrole:`dbAdmin` or the custom role to an existing
user, use :method:`db.grantRolesToUser` or :method:`db.updateUser()`.
The following operation grants the custom ``compact`` role to the 
``myCompactUser`` on the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.grantRolesToUser("myCompactUser", [ "dbAdmin" | "myCustomCompactRole" ] )

To add the :authrole:`dbAdmin` or the custom role to a new user,
specify the role to the ``roles`` array of the
:method:`db.createUser()` method when creating the user.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.createUser(
     { 
        user: "myCompactUser",
        pwd: "myCompactUserPassword",
        roles: [
          { role: "dbAdmin", db: "<database>" } | "myCustomCompactRole"
        ]
      }
   )

Behavior
--------

Monitoring Progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the ``compact`` operation's progress, monitor the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` log file or run :method:`db.currentOp()`
from another shell instance.

Operation Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you terminate ``compact`` with the :method:`db.killOp()
<db.killOp()>` method or restart the server before the operation  
finishes, ``compact`` ends and may fail its attempt to release 
disk space back to the operating system.

Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~

To see how the storage space changes for the collection, run the
:dbcommand:`collStats` command before and after compaction.

On :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, ``compact`` attempts
to reduce the required storage space for data and indexes in a
collection, releasing unneeded disk space to the operating system. The
effectiveness of this operation is workload dependent and no disk space
may be recovered. This command is useful if you have removed a large
amount of data from the collection, and do not plan to replace it.

``compact`` may require additional disk space to run on
WiredTiger databases.

.. _compact-cmd-replica-sets:

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``compact`` on collections and indexes that are stored in a
replica set, however there are some important considerations:

- The primary node does not replicate the ``compact`` command to the
  secondaries.
- You should run ``compact`` on secondary nodes whenever possible. If
  you cannot run ``compact`` on secondaries, see the :ref:`force 
  <compact-force-option>` option.
- Starting in MongoDB 6.1.0 (and 6.0.2 and 5.0.12):

  - A secondary node can replicate while ``compact`` is running.
  - Reads are permitted.


To run ``compact`` on a cluster

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Compact the secondary nodes.

      Run ``compact`` on one of the secondary nodes. When ``compact``
      finishes, repeat the operation on each of the remaining
      secondaries in turn.

   .. step:: Reassign the primary node.
    
      To step down the current primary and trigger an election, use the
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` method. To nominate a particular secondary
      node, :ref:`adjust the member priority
      <replica-set-adjust-priority>`.

   .. step:: Compact the old primary.

      After stepping down, the old primary node becomes a secondary
      node. Run ``compact`` on the old primary node.

Version Specific Considerations for Secondary Nodes
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

- A secondary node can replicate while ``compact`` is running.

- Reads are permitted.  

While the ``compact`` command is running, the replica set remains in a 
:replstate:`SECONDARY` status.

For more information about replica set member states, see
See :ref:`replica-set-member-states`.

For replica set maintenance and availability, see
:ref:`perform-maint-on-replica-set`.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``compact`` only applies to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In a
sharded environment, run ``compact`` on each shard separately
as a maintenance operation.

You cannot issue ``compact`` against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Index Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongod` rebuilds all indexes in parallel following the
``compact`` operation.

Example
-------

The following operation runs the ``compact`` command on the
``movies`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { compact: "movies" } )

Running ``compact`` returns output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { bytesFreed: 27859, ok: 1 }
