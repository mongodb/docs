Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: sleep

   Forces the database to block all operations. This is an internal
   command for testing purposes.

   The :dbcommand:`sleep` command takes a document with the following
   fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/sleep-field.rst

Example
-------

   The :dbcommand:`sleep` command takes the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: none

        { sleep: { w: <true|false>, secs: <seconds> } }

   The command places the :program:`mongod` instance in a "write-lock"
   state for a specified number of seconds. Without arguments,
   :dbcommand:`sleep` causes a "read lock" for 100 seconds.

   .. warning::

      :dbcommand:`sleep` claims the lock specified in the ``w``
      argument and blocks *all* operations on the :program:`mongod`
      instance for the specified amount of time. 

   .. read-lock, write-lock, global-lock

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`sleep`
