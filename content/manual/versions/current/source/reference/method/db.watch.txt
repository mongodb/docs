.. method:: db.watch( pipeline, options )

   *For replica sets and sharded clusters only*

   Opens a :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` for a database
   to report on all its non-``system`` collections.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``pipeline``
        - array
        - Optional. An :ref:`aggregation-pipeline` consisting
          of one or more of the following aggregation stages:
          
          .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-available-pipeline-stages.rst
          
          Specify a pipeline to filter/modify the change events output.
          
          .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-change-stream-modification-error.rst

      * - ``options``
        - document
        - Optional. Additional options that modify the behavior of
          :method:`db.watch()`.

   The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``resumeAfter``
   
        - document
   
        - .. include:: /includes/change-stream/resume-after-description.rst

      * - ``startAfter``
   
        - document
   
        - .. include:: /includes/change-stream/start-after-description.rst
   
      * - ``fullDocument``
   
        - string
   
        - Optional. By default, :method:`db.watch()` returns the delta of
          those fields modified by an update operation, instead of the entire
          updated document.
          
          Set ``fullDocument`` to ``"updateLookup"`` to direct
          :method:`db.watch()` to look up the most current 
          majority-committed version of the updated document.
          :method:`db.watch()` returns a ``fullDocument`` field with
          the document lookup in addition to the ``updateDescription`` delta.
          
          .. include:: /includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-full-document.rst


      * - ``fullDocumentBeforeChange``   
        - string
        - Optional. Default is ``"off"``.

          .. include:: /includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-full-document-before-change.rst


      * - ``batchSize``
   
        - int
   
        - Optional. Specifies the maximum number of change events to return in each
          batch of the response from the MongoDB cluster. 
          
          Has the same functionality as :method:`cursor.batchSize()`.
          
          
   
      * - ``maxAwaitTimeMS``
   
        - int
   
        - Optional. The maximum amount of time in milliseconds the server waits for new
          data changes to report to the change stream cursor before returning an
          empty batch.
          
          Defaults to ``1000`` milliseconds.
          
          
   
      * - ``collation``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. Pass a :ref:`collation document <collation-document-fields>` 
          to specify a collation for the change stream cursor.
          
          If omitted, defaults to ``simple`` binary comparison.
          
          
   
      * - ``startAtOperationTime``
   
        - Timestamp
   
        - Optional. The starting point for the change stream. If the specified starting
          point is in the past, it must be in the time range of the oplog. To
          check the time range of the oplog, see
          :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()`.
          
          ``startAtOperationTime`` is mutually exclusive with ``resumeAfter``
          and ``startAfter``.

   :returns:
      A :term:`cursor` over the change event documents.
      See :doc:`/reference/change-events` for examples of change
      event documents.

Compatibility
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Availability
------------

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.watch()` is available for replica sets and sharded
clusters:

- For a replica set, you can issue :method:`db.watch()` on any
  data-bearing member.

- For a sharded cluster, you must issue :method:`db.watch()` on a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only use :method:`db.watch()` with the :ref:`Wired Tiger
storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Read Concern ``majority`` Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-rc-majority-4.2.rst

Behavior
--------

- You cannot run :method:`db.watch()` on the ``admin``, ``local``, or
  ``config`` database.

- :method:`db.watch()` only notifies on data changes that have
  persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-cursor-open.rst


- You can run :method:`db.watch()` for a database that does not exist.
  However, once the database is created and you drop the database, the
  change stream cursor closes.

Resumability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume.rst

.. include:: /includes/change-stream/resume-after

.. |watchmethod| replace:: :method:`db.watch()`

Full Document Lookup of Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-full-document-lookup.rst

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`find` and :authaction:`changeStream` privilege actions on
the :ref:`database resource <resource-document>`. That is, a user must
have a :ref:`role <roles>` that grants the following :ref:`privilege
<privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream"] }

The built-in :authrole:`read` role provides the appropriate
privileges.

Cursor Iteration
----------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-multiple-cursor-monitors.rst

.. _db.watch-example:

Example
-------

The following operation in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` opens a
change stream cursor on the ``hr`` database. The returned cursor
reports on data changes to all the non-``system`` collections in that
database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   watchCursor = db.getSiblingDB("hr").watch()


Iterate the cursor to check for new events. Use the
:method:`cursor.isClosed()` method with the :method:`cursor.tryNext()`
method to ensure the loop only exits if the change stream cursor is
closed *and* there are no objects remaining in the latest batch:

.. code-block:: javascript

   while (!watchCursor.isClosed()) {
     let next = watchCursor.tryNext()
     while (next !== null) {
       printjson(next);
       next = watchCursor.tryNext()
     }
   }

:ref:`change-stream-output`.
