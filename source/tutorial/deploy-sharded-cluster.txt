Overview
--------

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling for
large data sets and enable high throughput operations by distributing the data
set across a group of servers. See the :manual:`Sharding Introduction
</core/sharding-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual for more information.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster managed by |mms|. Later, you
can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance operations on the
cluster.
