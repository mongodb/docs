  .. note::

     |mms| can manage |tls| for you if you are using {+aagent+} for
     the deployment. With {+aagent+}, |mms| prompts you for the
     certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you enable
     |tls| and then configures the agents appropriately. To learn
     how to configure |tls|, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.
