Definition
----------

.. method:: cursor.batchSize(size)

   Specifies the
   number of documents to return in each batch of the response from the
   MongoDB instance. In most cases, modifying the batch size will
   not affect the user or the application, as the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and most :doc:`drivers
   </applications/drivers>` return results as if MongoDB returned a
   single batch.

   The :method:`~cursor.batchSize()` method takes the
   following parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-cursor.batchSize-param.rst

   .. note::

      Specifying ``1`` or a negative number is analogous to using the
      :method:`~cursor.limit()` method.

Example
-------

The following example sets the batch size for the results of a query
(i.e. :method:`~db.collection.find()`) to ``10``. The
:method:`~cursor.batchSize()` method does not change the
output in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, which, by default, iterates over the
first 20 documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find().batchSize(10)
