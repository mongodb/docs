Online Gaming: Creating a Role-Playing Game
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This document outlines the basic patterns and principals for using
MongoDB as a persistent storage engine for an online
game, particularly one that contains role-playing characteristics.

Problem
~~~~~~~

In designing an online game, there is a need to store various
data about the player's character. Some of the attributes might include:

Character attributes
   These might include intrinsic characteristics such as strength,
   dexterity, charisma, etc., as well as variable characteristics such
   as health, mana (if your game includes magic), etc.
Character inventory
   If your game includes the ability for the player to carry around
   objects, you will need to keep track of the items carried.
Character location / relationship to the game world
   If your game allows the player to move their character from one
   location to another, this information needs to be stored as well.

In addition, you need to store all this data for large numbers of
playerss who might be playing the game simultaneously, and this data
needs to be both readable and writeable with minimal latency in order
to ensure responsiveness during gameplay.

In addition to the above data, you also need to store data for

Items
   These include various artifacts that the character might interact with such as
   weapons, armor, treasure, etc.
Locations
   The various locations in which characters and items might find themselves such
   as rooms, halls, etc.

Another consideration when designing the persistence backend for an
online game is its flexibility. Particularly in early releases of a
game, you may wish to change gameplay mechanics significantly as you
receive feedback from your players. As you implement these changes, you
need to be able to migrate your persistent data from one format to
another with minimal (or no) downtime.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

The solution presented by this case study assumes that the read and
write performance is equally important and must be accessible with minimal
latency.

Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ultimately, the particulars of your schema depends on the particular
design of your game. When designing your schema, you should attempt to
encapsulate all the commonly used data into a small number of objects in order to
minimize the number of queries to the database and the number of seeks in a
query. Encapsulating all player state into a ``character`` collection, item data
into an ``item`` collection, and location data into a ``location`` collection
satisfies both these criteria.

Character Schema
````````````````

In a role-playing game, then, a typical character state document might look
like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       _id: ObjectId('...'),
       name: 'Tim',
       character: {
           intrinsics: {
               strength: 10,
	       dexterity: 16,
               intelligence: 17,
               charisma: 8 },
           class: 'mage',
           health: 212,
           mana: 152
       },
       location: {
           id: 'maze-1',
           description: 'a maze of twisty little passages...',
	   exits: {n:'maze-2', s:'maze-1', e:'maze-3'},
           players: [
               { id:ObjectId('...'), name:'grue' },
               { id:ObjectId('...'), name:'Tim' }
               ],
           inventory: [
               { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:'scroll of cause fear' }]
        },
       gold: 523,
       armor: [
           { id:ObjectId('...'), region:'head'},
	   { id:ObjectId('...'), region:'body'},
	   { id:ObjectId('...'), region:'feet'}],
       weapons: [ {id:ObjectId('...'), hand:'both'} ],
       inventory: [
           { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:'backpack', inventory: [
               { qty:4, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'potion of healing'},
	       { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'scroll of magic mapping'},
               { qty:2, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'c-rations'} ]},
           { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:"wizard's hat", bonus:3},
	   { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:"wizard's robe", bonus:0},
	   { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:"old boots", bonus:0},
	   { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:"quarterstaff", bonus:2} ]
   }

There are a few things to note about this document:

#. Information about the character's location in the game is encapsulated under
   the ``location`` attribute. Note in particular that all of the information
   necessary to render the room is encapsulated within the character state
   document. This allows the game system to render the room without making a
   second #query to the database to get room information.
#. The ``armor`` and ``weapons`` attributes contain little information about the
   actual items being worn or carried. This information is actually stored under
   the ``inventory`` property. Since the inventory information is stored in the
   same document, there is no need to replicate the detailed information about
   each item into the ``armor`` and ``weapons`` properties.
#. ``inventory`` contains the item details necessary for
   rendering each item in the character's posession, including anyenchantments
   (``bonus``) and ``quantity``. Once again, embedding this data into the
   character record means you don't have to perform a separate query to fetch
   item details necessary for display.

Item Schema
```````````

Likewise, the item schema should include all details about all items globally in
the game:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       _id: ObjectId('...'),
       name: 'backpack',
       bonus: null,
       inventory: [
           { qty:4, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'potion of healing'},
	   { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'scroll of magic mapping'},
           { qty:2, id:ObjectId('...'), name: 'c-rations'} ]},
       weight: 12,
       price: 160,
       ...
   }

Note that this document contains more or less the same information as stored in
the ``inventory`` attribute of ``character`` documents, as well as additional
data which may only be needed sporadically in the case of game-play such as
``weight`` and ``price``.

Location Schema
```````````````

Finally, the ``location`` schema specifies the state of the world in the game:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       id: 'maze-1',
       description: 'a maze of twisty little passages...',
       exits: {n:'maze-2', s:'maze-1', e:'maze-3'},
       players: [
           { id:ObjectId('...'), name:'grue' },
           { id:ObjectId('...'), name:'Tim' } ],
       inventory: [
           { qty:1, id:ObjectId('...'), name:'scroll of cause fear' } ],
   }

Here, note that ``location`` stores exactly the same information as is stored in
the ``location`` attribute of the ``character`` document. You will use
``location`` as the system of record when the game requires interaction between
multiple characters or between characters and non-inventory items.

Operations
----------

In an online gaming system with the state embedded in a single document for
``character``, ``item``, and ``location``, the primary operations you'll be
performing are querying for the character state by ``_id``, extracting relevant
data for display, and updating various attributes about the character. This
section describes procedures for performing these queries, extractions, and
updates.

In particular you should try *not* to load the ``location`` or ``item`` documents
except when absolutely necessary.

The examples that follow use the Python programming language and the
:api:`PyMongo <python/current>` :term:`driver` for MongoDB, but you
can implement this system using any language you choose.

Load Character Data from MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic operation in this system is loading the character state.

Query
`````

Use the following query to load the ``character`` document from MongoDB:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> character = db.characters.find_one({'_id': character_id})

Index Support
`````````````

In this case, the default index that MongoDB supplies on the ``_id`` field is
sufficient for good performance of this query.

Extract Armor and Weapon Data for Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to save space, the ``character`` schema described above stores item
details only in the ``inventory`` attribute, storing ``ObjectId``\ s in other
locations. To display these item details, as on a character summary window, you
need to merge the information from the ``armor`` and ``weapons`` attributes with
information from the ``inventory`` attribute.

Suppose, for instance, that your code is displaying the armor data using the
following Jinja2 template:

.. code-block:: html

   <div>
     <h2>Armor</h2>
     <dl>
       {% if value.head %}
         <dt>Helmet</dt>
         <dd>{{value.head[0].description}}</dd>
       {% endif %}
       {% if value.hands %}
         <dt>Gloves</dt>
         <dd>{{value.hands[0].description}}</dd>
       {% endif %}
       {% if value.feet %}
         <dt>Boots</dt>
         <dd>{{value.feet[0].description}}</dd>
       {% endif %}
       {% if value.body %}
         <dt>Body Armor</dt>
         <dd><ul>{% for piece in value.body %}
           <li>piece.description</li>
         {% endfor %}</ul></dd>
       {% endif %}
    </dl>
   </dd>

In this case, you want the various ``description`` fields above to be text
similar to "+3 wizard's hat." The context passed to the template above, then,
would be of the following form:

.. code-block:: python

   {
       "head": [ { "id":..., "description": "+3 wizard's hat" } ],
       "hands": [],
       "feet": [ { "id":..., "description": "old boots" } ],
       "body": [ { "id":..., "description": "wizard's robe" } ],
   }

In order to build up this structure, use the following helper functions:

.. code-block:: python

   def get_item_index(inventory):
       '''Given an inventory attribute, recursively build up an item
       index (including all items contained within other items)
       '''

       result = {}
       for item in inventory:
           result[item['_id']] = item
           if 'inventory' in item:
               result.update(get_item_index(item['inventory]))
       return result

   def describe_item(item):
       '''Add a 'description' field to the given item'''

       result = dict(item)
       if item['bonus']:
           description = '%+d %s' % (item['bonus'], item['name'])
       else:
           description = item['name']
       result['description'] = description
       return result

   def get_armor_for_display(character, item_index):
       '''Given a character document, return an 'armor' value
       suitable for display'''

       result = dict(head=[], hands=[], feet=[], body=[])
       for piece in character['armor']:
           item = describe_item(item_index[piece['id']])
           result[piece['region']].append(item)
       return result

In order to actually display the armor, then, you would use the following code:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> item_index = get_item_index(
   ...     character['inventory'] + character['location']['inventory'])
   >>> armor = get_armor_for_dislay(character, item_index)

Note in particular that you are building an index not only for the items the
character is actually carrying in inventory, but also for the items that the
player might interact with in the room.

Similarly, in order to display the weapon information, you need to build a
structure such as the following:

.. code-block:: python

   {
       "left": None,
       "right": None,
       "both": { "description": "+2 quarterstaff" }
   }

The helper function is similar to that for ``get_armor_for_display``:

.. code-block:: python

   def get_weapons_for_display(character, item_index):
       '''Given a character document, return a 'weapons' value
       suitable for display'''

       result = dict(left=None, right=None, both=None)
       for piece in character['weapons']:
           item = describe_item(item_index[piece['id']])
           result[piece['hand']] = item
       return result

In order to actually display the weapons, then, you would use the following code:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> armor = get_weapons_for_dislay(character, item_index)

Extract Character Attributes, Inventory, and Room Information for Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to display information about the character's attributes, inventory, and
surroundings, you also need to extract fields from the character state. In this
case, however, the schema defined above keeps all the relevant information for
display embedded in those sections of the document. The code for extracting this
data, then, is the following:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> attributes = character['character']
   >>> inventory = character['inventory']
   >>> room_data = character['location']

Pick Up an Item From a Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your game, suppose the player decides to pick up an item from the room and add
it to their inventory. In this case, you need to update both the character state
and the global location state:

.. code-block:: python

   def pick_up_item(character, item_index, item_id):
       '''Transfer an item from the current room to the character's inventory'''

       item = item_index[item_id]
       character['inventory'].append(item)
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'] },
           { '$push': { 'inventory': item },
             '$pull': { 'location.inventory': { '_id': item['id'] } } })
       db.location.update(
           { '_id': character['location']['id'] },
           { '$pull': { 'inventory': { 'id': item_id } } })

While the above code may be for a single-player game, if you allow multiple
players, or non-player characters, to pick up items, that introduces a problem in
the above code where two characters may try to pick up an item simultaneously. To
guard against that, use the ``location`` collection to decide between ties. In
this case, the code is now the following:

.. code-block:: python

   def pick_up_item(character, item_index, item_id):
       '''Transfer an item from the current room to the character's inventory'''

       item = item_index[item_id]
       character['inventory'].append(item)
       result = db.location.update(
           { '_id': character['location']['id'],
             'inventory.id': item_id },
           { '$pull': { 'inventory': { 'id': item_id } } },
           safe=True)
        if not result['updatedExisting']:
            raise Conflict()
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'] },
           { '$push': { 'inventory': item },
             '$pull': { 'location': { '_id': item['id'] } } })

By ensuring that the item is present before removing it from the room in the
``update`` call above, you guarantee that only one player/non-player
character/monster can pick up the item.

Remove an Item from a Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the game described here, the ``backpack`` item can contain other
items. You might further suppose that some other items may be similarly
hierarchical (e.g. a chest in a room). Suppose that the player wishes to move an
item from one of these "containers" into their active ``inventory`` as a prelude
to using it. In this case, you need to update both the character state and the
item state:

.. code-block:: python

   def move_to_active_inventory(character, item_index, container_id, item_id):
       '''Transfer an item from the given container to the character's active
       inventory
       '''

       result = db.item.update(
           { '_id': container_id,
             'inventory.id': item_id },
           { '$pull': { 'inventory': { 'id': item_id } } },
           safe=True)
       if not result['updatedExisting']:
           raise Conflict()
       item = item_index[item_id]
       container = item_index[item_id]
       character['inventory'].append(item)
       container['inventory'] = [
           item for item in container['inventory']
           if item['_id'] != item_id ]
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'] },
           { '$push': { 'inventory': item } } )
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'], 'inventory.id': container_id },
           { '$pull': { 'inventory.$.inventory': { 'id': item_id } } } )

Note in the code above that you:

- Ensure that the item's state makes this update reasonable (the item is
  actually contained within the container). Abort with an error if this is not
  true.
- Update the in-memory ``character`` document's inventory, adding the item.
- Update the in-memory ``container`` document's inventory, removing the item.
- Update the ``character`` document in MongoDB.
- In the case that the character is moving an item from a container *in his own
  inventory*, update the character's inventory representation of the container.

Move the Character to a Different Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your game, suppose the player decides to move north. In this case, you need to
update the character state to match the new location:

.. code-block:: python

   def move(character, direction):
       '''Move the character to a new location'''

       # Remove character from current location
       db.location.update(
           {'_id': character['location']['id'] },
           {'$pull': {'players': {'id': character['_id'] } } })
       # Add character to new location, retrieve new location data
       new_location = db.location.find_and_modify(
           { '_id': character['location']['exits'][direction] },
           { '$push': { 'players': {
               'id': character['_id'],
               'name': character['name'] } } },
           new=True)
       character['location'] = new_location
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'] },
           { '$set': { 'location': new_location } })

Here, note that the code updates the old room, the new room, and the character
document.

Buy an Item
~~~~~~~~~~~

If your character wants to buy an item, you need to add that item to the
character's inventory, decrement the character's gold, increment the shopkeeper's
gold, and update the room:

.. code-block:: python

   def buy(character, shopkeeper, item_id):
       '''Pick up an item, add to the character's inventory, and transfer
       payment to the shopkeeper
       '''

       price = db.item.find_one({'_id': item_id}, {'price':1})['price']
       result = db.character.update(
           { '_id': character['_id'],
             'gold': { '$gte': price } },
           { '$inc': { 'gold': -price } },
           safe=True )
       if not result['updatedExisting']:
            raise InsufficientFunds()
       try:
           pick_up_item(character, item_id)
       except:
           # Add the gold back to the character
           result = db.character.update(
               { '_id': character['_id'] },
               { '$inc': { 'gold': price } } )
           raise
       character['gold'] -= price
       db.character.update(
           { '_id': shopkeeper['_id'] },
           { '$inc': { 'gold': price } } )

Note that the code above ensures that the character has sufficent gold to pay for
the item using the ``updatedExisting`` trick used for picking up items. The race
condition for item pickup is handled as well, "rolling back" the removal of gold
from the character's wallet if the item cannot be picked up.

Sharding
--------

If your system needs to scale beyond a single MongoDB node, you will want to
use a :term:`shard cluster`, which takes advantage of MongoDB's
:term:`sharding` functionality.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/faq/sharding`" and the ":wiki:`Sharding` wiki
   page.

Sharding in this use case is fairly
straightforward, since all our items are always retrieved by ``_id``. To shard
the ``character`` and ``location`` collections, the commands would be the
following:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> db.command('shardcollection', 'character', {
   ...     'key': { '_id': 1 } })
   { "collectionsharded" : "character", "ok" : 1 }
   >>> db.command('shardcollection', 'location', {
   ...     'key': { '_id': 1 } })
   { "collectionsharded" : "location", "ok" : 1 }
