Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: split

   Splits a :term:`chunk` in a :term:`sharded cluster` into two chunks.
   In most cases, you do not need to do this. The :program:`mongos`
   instance splits and manages chunks automatically. However, the
   :dbcommand:`split` command does allow administrators to manually
   create splits.

   The :dbcommand:`split` command is an administrative command and can
   be run only on a :program:`mongos` instance.

   The :dbcommand:`split` command takes a document with the following
   fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/split-field.rst

Command Formats
---------------

To issue the :dbcommand:`split` command, connect to the ``admin``
database of a :program:`mongos` instance. Pass to the
:method:`db.runCommand()` method a document of one of the following
forms:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { split: <database>.<collection>, find: <document> }

Or:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { split: <database>.<collection>, middle: <document> }

Or:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { split: <database>.<collection>, bounds: [ lower, upper ] }

To create a split for a collection that uses a :term:`hashed shard key`,
use the ``bounds`` parameter. Do *not* use the ``middle`` parameter.

.. include:: /includes/warning-splitting-chunks.rst

Examples
--------

The following sections provide examples of the count command.

Split a Chunk in Half
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , find : { _id : 99 } } )

This command inserts a new split in the collection named
``people`` in the ``test`` database. This will split the chunk
that contains the document that matches the query ``{ _id : 99
}`` in half. If the document specified by the query does not (yet)
exist, the :dbcommand:`split` will divide the chunk where that
document *would* exist.

The split divides the chunk in half and does *not* split the chunk
using the identified document as the middle.

Define an Arbitrary Split Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define an arbitrary split point, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , middle : { _id : 99 } } )

This form is typically used when :term:`pre-splitting` data in a
collection.

Split a Chunk Using Values of a Hashed Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To split a specific chunk using the minimum and maximum values of the
:term:`hashed shard key` of that chunk, use the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { split: "test.people" ,
                  bounds : [ NumberLong("-5838464104018346494"),
                             NumberLong("-5557153028469814163")] } )

Metadata Lock Error
-------------------

If another process, such as a balancer process, changes meta data
while :dbcommand:`split` is running, you may see this
error. You may retry the :dbcommand:`split` operation without
side effects. 

.. code-block:: none

   errmsg: "The collection's metadata lock is already taken."

.. seealso:: :dbcommand:`moveChunk`, :method:`sh.moveChunk()`,
   :method:`sh.splitAt()`, and :method:`sh.splitFind()`.
