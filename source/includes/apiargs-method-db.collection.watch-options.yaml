  By default, :method:`~db.collection.watch()` returns the delta of
  those fields modified by an update operation, instead of the entire
  updated document.

  :method:`~db.collection.watch()` to look up the most current 
  majority-committed version of the updated document.

  the document lookup in addition to the ``updateDescription`` delta.
