MongoDB recommends migrating from the 
:ref:`{+abic+} <bi-connection>` to the newer 
:ref:`{+asql+} Interface <query-with-sql>`.

.. note::

   The {+abic+} and the on-premise BI Connector
   are separate tools. This guide is about migrating from the
   {+abic+}, which MongoDB is phasing out.

{+asql+}
---------

Similar to the {+abic+}, 
{+asql+} enables you to analyze data from |service| clusters
using a variety of SQL-based tools, such as Tableau and Power BI.

Compared to the {+abic+}, {+asql+} offers the
following advantages:

- You can read data from sources other than |service| clusters 
  using the {+adf+} infrastructure.
- You can set your schema.
- You pay only for your usage; you don't need a subscription.
- You can use custom MongoDB connectors for Tableau and Power BI.

To learn more about {+asql+}, see :ref:`query-with-sql`.

{+asql+} Limitations
---------------------

- {+asql+} is read-only.
- {+asql+} is compatible only with the SQL 92 dialect; 
  other SQL dialects are not supported.
- All :ref:`{+adf+} limitations <df-limitations>` apply to {+asql+} because it's a feature of {+adf+}.

{+asql+} Pricing
-----------------

{+asql+} incurs only {+adf+} query costs and |aws| transfer costs;
the {+asql+} Interface itself is free to use. To learn more about the
cost of querying your {+fdi+}, see :ref:`atlas-data-federation-billing`.

.. note::
   
   Costs incurred by {+asql+} queries appear on your invoice under 
   the {+fdi+} that you queried, either as "Data Processed" or 
   "Data Returned and Transferred" charges.

Prepare to Transition to {+asql+}
----------------------------------

To transition from the {+abic+} to {+asql+}, make sure your deployment
meets the following prerequisites:

Additionally, MongoDB recommends that you generate a
:ref:`Transition Readiness Report <bic-asql-transition-report-tool>` 
to help plan your transition.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- An {+fdi+} containing queryable data.
- A MongoDB database user to connect to your {+fdi+}.

.. _bic-asql-transition-report-tool:

Generate a Transition Readiness Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides an {+asql+} Transition Readiness Tool to help you
plan your move from the {+abic+} to the {+asql+} Interface.
The tool generates a report based on your past {+abic+} usage,
providing real-time schema analysis and suggestions and highlighting queries that need 
syntax changes to run properly using {+asql+}.

To generate a report, you must provide the tool 
with at least one of the following details:

- Your {+abic+} logs, for query analysis.
- Your cluster |uri|, for schema analysis.

You can analyze your queries, your schema, or both.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the {+asql+} Readiness Report Tool.
      
      Select the tab for your operating system below and
      download the executable file.

      .. tabs::
      
         .. tab:: MacOS (ARM)
            :tabid: macosarm
      
            Download the `MongoDB {+asql+} Readiness Report Tool 
            <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/transition-readiness-report/AtlasSQLReadinessReport-macos-arm>`__.
      
         .. tab:: MacOS (Intel)
            :tabid: macosintel
      
            Download the `MongoDB {+asql+} Readiness Report Tool 
            <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/transition-readiness-report/AtlasSQLReadinessReport-macos>`__.
      
         .. tab:: Ubuntu
            :tabid: ubuntu
      
            Download the `MongoDB {+asql+} Readiness Report Tool 
            <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/transition-readiness-report/AtlasSQLReadinessReport-linux>`__.
      
         .. tab:: Windows
            :tabid: windows
      
            Download the `MongoDB {+asql+} Readiness Report Tool 
            <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/transition-readiness-report/AtlasSQLReadinessReport-win.exe>`__.


   .. step:: Grant execution permission to the Readiness Report Tool.

      If the file doesn't have execution permission already, grant it.

      .. tabs:: 
         :hidden: true

         .. tab:: MacOS (ARM)
            :tabid: macosarm
      
            .. code-block:: sh 
               :copyable: false

                chmod +x <executable-filename>
      
         .. tab:: MacOS (Intel)
            :tabid: macosintel
            
            .. code-block:: sh 
               :copyable: false

                chmod +x <executable-filename>
      
         .. tab:: Ubuntu
            :tabid: ubuntu

            .. code-block:: sh 
               :copyable: false

                chmod +x <executable-filename>
      
         .. tab:: Windows
            :tabid: windows

   .. step:: (Optional) Download and decompress your {+abic+} logs.

      Providing your {+abic+} logs enables the Readiness Report Tool to 
      report on the following information:
      
      - Historical query data, such as volume and frequency.
      - Query syntax that will fail in {+asql+}.
      - Collection fields with data types
        unknown to relational databases.

      To download your {+abic+} logs:
      
      a. In the {+atlas-ui+}, go to the |service| cluster with the 
         BI connection that you want to analyze. 
      
      #. From your cluster's options (:icon-mms:`ellipsis`), 
         select :guilabel:`Download Logs`.
         
      #. Download ``mongosql.gz``.

      #. Create a new directory,
         then decompress ``mongosql.gz`` into it.
   
   .. step:: (Optional) Copy your cluster URI.

      Providing your |service| cluster |uri| enables the Readiness Report Tool 
      analyze your collection schemas and identify fields that 
      contain data types unknown to SQL tools.

      To find your cluster |uri|:
      
      a. In the {+atlas-ui+}, go to the
         cluster with the collections that you
         want to analyze.
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

      #. Select :guilabel:`Shell` from the list of connection options.

      #. Copy only your connection |uri|.

         The connection |uri| resembles: ``mongodb+srv://bicluster.example.mongodb.net/``.
         Exclude the shell executable, ``mongosh``, and any shell-specific
         command line options.

   .. step:: Generate a report.

      In a terminal, run the Readiness Report Tool executable, providing
      your downloaded logs or your cluster |uri|.

      - You must include your database username. 
      - You must include either ``--input``, ``--uri``, or both. 
        If you include your |uri|, the Readiness Report Tool prompts you 
        for your database user password.
      - You can specify an ``--output`` destination for your generated
        report. If you don't, it's generated in your current
        directory.
      - You can specify a ``--resolver`` to choose a |dns| resolver for network requests. 
        Possible values are: ``cloudflare``, ``google``, and ``quad9``.
      - You can use ``--include`` or ``--exclude`` to narrow your list of namespaces.
        Glob syntax is supported. By default, all namespaces are included.    
      
      The ``--help`` option returns the full list of 
      Readiness Report Tool options:
      
      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         <executable-filename> --help
         Options:
              -i, --input <INPUT>        Sets the input file or directory to analyze BIC logs (optional). One of `--input` or `--uri` must be provided, or both
              -o, --output <OUTPUT>      Sets the output directory (optional). If not specified, the current directory is used
                  --uri <URI>            The Atlas cluster URI to analyze schema (optional). One of `--input` or `--uri` must be provided, or both
              -u, --username <USERNAME>  Username for authentication (optional). This is required if the username and password is not provided in the URI
                  --quiet                Enables quiet mode for less output
                  --resolver <RESOLVER>  The specified resolver (optional) [possible values: cloudflare, google, quad9]
                  --include <INCLUDE>    A list of namespaces to include (optional). If not provided, all namespaces are included. Glob syntax is supported
                  --exclude <EXCLUDE>    A list of namespaces to exclude (optional). If not provided, no namespaces are excluded
              -h, --help                 Print help (see more with '--help')
              -V, --version              Print version

      The Readiness Report Tool organizes the output and generates a clickable index file 
      so you can easily navigate the report.

Transition to {+asql+}
-----------------------

The underlying architecture of {+asql+} is different from {+abic+} 
and you might need to adapt your schema or your queries.

To transition to {+asql+}, identify existing {+abic+}
queries that fail on {+asql+} and update your schema or their syntax
to fix them.

.. warning::
   
   MongoDB recommends testing the full transition process in a sandbox environment
   before you make changes to your production environment. Transitioning from the {+abic+}
   to {+asql+} without adapting your schema or your queries
   might cause breaking changes.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Enable {+asql+} for your {+fdi+}.

      To learn more about enabling and using {+asql+},
      see :ref:`enable-sql-interface`.

   .. step:: Connect to your data with the {+asql+} Interface.

      To learn more about connecting with {+asql+},
      see :ref:`sql-connect`.

   .. step:: Test your queries.
      
      Test your queries with your new {+asql+} connection to ensure
      they run and return the results you expect.

      To learn more about querying with {+asql+},
      see :ref:`asql-write-asql-queries`.

   .. step:: View your schema and adapt it if necessary.
      
      To learn more about schemas in {+asql+}, see
      :ref:`sql-schema-management`.

   .. step:: Adapt any failing queries.

      Some query syntax might need to be changed when you
      transition from the {+abic+} to {+asql+}.

      To learn more about {+asql+} query syntax, see :ref:`sql-reference`.
