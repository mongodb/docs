   To use the {+atlas-cli+} with {+avs+}, you must create an |service| 
   deployment with MongoDB 7.0.5 or later. If you created a local
   |service| deployment with an earlier MongoDB version, you don't get 
   the latest MongoDB version automatically. You must delete the 
   earlier images and deployments. Then you must create a new |service| 
   deployment.
