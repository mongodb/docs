The ``$vectorSearch`` stage is used to perform a semantic search for a 
natural language query on the specified field. When using automated 
embeddings, the field or fields must be indexed as the {+avs+} 
:ref:`autoEmbed <avs-types-auto-embed>` type inside a :ref:`vectorSearch
<avs-types-vector-search>` type index.
