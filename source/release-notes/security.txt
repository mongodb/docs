Access to ``system.users`` Collection
-------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

In 2.4, only users with the ``userAdmin`` role have access to the
``system.users`` collection.

In version 2.2 and earlier, the read-write users of a database all have
access to the ``system.users`` collection, which contains the user
names and user password hashes. [#read-and-write-system-users]_

.. [#read-and-write-system-users] Read-only users do not have access
   to the ``system.users`` collection.

.. _password-hashing-security:

Password Hashing Insecurity
---------------------------

If a user has the same password for multiple databases, the hash will
be the same. A malicious user could exploit this to gain access on a
second database using a different user's credentials.

As a result, always use unique username and password combinations
for each database.

.. example: NOT INCLUDED IN OUTPUT.

   Eve connects to the ``db1`` database and views the ``system.users``
   collection, with the following invocation of :binary:`~bin.mongo`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo <host>/db1 -u eve -p test

   Then, in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, issues the following
   operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.system.users.find()

   This operation returns the following documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id": ObjectId("5074202e032a960d16f4394e"), "user": "alice", "readOnly": false, "pwd": "ac2061b4a08ef8f2d60a07dc18ab4a0a" }
      { "_id": ObjectId("507420ba032a960d16f43951"), "user": "eve", "readOnly": false, "pwd": "5dcc2819b97e68d5cfe51da6cae8a7f6" }

   Alice has read and write accounts on both ``db1`` and ``db2`` and
   also has access on the ``admin`` database. Consider the following
   example where Alice authenticates to the ``admin`` db:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.auth("alice", "pass")

   Consider the output of :method:`~db.collection.find()` on
   the ``system.users`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.system.users.find()

   The following output confirms that the user has the same password and hash:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id": ObjectId("50742045032a960d16f43950"), "user": "alice", "readOnly": false, "pwd": "ac2061b4a08ef8f2d60a07dc18ab4a0a" }

Thanks to Will Urbanski, from Dell SecureWorks, for identifying this issue.
