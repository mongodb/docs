.. important:: Enable MongoDB Usage UI and MongoDB Usage Data Collection

   If :setting:`MongoDB Usage UI` is set to ``true``, this page
   displays information about the MongoDB Usage collected via daily
   snapshots.

   If this page contains no data, you can populate it with data with one of two methods:

   - Set :setting:`MongoDB Usage Data Collection` to ``true`` and wait
     for the daily usage snapshot to generate within 24 hours.

   - Request the
     :doc:`Daily Usage Snapshot API resource </reference/api/usage/generate-daily-usage-snapshot>`.

Sections of the Page
--------------------

This page has two parts: a usage summary and a table of MongoDB deployments.

Usage Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This card contains a section for each server type that your |onprem| deployment between the dates selected.

Each server type section contains three headings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Heading
     - Description
   * - :guilabel:`RAM Used`
     - Greatest amount of RAM used on the date with the greatest use.
   * - :guilabel:`Total Nodes`
     - Count of nodes used on the date with the greatest use.
   * - :guilabel:`Date`
     - When this server type had its greatest use.

The *date of greatest use* depends on the server type:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Server Type
     - Date of Greatest Use Measured
   * - RAM Pool
     - When the greatest amount of RAM was used for all hosts running
       that server type.
   * - All other server types
     - When the greatest number of all hosts of that server type were
       running.

Deployments Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table contains each server and describes the server type
associated, as well as important information about the server's
processes and their deployments.

To build this report, |mms|:

1. Takes daily snapshots of all running MongoDB processes.
2. Merges all snapshots for the selected range of dates.

If you stop or terminate a server before creating the report, that
server remains part of the report in the date range you selected.

.. example::

   1. You start Process A on Host A on 20 April.
   #. On 4 May, |mms| takes a snapshot of Process A.
   #. On 5 May, you shut down Process A.
   #. On 6 May, |mms| takes a new snapshot.
   #. On 10 May, you create report for the range of 1 to 6 May.
   #. This report includes Process A.

To exclude the shutdown process, create a report that doesn't include
dates when that process ran.

Actions
-------

From this page, you can:

Determine Server Type Usage over Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To review which server types were in use for your MongoDB Enterprise
installations during a given time period:

1. Select a start date from the :guilabel:`From` box.

2. Select an end date from the :guilabel:`To` box.

The Usage Summary updates automatically with the applicable values.
This usage summary covers all hosts, organizations, and projects.

Apply New Server Type to Multiple Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the server type of multiple hosts at once:

1. Check the box at the left the columns containing the hosts to which
   you wish to apply the new server type.

2. Select the desired server type from the
   :guilabel:`Apply a Server Type` dropdown.

This action updates these hosts to have that server type for all
*existing* and *future* usage snapshots. The new server type does not
apply to the timeframe you specified using the date selectors.

Apply New Server Type to Specific Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the server type of one host, use the dropdown in its row
under the :guilabel:`Server Type` column.

This action updates this host to have that server type for all
*existing* and *future* usage snapshots. The new server type does not
apply to the timeframe you specified using the date selectors.

Download a Usage Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To report on your MongoDB Enterprise usage:

1. (Optional) Clear :guilabel:`Redact sensitive information` if you
   want include all IP addresses, hostnames, organization names, and
   project names in the report.

#. Click :guilabel:`Download Report` to create a usage report.

#. Attach this report to the MongoDB email displayed on the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Usage` page.
