================================
Upgrade a Cluster to Use TLS/SSL
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The MongoDB server supports listening for both TLS/SSL encrypted and
unencrypted connections on the same TCP port. This allows upgrades of
MongoDB clusters to use TLS/SSL encrypted connections.

.. _upgrade-to-tls:

Procedure (Using ``tls`` Settings)
----------------------------------


.. important::
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/security-prereq-configure-ssl-clients.rst

To upgrade from a MongoDB cluster using no TLS/SSL encryption to one
using *only* TLS/SSL encryption, use the following rolling upgrade
process.

.. note::

   The procedures in this section use the ``tls`` settings/option
   (Available in MongoDB 4.2). For procedures using their ``ssl``
   aliases, see :ref:`upgrade-to-ssl`.
   
   The ``tls`` settings/options provide **identical** functionality
   as the ``ssl`` options since MongoDB has always supported TLS 1.0
   and later.

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the command-line option
   ``--tlsMode`` or the configuration file option :setting:`net.tls.mode` set to ``allowTLS``. 
   The ``allowTLS`` setting allows the node to accept both TLS/SSL
   and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming connections. Its connections to other servers
   do not use TLS/SSL. Include other :doc:`TLS/SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` [#systemstore]_ as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. 

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/default-bind-ip-security.rst

   For example:

   .. tabs::

      tabs:

        - id: commandline
          name: Command-Line Options
          content: |

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongod --replSet <name> --tlsMode allowTLS --tlsCertificateKeyFile <TLS/SSL certificate and key file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file> <additional options>

        - id: config
          name: Configuration File Options
          content: |

             To specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
             </reference/configuration-options>`, include the following
             settings in the file:

             .. code-block:: yaml

                net:
                   tls:
                      mode: allowTLS
                      PEMKeyFile: <path to TLS/SSL certificate and key PEM file>
                      CAFile: <path to root CA PEM file>

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Switch all clients to use TLS/SSL. See :ref:`ssl-clients`.

#. For each node of a cluster, use the :dbcommand:`setParameter`
   command to update the :parameter:`tlsMode` to ``preferTLS``.
   [#update-mode-alternative]_ With ``preferTLS`` as its
   :setting:`net.tls.mode`, the node accepts both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming
   connections, and its connections to other servers use TLS/SSL. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, tlsMode: "preferTLS" } )

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

   At this point, all connections should be using TLS/SSL.

#. For each node of the cluster, use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`tlsMode`
   to ``requireTLS``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ With ``requireTLS``
   as its :setting:`net.tls.mode`, the node will reject any non-TLS/non-SSL
   connections. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, tlsMode: "requireTLS" } )

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate TLS/SSL
   settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster uses
   TLS/SSL.

.. [#update-mode-alternative] As an alternative to using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command, you can also
   restart the nodes with the appropriate TLS/SSL options and values.

.. [#systemstore] 

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can use system SSL certificate stores
   for Windows and macOS. To use the system SSL certificate store, use:

   - :setting:`net.tls.certificateSelector` (or the command-line option
     ``--tlsCertificateSelector``) instead of
     :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` (or the command-line
     option``--certificateKeyFile``).
   
   - :setting:`net.ssl.certificateSelector` (or the command-line option
     ``--sslCertificateSelector``) instead of
     :setting:`net.ssl.PEMKeyFile` (or the command-line
     option``--sslPEMKeyFile``).

   When using the system SSL certificate store, OCSP (Online
   Certificate Status Protocol) is used to validate the revocation
   status of certificates.
