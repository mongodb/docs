"In :ref:`some circumstances <edge-cases>`, two nodes in a replica set may"
" *transiently* believe that they are the primary, but at most, one of "
"them will be able to complete writes with :writeconcern:`{ w: "
"\"majority\" } <\"majority\">` write concern. The node that can complete "
":writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` writes is the current "
"primary, and the other node is a former primary that has not yet "
"recognized its demotion, typically due to a :term:`network partition`. "
"When this occurs, clients that connect to the former primary may observe "
"stale data despite having requested read preference :readmode:`primary`, "
"and new writes to the former primary will eventually roll back."
