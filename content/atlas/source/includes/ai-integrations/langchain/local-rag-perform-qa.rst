   .. step:: Use {+avs+} to retrieve relevant documents.

      In this step, you create a retrieval function called
      ``get_query_results`` that runs a sample vector search query.
      It uses the ``get_embedding()`` function to create embeddings from the
      search query. Then, it runs the query to return semantically similar
      documents.

      To learn more, see :ref:`return-vector-search-results`.
