  .. note::
  
     This page describes text query capabilities for self-managed
     (non-Atlas) deployments. For data hosted on MongoDB, MongoDB also
     offers an improved full-text query solution, :atlas:`{+fts+}
     </atlas-search/>` and a vector search solution, :atlas:`{+avs+}
     </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`.

  **For data hosted on MongoDB**, MongoDB also offers a 
  full-text search solution, :atlas:`{+fts+} 
  </atlas-search/>`. If you frequently run case-insensitive regex 
  queries (utilizing the ``i`` option), MongoDB recommends {+fts+} 
  queries that use the :pipeline:`$search` aggregation pipeline stage. 
  
  :atlas:`{+fts+} queries </reference/atlas-search/searching/>` 
  significiantly improve the performance of text queries and offer more 
  options for customizing query parameters. To learn more, see 
  :atlas:`{+fts+} </atlas-search/>`. 
  
  **For self-managed deployments**, you can find information on our 
  regex capability below.
