msgid "This document provides a pattern for doing multi-document updates or \"multi-document transactions\" using a two-phase commit approach for writing data to multiple documents. Additionally, you can extend this process to provide a :ref:`rollback-like <2-phase-commits-rollback>` functionality."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:25
msgid "Operations on a single :term:`document` are always atomic with MongoDB databases; however, operations that involve multiple documents, which are often referred to as \"multi-document transactions\", are not atomic. Since documents can be fairly complex and contain multiple \"nested\" documents, single-document atomicity provides the necessary support for many practical use cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:32
msgid "Despite the power of single-document atomic operations, there are cases that require multi-document transactions. When executing a transaction composed of sequential operations, certain issues arise, such as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:36
msgid "Atomicity: if one operation fails, the previous operation within the transaction must \"rollback\" to the previous state (i.e. the \"nothing,\" in \"all or nothing\")."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:40
msgid "Consistency: if a major failure (i.e. network, hardware) interrupts the transaction, the database must be able to recover a consistent state."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:44
msgid "For situations that require multi-document transactions, you can implement two-phase commit in your application to provide support for these kinds of multi-document updates. Using two-phase commit ensures that data is consistent and, in case of an error, the state that preceded the transaction is :ref:`recoverable <2-phase-commits-rollback>`. During the procedure, however, documents can represent pending data and states."

#: ../source/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits.txt:54
