  Can |onprem| monitor itself?
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  Yes. You can use |onprem| to monitor the :doc:`backing MongoDB
  instances </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`
  that hold data for the |application| and Backup Daemon. Create a
  separate group for the backing instances.

  You **cannot**, however, use |onprem| to backup or automate the backing
  instances.

  |onprem| also provides built-in basic monitoring of all backing
  databases through :doc:`system alerts </core/system-alerts>`.
