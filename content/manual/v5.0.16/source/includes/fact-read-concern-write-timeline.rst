Consider the following timeline of a write operation Write\ :sub:`0` to
a three member replica set:

.. note::

   For simplification, the example assumes:

   - All writes prior to Write\ :sub:`0` have been successfully
     replicated to all members.

   - Write\ :sub:`prev` is the previous write before Write\ :sub:`0`.

   - No other writes have occured after Write\ :sub:`0`.
