.. dbcommand:: cloneCollectionAsCapped

   The :dbcommand:`cloneCollectionAsCapped` command creates a new
   :term:`capped collection` from an existing, non-capped collection
   within the same database. The operation does not affect the
   original non-capped collection.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { cloneCollectionAsCapped: <existing collection>, toCollection: <capped collection>, size: <capped size> }

   The command copies an ``existing collection`` and creates a new
   ``capped collection`` with a maximum size specified by the ``capped
   size`` in bytes.

   The name of the new capped collection must be
   distinct and cannot be the same as that of the original existing
   collection.

   To replace the original non-capped collection with a
   capped collection, use the :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command.

Behavior
--------

If the ``capped size`` is less than the size of the source collection,
then not all documents in the source collection will exist in the destination
capped collection.
