"If encryption is enabled, the default encryption mode that MongoDB "
"Enterprise uses is the ``AES256-CBC`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption "
"Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode) via OpenSSL. AES-256 uses a "
"symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. MongoDB "
"Enterprise also supports authenticated encryption ``AES256-GCM`` (or "
"256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode). FIPS mode "
"encryption is also available."

"If you use ``AES256-GCM`` authenticated encryption, do **not** make "
"copies of your data files. ``AES256-GCM`` requires that every process use"
" a unique counter block value with the key. If you use copied "
"``AES256-GCM`` encrypted data files to start a second "
":binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances may "
"use the duplicate counter block values, voiding confidentiality and "
"integrity guarantees."
