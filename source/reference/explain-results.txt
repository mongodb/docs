Explain Results

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.8

MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.explain()` method, the
:method:`cursor.explain()` method, and the :dbcommand:`explain` command
to return information on query plans and execution statistics of the
query plans.

The ``explain`` results present the query plans as a tree of stages.
Each stage passes its results (i.e. documents or index keys) to the
parent node. The leaf nodes access the collection or the indices. The
internal nodes manipulate the documents or the index keys that result
from the child nodes. The root node is the final stage from which
MongoDB derives the result set.

Stages are descriptive of the operation; e.g.

- ``COLLSCAN`` for a collection scan

- ``IXSCAN`` for scanning index keys

- ``FETCH`` for retrieving documents

- ``SHARD_MERGE`` for merging results from shards

Explain Output
--------------

The following sections presents a list of some key fields returned by
the ``explain`` operation.

.. note::

   - The list of fields is not meant to be exhaustive, but is meant to
     highlight some key field changes from earlier versions of explain.

   - The output format is subject to change between releases.

.. _queryPlanner:

``queryPlanner``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:data:`~explain.queryPlanner` information details the plan selected by
the :doc:`query optimizer </core/query-plans>`.

For unsharded collections, ``explain`` returns the following
information:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      "queryPlanner" : {
         "plannerVersion" : <int>,
         "namespace" : <string>,
         "parsedQuery" : {
            ...
         },
         "winningPlan" : {
            "stage" : <STAGE1>,
            ...
            "inputStage" : {
               "stage" : <STAGE2>,
               ...
               "inputStage" : {
                  ...
               }
            }
         },
         "rejectedPlans" : [ 
            <candidate plan 1>,
            ...
         ]
      }

.. data:: explain.queryPlanner

   Contains information on the selection of the query plan by the
   :doc:`query optimizer </core/query-plans>`.

   .. data:: explain.namespace

      A string that specifies the namespace (i.e.,
      ``<database>.<collection>``) against which the query is run.

   .. data:: explain.winningPlan

      A document that details the plan selected by the :doc:`query
      optimizer </core/query-plans>`. MongoDB presents the plan as a
      tree of stages; i.e. a stage can have an
      :data:`~explain.winningPlan.inputStage` or
      :data:`~explain.winningPlan.inputStages`.

      .. data:: explain.winningPlan.stage

         A string that denotes the name of the stage.

         Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For
         instance, an ``IXSCAN`` stage will include the index bounds
         along with other data specific to the index scan.

      .. data:: explain.winningPlan.inputStage

         A document that describes the child stage, which provides the
         documents or index keys to its parent. The field is present
         *if* the parent stage has only one child.

      .. data:: explain.winningPlan.inputStages

         An array of documents describing the child stages. Child
         stages provide the documents or index keys to the parent
         stage. The field is present *if* the parent stage has multiple
         child nodes. For example, stages for :ref:`$or expressions
         <explain-output-or-expression>` or :ref:`index intersection
         <explain-output-index-intersection>` consume input from
         multiple sources.

   .. data:: explain.rejectedPlans

      Array of candidate plans considered and rejected by the
      query optimizer. The array can be empty if there were no other
      candidate plans.

For sharded collections, the winning plan includes the
:data:`~explain.shards` array which contains the plan information for
each accessed shard. For details, see :ref:`explain-sharded-collection`.

.. _executionStats:

``executionStats``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The returned :data:`~explain.executionStats` information details the
execution of the winning plan.

You must run the explain in :ref:`executionStats
<explain-method-executionStats>` or :ref:`allPlansExecution
<explain-method-allPlansExecution>` verbosity mode in order for
``executionStats`` to be present in the results.

To include partial execution data captured during :ref:`plan selection
<query-plans-query-optimization>`, you must run in
``allPlansExecution`` mode.

For unsharded collections, ``explain`` returns the following
information:

.. code-block:: none

   "executionStats" : {
      "executionSuccess" : <boolean>,
      "nReturned" : <int>,
      "executionTimeMillis" : <int>,
      "totalKeysExamined" : <int>,
      "totalDocsExamined" : <int>,
      "executionStages" : {
         "stage" : <STAGE1>
         "nReturned" : <int>,
         "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : <int>,
         ...
         "inputStage" : {
            "stage" : <STAGE2>,
            ...
            "nReturned" : 0,
            "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,
            ...
            "inputStage" : {
               ...
            }
         }
      },
      "allPlansExecution" : [
         { <partial executionStats1> },
         { <partial executionStats2> },
         ...
      ]
   }

.. data:: explain.executionStats

   Contains statistics that describe the completed query execution for
   the winning plan. For write operations, completed query execution
   refers to the modifications that *would* be performed, but does
   *not* apply the modifications to the database.
      
   .. data:: explain.nReturned

      Number of documents that match the query condition.
      :data:`~explain.nReturned` corresponds to the ``n`` field
      returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionTimeMillis

      Total time in milliseconds required for query plan selection and
      query execution. :data:`~explain.executionTimeMillis` corresponds
      to the ``millis`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in
      earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.totalKeysExamined

      Number of index entries scanned.
      :data:`~explain.totalKeysExamined` corresponds to the
      ``nscanned`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in earlier
      versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.totalDocsExamined

      Number of documents scanned. In earlier versions of MongoDB,
      :data:`~explain.totalDocsExamined` corresponds to the
      ``nscannedObjects`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in
      earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStages

      Details the completed execution of the winning plan as a tree of
      stages; i.e. a stage can have an ``inputStage`` or multiple
      ``inputStages``.

      Each stage consists of execution information specific to the
      stage.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.allPlansExecution

      Contains *partial* execution information captured during the
      :ref:`plan selection phase <query-plans-query-optimization>` for
      both the winning and rejected plans. The field is present only if
      ``explain`` runs in ``allPlansExecution`` verbosity mode.

For sharded collections, ``explain`` also includes the execution
statistics for each accessed shard. For details, see
:ref:`explain-sharded-collection`.

.. _serverInfo:

``serverInfo``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For unsharded collections, ``explain`` returns the following
information for the MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: none

   "serverInfo" : {
      "host" : <string>,
      "port" : <int>,
      "version" : <string>,
      "gitVersion" : <string>
   }

For sharded collections, ``explain`` returns the
:data:`~explain.serverInfo` for each accessed shard. For details, see
:ref:`explain-sharded-collection`.

.. _explain-sharded-collection:

Sharded Collection
------------------

For sharded collections, ``explain`` returns the core query planner and
server information for each accessed shard in the ``shards`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "queryPlanner" : {
         ...
         "winningPlan" : {
            ...
            "shards" : [
               {
                 "shardName" : <shard>,
                 <queryPlanner information for shard>,
                 <serverInfo for shard>
               },
               ...
            ],
         },
      },
      "executionStats" : {
         ...
         "executionStages" : {
            ...
            "shards" : [
               {
                  "shardName" : <shard>,
                  <executionStats for shard>
               },
               ...
            ]
         },
         "allPlansExecution" : [
            {
               "shardName" : <string>,
               "allPlans" : [ ... ]
            },
            ...
         ]
      }
   }

.. data:: explain.winningPlan.shards

   Array of documents that contain :data:`~explain.queryPlanner` and
   :data:`~data.serverInfo` for each accessed shard.

.. data:: explain.executionStages.shards

   Array of documents that contain :data:`~explain.executionStats`
   for each accessed shard.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.8

The format and fields of the ``explain`` results have changed from
previous versions. The following lists some key differences.

.. _explain-output-collection-scan:
 
Collection Scan vs. Index Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the query planner selects a collection scan, the explain result
includes a ``COLLSCAN`` stage.

If the query planner selects an index, the explain result includes a
``IXSCAN`` stage. The stage includes information such as the index
key pattern, direction of traversal, and index bounds.

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``cursor`` field with the value of:

- ``BasicCursor`` for collection scans, and

- ``BtreeCursor <index name> [<direction>]`` for index scans.

For more information on execution statistics of collection scans versus
index scans, see :doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan`.

.. _explain-output-covered-queries:

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an index covers a query, MongoDB can both match the query
conditions **and** return the results using only the index keys; i.e.
MongoDB does not need to examine documents from the collection to
return the results.

When an index covers a query, the explain result has an ``IXSCAN``
stage that is **not** a descendent of a ``FETCH`` stage, and in the
:ref:`executionStats`, the :data:`~explain.totalDocsExamined` is ``0``.

In earlier versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``indexOnly`` field to indicate whether the index covered a query.

.. _explain-output-index-intersection:

Index Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an :doc:`index intersection plan </core/index-intersection>`, the
result will include either an ``AND_SORTED`` stage or an ``AND_HASH``
stage with an :data:`~explain.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
      "stage" : "AND_SORTED",
      "inputStages" : [
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         }
      ]
   }

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``cursor`` field with the value of ``Complex Plan`` for index
intersections.

.. _explain-output-or-expression:

``$or`` Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB uses indexes for an :query:`$or` expression, the result will
include the ``OR`` stage with an
:data:`~explain.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
      "stage" : "OR",
      "inputStages" : [
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         ...
      ]
   }

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``clauses`` array that detailed the indexes.

.. _explain-output-sort:

Sort Stage
``````````

If MongoDB can use an index scan to obtain the requested sort order,
the result will **not** include a ``SORT`` stage. Otherwise, if MongoDB
cannot use the index to sort, the ``explain`` result will include a
``SORT`` stage.

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``scanAndOrder`` field to specify whether MongoDB could use the index
order to return sorted results.
