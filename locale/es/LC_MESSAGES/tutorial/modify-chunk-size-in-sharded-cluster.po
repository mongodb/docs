"When the first :program:`mongos` connects to a set of :term:`config servers "
"<config database>`, it initializes the sharded cluster with a default chunk "
"size of 64 megabytes. This default chunk size works well for most "
"deployments; however, if you notice that automatic migrations have more I/O "
"than your hardware can handle, you may want to reduce the chunk size. For "
"automatic splits and migrations, a small chunk size leads to more rapid and "
"frequent migrations."
