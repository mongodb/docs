|service| provides the ability to manage user authentication and
authorization from all MongoDB clients using your own Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (|ldap|) server over |tls|. A single |ldaps|
(|ldap| over |tls|) configuration applies to all clusters in a project.

If you enable user authorization with |ldap|, you can create |ldap|
groups on the ``admin`` database by mapping |ldap| groups to MongoDB
roles on your |service| databases. To use |ldap| groups effectively,
:doc:`create additional projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` within
|service| to control access to specific deployments in your
organization, such as creating separate |service| projects for
development and production environments. You can then map an |ldap|
group to a role in the |service| project to provide access to the
desired deployment.

.. note::

   When you enable user authorization and an |ldap| user doesn't belong
   to any |ldap| group, |service| doesn't assign any database roles to
   the user. When you enable user authentication and you disable user
   authorization, |service| assigns MongoDB database roles to the
   |ldap| user.

If you have multiple departments with their own billing needs, alert
settings, and project members, consider creating a new set of 
:doc:`projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` or a new :doc:`organization 
</tutorial/manage-organizations>` for each department or business unit.

.. note::

   An explanation of |ldap| is out of scope for the MongoDB
   documentation. Please review :rfc:`RFC 4515 <4515>` and
   :rfc:`RFC 4516 <4516>`  or refer to your preferred |ldap|
   documentation.

Required Access
---------------

.. include:: /includes/required-atlas-roles-ldap.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

You must meet the following prerequisites to manage user authentication
and authorization using |ldap| in |service|:

- |service| cluster using MongoDB 4.0 or later.

- |ldap| server using |tls| that your |service| clusters can access
  over the network using either  :doc:`VPC </security-vpc-peering>` or
  VNet peering connection or the cluster nodes' public IP addresses.

- |ldap| group memberships embedded as an attribute for each user in
  the |ldap| entry for user authorization only.

Recommendation
--------------

For your |ldaps| service to access |service| clusters, MongoDB
recommends one of two configurations:

Using a |vpc| or VNet:

1. Run your |ldap| server in a |vpc| or VNet.
#. Establish a peering connection to your |service| project.
#. Use a public |fqdn| that resolves to the private IP address
   of your |ldap| server.

Using your data center:

1. Run your |ldap| server with a public |fqdn| that resolves to a
   public IP address.
#. Configure the |ldap| server to allow inbound access from the
   |service| cluster nodes' public IP addresses.

Considerations
--------------

Conflicts between LDAP Authorization and X.509 Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you enable LDAP authorization, you can't connect to your
{+database-deployments+} with users that authenticate with an
|service|-managed X.509 certificate.

After you enable LDAP authorization, you *can* connect to your
{+database-deployments+} with users that authenticate with an
:ref:`self-managed X.509 certificate <self-managed-x509>`. However, 
the user's Common Name in their X.509 certificate must match the 
Distinguished Name of a user who is authorized to access your 
database with LDAP.

Usernames
~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses the full Distinguished Name (DN) of users in your |ldap|
server as the |service| username. For example, an example |ldap| user
named ``ralph`` has the following username in |service|:

``cn=ralph,cn=Users,dc=aws-atlas-ldap-01,dc=myteam,dc=com``

.. _ldap-connection-string:

Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the administrator enables user authentication or both user
authentication and authorization with |ldap|, database users must
override the following parameters in the connection string for their
clients.

* ``authSource`` must be ``$external``

* ``authenticationMechanism`` must be ``PLAIN``

.. example::

   The following connection string for {+mongosh+}
   authenticates an |ldap| user named ``rob``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0-tijis.mongodb.net/test?authSource=%24external" \
        --authenticationMechanism PLAIN \
        --username cn=rob,cn=Users,dc=ldaps-01,dc=myteam,dc=com

To copy the connection string:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Locate the connection string.

      Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

   .. step:: Edit the connection string.

      Edit the string with your ``User DN`` and password.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/note-escape-special-chars-pwd.rst

Rolling Restart on Configuration Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you change your |ldap| configuration, |service| performs a rolling
restart of your cluster. This restart allows |service| to use the
correct settings to authenticate users.

Using Public IP Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use public IP addresses that refer to other internal or private
IP addresses using Network Address Translation to allow |service|
traffic to your |ldap| server. If you do this, be aware that
:doc:`certain activities <reference/faq/networking>` trigger a change
in the |service| cluster's public IP addresses.

If you allowed |ldap| server access based on public IP addresses,
changes to the |service| cluster's public IP address prevent |ldap|
access. To restore |ldap| access, add the new |service| cluster public
IP addresses to the |ldap| access list.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use both |ldap| and SCRAM authentication for the same
database user.
