Alert Conditions
----------------

When you configure alerts, you specify alert conditions and thresholds. 
Review the possible :ref:`alert conditions <alert-conditions>` for 
which you can trigger alerts related to your clusters.

Configure Alerts
----------------

To set which conditions trigger alerts and how users are notified, 
:doc:`/configure-alerts`. You can configure alerts at the organization 
or project level. |service| provides default alerts at the project 
level. You can clone existing alerts and configure maintenance window 
alerts.

Resolve Alerts
--------------

When a condition triggers an alert, |service| displays a warning symbol 
on the cluster and sends alert notifications. Resolve these
alerts and work to prevent alert conditions from occurring in the 
future. To learn how to fix the immediate problem, implement a 
long-term solution, and monitor your progress, see 
:doc:`/alert-resolutions`.

Alerts Workflow
---------------

When an :ref:`alert condition <alert-conditions>` is met, the following 
alert lifecycle begins:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: The alert condition is met.
   
      - For informational alerts like the 
        :alert:`User joined the organization` alert, |service| sends 
        notifications as soon as the condition is met. These alerts 
        don't appear in the {+atlas-ui+}. The informational alerts 
        workflow ends here.

      - Otherwise, |service| retrieves metrics at regular intervals
        based on :ref:`granularity
        <monitoring-storage-granularity>`. When the retrieved metrics
        indicate that an alert condition is met, |service| tracks the
        alert condition until it ends, or until it remains past the
        amount of time specified in the :guilabel:`send if condition
        lasts at least` field.

        .. note::

           If the alert condition ends between sampling periods, 
           |service| doesn't track the alert condition or send any 
           notifications.

   .. step:: The alert condition remains past the amount of time specified in the :guilabel:`send if condition lasts at least` field.
      
      |service| sends notifications. The alerts appear on the 
      :guilabel:`All Alerts` tab (organization alerts) or the 
      :guilabel:`Open Alerts` tab (project alerts).

   .. step:: The alert remains active until it resolves, or you disable or delete it.

      The following stages might occur:

      - You :ref:`acknowledge the alert <acknowledge-alert>`. |service| 
        sends no further notifications until either the acknowledgement 
        period ends, you resolve the alert condition, or you 
        unacknowledge the alert. If an alert condition ends during an 
        acknowledgment period, |service| sends a notification.

      - You :ref:`unacknowledge an alert <unacknowledge-alert>` that 
        you previously acknowledged. After you unacknowledge an active 
        alert, |service| resumes sending notifications at regular 
        intervals until the condition resolves or you delete, disable, 
        or re-acknowledge the alert.

      - You :ref:`disable the alert <disable-alert-setting>`. |service| 
        cancels active alerts related to the setting. A disabled alert 
        setting remains visible but grayed-out and you can later 
        re-enable it.

      - You :ref:`enable an alert <enable-alert-setting>` that you 
        previously disabled.

      - You :ref:`delete the alert <delete-alert-setting>`. |service| 
        cancels active alerts related to the setting. A deleted alert 
        setting does not remain visible.

      - The alert condition resolves. The alert appears on the 
        :guilabel:`All Alerts` tab (organization alerts) or the 
        :guilabel:`Closed Alerts` tab (project alerts).
