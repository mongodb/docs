Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system
snapshots to capture a copy of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. An
alternate procedure that uses :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create binary
database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the
alternate procedure.

See :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups` for a full higher level overview
backing up a sharded cluster as well as links to other tutorials that
provide alternate procedures.

Procedure
---------

In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup
up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each
shard in the cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can improve the quality
of the backup while minimizing impact on the cluster by taking the
backup from a secondary member of the replica set that provides each
shard.

1. Disable the :term:`balancer` process that equalizes the
   distribution of data among the :term:`shards <shard>`. To disable
   the balancer, use the :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` method in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, and see the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

   .. warning::

      It is essential that you stop the balancer before creating
      backups. If the balancer remains active, your resulting backups
      could have duplicate data or miss some data, as :term:`chunks
      <chunk>` may migrate while recording backups.

#. Lock one member of each replica set in each shard so that your
   backups reflect the state of your database at the nearest possible
   approximation of a single moment in time. Lock these
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in as short of an interval as possible.

   To lock or freeze a sharded cluster, you must:

   - use the :method:`db.fsyncLock()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
     shell connected to a single secondary member of the replica set
     that provides shard :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

   - Shutdown one of the :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`, to
     prevent all metadata changes during the backup process.

#. Use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to backup one of the :ref:`config servers
   <sharding-config-server>`. This backs up the cluster's
   metadata. You only need to back up one config server, as they all
   hold the same data.

   Issue this command against one of the config :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances or via the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongodump --db config

#. Back up the replica set members of the shards that you locked. You
   may back up the shards in parallel. For each shard, create a
   snapshot. Use the procedures in
   :doc:`/tutorial/backup-databases-with-filesystem-snapshots`.

#. Unlock all locked replica set members of each shard using the
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

#. Re-enable the balancer with the :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`
   method.

   Use the following command sequence when connected to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(true)
