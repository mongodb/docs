     * - ``OFF``

       - ``ON``

       - |mms| now manages the user.

         .. note:: 

            If there are any potential conflicts with other discovered
            users, you will be presented with the option to resolve
            conflicts.

     * - ``ON``

       - ``OFF``

       - |mms| no longer manages the user. This user is no longer
         visible in |mms|.

         .. warning::
            If :guilabel:`Ensure Consistent Set` is ``YES``, the user
            is deleted from all MongoDB databases |mms| currently
            manages for this group.

         .. note::
            If :guilabel:`Ensure Consistent Set` is ``NO``, |mms| no
            longer manages the users in that MongoDB database, but
            those users can be managed through a direct connection to
            that database.
