Control Results of Text Search with Weights
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

By default, the :dbcommand:`text` command returns matching documents
based on scores, from highest to lowest. For a ``text`` index, the
*weight* of an indexed field denotes the significance of the field
relative to the other indexed fields in terms of the score. The score
for a given word in a document is derived from the weighted sum of the
frequency for each of the indexed fields in that document.

The default weight is 1 for the indexed fields. To adjust the weights
for the indexed fields, include the ``weights`` option in the
:method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` method.

.. warning::

   Choose the weights carefully in order to prevent the need to reindex.

A collection ``blog`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1,
     content: "This morning I had a cup of coffee.",
     about: "beverage",
     keywords: [ "coffee" ]
   }

   { _id: 2,
     content: "Who doesn't like cake?",
     about: "food",
     keywords: [ "cake", "food", "dessert" ]
   }

To create a ``text`` index with different field weights for the
``content`` field and the ``keywords`` field, include the ``weights``
option to the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method. For
example, the following command creates an index on three fields and
assigns weights to two of the fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.ensureIndex(
                        { 
                          content: "text",
                          keywords: "text",
                          about: "text"
                        },
                        {
                          weights: {
                                     content: 10,
                                     keywords: 5,
                                   },
                          name: "TextIndex"
                        }
                      )

The ``text`` index has the following fields and weights:

- ``content`` has a weight of 10,

- ``keywords`` has a weight of 5, and

- ``about`` has the default weight of 1.

These weights denote the relative significance of the indexed fields to
each other. For instance, a term match in the ``content`` field has:

- ``2`` times (i.e. ``10:5``) the impact as a term match in the
  ``keywords`` field and

- ``10`` times (i.e. ``10:1``) the impact as a term match in the
  ``about`` field.
