Dashboard Filters
-----------------

Dashboard filters refine data across some or all of the charts in a dashboard.
They allow you to view a common subset of data across the dashboard's 
charts.

Dashboard ``Authors`` or ``Owners`` can:

- Select the fields that all dashboard users can use to filter data.
- Set initial default values for each filter. 
- Disable filtering for a specific chart. Disabling filtering
  exempts the chart from dashboard filters.

All dashboard users can filter based on values they specify and save their own
default filter values.

.. note::

   Users who open a dashboard using a public link can't save their own
   default filter values. |charts-short| reverts to the initial default 
   filter values after refreshing the page or starting a new session.

         pane is highlighted. 

If one or more dashboard filters affect the data a chart displays, an 
:icon-fa5:`filter` icon displays in the bottom left corner of that 
chart. Hover over the :icon-fa5:`filter` icon for a list of the 
filtered fields impacting that chart.

.. note::

   Dashboard ``Authors`` or ``Owners`` define filters using specific 
   data sources and can :ref:`disable filtering on specific charts
   <disable-filtering-on-chart>`. A single filter might not refine all charts
   if: 
   
   - The dashboard contains charts mapped to data sources that the filter 
     doesn't use.
   - A dashboard ``Author`` or ``Owner`` :ref:`disables filtering
     <disable-filtering-on-chart>` on some charts.

Example Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dashboard ``Author`` creates a dashboard with charts that contain
sales data for all of a company's customers. The author creates a 
filter allowing dashboard viewers to select which region(s) to 
display data from. Members of a sales team use this filter to display 
customer data only for the region(s) that they cover.

.. tip::

   You can use a prebuilt 
   :ref:`sample dashboard <add-sample-dashboard>` 
   to experiment with dashboard filters.

Filter Persistence Per Dashboard Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|charts-short| persists the following states for each dashboard viewer 
across reloads and user sessions: 

- which filters are enabled or disabled
- field values chosen to filter dashboards
- whether the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` is expanded or collapsed.

The changes that a dashboard viewer makes to filters don't affect other 
|charts-short| users. A viewer's saved filters are not affected when a 
dashboard ``Author`` or ``Owner`` modifies a filter's default values 
unless you :ref:`reset a filter <revert-dashboard-filters>`. 

.. note::

   |charts-short| doesn't persist filter states or values for users who
   open a dashboard using a public link. |charts-short| reverts to the 
   initial default filter values after refreshing the page or starting 
   a new session.

The :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` Pane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` icon indicates the number of active 
filters. Click the icon to expand the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` 
pane.

.. figure:: /images/charts/expand-filter-pane.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: An image of a dashboard. The :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` icon
         in the top right corner is highlighted.

The :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane displays a filter card for 
each field you can use to filter chart data. You can configure filter 
cards to use related fields from multiple data sources. When you update 
a field value, |charts-short| updates dashboard charts to display data 
that matches the field values you provide from all configured data 
sources.

In the following example, a dashboard ``Author`` creates filters on 
the ``genres`` and ``year`` fields from two sample movie datasets. The 
``Author`` sets default values for these fields to only display Science 
Fiction and History movies released in or after 1968. Dashboard 
``Viewers`` can provide their own values for the filterable fields to 
refine chart data based on their interests.

   :alt: An image of a dashboard. The :guilabel:`Edit Dashboard Filters`
         pane is highlighted. 

To learn about filtering options for each field data type, see 
:ref:`filter-tab`.

Expand or Collapse Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can expand or collapse dashboard filter cards by clicking 
:guilabel:`Show` or :guilabel:`Hide` on that card.

Disabled filters are automatically collapsed.

Enabled, collapsed filters are still applied to your charts.

.. _manage-dashboard-filters:

Manage Dashboard Filters
------------------------

Dashboard ``Authors`` and ``Owners`` can: 

- Add, edit, and delete dashboard filters.
- Disable dashboard filters on specific charts.

.. _add-dashboard-filters:

Add Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify fields that any dashboard users can filter data with. 
When you create a dashboard filter, you select related fields from the 
data sources that a dashboard chart uses. You can add dashboard filters 
based on any number of data sources that a dashboard chart uses.

Filter cards that use multiple data sources query each chart using 
the name of the field from the applicable data set.

.. example::

   Chart ``A`` uses data set ``A``. Chart ``B`` uses data set ``B``.
   Field ``A`` in data set ``A`` and field ``B`` in data set ``B`` 
   contain related information. You add both fields to a single 
   filter card.

   When a filter affects chart ``A``, the query for that chart uses 
   field ``A`` only. When a filter affects chart ``B``, the query for
   that chart uses field ``B`` only.

To add a dashboard filter:

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane on the desired 
   dashboard.
#. If a dashboard has no filers, click :guilabel:`Add Filters`. 
   Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Edit`.
#. Expand a data source that contains fields you want to add a filter 
   for.
#. Drag a field from the data source to the :guilabel:`+ filter` drop 
   zone.

   .. tip::
      
      To search for specific data fields, use the search bar at the
      upper left corner of the :guilabel:`Edit Dashboard Filters` pane.

   The data source name appears below the field name in the filter card.

#. (*Optional*) You can stack fields from other data sources. This 
   allows you to use a single filter to refine chart data from related
   fields from multiple data sources.

   .. note:: To stack fields in a filter card:

      - Each field must be of the same :ref:`data type <filter-tab>` as 
        the other fields on the filter card.

      - The filter card must not have another field from the selected 
        data source on it.

   To stack fields from other data sources:
   
   a. Expand another data source that contains a related field. 
   
   b. Drag a field from the data source to the 
      :guilabel:`+ another field` drop zone on the same filter card.

   The data source name appears below the field name and the other data 
   sources you selected fields from in the filter card.

   .. note::

      The field names might differ from each data source. The filter 
      card lists the field name you used to create the filter.

   Click :icon-fa4:`trash-o` next to a data source to remove its field
   from a filter card.
 
#. (*Optional*) Supply default values for the field in the filter card.
   All dashboard viewers see chart data that matches the default field 
   values you provide until they provide their own filter values or 
   disable the filter card.
   
   The filter card options are based on the data type of the field.
   To learn about filtering options for each field data type, see 
   :ref:`filter-tab`.

#. Use the toggle to disable or enable the filter card by default. If
   disabled, each dashboard user must enable the filter card to display
   data the filter refines.

#. Repeat for each field you want users to filter data by. 
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Filters`.

.. _edit-dashboard-filters:

Edit Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you create a dashboard filter, you can:

- Rename filter cards.
- Enable or disable filter cards.
- Add or remove fields.
- Stack fields from other data sources.
- Change the default field values.

To edit a dashboard filter:

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane on the desired 
   dashboard, then click :guilabel:`Edit`.
#. Make the changes you want to each filter card.
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Filters`.

.. _delete-dashboard-filters:

Delete Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane on the desired 
   dashboard, then click :guilabel:`Edit`.
#. Hover of the filter card you want to delete, then click 
   :icon-fa4:`trash-o`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Filters`.

.. _disable-filtering-on-chart:

Disable Dashboard Filters for a Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can disable filtering for a specific chart if you create at least 
one dashboard filter on the chart's data source. If you disable
filtering, the chart is exempted from all dashboard filters and 
highlighting. The default selection for all charts is 
:guilabel:`Filter or highlight`.

To disable dashboard filtering for a chart:

1. Hover over the chart on the dashboard to reveal four buttons in the 
   upper right corner of the chart.
#. Click the second button (for :guilabel:`Interactive Filters`) and
   select :guilabel:`Ignore` from the dropdown. 

.. note::
   
   You can't change this setting until you've created at least one 
   dashboard filter on the chart's data source.

Once you ignore filtering, the :guilabel:`Interactive Filters`
button icon on the chart changes for all users. Users with the 
``Viewer`` role can also see a tooltip if they click the 
:guilabel:`Interactive Filters` button,
which says ":guilabel:`The dashboard owner has not enabled filtering for
this chart`."

To reenable dashboard filtering for a chart:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Interactive Filters` button.
2. Select :guilabel:`Filter` from the dropdown.

Use Dashboard Filters
----------------------

Any user with at least the ``Viewer`` role on a dashboard *and* the data 
source backing a field can view the filter card and provide their own 
values for the filter.

.. _filter-dashboards:  

Filter Dashboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the dashboard data based on the filterable fields
that an ``Author`` or ``Owner`` configured. |charts-short| filters 
data based on default field values if the dashboard ``Author`` or 
``Owner`` configured them. Dashboard ``Authors`` or ``Owners`` can 
configure filter cards to use related fields from multiple data sources. 
You can provide your own field values to customize the data the charts 
display. 

To filter dashboard data based on filterable fields:

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane on the desired 
   dashboard.
#. If a filter card is disabled, click the toggle to enable it.
#. Modify the values of the provided fields to update the dashboard's 
   charts based on the filter values you provided.

   The filter card options are based on the data type of the field.
   To learn about filtering options for each field data type, see 
   :ref:`filter-tab`.

   .. note::

      If the filter card field is a ``String`` or ``ObjectId``, 
      |charts-short| only samples field values from the first data 
      source that was added to the filter. 

   Updating the filter value refines chart data based on all data 
   sources linked to the filter card.
   
The charts refresh immediately after you modify a field value.

.. _revert-dashboard-filters:

Revert Dashboard Filters to Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To revert a filter card to its default values, click :icon-fa4:`undo`.
