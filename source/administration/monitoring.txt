Monitoring is a critical component of all database administration. A
firm grasp of MongoDB's reporting will allow you to assess the state
of your database and maintain your deployment without crisis.
Additionally, a sense of MongoDB's normal operational parameters will
allow you to diagnose problems before they escalate to failures.

This document presents an overview of the available monitoring utilities
and the reporting statistics
available in MongoDB. It also introduces diagnostic strategies
and suggestions for monitoring replica sets and
sharded clusters.

Monitoring Strategies
---------------------

MongoDB provides various methods for collecting data about the state of
a running MongoDB instance:

- Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB offers :doc:`free Cloud monitoring
  </administration/free-monitoring>` for standalones and replica sets.

- MongoDB distributes a set of utilities that provides real-time
  reporting of database activities.

- MongoDB provides various :doc:`database commands
  </reference/command>` that return statistics regarding the current
  database state with greater fidelity.

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`_
  is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service for running, monitoring, and
  maintaining MongoDB deployments. 
  
- |mms-home| is a hosted service that monitors running MongoDB
  deployments to collect data and provide visualization and alerts
  based on that data.
  
- MongoDB Ops Manager is :products:`an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`
  that monitors running MongoDB deployments to collect data and provide
  visualization and alerts based on that data.

Each strategy can help answer different questions and is useful in
different contexts. These methods are complementary.

MongoDB Reporting Tools
-----------------------

This section provides an overview of the reporting methods distributed
with MongoDB. It also offers examples of the kinds of questions that
each method is best suited to help you address.

Free Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.0

MongoDB offers :doc:`free Cloud monitoring
</administration/free-monitoring>` for standalones or replica sets.

By default, you can enable/disable free monitoring during runtime using
:method:`db.enableFreeMonitoring()` and :method:`db.disableFreeMonitoring()`.

Free monitoring provides up to 24 hours of data. For more details, see
:doc:`/administration/free-monitoring`.

Utilities
~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB distribution includes a number of utilities that quickly
return statistics about instances' performance and activity. Typically,
these are most useful for diagnosing issues and assessing normal
operation.

``mongostat``
`````````````

:binary:`~bin.mongostat` captures and returns the counts of database
operations by type (e.g. insert, query, update, delete, etc.). These
counts report on the load distribution on the server.

Use :binary:`~bin.mongostat` to understand the distribution of operation types
and to inform capacity planning. See the :doc:`mongostat manual
</reference/program/mongostat>` for details.

``mongotop``
````````````

:binary:`~bin.mongotop` tracks and reports the current read and write
activity of a MongoDB instance, and reports these statistics on a per
collection basis.

Use :binary:`~bin.mongotop` to check if your database activity and use
match your expectations. See the :doc:`mongotop manual
</reference/program/mongotop>` for details.

.. _http-console:

HTTP Console
````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

Commands
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB includes a number of commands that report on the state of the
database.

These data may provide a finer level of granularity than the utilities
discussed above. Consider using their output in scripts and programs to
develop custom alerts, or to modify the behavior of your application in
response to the activity of your instance. The :method:`db.currentOp`
method is another useful tool for identifying the database instance's
in-progress operations.

``serverStatus``
````````````````

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command, or :method:`db.serverStatus()`
from the shell, returns a general overview of the status of the
database, detailing disk usage, memory use, connection, journaling,
and index access. The command returns quickly and does not impact
MongoDB performance.

:dbcommand:`serverStatus` outputs an account of the state of a MongoDB
instance. This command is rarely run directly. In most cases, the data
is more meaningful when aggregated, as one would see with monitoring
tools including |mms-home| and :products:`Ops Manager
</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`. Nevertheless, all
administrators should be familiar with the data provided by
:dbcommand:`serverStatus`.

``dbStats``
```````````

The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command, or :method:`db.stats()` from the shell,
returns a document that addresses storage use and data volumes. The
:dbcommand:`dbStats` reflect the amount of
storage used, the quantity of data contained in the database, and
object, collection, and index counters.

Use this data to monitor the state and storage capacity
of a specific database. This output also allows you to compare
use between databases and to determine the average
:term:`document` size in a database.

``collStats``
`````````````

The :dbcommand:`collStats` or :method:`db.collection.stats()` from the
shell that provides statistics that resemble :dbcommand:`dbStats` on
the collection level, including a count of the objects in the
collection, the size of the collection, the amount of disk space used
by the collection, and information about its indexes.

``replSetGetStatus``
````````````````````

The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command (:method:`rs.status()` from
the shell) returns an overview of your replica set's status. The :doc:`replSetGetStatus
</reference/command/replSetGetStatus>` document details the
state and configuration of the replica set and statistics about its members.

Use this data to ensure that replication is properly configured,
and to check the connections between the current host and the other members
of the replica set.

Hosted (SaaS) Monitoring Tools
``````````````````````````````

These are monitoring tools provided as a hosted service, usually through
a paid subscription.

.. _monitoring-standard-loggging:

Process Logging
---------------

During normal operation, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances report a live account of all server activity and operations
to either
standard output or a log file. The following runtime settings
control these options.

- :setting:`~systemLog.quiet`. Limits the amount of information written to the
  log or output.

- :setting:`~systemLog.verbosity`. Increases the amount of information written to
  the log or output. You can also modify the logging verbosity during
  runtime with the :parameter:`logLevel` parameter or the
  :method:`db.setLogLevel()` method in the shell.

- :setting:`~systemLog.path`. Enables logging to a file, rather than the standard
  output. You must specify the full path to the log file when adjusting
  this setting.

- :setting:`~systemLog.logAppend`. Adds information to a log
  file instead of overwriting the file.

.. note::

   You can specify these configuration operations as the command line
   arguments to :doc:`mongod </reference/program/mongod>` or :doc:`mongos
   </reference/program/mongos>`

   For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log --logappend

   Starts a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in :setting:`verbose
   <systemLog.verbosity>` mode, appending data to the log file at
   ``/var/log/mongodb/server1.log/``.

The following :term:`database commands <database command>` also
affect logging:

- :dbcommand:`getLog`. Displays recent messages from the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` process log.

- :dbcommand:`logRotate`. Rotates the log files for :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  processes only. See :doc:`/tutorial/rotate-log-files`.

.. _monitoring-log-redaction:

Log Redaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` running with :setting:`security.redactClientLogData`
redacts :doc:`messages </reference/log-messages>` associated with any given
log event before logging, leaving only metadata, source files, or line numbers
related to the event. :setting:`security.redactClientLogData` prevents
potentially sensitive information from entering the system log at the cost of
diagnostic detail.

For example, the following operation inserts a document into a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` running without log redaction. The :binary:`~bin.mongod`
has :setting:`systemLog.component.command.verbosity` set to ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.clients.insertOne( { "name" : "Joe", "PII" : "Sensitive Information" } )

This operation produces the following log event:

.. code-block:: text

   2017-06-09T13:35:23.446-04:00 I COMMAND  [conn1] command internal.clients
      appName: "MongoDB Shell"
      command: insert {
         insert: "clients",
         documents: [ {
               _id: ObjectId('593adc5b99001b7d119d0c97'),
               name: "Joe",
               PII: " Sensitive Information"
            } ],
         ordered: true
      }
      ...

A :binary:`~bin.mongod` running with :setting:`security.redactClientLogData`
performing the same insert operation produces the following log event:

.. code-block:: text

   2017-06-09T13:45:18.599-04:00 I COMMAND  [conn1] command internal.clients
      appName: "MongoDB Shell"
      command: insert {
         insert: "###", documents: [ {
            _id: "###", name: "###", PII: "###"
         } ],
         ordered: "###"
      }

Use :setting:`~security.redactClientLogData` in conjunction with
:doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest` and
:doc:`/core/security-transport-encryption` to assist compliance with
regulatory requirements.

Diagnosing Performance Issues
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/intro-performance.rst

.. _replica-set-monitoring:

Replication and Monitoring
--------------------------

Beyond the basic monitoring requirements for any MongoDB instance, for
replica sets, administrators must monitor *replication
lag*. "Replication lag" refers to the amount of time that it takes to
copy (i.e. replicate) a write operation on the :term:`primary` to a
:term:`secondary`. Some small delay period may be acceptable, but
significant problems emerge as replication lag grows, including:

- Growing cache pressure on the primary.

- Operations that occurred during the period of lag are not
  replicated to one or more secondaries. If you're using replication
  to ensure data persistence, exceptionally long delays may impact the
  integrity of your data set.

- If the replication lag exceeds the length of the operation
  log (:term:`oplog`) then MongoDB will have to perform an initial
  sync on the secondary, copying all data from the :term:`primary` and
  rebuilding all indexes. [#oplog]_ This is uncommon under normal circumstances,
  but if you configure the oplog to be smaller than the default,
  the issue can arise.

  .. note::

     The size of the oplog is only configurable during the first
     run using the :option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>` argument to
     the :binary:`~bin.mongod` command, or preferably, the
     :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` setting
     in the MongoDB configuration file. If you do not specify this on the
     command line before running with the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
     option, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will create a default sized oplog.

     By default, the oplog is 5 percent of total available disk space
     on 64-bit systems. For more information about changing the oplog
     size, see the :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`.

Flow Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-flow-control-general-desc.rst

See also: :ref:`replica-set-replication-lag`.

Replica Set Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replication issues are most often the result of network connectivity
issues between members, or the result of a :term:`primary` that does not
have the resources to support application and replication traffic. To
check the status of a replica, use the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` or
the following helper in the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status()

The :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` reference provides a more in-depth
overview view of this output. In general, watch the value of
:data:`~replSetGetStatus.members[n].optimeDate`, and pay particular attention
to the time difference between the :term:`primary` and the
:term:`secondary` members.


.. [#oplog]

   .. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-size.rst

Free Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB offers :doc:`free monitoring
   </administration/free-monitoring>` for standalone and replica sets.
   For more information, see :doc:`/administration/free-monitoring`.

Slow Application of Oplog Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-slow-oplog-log-message-footnote.rst

Sharding and Monitoring
-----------------------

In most cases, the components of :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
benefit from the same monitoring and analysis as all other MongoDB
instances. In addition, clusters require further monitoring to ensure
that data is effectively distributed among nodes and that sharding
operations are functioning appropriately.

.. seealso::

   See the :doc:`/sharding` documentation for more
   information.

Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`config database` maintains a map identifying which
documents are on which shards. The cluster updates this map as
:term:`chunks <chunk>` move between shards. When a configuration
server becomes inaccessible, certain sharding operations become
unavailable, such as moving chunks and starting :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances. However, clusters remain accessible from already-running
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Because inaccessible configuration servers can seriously impact
the availability of a sharded cluster, you should monitor your
configuration servers to ensure that the cluster remains well
balanced and that :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can restart.

|mms-home| and :products:`Ops Manager
</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>` monitor config servers and can
create notifications if a config server becomes inaccessible. See the
|mms-docs| and :opsmgr:`Ops Manager documentation
</application>` for more information.

Balancing and Chunk Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most effective :term:`sharded cluster` deployments evenly balance
:term:`chunks <chunk>` among the shards. To facilitate this, MongoDB
has a background :term:`balancer` process that distributes data to ensure that
chunks are always optimally distributed among the :term:`shards <shard>`.

Issue the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` or :method:`sh.status()`
command to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` by way of the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell. This returns an overview of the entire cluster including the
database name, and a list of the chunks.

Stale Locks
~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the lock status of the database, connect to a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. Issue the
following command sequence to switch to the ``config`` database and
display all outstanding locks on the shard database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.locks.find()

The balancing process takes a special "balancer" lock that prevents
other balancing activity from transpiring. In the ``config`` database,
use the following command to view the "balancer" lock.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.locks.find( { _id : "balancer" } )

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

   Starting in 3.4, the primary of the CSRS config server holds the
   "balancer" lock, using a process id named "ConfigServer". This lock
   is never released. To determine if the balancer is running, see
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-is-running`.

.. _storage-node-watchdog:

Storage Node Watchdog
---------------------

.. note::

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :ref:`Storage Node Watchdog
     <storage-node-watchdog>` is available in both the Community and
     MongoDB Enterprise editions.

   - In earlier versions (3.2.16+, 3.4.7+, 3.6.0+, 4.0.0+), the
     :ref:`Storage Node Watchdog <storage-node-watchdog>` is only
     available in MongoDB Enterprise edition.

The Storage Node Watchdog monitors the following MongoDB directories to
detect filesystem unresponsiveness:

* The :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` directory
* The ``journal`` directory inside the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` directory if
  :option:`journaling <mongod --journal>` is enabled
* The directory of :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>` file
* The directory of :option:`--auditPath <mongod --auditPath>` file

By default, the Storage Node Watchdog is disabled. You can only enable
the Storage Node Watchdog on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` at startup time by
setting the :parameter:`watchdogPeriodSeconds` parameter to an integer
greater than or equal to 60. However, once enabled, you can pause the
Storage Node Watchdog and restart during runtime. See
:parameter:`watchdogPeriodSeconds` parameter for details.

If any of the filesystems containing the monitored directories become
unresponsive, the Storage Node Watchdog terminates the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and exits with a status code of 61. If the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` is the :term:`primary` of a replica set, the
termination initiates a :term:`failover`, allowing another member to
become primary.

Once a :binary:`~bin.mongod` has terminated, it may not be possible to cleanly
restart it on the *same* machine.

.. topic:: Symlinks

   If any of its monitored directories is a symlink to other volumes, the
   Storage Node Watchdog does not monitor the symlink target.

   For example, if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses
   :setting:`storage.directoryPerDB: true <storage.directoryPerDB>` (or
   :option:`--directoryperdb <mongod --directoryperdb>`) and symlinks a
   database directory to another volume, the Storage Node Watchdog does
   not follow the symlink to monitor the target.

The maximum time the Storage Node Watchdog can
take to detect an unresponsive filesystem and terminate is nearly *twice* the
value of :parameter:`watchdogPeriodSeconds`.
