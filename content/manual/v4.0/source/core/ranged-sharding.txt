Ranged Sharding
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Range-based sharding involves dividing data into contiguous ranges determined
by the shard key values. In this model, documents with "close" shard key
values are likely to be in the same :term:`chunk` or :term:`shard`. This
allows for efficient queries where reads target documents within a contiguous
range. However, both read and write performance may decrease with poor shard
key selection. See :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`.

.. include:: /images/sharding-range-based.rst

Range-based sharding is the default sharding methodology if no other options
such as those required for :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding` or
:ref:`zones <zone-sharding>` are configured.

Shard Key Selection
-------------------

Ranged sharding is most efficient when the shard key displays the following
traits:

* Large :ref:`shard-key-range`
* Low :ref:`shard-key-frequency`
* Non-:ref:`shard-key-monotonic`


The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field ``X`` as the
shard key. If the values for ``X`` have a large range, low frequency, and
change at a non-monotonic rate, the distribution of inserts may look similar
to the following:

Shard a Collection
------------------

Use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method, specifying the full namespace
of the collection and the target :term:`index` or :term:`compound index`
to use as the :term:`shard key`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( "database.collection", { <shard key> } )

Shard a Populated Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you shard a populated collection:

- The sharding operation creates the initial chunk(s) to cover the
  entire range of the shard key values. The number of chunks created
  depends on the :ref:`configured chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>`.

- After the initial chunk creation, the balancer migrates these initial
  chunks across the shards as appropriate as well as manages the chunk
  distribution going forward.

Shard an Empty Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you shard an empty collection:

- With no :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified for the
  empty or non-existing collection:

  - The sharding operation creates a single empty chunk to cover the
    entire range of the shard key values.

  - After the initial chunk creation, the balancer migrates the initial
    chunk across the shards as appropriate as well as manages the chunk
    distribution going forward.

- With :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified for the
  empty or a non-existing collection (Available starting in MongoDB
  4.0.3),

  - The sharding operation creates empty chunks for the defined zone
    ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range
    of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution
    based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and distribution of
    chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding.

  - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
    distribution going forward.
