|service| automatically pauses all inactive ``M0`` {+clusters+} after 
60 days, disallowing any connections to it until you resume the
{+cluster+}. However, you can't :ref:`resume <resume-cluster>` the
{+cluster+} if it was running a version older than the latest release.
This page describes the process of restoring data from your ``M0``
{+cluster+} that was paused on a still supported version to a new
``M0`` {+cluster+} that will run the latest release version.

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, you need the following: 

- :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` role in |service|
- |mongodump| 
- |mongorestore| 

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
   
   .. step:: Deploy an ``M10`` or higher {+cluster+}.

      You must deploy an ```M10`` {+cluster+} with the same MongoDB
      :ref:`version <supported-mdb-versions>` as the paused ``M0``
      {+cluster+}. To learn more about deploying an ``M10`` or higher
      {+cluster+} with a specific MongoDB version, see
      :ref:`create-new-cluster`. If you use the {+atlas-ui+} to create
      the {+cluster+}, click :guilabel:`Advanced Settings` to
      :ref:`create-cluster-version`. If your paused ``M0`` {+cluster+}
      was running a MongoDB version that has since reached :abbr:`EOL
      (End of Life)`, you won't be able to deploy an ``M10`` {+cluster+}
      with the same version as the ``M0`` {+cluster+}.
      
      Wait until your {+cluster+} is deployed before proceeding to the
      next step.

      .. important:: 

         You must delete the ``M10`` {+cluster+} at the end of this
         procedure to avoid charges.

   .. step:: Access the available backups for the paused ``M0`` {+cluster+}.

      You can access the available backups for a {+cluster+} at the
      following |url|: 

      .. code-block:: shell 

         https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/<project_id>#/clusters/backup/<cluster_name>

      Where: 

      - ``project_id`` is the unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that
        identifies your project. 
    
      - ``cluster_name`` is the label that identifies your {+cluster+}. 

   .. step:: Restore data from the backup.
    
      a. For the snapshot that you want to restore data from, click 
         :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column. 
      #. In the :guilabel:`Restore` window, select the project that contains 
         the ``M10`` {+cluster+} from the :guilabel:`Target Project` dropdown 
         if it isn't already selected.
      #. In the :guilabel:`Restore` window, select the ``M10`` {+cluster+} 
         from the :guilabel:`Target Cluster` dropdown if it isn't already 
         selected.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

   .. step:: Upgrade your ``M10`` {+cluster+}. 
    
      You must upgrade your ``M10`` {+cluster+} to the latest supported MongoDB 
      version. To learn more, see :ref:`upgrade-major-MongoDB-version`. Wait for 
      the upgrade to complete before proceeding to the next step.

   .. step:: Export the data on the ``M10`` {+cluster+}.

      You can download a copy of the data on your ``M10`` {+cluster+} by
      using |mongodump|. To learn more, see :binary:`~bin.mongodump`.

   .. step:: Deploy an ``M0`` {+cluster+}. 

      To learn more, see :ref:`deploy-atlas-m0-cluster`.

   .. step:: Upload data to your ``M0`` {+cluster+}.

      You must upload the data that you downloaded from the ``M10``
      {+cluster+} to your ``M0`` {+cluster+}. You can use the
      |mongorestore| utility to restore the data into your ``M0``
      {+cluster+}. To learn more, see :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`. 

   .. step:: Delete the ``M10`` {+cluster+}.

      To learn more, see :ref:`terminate-atlas-cluster`. You must delete
      your ``M10`` {+cluster+} to avoid charges.
