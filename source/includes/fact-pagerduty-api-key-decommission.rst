   their |restapi| v1 key in October 2018. If you have a v1 key, you 
   can continue to use that key with |service|. All new PagerDuty keys 
   use their `REST API v2 
   <https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/rest-api-v2/rest-api/>`__,  
   but |service| does not support their v2 keys. If you don't have 
   their |restapi| v1 key, use the PagerDuty `Events API v1 
   <https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v1/overview/>`__ 
   instead.
