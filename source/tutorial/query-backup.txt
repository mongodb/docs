Query a Backup Snapshot
=======================

|mms| provides :opsmgr:`queryable backups </reference/glossary/#std-term-queryable-backup>`. This
functionality allows you to more quickly query specific backup
snapsnots. You can use the queryable backups to:

- Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.

- Compare previous versions of data against the current data.

- Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing data
  from multiple snapshots.

Considerations
--------------

Read-Only Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-duration.rst

Query Restrictions on the Queryable Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot perform the following operations on queryable snapshots:

- :manual:`Map-reduce operations </core/map-reduce>`.

- Queries that require disk usage, such as
  :manual:`running aggregation </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`
  with the ``allowDiskUse`` option to perform large sort
  operations.

Cannot Query Snapshots on Compressed File System Stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If snapshots are :ref:`compressed <add-filestore>` in a
:opsmgr:`file system store </reference/glossary/#std-term-File-System-Store>`,
the snapshot contents cannot be queried.

If you want to be able to query snapshots on a
:opsmgr:`file system store </reference/glossary/#std-term-File-System-Store>`, you need to
:ref:`create a new file system store <add-filestore>` with
compression disabled.

Connection Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections to these instances are over |tls-ssl|  and require
:manual:`x.509 authentication </core/security-x.509>`.  |mms| provides:

- An executable that creates a :ref:`tunnel <query-via-tunnel>` which
  handles the connection, including the client |tls-ssl| and the x.509
  authentication.

  Requests are routed through the tunnel. The tunnel ensures that
  the request is speaking to the correct :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` instance.

- x.509 certificates if you want to handle the connection details
  manually, including the |tls-ssl| and the x.509 authentication.

  Requests come in through the web server, which acts as a proxy to
  the :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Encrypted Snapshot Support for Local Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query encrypted snapshot using |onprem|
:doc:`local mode </tutorial/configure-local-mode>` if you
run MongoDB Enterprise 4.2.9 or later.

MongoDB Version Compatibility between Snapshot and Target Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query snapshots made from :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
or :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` with |csrs| running
MongoDB 3.2 or later.

For a queryable backup to succeed, the MongoDB instance that is the
target of a restore must run a compatible MongoDB version.
The following table lists the compatibility requirements for each
deployment type and MongoDB version.

Authentication and Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-out-of-scope-ssl-certs.rst

|onprem| needs a separate |pem| file to authenticate and authorize
use of Queryable Backup. This |pem| file:

- Must belong to the same platform user and group that owns the
  |onprem| process. On Linux, the ``mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms`` user
  and group owns this PEM file. On Windows, use the ``SYSTEM`` user.

- Must be readable by the platform user only.

- Must be saved in the same location on every |onprem| host if your
  deployment :doc:`uses high availability </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability>`.

- Must be different than the one used for |https| connections to
  |onprem| (:setting:`HTTPS PEM Key File`).

- Should use a key length greater than 512-bit. Using a 2048-bit RSA
  key is recommended.

- Should use a message digest stronger than ``sha1``, such as
  ``sha256``.

At minimum, the |pem| file consists of:

- A server certificate / key pair and
- A Certificate Authority certificate

These pairs are merged to create a |pem| file that Queryable Backup
can use. The pairs have the following requirements:

Certificate Authority Certificate
`````````````````````````````````

The |certauth| must sign any other certs and keys to be used in the
PEM file. The |certauth| can be one of the following:

- A private |certauth| (self signed; recommended for test purposes).

- An intermediate |certauth| certificate from a
  :wikipedia:`certificate provider
  </Certificate_authority#Providers>`.

- A |certauth| that your company security team issued.

Server Certificate / Key Pair
`````````````````````````````

The |certauth| that you selected must sign this server certificate.

The Common Name setting of the server certificate/key pair depends
on how many hosts your |onprem| deployment uses:

- For a single |onprem| host, the Subject Alternative Name (or,
  absent the |san-dns|, the Common Name) in the pair must match the
  |fqdn| of the |onprem| host.

- For high availability, the |san-dns| (or, absent the |san-dns|,
  the Common Name) in the pair must match the |fqdn| of the load
  balancer |url|.

Concatenate the server certificate / key pair and the certificate
chain to create the Proxy Server PEM Key.

PEM File Location
`````````````````

For the queryable backup host, you must specify the location of the
PEM file (which contains both a public key certificate and its
associated private key) using the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File`
setting. If you have not already set up the queryable backup
settings:

#. Click on :guilabel:`Admin` on the upper-right hand corner. From
   the :guilabel:`Admin` screen, click on :guilabel:`General`
   :icon:`arrow-right` :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`
   :icon:`arrow-right` :guilabel:`Backup`.

#. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Queryable Snapshot Configuration` and
   specify the :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` that the tunnel or
   clients can use to connect to the queryable :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`
   instance.

   If the file is encrypted, specify the
   :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File Password`.

#. *Optional.* Update other queryable snapshot settings as
   appropriate. For description of the settings, see
   :ref:`queryable-snapshot-settings`.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-proxy-requirements.rst

Open Ports for App Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The app server requires that ports 27700-27719 be open for
communication with queryable backup snapshots.

If you use a load balancer, it must pass the |tcp| connection
through the value in the :setting:`Proxy Server Port`.

To learn more about port requirements, see
:doc:`Firewall Configuration </reference/firewall-configuration>`.


Sufficient Workers for the |mms| Backup Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-workers.rst

Hostname
~~~~~~~~

The |fqdn| that hosts the :binary:`~bin.mongod` for the queryable
backup must match the one found the :guilabel:`Daemons` page. To
find that hostname, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link, then click
:guilabel:`Backup`, and then click :guilabel:`Daemons`.

Queryable Backup Requires Enterprise Downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |onprem| can connect to the internet, set
:guilabel:`Backup Versions Auto Download Enterprise Builds` to
**TRUE**. Queryable Backups require MongoDB Enterprise.

.. _query-via-tunnel:

Query Backup (Use Tunnel to Connect)
------------------------------------

.. note::

   The tunnel handles the security (|tls-ssl| and x.509 authentication)
   for connecting to the instance.

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-tunnel.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. note::

   To find the log file for the queryable backup
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, navigate to the following path in
   the head directory of the :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` host:

   .. code-block:: shell

      <daemon-hostname>:/<headDirectory>/queryable/<backupId>/mongod.log

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning/rotate-keys-with-aes256-gcm.rst

.. _query-via-manual-connection:

Query Backup (Handle |tls| Authentication Manually)
-------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-certificate-duration.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-manual.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.
