``mongokerberos`` Validation Tool
---------------------------------

Introduced alongside MongoDB 4.4, the :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos`
program provides a convenient method to verify your platform's Kerberos
configuration for use with MongoDB, and to test that Kerberos
authentication from a MongoDB client works as expected.

The :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` tool can help diagnose common
configuration issues, and is the recommended place to start when
troubleshooting your Kerberos configuration. See the
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` documentation for more information.

:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` is available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

Kerberos Configuration Debugging Strategies
-------------------------------------------

If you have difficulty starting or authenticating against
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` with :doc:`Kerberos
</core/kerberos>`:

- Ensure that you are running MongoDB Enterprise, not MongoDB Community
  Edition. Kerberos authentication is a MongoDB Enterprise feature
  and will not work with MongoDB Community Edition binaries.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-confirm-enterprise-binaries.rst

- Ensure that the canonical system hostname of the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance is a resolvable,
  fully qualified domain name. 
  
  On Linux, you can verify the system hostname resolution with the ``hostname
  -f`` command at the system prompt.

- On Linux, ensure that the `primary component of the service principal name (SPN)
  <http://web.mit.edu/KERBEROS/krb5-1.5/krb5-1.5.4/doc/krb5-user/What-is-a-Kerberos-Principal_003f.html>`_ 
  of the SPN is ``mongodb``. If the primary component of the SPN
  **is not** ``mongodb``,
  you must specify the primary component using
  :parameter:`--setParameter saslServiceName <saslServiceName>`. 

.. _kerberos-spn-matches-fqdn:

- On Linux, ensure that the `instance component of the service principal 
  name (SPN) <http://web.mit.edu/KERBEROS/krb5-1.5/krb5-1.5.4/doc/krb5-user/What-is-a-Kerberos-Principal_003f.html>`_ 
  in the
  :ref:`keytab file <keytab-files>` matches the canonical system hostname
  of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  instance. If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  instance's system hostname is not in the keytab file,
  authentication will fail with a ``GSSAPI error acquiring 
  credentials.`` error message.

  If the hostname of your :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance
  as returned by ``hostname -f``
  is not fully qualified,
  use :parameter:`--setParameter saslHostName
  <saslHostName>` to set the instance's fully qualified domain name when
  starting your :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
  
- Ensure that each host that runs a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance has ``A`` and ``PTR`` DNS records to
  provide both forward and reverse DNS lookup. The ``A`` record should
  map to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`'s FQDN.

- Ensure that clocks on the servers hosting your MongoDB instances and
  Kerberos infrastructure are within the maximum time skew: 5 minutes
  by default. Time differences greater than the maximum time skew
  prevent successful authentication.

Kerberos Trace Logging on Linux
-------------------------------

MIT Kerberos provides the ``KRB5_TRACE`` environment variable for
trace logging output. If you are having persistent problems with
MIT Kerberos on Linux, you can set ``KRB5_TRACE`` when starting your
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, :binary:`~bin.mongos`, or :binary:`~bin.mongosh` instances to
produce verbose logging.

For example, the following command starts a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
whose keytab file is at the default ``/etc/krb5.keytab`` path
and sets ``KRB5_TRACE`` to write to ``/logs/mongodb-kerberos.log``:

.. code-block:: bash

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/krb5.keytab \
       KRB5_TRACE=/logs/mongodb-kerberos.log \
       mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /data/db/mongodb.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI \
       --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --fork

Common Error Messages
---------------------

In some situations, MongoDB will return error messages from the GSSAPI
interface if there is a problem with the Kerberos service. Some common
error messages are:

``GSSAPI error in client while negotiating security context.``
  This error occurs on the client and reflects insufficient credentials
  or a malicious attempt to authenticate.

  If you receive this error, ensure that you are using the correct
  credentials and the correct fully qualified domain name when
  connecting to the host.

``GSSAPI error acquiring credentials.``
  This error occurs during the start of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` and reflects improper configuration of the system
  hostname or a missing or incorrectly configured keytab file.
