.. method:: db.collection.reIndex()

   The :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` drops all indexes on a
   collection and recreates them. This operation may be expensive for
   collections that have a large amount of data and/or a large number
   of indexes.

   .. warning::

      - For most users, the :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` operation
        is unnecessary.

      - Avoid running :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` against a
        collection in a replica set.

      - Do not run :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` against a
        collection in a sharded cluster.


Behavior
--------

.. |cmd-name| replace:: :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`

.. include:: /includes/note-reindex-impact-on-replica-sets.rst

|cmd-name| always builds indexes in the foreground due to the logic
described in :ref:`createIndexes-multiple-indexes`.

.. |limit| replace:: :limit:`Maximum Index Key Length <Index Key Limit>`

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Starting with MongoDB 4.0, :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` obtains a
global exclusive (W) lock and blocks other operations on the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` until it completes.

For MongoDB 3.6 and earlier, these operations
:method:`db.collection.reIndex()` obtains an exclusive (W) lock on the
database and blocks other operations on the database until finished.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.
