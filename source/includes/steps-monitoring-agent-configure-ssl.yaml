  If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the
  Monitoring Agent to use SSL. To configure the agent to use SSL, you
  must have a trusted CA certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's
  certificate.

  - pre: |
      In the agent's install directory, edit the
      ``monitoring-agent.config`` file to set
      :msetting:`sslTrustedServerCertificates` field to the path of a
      file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. For example
      if you would use the following command to connect through the
      :program:`mongo` shell:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --ssl --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem example.net:27017
  - pre: |
      Then you would set:
    language: ini
    code: |
      sslTrustedServerCertificates=/etc/ssl/ca.pem
