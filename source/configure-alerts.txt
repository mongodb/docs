Required Access

To manage all organization alerts, you must have the 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

The :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` role grants a 
limited authorization to manage billing alerts.

To manage project alerts, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. Users with 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves to the project 
as a ``Project Owner``.

      To use certain notification methods, you must first set up
      notification methods in the project's settings.
      If the notification method's value becomes invalid, |service|

      notification methods require set up in the project's

      organization's :guilabel:`Settings` menu, click
      :guilabel:`Add to Slack` in :guilabel:`Slack` Settings and
      log in to your preferred Slack workspace.
