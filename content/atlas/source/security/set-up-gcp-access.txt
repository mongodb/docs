Overview
--------

Some |service| features such as :ref:`Data Federation 
<atlas-data-federation>` require access to resources in your {+gcs+}
environment. To grant access in a secure manner, create or 
update a {+gcp+} `Service Account 
<https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview>`__
with access policy.  

Required Access
---------------

To configure {+gcp+} Service Account access, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner`
access to the project.

Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves to the 
project as a ``Project Owner``.

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| :doc:`account </index>`.

- An |service| ``M10+`` {+cluster+} hosted on {+gcp+}.
