Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification that describes how
to split files into chunks during storage
and reassemble them during retrieval. The driver implementation of
GridFS manages the operations and organization of
the file storage.

Use GridFS if the size of your file exceeds the BSON-document
size limit of 16 megabytes. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see the :manual:`GridFS Server manual page </core/gridfs>`.

and implementation:

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and descriptive information.
Buckets contain the following collections, named using the convention
defined in the GridFS specification:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the ``chunks``
and ``files`` collections, prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless
you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each
collection to ensure efficient retrieval of files and related
metadata. The driver only creates the GridFS bucket on the first write
operation if it does not already exist. The driver only creates indexes if
they do not exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information on
GridFS indexes, see the Server manual page on :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
pieces, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a unique file id, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from
memory or from a stream. The following diagram describes how GridFS splits
files when uploading to a bucket:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

.. _gridfs-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

Create a bucket or get a reference to an existing one to begin storing
or retrieving files from GridFS. Create a ``GridFSBucket``
instance, passing a database as the parameter. You can then use the
``GridFSBucket`` instance to call read and write operations on the files
in your bucket:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const db = client.db(dbName);
   const bucket = new mongodb.GridFSBucket(db);

Pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the ``create()`` method
to create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the
default name ``fs``, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const bucket = new mongodb.GridFSBucket(db, { bucketName: 'myCustomBucket' });

For more information, see the `GridFSBucket API documentation <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html>`__.

.. _gridfs-upload-files:

Upload Files
------------

Use the ``openUploadStream()`` method from ``GridFSBucket`` to create an upload
stream for a given file name. You can use the ``pipe()`` method to
connect a Node.js read stream to the upload stream. The
``openUploadStream()`` method allows you to specify configuration information
such as file chunk size and other field/value pairs to store as metadata.

The following example shows how to pipe a Node.js read stream, represented by the
variable ``fs``, to the ``openUploadStream()`` method of a ``GridFSBucket`` instance: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   fs.createReadStream('./myFile').
        pipe(bucket.openUploadStream('myFile', {
            chunkSizeBytes: 1048576,
            metadata: { field: 'myField', value: 'myValue' }
        }));

See the `openUploadStream() API documentation <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#openUploadStream>`__ for more information.

.. _gridfs-retrieve-file-info:

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the
``files`` collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information
about the file it refers to, including:

- The ``_id`` of the file
- The name of the file
- The length/size of the file
- The upload date and time
- A ``metadata`` document in which you can store any other information

Call the ``find()`` method on the ``GridFSBucket`` instance to retrieve
files from a GridFS bucket. The method returns a ``FindCursor`` instance
from which you can access the results.

The following code example shows you how to retrieve and print file metadata
from all your files in a GridFS bucket. Among the different ways that you can
traverse the retrieved results from the ``FindCursor`` iterable, the
following example uses the ``for await...of`` syntax to display the results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const cursor = bucket.find({});
   for await (const doc of cursor) {
      console.log(doc);
   }

The ``find()`` method accepts various query specifications and can be
combined with other methods such as ``sort()``, ``limit()``, and ``project()``.

For more information on the classes and methods mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `find() API documentation <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#find>`__
- `FindCursor API documentation <{+api+}/classes/FindCursor.html>`__
- :doc:`Cursor Fundamentals page </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/cursor>`
- :doc:`Read Operations page </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/>`

.. _gridfs-download-files:

Download Files
--------------

You can download files from your MongoDB database by using the
``openDownloadStreamByName()`` method from ``GridFSBucket`` to create a
download stream.

The following example shows you how to download a file referenced
by the file name, stored in the ``filename`` field, into your working
directory:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bucket.openDownloadStreamByName('myFile').
        pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./outputFile'));

.. note::

   If there are multiple documents with the same ``filename`` value,
   GridFS will stream the most recent file with the given name (as
   determined by the ``uploadDate`` field).

Alternatively, you can use the ``openDownloadStream()``
method, which takes the ``_id`` field of a file as a parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bucket.openDownloadStream(ObjectId("60edece5e06275bf0463aaf3")).
        pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./outputFile'));

.. note::

   The GridFS streaming API cannot load partial chunks. When a download
   stream needs to pull a chunk from MongoDB, it pulls the entire chunk
   into memory. The 255 kilobyte default chunk size is usually
   sufficient, but you can reduce the chunk size to reduce memory
   overhead.

For more information on the ``openDownloadStreamByName()`` method, see
its `API documentation <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#openDownloadStreamByName>`__.

.. _gridfs-rename-files:

Rename Files
------------

Use the ``rename()`` method to update the name of a GridFS file in your
bucket. You must specify the file to rename by its ``_id`` field
rather than its file name.

.. note::

   The ``rename()`` method only supports updating the name of one file at
   a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the
   file name from the bucket, extract the ``_id`` field from the files you
   want to rename, and pass each value in separate calls to the ``rename()``
   method.

The following example shows how to update the ``filename`` field to
"newFileName" by referencing a document's ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bucket.rename(ObjectId("60edece5e06275bf0463aaf3"), "newFileName");

For more information on this method, see the `rename() <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#rename>`__
API documentation.

.. _gridfs-delete-files:

Delete Files
------------

Use the ``delete()`` method to remove a file from your bucket. You must
specify the file by its ``_id`` field rather than its file name.

.. note::

   The ``delete()`` method only supports deleting one file at a time. To
   delete multiple files, retrieve the files from the bucket, extract
   the ``_id`` field from the files you want to delete, and pass each value
   in separate calls to the ``delete()`` method.

The following example shows you how to delete a file by referencing its ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bucket.delete(ObjectId("60edece5e06275bf0463aaf3"));

For more information on this method, see the `delete() <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#delete>`__
API documentation.

.. _gridfs-delete-bucket:

Delete a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

Use the ``drop()`` method to remove a bucket's ``files`` and ``chunks``
collections, which effectively deletes the bucket. The following
code example shows you how to delete a GridFS bucket:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bucket.drop();

For more information on this method, see the `drop() <{+api+}/classes/GridFSBucket.html#drop>`__
API documentation.
