  a. Select from the following options:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - :guilabel:`Format`
          - Select the format in which you want to receive the restore 
            files:

            :guilabel:`Individual DB Files` 
              Transfers individual MongoDB data files that |mms|
              produces directly to the target directory.

            :guilabel:`Archive`
              Transfers MongoDB data files in a single archive (``tar``
              or ``tar.gz``) that you must extract before restoring the
              data files to a working directory.

              This option displays only if the archive size can be
              calculated.

              With :guilabel:`Archive` delivery, you need sufficient
              storage space on the destination host for both the
              archive *and* the extracted files.

        * - :guilabel:`SCP Host`
          - Type the hostname of the host to receive the files.

        * - :guilabel:`SCP Port`
          - Type the port of the host to receive the files.

        * - :guilabel:`SCP User`
          - Type the username used to access to the host.

        * - :guilabel:`Auth Method`
          - Select whether to use a username and password or an SSH
            certificate to authenticate to the host.

        * - :guilabel:`Password`
          - Type the user password used to access to the host.

        * - :guilabel:`Passphrase`
          - Type the SSH passphrase used to access to the host.

        * - :guilabel:`Target Directory`
          - Type the absolute path to the directory on the host to
            which to copy the restore files.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Finalize Request`.

  c. If you use 2FA, |mms| prompts you for your 2FA code. Enter your
     2FA code, then click :guilabel:`Finalize Request`.
