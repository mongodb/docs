To remove a :term:`shard` you must ensure the shard's data is migrated
to the remaining shards in the cluster. This procedure describes how to
safely migrate data and remove a shard.

About this Task
---------------

- Creating, sharding, or moving collections while performing this
  procedure may cause interruptions and lead to unexpected results.

- Do not use this procedure to migrate an entire cluster to new
  hardware. To migrate, see
  :ref:`migrate-cluster-to-different-hardware`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-remove-shard-balance-order.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-remove-shard-with-link.rst

- You can safely restart a cluster during a shard removal process. If
  you restart a cluster during an ongoing :term:`draining` process,
  draining continues automatically after the cluster components restart.
  MongoDB records the shard draining status in the :data:`config.shards`
  collection.

Before you Begin
----------------

1. This procedure uses the :method:`sh.moveCollection()` method to move
   collections off of the removed shard. Before you begin this
   procedure, review the ``moveCollection`` :ref:`considerations
   <moveCollection-method-considerations>` and :ref:`requirements
   <moveCollection-method-reqs>` to understand the command behavior.

#. To remove a shard, first connect to one of the cluster's
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Ensure the balancer is enabled

      To migrate data from a shard, the :term:`balancer` process must
      be enabled. To check the balancer state, use the
      :method:`sh.getBalancerState()` method:
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
         
         sh.getBalancerState()

      If the operation returns ``true``, the balancer is enabled.

      If the operation returns ``false``, see
      :ref:`sharding-balancing-enable`.

   .. step:: Determine the name of the shard to remove
      
      To find the name of the shard, run the :dbcommand:`listShards` command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { listShards: 1 } )

      The ``shards._id`` field contains the shard name.

   .. step:: Remove chunks from the shard

      Run the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command for the shard you want to
      remove:
      
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { removeShard: "<shardName>" } )
      
      .. note::
         
         .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-remove-shard.rst

      The ``removeShard`` operation returns:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {
            "msg" : "draining started successfully",
            "state" : "started",
            "shard" : "<shardName>",
            "note" : "you need to drop or movePrimary these databases", 
            "dbsToMove" : [
               "db1",
               "db2"
            ],
            "ok" : 1,
            "operationTime" : Timestamp(1575398919, 2),
            "$clusterTime" : {
               "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1575398919, 2),
               "signature" : {
                  "hash" : BinData(0,"Oi68poWCFCA7b9kyhIcg+TzaGiA="),
                  "keyId" : NumberLong("6766255701040824328")
               }
            }
         }

      The shard enters the ``draining`` state and the balancer begins
      migrating chunks from the removed shard to other shards in the
      cluster. These migrations happens slowly to avoid severe impact on
      the overall cluster. Depending on your network capacity and the
      amount of data, this operation can take from a few minutes to
      several days to complete.

      .. tip::

         While the shard is in the ``draining`` state, you can use the
         :ref:`reshardCollection
         <reshardCollection-redistribute-data>` command to redistribute
         data off of the removed shard.
         
         Moving data with ``reshardCollection`` can be faster than
         waiting for the balancer to migrate chunks. The cluster ensures
         that data is not placed on any draining shards. You can't run
         ``moveCollection`` and ``reshardCollection`` operations
         simultaneously.

   .. step:: List sharded collection namespaces

      To return a list of sharded collection namespaces, use the
      :pipeline:`$shardedDataDistribution` stage and project the ``ns``
      field:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use admin

         db.aggregate(
            [
               { $shardedDataDistribution: { } },
               { $project: { ns: 1 } }
            ]
         )

      Record the output to reference later in this tutorial.

   .. step:: List all databases in the cluster

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { listDatabases: 1, nameOnly: true } )

   .. step:: Move collections off of the shard

      **For each database in the cluster, excluding admin and config**,
      perform these steps:

      a. List the database collections

         List the collections in the database, omitting the following
         types of collections:

         - Internal collections that support {+csfle-abbrev+}
         - System collections
         - Time series collections
         - Views

         .. code-block:: javascript
         
            use <databaseName>

            db.getCollectionInfos(
               {
                  $and: [
                     { type: { $nin: [ "view", "timeseries" ] } },
                     { name: { $not: { $regex: "^system\." } } },
                     { name: { $not: { $regex: "^enxcol_\..*(\.esc|\.ecc|\.ecoc|\.ecoc\.compact)$" } } }
                  ]
               },
               { nameOnly: true }
            )

      #. Move necessary collections

         For each collection returned by ``getCollectionInfos()``
         perform the following steps.

         .. note::

            Only one ``moveCollection`` operation can be in progress
            at a time. Complete all sub-steps before moving on to the
            next collection.

         i. Determine whether the collection needs to be moved.

            Run the :pipeline:`$collStats` aggregation stage and
            project the ``ns`` and ``shard`` fields:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.<collName>.aggregate(
                  [
                     {
                        $collStats: { }
                     },
                     {
                        $project: {
                           ns: 1,
                           shard: 1
                        }
                     }
                  ]
               )

            If any of the following criteria are met, skip the
            collection and return to step ``i`` for the next
            collection in the database:

            - The ``ns`` field is present in the
              ``$shardedDataDistribution`` output from step 4.

            - The ``shard`` field is not the shard being removed.

            If neither of the preceding criteria are met, continue to
            step ``ii`` for the current collection.

         #. Move the collection.

            To move the collection, run :method:`sh.moveCollection()`
            on the collection:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               sh.moveCollection( "<namespace>.<collection>", "<ID of recipient shard>" )

            .. note::

               ``moveCollection`` fails if you run the command on a
               namespace that is sharded. If you receive this error
               message, ignore it and return to step ``i`` for the
               next collection.

         #. Return to step ``i`` for each collection in the database.

      #. Repeat the procedure for other databases

         Repeat step 6, :guilabel:`Move collections off of the shard`
         (and sub-steps) for each database in the cluster.

      #. Return to step ``1`` to check that there are no remaining unsharded collections
         on the draining shard. 

   .. step:: Change primary shard

      Run the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.printShardingStatus()

      In the ``databases`` section of the command output, check the
      ``database.primary`` field. If the ``primary`` field is the
      removed shard, you must move that database's primary to a
      different shard.

      To change a database's primary shard, run the :dbcommand:`movePrimary`
      command.

      .. warning::

         When you run ``movePrimary``, any collections that were not
         moved in the :guilabel:`Move collections off of the shard` step
         are unavailable during the ``movePrimary`` process.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand(
            {
               movePrimary: <dbName>,
               to: <shardName>
            }
         )

   .. step:: Check migration status

      To check the progress of the migration, run
      :dbcommand:`removeShard` from the ``admin`` database again:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { removeShard: "<shardName>" } )

      In the output, the ``remaining`` field includes these fields:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 10 90

         * - Field
           - Description

         * - ``chunks``
           - Number of chunks currently remaining on the shard

         * - ``dbs``
           - Number of databases whose :ref:`primary shard
             <primary-shard>` is the shard. These databases are specified in
             the ``dbsToMove`` output field.

         * - ``jumboChunks``

           - Of the total number of ``chunks``, the number that are
             :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`.

             If ``jumboChunks`` is greater than 0, wait until only the
             ``jumboChunks`` remain on the shard. Once only the
             ``jumbo`` chunks remain, you must manually clear the jumbo
             flag before the draining can complete. See
             :ref:`clear-jumbo-flag`.

             After the ``jumbo`` flag clears, the balancer can migrate these
             chunks. For details on the migration procedure, see 
             :ref:`chunk-migration-procedure`.

      Continue checking the status of the ``removeShard`` command until the
      number of chunks remaining is 0. 

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { removeShard: "<shardName>" } )

   .. step:: Finalize shard removal

      To finalize the shard removal process, re-run the ``removeShard``
      command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { removeShard: <shardName> } )

      .. note:: DDL Operations
      
         If you remove a shard while your cluster executes a DDL
         operation (an operation that modifies a collection such as
         :dbcommand:`reshardCollection`), the ``removeShard`` operation
         runs after the concurrent DDL operation finishes.

      If the shard is removed, the command output resembles the
      following:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         {
            msg: 'removeshard completed successfully',
            state: 'completed',
            shard: '<shardName>',
            ok: 1,
            '$clusterTime': {
               clusterTime: Timestamp({ t: 1721941519, i: 7 }),
               signature: {
                  hash: Binary.createFromBase64('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=', 0),
                  keyId: Long('0')
               }
            },
            operationTime: Timestamp({ t: 1721941519, i: 7 })
         }
