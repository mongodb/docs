ref: fts-field-search-analyzer
content: |

  Specifies the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to apply to query 
  text before searching the text. If you omit this field, the index 
  inherits an analyzer by default in the following order: 
       
  a. The ``analyzer`` option for this field if specified.
  
  b. The ``searchAnalyzer`` option for the :ref:`index
     <ref-index-definitions>` if specified. 
  
  c. The ``analyzer`` option for the :ref:`index
     <ref-index-definitions>` if specified. 
  
  d. The ``lucene.standard`` analyzer.

  Required if :guilabel:`Dynamic Mapping` in the :guilabel:`Index
  Configurations` section is disabled. 
  
  Defining your own field mappings is recommended for advanced
  users only.
  
  Specify the fields to index. To add the fields, you must do the
  following: 
  
  a. Click :guilabel:`Add Field` to open the :guilabel:`Add Field
     Mapping` window. 
     
  #. Specify the following information about the field:
        
     - :guilabel:`Field name` - Name of the field to index. 
     - :guilabel:`Data Type Configuration` - Field data type. To learn 
       more about the supported data types and their options, see 
       :ref:`bson-data-chart`.
     - :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` - Static or dynamic mapping to 
       use for fields of :ref:`document <bson-data-types-document>` and
       :ref:`embeddedDocument <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>`
       types. If you disable dynamic mapping, the data in the field
       isn't automatically indexed. 

  #. Click :guilabel:`Add` to add the field.

     You can, optionally, click the ellipses (:guilabel:`...`) icon for
     the field in the :guilabel:`Actions` column to do the following:

     - Modify the settings for the field by clicking :guilabel:`Edit`.
