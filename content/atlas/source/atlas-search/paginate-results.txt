On {+clusters+} running MongoDB 7.0.5+, use |fts|
to retrieve your :pipeline:`$search` query results sequentially after or
before a reference point. Use the :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` or
``searchBefore`` options to traverse results in-order and build
"Next Page" and "Previous Page" functions in your application.

.. _fts-paginate-results-usage:

Usage
-----

To retrieve paginated results, perform the following steps: 

a. :ref:`Create an index <ref-create-index>` on the fields you want to query.
#. Run a :pipeline:`$search` query that returns a point of reference. To
   learn more, see :ref:`paginate-results-search-sequence-token`.
#. Use the point of reference in your subsequent :pipeline:`$search`
   query to retrieve the next or previous set of documents in the
   results. 
   
   - To learn more about retrieving results to build a "Next
     Page" function, see :ref:`paginate-results-search-after`.
   - To learn more about retrieving results to build a "Previous Page"
     function, see :ref:`paginate-results-search-before`.
   - To jump to a page in your results, combine :pipeline:`$skip` and
     :pipeline:`$limit` with :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` or
     ``searchBefore`` options. For example, to jump to results from Page
     3 to Page 5, with 10 results per page, do the following: 

     a. Retrieve results using ``searchAfter`` with the point of
        reference for the last result on Page 3 (Result 30).
     #. Use :pipeline:`$skip` to skip the 10 results on Page 4 (Results
        31-40) and :pipeline:`$limit` to limit the results to 10
        documents. 
     #. Return results for Page 5 (Results 41-50).

     Here, using :pipeline:`$skip` with the ``searchAfter`` option optimizes
     the query to skip only 1 page of results (10 documents). By comparison,
     if you use ``$skip`` without the :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter``
     option, the query skips 4 pages of results (40 documents). To learn
     more, see :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-skip-query`.

.. _fts-paginate-results-considerations:

Considerations 
--------------

A tie occurs when you sort on a field for which multiple documents
have identical values. MongoDB doesn't guarantee ordering of tied
query results, which can lead to duplication and inconsistency when
you use ``searchAfter`` and ``searchBefore``. Apply the following
principles to reduce relevance score ties:

- Sort your query by a unique field to prevent relevance score ties. For
  an example, see :ref:`fts-sort-score-unique-field`. 
- If you want to primarily sort by a non-unique field, add a secondary
  sort clause on a unique field to serve as a tiebreaker. 

Updating or deleting documents between queries might cause
inconsistencies in result order. Apply the following principles
to support deterministic search behavior: 

- Sort your query results by an immutable field, such as ``_id``. |fts|
  reflects the updates you make to your collection between initial and
  subsequent queries. If you sort by a mutable field such as
  ``updated_time`` and you update your collection between your first and
  second queries, |fts| might order the same documents differently.

.. _paginate-results-search-sequence-token:

Retrieve Point of Reference
---------------------------

To retrieve query results at a certain point, you must provide the point
of reference in your :pipeline:`$search` query. You can retrieve the
reference point by using the :expression:`$meta` keyword
``searchSequenceToken`` in the :pipeline:`$project` stage after your
:pipeline:`$search` stage.

   [{
     "$search": {

         <operator-specification>|<collector-specification>
       }
       "sort": {
         "score": {
           "$meta": "searchScore"
         }
       },
       ...
     },
     {
       "$project": {
          "paginationToken" : { "$meta" : "searchSequenceToken" }
     },
     ...
   }]

.. _search-sequence-token-output:

Output 
~~~~~~

The ``searchSequenceToken`` generates a Base64-encoded token for each
document in the results. The length of the token increases with the number
of fields specified in the :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option of your query.
The token isn't tied to a snapshot of the database. 

The documents in the results are sorted in the default order, unless you
specify the ``sort`` option in your query. To learn about sorting your
results, see :ref:`sort-ref`. 

.. _paginate-results-search-after:

Search After a Specific Point of Reference 
------------------------------------------

To search after a reference point, you must specify the reference point
in your :pipeline:`$search` query by using the ``searchAfter`` option with
the token generated by ``searchSequenceToken``. You can use the token
generated by ``searchSequenceToken`` only when you rerun the
:pipeline:`$search` query for which ``searchSequenceToken`` generated
the token. The semantics (search fields and values) of the subsequent 
:pipeline:`$search` query in which you use the token must be identical
to the query for which ``searchSequenceToken`` generated the token. 

You can use the ``searchAfter`` option to build a "Next Page" function
in your application. For a demonstration of this, see the :ref:`example
<search-before-egs>` on this page.

     },
     "$project": {
       "paginationToken" : { "$meta" : "searchSequenceToken" }
     },
     ...
   }

.. _search-after-output:

Output 
~~~~~~

|fts| returns the documents in the results after the specified token.
|fts| returns the generated tokens for the documents in the results
because you specified the ``searchSequenceToken`` in the
:pipeline:`$project` stage after the :pipeline:`$search` stage (as 
shown in line 11). These tokens can be used as a reference point for
another query with the same semantics.

The documents in the results are sorted in the default order, unless you
specify the ``sort`` option in your query. To learn about sorting your
results, see :ref:`sort-ref`. 

.. _paginate-results-search-before:

Search Before a Specific Point of Reference 
-------------------------------------------

To search before a reference point, you must specify the reference point 
in your :pipeline:`$search` query by using the ``searchBefore`` option
with the token generated by ``searchSequenceToken``. You can use the token
generated by ``searchSequenceToken`` only when you rerun the
:pipeline:`$search` query for which ``searchSequenceToken`` generated
the token. The semantics (search fields and values) of the subsequent 
:pipeline:`$search` query in which you use the token must be identical
to the query for which ``searchSequenceToken`` generated the token. 

You can build a "Previous Page" function in your application using the
``searchBefore`` option. To build a "Previous Page" function, combine
the following:

- :pipeline:`$search` stage with ``searchBefore`` option
- :pipeline:`$limit` stage 
- :manual:`toArray() </reference/method/cursor.toArray/>` and
  ``reverse()`` methods.  
  
For a demonstration of this, see the ``searchBefore`` query :ref:`examples
<search-before-egs>` on this page.

``searchBefore`` Syntax

   {

     },
     "$project": {
       "paginationToken" : { "$meta" : "searchSequenceToken" }
     },
     ...
   }

.. _search-before-output:

``searchBefore`` Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fts| returns documents in the results preceding the specified token in
reverse order. |fts| also returns the generated tokens for the documents
in the results because you specified the ``searchSequenceToken`` in the
:pipeline:`$project` stage after the :pipeline:`$search` stage (as
shown in line 11). These tokens can be used as a reference point for
another query with the same semantics.

.. _search-before-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following examples use the :ref:`sample-mflix.movies <sample-mflix>`
collection, which has a |fts| index named ``default`` with dynamic
mappings. If you load the collection and create the index, you can run
the following queries against the collection.

The queries demonstrate how to retrieve a point of reference, which you
then use in the subsequent queries to retrieve additional results for
the same term before and after the specified point of reference. 

This examples demonstrate how to do the following tasks:

1. :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-por-query`
2. :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-after-query`
3. :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-before-query`
4. :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-skip-query`
5. :ref:`sequential-pagination-tutorial-facet-query`

.. note:: 

   By default, |fts| sorts the documents in the results by the relevance
   score of the documents. If multiple documents in the results have
   identical scores, |fts| returns arbitrarily ordered results. To
   return documents in a determined order, the queries specify a unique 
   field, ``released``, to sort the results.
