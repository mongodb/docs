AI features in |compass-short| are powered by Generative AI
(Gen AI), and may give inaccurate responses. See our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ 
for more information about Gen AI in MongoDB products.

AI Features in Compass
----------------------

The :ref:`intelligent assistant <compass-ai-assistant>` is an AI-powered tool 
designed for integrated, tailored MongoDB guidance in |compass-short|.

You can also :ref:`query data with natural language <compass-query-natural-language>`
in |compass-short|. |compass-short| uses AI to generate filter queries and 
aggregations based on the prompts you provide.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

AI features in |compass-short| currently use the 
`Azure OpenAI Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft.  This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you use AI features in |compass-short|, the following information may be 
sent to MongoDB's backend and/or the third party AI provider.

For :ref:`natural language querying <compass-query-natural-language>`:

- The full text of your natural language prompt.
- The schema of the collection you are querying, 
  including database name, collection name, field names, and types. 
- Sample field values. These are only used if the ``Enable sending sample field values``
  setting is enabled in :ref:`Compass settings <compass-settings-reference>`. 
  This is an optional setting to improve the quality of recommendations. This 
  setting is off by default.

For the :ref:`intelligent assistant <compass-ai-assistant>`:

- Explain plan metadata. The "Interpret for me" button uses Explain plan metadata,
  including the original query, to process requests. The assistant prompts a
  user to confirm that they're okay with this before proceeding with the request
  each time.
- Sanitized connection information. The "Debug for me" button passes sanitized 
  connection information and error messages to the assistant.

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send unsanitized 
connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents from your databases.
