================================
Use MongoDB with SSL Connections
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document outlines the use and operation of MongoDB's SSL
support. SSL allows MongoDB clients to support encrypted connections
to :program:`mongod` instances.

.. note:: The `default distribution of MongoDB`_ does **not** contain
   support for SSL. To use SSL, you must either build MongoDB locally
   passing the "``--ssl``" option to ``scons`` or use `MongoDB
   Enterprise`_.

These instructions outline the process for getting started with SSL
and assume that you have already installed a build of MongoDB that
includes SSL support and that your client driver supports SSL.

.. _`MongoDB Enterprise`: http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-enterprise

Configure ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` for SSL
-------------------------------------------

Combine SSL Certificate and Key File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can use SSL, you must have a :file:`.pem` file that
contains the public key certificate and private key. MongoDB can use
any valid SSL certificate. To generate a self-signed certificate and
private key, use a command that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /etc/ssl/
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out mongodb-cert.crt -keyout mongodb-cert.key

This operation generates a new, self-signed certificate with no
passphrase that is valid for 365 days. Once you have the certificate,
concatenate the certificate and private key to a :file:`.pem` file, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   cat mongodb-cert.key mongodb-cert.crt > mongodb.pem

.. _ssl-mongod-ssl-cert-key:

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with SSL Certificate and Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use SSL in your MongoDB deployment, include the following run-time
options with :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`:

- :setting:`sslOnNormalPorts`

- :setting:`sslPEMKeyFile` with the :file:`.pem` file that contains the
  SSL certificate and key.

Consider the following syntax for :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile <pem>

For example, given an SSL certificate located at
:file:`/etc/ssl/mongodb.pem`, configure :program:`mongod` to use SSL
encryption for all connections with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem

.. note::

   - Specify ``<pem>`` with the full path name to the certificate.

     ..  relative paths aren't supported with --fork because of a
         server issue.

   - If the private key portion of the ``<pem>`` is encrypted, specify
     the encryption password with the :setting:`sslPEMKeyPassword`
     option.

   - You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the following example:

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslOnNormalPorts = true
        sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem

To connect, to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using
SSL, the :program:`mongo` shell and MongoDB tools must include the
``--ssl`` option. See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on
connecting to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` running with
SSL.

.. _ssl-mongod-ca-signed-ssl-cert-key:

Set Up ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` with Certificate Authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` for SSL encryption
using an SSL certificate signed by a certificate authority, include the
following run-time options during startup:

- :setting:`sslOnNormalPorts`

- :setting:`sslPEMKeyFile` with the name of the :file:`.pem` file that
  contains the signed SSL certificate and key.

- :setting:`sslCAFile` with the name of the :file:`.pem` file that
  contains the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority.

Consider the following syntax for :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile <pem> --sslCAFile <ca>

For example, given a signed SSL certificate located at
:file:`/etc/ssl/mongodb.pem` and the certificate authority file at
:file:`/etc/ssl/ca.pem`, you can configure :program:`mongod` for SSL
encryption as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

.. note::

   - Specify the ``<pem>`` file and the ``<ca>`` file with either the
     full path name or the relative path name.

   - If the ``<pem>`` is encrypted, specify the encryption password
     with the :setting:`sslPEMKeyPassword` option.

   - You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
     </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the following example:

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslOnNormalPorts = true
        sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
        sslCAFile = /etc/ssl/ca.pem

To connect, to :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances using
SSL, the :program:`mongo` tools must include the both the
:option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>` and
:option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongo --sslPEMKeyFile>` option.
See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more information on connecting to
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` running with SSL.

Block Revoked Certificates for Clients
``````````````````````````````````````

To prevent clients with revoked certificates from connecting, include
the :setting:`sslCRLFile` to specify a :file:`.pem` file that contains
revoked certificates.

For example, the following :program:`mongod` with SSL configuration
includes the :setting:`sslCRLFile` setting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslCRLFile /etc/ssl/ca-crl.pem --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

Clients with revoked certificates in the :file:`/etc/ssl/ca-crl.pem`
will not be able to connect to this :program:`mongod` instance.

.. _ssl-mongod-weak-certification:

Validate Only if a Client Presents a Certificate
````````````````````````````````````````````````

In most cases it's important to ensure that clients present valid
certificates. However, if you have clients that cannot present a
client certificate, or are transitioning to using a certificate
authority you may only want to validate certificates from clients that
present a certificate.

If you want to bypass validation for clients that don't present
certificates, include the :setting:`sslWeakCertificateValidation`
run-time option with :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`. If the
client does not present a certificate, no validation occurs. These
connections, though not validated are still encrypted using SSL.

For example, consider the following :program:`mongod` with an SSL
configuration that includes the :setting:`sslWeakCertificateValidation`
setting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslWeakCertificateValidation --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem --sslCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem

Then, clients can connect either with the option :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`
and **no** certificate or with the option :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`
and a **valid** certificate. See :ref:`ssl-clients` for more
information on SSL connections for clients.

.. note::

   If the client presents a certificate, the certificate must be a
   valid certificate.

   All connections, including those that have not presented
   certificates are encrypted using SSL.

Run in FIPS Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` is running on a system
with an OpenSSL library configured with the FIPS 140-2 module, you can
run :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` in FIPS mode, with the
:setting:`sslFIPSMode` setting.

.. _ssl-clients:

SSL Configuration for Clients
-----------------------------

Clients must have support for SSL to work with a :program:`mongod` or a
:program:`mongos` instance that has SSL support enabled. The current
versions of the Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, .NET, and C++ drivers have
support for SSL, with full support coming in future releases of other
drivers.

.. _mongo-shell-ssl-connect:

``mongo`` SSL Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For SSL connections, you must use the :program:`mongo` shell built with
SSL support or distributed with MongoDB Enterprise. To support SSL,
:program:`mongo` has the following settings:

- :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`

- :setting:`--sslPEMKeyFile <sslPEMKeyFile>` with the name of the
  :file:`.pem` file that contains the SSL certificate and key.

- :setting:`--sslCAFile <sslCAFile>` with the name of the :file:`.pem`
  file that contains the certificate from the Certificate Authority.

- :setting:`--sslPEMKeyPassword <sslPEMKeyPassword>` option if the
  client certificate-key file is encrypted.

Connect to MongoDB Instance with SSL Encryption
```````````````````````````````````````````````

To connect to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance that
requires :ref:`only a SSL encryption mode <ssl-mongod-ssl-cert-key>`,
start :program:`mongo` shell with :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>`, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --ssl

Connect to MongoDB Instance that Requires Client Certificates
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To connect to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that requires
:ref:`CA-signed client certificates
<ssl-mongod-ca-signed-ssl-cert-key>`, start the :program:`mongo` shell with
:option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>` and the :setting:`--sslPEMKeyFile
<sslPEMKeyFile>` option to specify the signed certificate-key file, as
in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --ssl --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/client.pem

Connect to MongoDB Instance that Validates when Presented with a Certificate
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To connect to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance that
:ref:`only requires valid certificates when the client presents a certificate
<ssl-mongod-weak-certification>`, start :program:`mongo` shell either
with the :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>` ssl and **no** certificate or
with the :option:`--ssl <mongo --ssl>` ssl and a **valid** signed
certificate.

For example, if :program:`mongod` is running with weak certificate
validation, both of the following :program:`mongo` shell clients can
connect to that :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --ssl
   mongo --ssl --sslPEMKeyFile /etc/ssl/client.pem

.. important:: If the client presents a certificate, the certificate
   must be valid.

MMS
~~~

The MMS agent will also have to connect via SSL in order to gather its
stats.  Because the agent already utilizes SSL for its communications
to the MMS servers, this is just a matter of enabling SSL support in
MMS itself on a per host basis.

Use the "Edit" host button (i.e. the pencil) on the Hosts page in the
MMS console and is currently enabled on a group by group basis by
10gen.

Please see the `MMS Manual <http://mms.10gen.com/help>`_ for more
information about MMS configuration.

PyMongo
~~~~~~~

Add the "``ssl=True``" parameter to a PyMongo
:py:class:`MongoClient <pymongo:pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient>`
to create a MongoDB connection to an SSL MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient
   c = MongoClient(host="mongodb.example.net", port=27017, ssl=True)

To connect to a replica set, use the following operation:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoReplicaSetClient
   c = MongoReplicaSetClient("mongodb.example.net:27017",
                             replicaSet="mysetname", ssl=True)

PyMongo also supports an "``ssl=true``" option for the MongoDB URI:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb.example.net:27017/?ssl=true

Java
~~~~

Consider the following example "``SSLApp.java``" class file:

.. code-block:: java

    import com.mongodb.*;
    import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;

    public class SSLApp {

        public static void main(String args[])  throws Exception {

            MongoClientOptions o = new MongoClientOptions.Builder()
                    .socketFactory(SSLSocketFactory.getDefault())
                    .build();

            MongoClient m = new MongoClient("localhost", o);

            DB db = m.getDB( "test" );
            DBCollection c = db.getCollection( "foo" );

            System.out.println( c.findOne() );
        }
    }

Ruby
~~~~

The recent versions of the Ruby driver have support for connections
to SSL servers. Install the latest version of the driver with the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install mongo

Then connect to a standalone instance, using the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   require 'rubygems'
   require 'mongo'

   connection = Mongo::Connection.new('localhost', 27017, :ssl => true)

Replace ``connection`` with the following if you're connecting to a
replica set:

.. code-block:: ruby

   connection = Mongo::ReplSetConnection.new(['localhost:27017'],
                                             ['localhost:27018'],
                                             :ssl => true)

Here, :program:`mongod` instance run on "``localhost:27017``" and
"``localhost:27018``".

Node.JS (``node-mongodb-native``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `node-mongodb-native`_ driver, use the following invocation to
connect to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance via SSL:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var db1 = new Db(MONGODB, new Server("127.0.0.1", 27017,
                                        { auto_reconnect: false, poolSize:4, ssl:ssl } );

To connect to a replica set via SSL, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var replSet = new ReplSetServers( [
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[1], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[0], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       ],
     {rs_name:RS.name, ssl:ssl}
   );

.. _`node-mongodb-native`: https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native

.NET
~~~~

As of release 1.6, the .NET driver supports SSL connections with
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. To connect using
SSL, you must add an option to the connection string, specifying
``ssl=true`` as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var connectionString = "mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true";
    var server = MongoServer.Create(connectionString);

The .NET driver will validate the certificate against the local
trusted certificate store, in addition to providing encryption of the
server. This behavior may produce issues during testing if the server
uses a self-signed certificate. If you encounter this issue, add the
``sslverifycertificate=false`` option to the connection string to
prevent the .NET driver from validating the certificate, as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var connectionString = "mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true&sslverifycertificate=false";
    var server = MongoServer.Create(connectionString);
