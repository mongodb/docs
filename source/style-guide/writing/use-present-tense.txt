Users read content to learn how to perform tasks or to gather
information. These activities occur in the users' present time. This
makes the present tense appropriate in most cases. The present tense
implies that users should take action now. Sentences that use the
present tense are easier to read than sentences that use past or future
tense.

The future tense may imply a sense of uncertainty. (We can't guarantee
a future action, regardless of expectation!) Use future tense to
emphasize that something occurs later from the users' perspective.

The past tense may be used when you need to refer to a past event or,
more often, an earlier software release. Limit references to earlier
versions to the immediate prior release. If a user wants to learn about
something earlier than that can refer to an earlier version of the
documentation.

   To easily find and remove instances of future tense, search for
