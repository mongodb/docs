.. dbcommand:: flushRouterConfig

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` marks the cached routing table for a 
   sharded cluster as stale, causing the next operation that requests
   the routing table to refresh the cache. Management of the routing
   table cache is generally handled automatically by the cluster. You
   should only need to run the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command
   manually in specific instances, as indicated under
   :ref:`flushrouterconfig-considerations`.

.. note::

   **Starting in MongoDB 4.4,** running :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig`
   is no longer required after executing the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` or
   :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` commands. These two commands now
   automatically refresh a sharded cluster's routing table as needed
   when run.

Syntax
------

Starting in MongoDB 4.0.6 (and 3.6.11), the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is available on both
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, and has the
following syntax:  

- Flush the cache for a specified collection when passed in a
  collection namespace parameter:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand({ flushRouterConfig: "<db.collection>" } )

- Flush the cache for a specified database and all of its collections
  when passed in a database namespace parameter:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand({ flushRouterConfig: "<db>" } ) 

- Flush the cache for all databases and their collections when run
  without a parameter or passed in a non-string scalar value
  (e.g. ``1``):

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand("flushRouterConfig")
     db.adminCommand( { flushRouterConfig: 1 } )

.. note::

   **In MongoDB 4.0.5 and earlier (and 3.6.10 and earlier)**,
   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is only available for
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and can only flush the cache for all
   databases and their collections:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand("flushRouterConfig")
      db.adminCommand( { flushRouterConfig: 1 } )

Considerations
--------------

Generally, a sharded cluster's routing table is automatically refreshed
as needed as part of normal operation. However, you should manually
issue the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command in the following
instances:

- If running MongoDB 4.2 or earlier, after executing the
  :dbcommand:`movePrimary` or :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` commands.

- If running MongoDB 4.2.2 or earlier (or 4.0.14 or earlier), after
  manually clearing the ``jumbo`` flag from a chunk that could not be
  split (i.e. an *indivisible chunk*). See
  :doc:`/tutorial/clear-jumbo-flag` for more information.

- Before running the :method:`db.collection.getShardDistribution()`
  command. This ensures that the command returns the most up-to-date
  information.
