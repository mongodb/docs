      a. Click :icon:`trash-alt` next to the |api| Key that you want to
         delete.
      
      b. Click :guilabel:`Delete` to confirm that you want to delete this
         |api| Key or :guilabel:`Cancel` to leave the key in the
         Organization.
      
      .. note::
      
         Removing an |api| Key from an Organization also removes that key
         from any projects to which the key was granted access.
