Overview
--------

To authenticate to a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance, you must have user credentials for a resource on that instance.
When you authenticate to MongoDB, you authenticate either to a database or
to a cluster. Your user privileges determine the resource you can
authenticate to.

You authenticate to a resource either by:

- using the authentication options when connecting to the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, or

- connecting first and then authenticating to the resource with the
  :dbcommand:`authenticate` command or the :method:`db.auth()` method.

This section describes both approaches.

In general, always use a trusted channel (VPN, TLS/SSL, trusted wired network)
for connecting to a MongoDB instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have user credentials on the database or cluster to which you are
authenticating.
