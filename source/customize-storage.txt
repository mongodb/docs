Each cluster tier comes with a default set of resources. 
Clusters of size M10 and larger provide the ability to customize
your storage capacity.

|service| provides the following storage configuration options,
depending on the selected cloud provider and cluster tier.

.. _storage-class-ui:

Cluster Class (AWS only)
------------------------

Clusters of size M40 and larger on AWS offer multiple options,
including:

- :guilabel:`Low CPU`
- :guilabel:`General`
- :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD`

Locally attached ephemeral :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>`
offer the highest level of speed and performance.

Select the :guilabel:`Class` box with your preferred speed.
Changes to cluster class affect :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

.. _storage-capacity-ui:

Storage Capacity
----------------

The size of the server data volume. To change this, either:

- Specify the exact disk size in the text box, *or*

- Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
  disk size.

Changes to storage capacity affect
:ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

.. _storage-iops-ui:

IOPS (configurable for AWS only)
--------------------------------

|service| clusters on AWS of size M30 and greater allow you to
customize the maximum |iops| rate of your cluster. To provision the
|iops| rate of your cluster, check the box marked
:guilabel:`Provision IOPS` and either:

- Specify the exact |iops| rate in the text box, *or*

- Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
  IOPS rate.

Changes to IOPS provisioning affect :ref:`cost
<instance-storage-speed>`.

.. note::
 
   The available IOPS range for a cluster is tied to disk
   :ref:`storage capacity <storage-capacity-ui>`. If you modify
   your cluster's storage capacity, the range of available IOPS
   values changes as well.

   If you do not choose to provision IOPS, the default IOPS rate
   changes as the cluster's storage capacity changes.

.. _configuration-storage-considerations:

Minimum Disk Capacity to RAM Ratios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-minimum-iops.rst

|service| has a 4 TB disk capacity limit on all replica sets and
shards, regardless of cluster tier. To expand total cluster
storage beyond 4 TB, enable :ref:`sharding
<cluster-option-sharding>`.

For clusters with :guilabel:`Auto-Expand Storage` enabled,
|service| respects the calculated maximum storage for the
selected cluster tier. Users whose disk capacity reaches the
allowable limit receive notification by email.

For more information on the default resources and available
configuration options for each cloud service provider, see:

- :ref:`AWS Configuration Options <amazon-aws-configuration-options>`
- :ref:`GCP Configuration Options <google-gcp-configuration-options>`
- :ref:`Azure Configuration Options
  <microsoft-azure-configuration-options>`.

Auto-Scale
----------

Use :guilabel:`Auto-scale` options to configure your cluster to
automatically scale your cluster tier and storage in response to
cluster usage. Cluster storage auto-scaling is enabled by default.

To configure your cluster to automatically scale its cluster tier,
check the :guilabel:`Cluster tier` checkbox. When you
enable cluster tier scaling, by default, your cluster can only scale
up. To allow your cluster to scale down, check the
:guilabel:`Allow cluster to be scaled down` checkbox. Specify a
range of cluster tiers to which your cluster can scale.

To opt out of cluster storage scaling, un-check the
:guilabel:`Storage` checkbox.

For more information on cluster auto-scaling and when auto-scaling
occurs, see :ref:`how-auto-scale-works`.
