Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
Authorization is the process of assigning permissions to an authenticated user.
|service| uses a deny-by-default security model. Users and machine accounts 
must authenticate and be assigned permissions before they can access any resources.

For :ref:`Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>`, |service| 
provides robust authentication mechanisms that seamlessly integrate with your 
existing identity systems, providing secure access to the UI, database, and 
|api|\s.

For :ref:`Authorization <arch-center-authorization-recs>`, |service| 
provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to govern 
access to |service|. You must grant a user one or more roles to determine the
user's access resources and operations. Outside of role assignments, the user 
has no access to the system.
