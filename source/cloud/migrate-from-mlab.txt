     Free (Sandbox) and Shared Plan Migration
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Due to limitations on mLab Sandbox and Shared plan database access,
     the only way to migrate data to Atlas is to pipe :manual:`mongodump
     </reference/program/mongodump/>` to :manual:`mongorestore
     </reference/program/mongodump/>`.

     It is possible to `upgrade
     <https://docs.mlab.com/subscriptions/#change-plans>`_ an mLab
     Sandbox deployment to a Dedicated deployment, but database downtime
     is required. You can upgrade a Shared deployment to a Dedicated
     deployment with no downtime by using a rolling upgrade procedure,
     as described in the `mLab documentation
     <https://docs.mlab.com/subscriptions/#change-plans-using-rnr>`_.

     Dedicated Plan Migration
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     You can migrate data in an mLab Dedicated deployment to Atlas with
     no database downtime by using the `Atlas Live Migration Service
     <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/import/live-import/>`_. The
     following procedure will help you prepare your data for
     migration.

   procedure:

   summary:
     You created an Atlas cluster, migrated data from your old mLab
     cluster, and updated your applications to use the new Atlas
     cluster. Congratulations and welcome to MongoDB Atlas!
