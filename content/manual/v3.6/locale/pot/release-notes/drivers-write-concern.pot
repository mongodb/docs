msgid "All drivers will add a new top-level connection class that will increase consistency for all MongoDB client interfaces."

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:32
msgid "This change is non-backward breaking: existing connection classes will remain in all drivers for a time, and will continue to operate as expected. However, those previous connection classes are now deprecated as of these releases, and will eventually be removed from the driver interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:38
msgid "The new top-level connection class is named ``MongoClient``, or similar depending on how host languages handle namespacing."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:41
msgid "The default write concern on the new ``MongoClient`` class will be to acknowledge all write operations [#without-arguments]_. This will allow your application to receive acknowledgement of all write operations."

msgid "The drivers will call :dbcommand:`getLastError` without arguments, which is logically equivalent to the ``w: 1`` option; however, this operation allows :term:`replica set` users to override the default write concern with the :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` setting in the :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`."
