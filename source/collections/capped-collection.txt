:manual:`Capped Collections </core/capped-collections/>` are fixed-sized 
collections that support high-throughput operations that insert and retrieve 
documents based on insertion order. 

Limitations
-----------

The following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a 
capped collection:

- :guilabel:`Custom collation` is the only :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Option` 
  that you can use alongside your capped collection.  

- If you import a data set larger than the maximum size of the capped collection,
  |compass-short| only loads the last documents of the data set and drops the oldest
  documents.

- Once the collection is created, you can't adjust the maximum number of bytes.
