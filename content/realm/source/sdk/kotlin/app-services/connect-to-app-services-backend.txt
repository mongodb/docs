This page describes how to initialize your App client and connect to the Atlas
App Services backend using the Kotlin SDK.

The **App client** is the client-side interface to the App Services backend.
It lets you interact with your App Services App and provides access to App
Services functionality, including:

- :ref:`Authenticating <kotlin-authenticate>` app users
- :ref:`Synchronizing data <kotlin-sync>` between the Atlas backend and the
  client app using Device Sync
- :ref:`Calling Atlas functions <kotlin-call-function>`

Each App client is associated with a single App ID. To learn how to find your
App ID in the App Services UI, refer to
:ref:`Find Your App ID <find-your-app-id>` in the App Services documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can connect to Atlas App Services, you need an App Services App
with an App ID.

To get started, refer to :ref:`Create an App <create-a-realm-app>`
in the App Services documentation.

.. _kotlin-access-the-app-client:

Initialize the App Client
-------------------------

The Kotlin SDK uses the
`App <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/index.html>`__
interface to access an ``App`` client.

Each ``App`` client is associated with a single App ID.
You can have multiple App client instances that connect to multiple
Apps, but all App client instances that share the same App ID use the same
underlying connection.

You can initialize an App client by calling one of the following methods:

- ``.create()``: initializes an App with default configuration values
- ``.build()``: initializes an App with custom configuration values passed
  through an ``AppConfiguration`` object

Once you initialize the App, you can use the ``App`` instance to
access App Services functionality.

Default App Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize an App with default configuration values, pass the App ID
for your App Services App to the
`App.create()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-companion/create.html>`__
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.initialize-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-app-client-configuration:

Configured App Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `AppConfiguration
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/index.html>`__
interface lets you configure your App client with optional arguments
for more granular control of your app connection details, such as custom
request headers and keys for local encryption.

To control the configuration options, use the
`AppConfiguration.Builder
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html>`__
and call the ``.build()`` method to pass a configuration object:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.configure-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

Configuration Caching
`````````````````````

.. versionchanged:: 1.14.0
   ``baseUrl`` is not cached in the ``AppConfiguration``

When you initialize the App client, the configuration is cached internally.

Attempting to close and then re-open an App with a changed configuration
within the same process has no effect. The client continues to use the
cached configuration.

Starting with Kotlin SDK version 1.14.0, the
`baseUrl() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/index.html#-175646410%2FProperties%2F380376748>`__
is *no longer* cached in the ``AppConfiguration``. This means that you can
change the ``baseUrl``, and the App client will use the updated configuration.
In earlier SDK versions, changes to the ``baseUrl`` in a cached App
configuration have no effect.

Configure the App Client
------------------------

The following sections describe how to build the ``AppConfiguration`` client
with specific properties.

.. _kotlin-share-sync-connections:

Share Sync Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/kotlin-note-sync-config-option.rst

.. versionadded:: 1.13.0

By default, the SDK opens a separate connection to the server for
each synced realm. In Kotlin v1.13.0 and later, you can enable
**session multiplexing**. When enabled, the SDK
shares a connection to the server for all synced realms opened with
a single App Services user. Sharing a connection across multiple
sessions reduces resources and can improve performance.

Multiplexing is disabled by default. You can enable it on the
``AppConfiguration`` using the `.enableSessionMultiplexing()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html#-839865185%2FFunctions%2F380376748>`__
method, which accepts a Boolean value.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.enable-multiplexing.kt
   :language: kotlin

When enabled, the shared connection does not immediately close when all sessions are closed.
Instead, it remains open for the ``connectionLingerTime``, which defaults to
30 seconds. You can override this duration by passing a new value to
`SyncTimeoutOptions.connectionLingerTime()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-timeout-options/connection-linger-time.html>`__
on the ``AppConfiguration``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.enable-multiplexing-with-timeout.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information, refer to the
:ref:`kotlin-configure-sync-timeouts` section on this page.

.. _kotlin-configure-sync-timeouts:

Configure Sync Timeouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/kotlin-note-sync-config-option.rst

.. versionadded:: 1.13.0

In Kotlin v1.13.0 and later, you can override the default
timeout settings used when syncing data between the Atlas backend
and the client app.

You can set various sync timeout settings on the
``AppConfiguration`` using the `.syncTimeouts()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html#90306255%2FFunctions%2F380376748>`__
method. Pass specific timeout property values you want to override. The
configured timeouts apply to all sync sessions in the app.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.sync-timeout-configuration.kt
   :language: kotlin

For a complete list of the available timeout properties and their
definitions, refer to the
`SyncTimeoutOptionsBuilder <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-timeout-options-builder/index.html>`__
API reference.

.. _kotlin-encrypt-app-metadata:

Encrypt App Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you connect to App Services, Realm creates additional metadata files on
a device. For more information about these metadata files, refer to
:ref:`<kotlin-realm-database-internals>`.

You can encrypt the metadata that App Services stores on client devices,
similar to how you :ref:`<kotlin-encrypt-a-synced-realm>`.

To encrypt App metadata, pass your encryption key to the
`encryptionKey <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/encryption-key.html>`__
property when you initialize the App:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.encrypted-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

Set Custom HTTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.11.0

If you use App Services or Device Sync with a proxy setup, you may need to set
custom HTTP headers. The Kotlin SDK supports setting custom HTTP headers
on the App. These headers are appended to every request to the App Services
App, including :ref:`function calls <kotlin-call-function>`.

When you initialize the App, you can pass:

- the custom `authorizationHeaderName
  <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/authorization-header-name.html>`__
  ``String`` value
- any `customRequestHeaders
  <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/custom-request-headers.html>`__
  in a map of ``String`` header keys and values (SDK accepts empty values but
  not empty keys)

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.set-custom-http-headers.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-enable-platform-networking:

Enable Platform Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.14.0

Atlas Device SDK's **platform networking** lets you use your platform's networking
stack instead of the default WebSocket client for Device Sync
traffic.

When enabled, you can configure applications running on Android and
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platforms to use managed WebSockets over
:github:`OkHttp </square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`. Managed WebSockets provide advanced
configuration support for proxies and firewalls that require authentication.

Platform networking is disabled by default. You can enable it on the
``AppConfiguration`` using the
`AppConfiguration.usePlatformNetworking()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/use-platform-networking.html>`__
method, which accepts a Boolean value.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.enable-platform-networking.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note:: Android and JVM platforms only

   This feature is currently only available on Android and Java Virtual
   Machine (JVM) platforms.

Close the App Client
--------------------

You can manually close an App instance and release all underlying resources
using the `App.close()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/close.html>`__ method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.close-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

If not closed manually, resources are freed when the App instance is garbage collected.
