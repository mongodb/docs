.. note:: Default Read Concern Change

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :readconcern:`"local"` is the default read concern level for
   read operations against the primary and secondaries. This could introduce latency
   increases for count queries that use a filter and for :ref:`covered queries
   <covered-queries>` on sharded clusters. To learn more about this change, see :ref:`local-default-read-5.0` in the
   Compatibility Changes documentation.
