    - To ensure :binary:`mongodump` can take a consistent backup of
      a replica set, you must either use the 
      :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to capture writes
      received during backup operations or stop all writes to the 
      replica set for the duration of the backup.

      For sharded cluster replica sets, see
      :ref:`backup-sharded-dumps`.
