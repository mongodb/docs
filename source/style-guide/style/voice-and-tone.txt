The *voice* and *tone* that we use influence how people think
and feel about MongoDB.

- *Voice* is our style and communicates our personality to the user. 
- *Tone* is our mood and communicates our attitude about the subject to 
  the user.

The words we choose—and the ways we use them—should reflect our goals,
which include the following things:

- Build trust.
- Inspire confidence.
- Make things easier.
- Develop a relationship with MongoDB users.

No matter where our words land, they should sound like us.

Voice and Tone Attributes
-------------------------

At MongoDB, we shape our words with the following voice and tone
attributes:

Best Practices
--------------

Consider the following best practices for voice and tone:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Best practices
     - Use
     - Avoid

   * - :ref:`Write to the user <write-to-the-user>` by using second 
       person and imperative mood. Users are more engaged with content
       when it talks to them directly. You talk to users directly by
       using second person, addressing the user as *you*. When you use
       second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject
       *you* is understood) *and* active voice, you make the text clear,
       concise, and direct.
     - Click **Yes** to accept the license agreement.
     - The license agreement is accepted when the user clicks **Yes**.

   * - :ref:`Write in active voice <use-active-voice>`. Active voice 
       makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject
       of the sentence. Active-voice sentences are more direct and
       easier to understand than passive-voice sentences.
     - After you install the software, restart the computer.
     - After the software has been installed, the computer can be
       restarted.

   * - :ref:`Use present tense <use-present-tense>`. Users read content 
       to help them perform tasks or to gather information. These
       activities occur in the users' present time, so the present tense
       is appropriate in most content.
     - The product **prompts** you to verify the deletion.
     - The product **will prompt** you to verify the deletion.

   * - Be impactful and speak directly to a pain point.
     - Stop letting maintenance of your database take time away from
       developing your app.
     - MongoDB Atlas is built for agile teams who'd rather spend time
       building apps than managing databases.

   * - It's about them, not us, and promises a solution.
     - Unlock the value of your data with a scalable, serverless data 
       lake.
     - One of the benefits of Atlas Data Lake is that it's serverless 
       and scalable.

   * - Be simple and direct.
     - Why MongoDB Atlas? Flexible and scalable document database.   
       Available as a fully managed service.
     - Are you looking for a global cloud database service that deploys
       fully managed document databases?

   * - Write in a way that the user wants to be spoken to. Use helpful
       words and phrases that are informative, simple, clear, and easy
       to understand.
     - Enter the IP address of the host. Click :guilabel:`My
       Server` to complete the configuration.
     - The monitoring engine couldn't connect to the server. Make sure
       the information is correctly entered.

   * - Avoid being overly enthusiastic.
     - You successfully configured all databases for monitoring.
     - Congratulations!! ALL of your databases are now being
       monitored!!

   * - Be careful about laying blame. Don’t take the blame for a
       negative situation. Don’t lay the blame of the negative
       situation on the user.
     - The system could not validate your account. Enter your
       credentials again.
     - Either you didn't enter your credentials correctly, or the
       system timed out. Please enter your credentials again.

   * - In positive situations, be encouraging and offer next steps.
       Don’t take credit for the user’s success.
     - Configuration successful. You can now commission and
       decommission servers on-demand.
     - Congrats! Our system is so easy to use that you are now able to
       commission and decommission servers on-demand

   * - In negative situations, be clear about the problem and how the
       user can fix it. Don’t ask the user to trust us without
       providing more information.
     - Your account details and database IP address range don’t match.
       Ensure that the IP addresses on the **Account Details** page are
       correct.
     - The database configuration failed.
