For single-region |aws| {+clusters+}, |service| supports deploying 
search nodes for |fts| separately on :ref:`Amazon Web Services
<amazon-aws>` compute-intensive |nvme| instances.   

When you first :ref:`deploy the search nodes
<create-new-database-deployment>` by clicking :guilabel:`create` in
the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` page, |service| charges you
immediately for your selected configuration. |service| uses the
following to calculate the cost of search nodes on your |service|
{+cluster+}:   

- :ref:`Number of search nodes <fts-number-of-search-node-costs>` on
  your |service| {+cluster+}. 
- Choice of :ref:`search tier <fts-instance-size-costs>`. 
- :ref:`Amount of data transferred <fts-network-transfer-costs>` between 
  the search nodes and database nodes.

Number of Search Nodes 
----------------------

You can :ref:`increase and reduce <configure-search-nodes>` the number
of search nodes that you deploy for your {+cluster+} when you
:ref:`create <create-new-database-deployment>` or :ref:`modify
<scale-cluster>` a {+cluster+}. You can deploy a minimum of 2 and a
maximum of 32 search nodes on you |service| {+cluster+}. |service|
charges hourly for each search node on your {+cluster+}. 

When you add a search node, |service| charges you for the new
configuration, including the new node, immediately. When you remove a
search node, |service| charges for the new configuration, excluding the
node that you removed, immediately. |service| charges you for a full
hour even if you had a search node running for only part of the hour. If
an unhealthy node is being replaced, |service| doesn't charge for the
replacement node and your charges will reflect the cost of only one node. 

.. _fts-instance-size-costs:

Search Tier
-----------

|service| provides different :ref:`search tiers
<select-tiers-for-search-nodes>`. Each search tier has a default RAM
capacity, storage capacity, and CPU. Each search node's per-hour usage 
charge (as shown in the {+atlas-ui+} during cluster creation) is
calculated based on these default values. 

When you create a {+cluster+}, |service| calculates a per-hour usage
charge based on the default values for the search tier. You can modify
the search tier for your search nodes anytime. When you change instance
size, |service| charges for both instances for the first hour. After one
hour, |service| charges you for only the new instance. 

.. _fts-network-transfer-costs:

Network Transfer 
----------------

You will be charged for network traffic between search nodes and the
database nodes on your |service| cluster. You will see the charges for
:ref:`data transfer <data-transfer-costs>` at the {+cluster+} level.
|service| doesn't reflect the charges for the search nodes separately.
Your network charges reflect the cost of the whole |service|
{+cluster+}, including the search nodes.
