Overview
--------

A **client reset error** is a scenario where a client realm cannot sync
data with the application backend. Clients in this state may continue to
run and save data locally but cannot send or receive sync changesets
until they perform a client reset. The Realm SDKs provide methods to 
automatically handle client resets under most scenarios.

.. warning::
   
   By default, the client reset process attempts to recover unsynced changes
   that were successfully saved locally. When your client application 
   has breaking schema changes, or if :ref:`Recovery Mode <recover-unsynced-changes>` 
   is disabled on the server, the client reset process cannot recover unsynced
   data that may be persisted locally on the device.

Client reset scenarios occur when the server's history is incompatible
with the client's history. The most common causes of client resets are:

- **Atlas App Services server crashes**: A server may restore from a backup that has an earlier
  version. A client reset for this scenario would reset the client to
  the earlier version and lose any changes that were saved on the client but not
  yet synced with the server.

- **Disabling and re-enabling sync**: Turning Sync off and then on again in
  the App Services UI causes all clients to require a client reset.

- **Client/Backend schema mismatch**: If a client application attempts
  to synchronize with the backend while using a Realm Object schema that
  does not exist in the backend, that client must perform a client reset.
  This only applies in one direction: if the backend schema contains an
  Realm Object class not used in a client, that client does *not*
  need to client reset.

- **Client maximum offline time**: When a client has not synchronized with
  the backend in more than :ref:`client maximum offline time
  <client-maximum-offline-time>` days, that client can no longer synchronize
  unsynced local changes with the backend. The client must discard all
  local changes since the last sync and download the current status of
  the realm from the backend.

- **Breaking schema changes**: A :ref:`breaking or destructive change
  <destructive-changes-synced-schema>`, like changing a property type or a
  primary key, requires you to terminate and re-enable Sync. This creates a new
  synced realm file with a version unrelated to the client's file. In this
  scenario, the client reset process cannot complete automatically, and your 
  app must provide a :ref:`manual client reset handler 
  <manually-recover-unsynced-changes>`. 

- **Upgrading from a Shared to Dedicated cluster**: When you :ref:`upgrade from 
  a shared to a dedicated cluster <upgrade-shared-cluster>`, you must 
  terminate Sync on the old cluster. After you upgrade, you can re-enable Sync.
  Turning Sync off and then on again causes all clients to require a 
  client reset.

- **Session role changes**: When using Flexible Sync, changes to a user's
  :ref:`Flexible Sync session role <flex-sync-expansions-consideration>` result
  in a client reset. The following scenarios all result in a client reset:

  - server-side modifications to the session role
  - changes to the value of any expansions in the "apply when", read, or
    write expressions
  - changes that qualify the user for a different session role

.. _handle-a-client-reset:

Handle a Client Reset
---------------------

The SDKs automatically detect the need for client resets. They can 
automatically perform a client reset in most cases, except in the 
event of a breaking schema change.

During an automatic client reset, the client:

1. Downloads a fresh copy of the realm from the backend.
#. Performs a diff to figure out the steps required to bring the original 
   (local) copy of the realm to the same state as the fresh copy of the 
   backend.
#. Applies that set of steps to transform the local realm into a state
   where it can sync with the backend. 
   
   If there are no schema changes, or only non-breaking schema changes, 
   the SDK attempts to recover all local changes that have not yet synced 
   to the backend. It also applies any inserts, updates, and deletes 
   from the backend that haven't yet synced to the client.

   If you have chosen to discard unsynced changes in the SDK, or if Recovery 
   Mode cannot recover unsynced changes, the SDK can discard local changes 
   that have not yet synced to the backend. Then it can apply any inserts, 
   updates, and deletes from the backend that haven't yet synced to the 
   client. To fall back to discard local changes, choose your preferred SDK's 
   version of the ``recoverOrDiscard`` client reset mode.

#. Discards the fresh copy. The app continues to use
   the original copy of the realm with the diff applied.

In a breaking schema change, or if automatic client reset fails, the client 
reset falls back to a :ref:`manual client reset handler <manual-client-reset>` 
that your app must define. The Realm SDKs cannot automatically perform a 
client reset when you make a breaking schema change.

Automatic client reset mode has several advantages compared to manual recovery:

- Your application can perform a client reset without writing any custom
  logic, other than specifying the mode. You don't have to manually
  initiate the client reset or interact with the error object at all.
- Your application can perform a client reset without closing any
  realms, disconnecting from the backend app, or manual restarts. This
  means you don't have to write any logic to handle these situations.
- Application users receive notifications for changes as the local realm
  updates to match the state of the backend realm.

.. _recover-unsynced-changes:

Recover Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When **Client Recovery** is enabled in your Device Sync configuration - as it 
is by default - client applications can automatically recover unsynced 
changes. In most scenarios, the client application can detect that a 
client reset error has occurred and start an automated process to handle 
the client reset.

After the client reset, the app can open and operate as usual. 

Client Recovery can recover unsynced data in client resets except where 
there has been a breaking schema change. Client Recovery applies 
:ref:`client-reset-recovery-rules` when determining how to integrate 
unsynced data from the device.

You can choose to fall back to :ref:`discard-unsynced-changes` in the
event that the client cannot recover unsynced data. In this case, local
data is discarded, but the client can automatically perform 
the client reset. To fall back to discard local changes, choose your 
preferred SDK's version of the ``recoverOrDiscard`` client reset mode.

.. _client-reset-recovery-rules:

Client Reset Recovery Rules
```````````````````````````

In a client reset that does not involve a breaking schema change, the 
Realm SDKs attempt to recover unsynced changes. The SDK integrates objects 
created locally that did not sync before the client reset. These rules 
determine how conflicts are resolved when both the backend and the client 
make changes to the same object:

- If an object is deleted on the server, but is modified on the recovering 
  client, the delete takes precedence and the client discards the update.
- If an object is deleted on the recovering client, but not the server, 
  then the client applies the delete instruction.
- In the case of conflicting updates to the same field, the client update 
  is applied.

.. _discard-unsynced-changes:

Discard Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Deletes Unsynced Local Changes Permanently

   This client reset mode permanently deletes any changes made
   locally that have not yet synchronized to the backend.
   Do not use this client reset mode if your
   application needs to preserve unsynced changes.

The **discard unsynced changes** client reset mode automatically handles 
client resets without attempting to recover data from the client device. 
You might choose this mode if the :ref:`client-reset-recovery-rules` do
not work for your app, or if you don't need to save unsynced data. When 
this mode uses a diff to bring the local realm to the same state as the 
backend, unsynced changes are permanently deleted.

Discard Unsynced Changes mode cannot perform an automated client reset in 
the event of a breaking schema change.

.. _manual-client-reset:
.. _manually-recover-unsynced-changes:

Manual Client Reset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event of :ref:`a breaking schema change <breaking-change-quick-reference>`,
Realm SDKs cannot automatically handle a client reset. You must define 
a manual client reset handler if you make breaking schema changes.

In this scenario, a manual client reset handler should do something like 
tell the user to update the app. In Realm SDK versions that automatically 
handle client resets, a manual client reset only occurs in error scenarios
where no meaningful recovery can occur.

.. _enable-or-disable-recovery-mode:

Enable or Disable Recovery Mode
-------------------------------

Recovery Mode is enabled by default in every Device Sync configuration.
You can disable Recovery Mode, or re-enable it if you have previously
disabled it.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      1. Select the :guilabel:`Device Sync` menu in the sidebar.

      2. Click the :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration` pane to display 
         additional configuration options.

      3. Click the :guilabel:`Enable Client Recovery` toggle.

      4. Press the :guilabel:`Save` button to confirm your
         changes.

         If your app uses deployment drafts, you must deploy your application
         after making changes.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      1. Pull a local copy of the latest version of your app with the
         following :ref:`pull command <appservices-pull>`:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: Pull

            {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

      2. You can configure the number of days for your application's
         client maximum offline time with the ``is_recovery_mode_disabled``
         property in your app's ``sync/config.json`` file:

         .. code-block:: json
            :caption: ``sync/config.json``
           
            {
              ...
              "is_recovery_mode_disabled": false,
              ...
            }

      3. Deploy the updated app configuration with the following
         :ref:`push command <appservices-push>`:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: Push

            {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"
