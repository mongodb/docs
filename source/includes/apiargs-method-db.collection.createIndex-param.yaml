  the index key and the value describes the type of index for that
  field. For an ascending index on a field, specify a value of ``1``; for

  :ref:`text <index-feature-text>`, :ref:`geospatial
  <index-feature-geospatial>`, and :ref:`hashed
  <index-type-hashed>` indexes. See :ref:`index types <index-types>`
