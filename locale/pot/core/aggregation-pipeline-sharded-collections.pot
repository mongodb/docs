msgid "When operating on a sharded collection, the aggregation pipeline is split into two parts. The first pipeline runs on each shard, or if an early :pipeline:`$match` can exclude shards through the use of the shard key in the predicate, the pipeline runs on only the relevant shards."

The primary shard merges the cursors from the other shards and runs the second pipeline on these results. The primary shard forwards the final results to the :program:`mongos`.
