Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-long+} to retrieve
data from a MongoDB collection by using read operations. You can call the
``find()`` or ``find_one()`` method to retrieve documents that match a set of criteria.

.. TODO: .. tip:: Interactive Lab
   You can complete a short interactive lesson that demonstrates how to
   retrieve data by using the ``Find()`` method in an in-browser coding
   experience. To learn more, see the :ref:`pymongo-retrieve-instruqt-lab`
   section of this guide.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :ref:`<pymongo-get-started>`
tutorial.

.. _pymongo-retrieve-find:

Finding Documents
-----------------

{+driver-short+} includes two methods for retrieving documents from a collection:
``find_one()`` and ``find()``.
These methods take a **query filter** and return one or more matching documents.
A query filter is an object that specifies the documents you want to retrieve in
your query. 

To learn more about query filters, see :ref:`pymongo-specify-query`.

.. _pymongo-retrieve-find-one:

Find One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find a single document in a collection, call the ``find_one()`` method and pass a query
filter that specifies the criteria of the document you want to find.
If more than one document matches the query
filter, this method returns the *first* matching document from the retrieved
results as a Python dictionary. If no documents match the query filter, the method returns
``None``.

.. tip::
   
   The ``find_one()`` method is useful when you know there's only one matching document,
   or you're only interested in the first match.  

The following example uses the ``find_one()`` method to find the first document where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Bakery"``. Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         restaurant = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find_one({"cuisine": "Bakery"})

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         restaurant = await sample_restaurants.restaurants.find_one({"cuisine": "Bakery"})
   
.. tip:: Sort Order

   The ``find_one()`` method returns the first document in 
   :manual:`natural order </reference/glossary/#std-term-natural-order>`
   on disk if no sort criteria is specified.

   To learn more about sorting, see the :ref:`sort guide <pymongo-sort>`.

.. _pymongo-retrieve-find-multiple:

Find Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find multiple documents in a collection, pass a query filter to the ``find()``
method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to retrieve.

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Spanish"``.

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Spanish"})

You can use a **cursor** to iterate over the documents returned by the ``find()``
method. A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over database 
results while holding only a subset of them in memory at a given time. Cursors
are useful when your ``find()`` method returns a large amount of documents.

You can iterate over the documents in a cursor by using a ``for-in`` loop, as shown in
the following example. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab
to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Spanish"})
         for restaurant in cursor:
         ...

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python
         :copyable: true

         cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Spanish"})
         async for restaurant in cursor:
         ...

.. note:: Find All Documents

   To find all documents in a collection, pass an empty filter 
   to the ``find()`` method:

   .. code-block:: python

      all_restaurants = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({})

Modify Find Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``find()`` and ``find_one()`` methods by passing
named arguments to them. The following table describes the commonly used arguments:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description

   * - ``batch_size`` 
     - | Limits the number of documents to hold in a cursor at a given time.

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | The collation options for the find operation. See the :ref:`pymongo-retrieve-collation`
         guide for more information.

   * - ``comment`` 
     - | A string to attach to the query. This can help you trace and interpret the
         operation in the server logs and in profile data. To learn more about query comments, 
         see the :manual:`cursor.comment() </reference/method/cursor.comment/>` page in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.
   
   * - ``hint`` 
     - | The index to use for the query.

   * - ``max_time_ms`` 
     - | The maximum execution time on the server for this operation. If this time is
         exceeded, {+driver-short+} aborts the operation and raises an ``ExecutionTimeout``.

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Italian"`` and sets a maximum execution
time of 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds):

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Italian"}, max_time_ms=10000)

For a full list of available arguments, see the
`API documentation <{+api-root+}pymongo/collection.html#pymongo.collection.Collection.find>`__
for the  ``find() method``.

.. _pymongo-retrieve-collation:

Collation
`````````

When you perform a query, you can specify a **collation** for the driver to follow when
sorting the results.

.. include:: /includes/collation-description.rst

The following example performs the same find operation as the previous example,
but with a default collation of ``fr_CA``:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Italian"}, max_time_ms=10000,
                                              collation=Collation(locale="fr_CA"))

Alternatively, you can specify a collation by chaining the ``collation()`` method
to the ``find()`` method:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   cursor = sample_restaurants.restaurants.find({"cuisine": "Italian"}, max_time_ms=10000)
                                          .collation(Collation(locale="fr_CA")

.. include:: /includes/collation-override-note.rst
