Choosing a deployment paradigm requires considering your application 
needs for availability (both in general and in case of an outage), 
latency, compliance, and cost. There is no one "correct" paradigm for 
deployment. This section explores the architectures available to you to 
help you meet your deployment needs.

When deploying your database, you must first choose between deploying to a single region or multiple regions. The following diagram 
shows these options, which are explained further below:

Single-Region Deployments
-------------------------

A :ref:`Single-Region Deployment<arch-center-paradigms-single>` 
is the simplest deployment option. In a single-region deployment, your 
data is stored in one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2`` 
or Google's ``asia-northeast3``). For those regions that have multiple 
zones, {+service+} always provides zone-level availability, your 
cluster nodes are spread across the availability zones within a single 
region. Therefore, if a single zone fails, your data is still available 
in the other zones.

.. note::

   Recommended regions have three availability zones, and are marked 
   with a star icon in the {+service+} UI.

With the simplicity and lower cost of a single-region deployment 
comes the risk of lower availability and potentially higher latency, depending on the 
distribution of your application's users. 

Multi-Region Deployments
------------------------

A :ref:`multi-region deployment <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>` is a more complex deployment paradigm that provides higher availability 
and low latency across a larger geographic range than a single-region deployment. There are several types of multi-region deployments:

- **Multi-region in one geography**:
  Deploys to multiple regions hosted by a single cloud provider 
  within a single geography, defined as a large area like a country or 
  continent. This ensures availability if any given region fails.

  For example, you deploy clusters to the {+aws+} regions ``us-west-1`` 
  and ``us-east-1``, both of which are in the United States. If 
  ``us-east-1`` becomes unavailable, ``us-west-1`` will continue to 
  accept reads and writes at close to normal performance.

- **Multi-region in multiple geographies**:
  Deploys to one or more regions in two or more geographies.
  This ensures availability if any given region fails, or 
  if an entire geographic area is unavailable.

  For example, you deploy clusters in the {+aws+} regions ``us-east-1`` and ``us-east-2``, 
  both of which are in the United States, and a third cluster in ``eu-west-2``, 
  which is in Europe. 
  
- **Multi-cloud** : 
  Deploys to one or more regions hosted by multiple cloud providers. 
  This provides the highest level of availability, ensuring 
  your data is available if any given region fails or if an entire cloud provider fails. 

  For example, you deploy clusters in the {+aws+} region ``us-west-1`` and the {+gcp+} 
  region ``us-east4``.

Availability Considerations
---------------------------

Availability is often considered in terms of how resilient your 
clusters are to disruptions, while disaster recovery is how quickly 
your system can recover from an outage (RTO) and how much data might be 
lost in an outage (RPO). Because all {+service+} instances always have 
current data, failovers do not require restoring of backups. 

{+service+} has replication built into your deployments, which means: 

- Database instances are kept tightly in sync with each other, typically in the 
  range of milliseconds.
- In the event of an outage, failover between database instances is fully automatic. 
  It requires no human intervention, and takes only seconds.
- When using the default :manual:`writeConcern 
  </reference/write-concern>` of ``majority``, then no data loss occurs 
  during failover because all data was written to multiple locations 
  preventing data loss. Additionally, the DB driver will automatically 
  re-try any in-flight operation to ensure that they succeed.

This means that the RTO, RPO and Data Replication Frequency are 
effectively equal and your {+service+} clusters are fully operational 
as long as a majority of the nodes are healthy.

.. note::

   The maximum RTO and RPO should be considered holistically across 
   both the entire cluster and how you deploy your application. 
   Consider the full workload of your cluster to ensure it will support 
   your requirements.

Deployment Paradigm Comparison
------------------------------

To figure out which deployment pattern is right for you, break down your 
applications by how critical they are to your core business. The 
more important the application (in other words, the more impact an 
outage has on your business), the more you should consider an architecture that  
automatically handles any outage event.

The following table provides a comparison of deployment paradigms to help you 
determine the best fit for your needs:

     - :ref:`3 nodes in a single region, Atlas CLI <arch-center-paradigms-single>`

.. note::

   The cost of each deployment type depends on several factors, including the 
   provider(s) you select, the number of regions you need, the amount of storage, and 
   the processing power of the servers. For the latest pricing information, 
   refer to the `MongoDB Pricing <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing>`_.

Use Cases 
---------

When choosing your deployment paradigm, start by identifying the smallest number of regions that you can deploy to serve 
the widest geographical distribution of your users. Then, consider adding additional regions or 
cloud providers according to your requirements for availability, performance, and
:ref:`data sovereignty <arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`. 

Consider the following use cases to help decide which deployment paradigm works for the geographical distribution of your application's users: 

Users Mostly in One Geography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the majority of your application's users are located in one geography,
we recommend that you deploy to one or more regions within the same geography.
While a single-region deployment can protect against an outage in a single 
availability zone, a multi-region deployment covers a larger geographical area 
and ensures availability during both zonal and regional outages.
For even higher availability, you can deploy across multiple regions.
These options all support low latency and simplify compliance with data 
sovereignty requirements because all user data is accessed and stored within the 
same geography. 

To learn more about these deployment paradigms, see the following paradigm pages: 

- :ref:`Single-Region Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-single>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region Deployment in One Geography <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment in One Geography <arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud>`

Users Distributed Across Multiple Geographies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application's users are distributed across multiple geographies, such as between the US and Europe,
we recommend that you deploy to one or more regions in each geography. 
Deploying to one region in each geography where you serve customers provides low latency and 
availability in case of a geographical outage. You can also meet data sovereignty requirements
by partitioning your data so that user data from each geography is hosted within that geography.

To ensure high availability in case of regional outages without increasing latency or violating data sovereignty requirements,
you can also deploy to multiple regions in each geography. You can achieve the highest availability for a multi-region deployment 
by deploying clusters to multiple regions, in multiple geographies. 

To learn more about these deployment paradigms, see the following paradigm pages: 

- :ref:`Multi-Region Deployment in Multiple Geographies <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment in Multiple Geographies <arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud>`

Users Distributed Worldwide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are deploying an application to a worldwide audience, we recommend that you 
deploy a multi-region deployment across multiple geographies before considering a 
global deployment. In almost all cases, a multi-region deployment in multiple 
geographies can fulfill your requirements for high availability, low latency, 
and data sovereignty. In rare cases, you might need global |service| deployments, 
which are the most complex multi-region deployment paradigms and require very 
careful planning.

- :ref:`Global Deployment <arch-center-global-data>`
