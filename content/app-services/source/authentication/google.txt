Overview
--------

The Google authentication provider allows users to log in with their
existing Google account through `Google Sign-In
<https://developers.google.com/identity/>`_. When a user logs in, Google
provides Atlas App Services with an `OAuth 2.0 access token
<https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/>`_ for the user.
App Services uses the token to identify the user and access approved data from
Google APIs on their behalf.

The following diagram shows the OAuth logic flow:

Set Up a Project in the Google API Console
------------------------------------------

You must set up a project in the Google API Console before you :ref:`configure 
Google Authentication in App Services <auth-google-configuration>`. Follow the
SDK-specific steps to set up Google Authentication in the Google API Console.

The Google authentication provider requires a :gcp:`project in the Google
API Console </>` to manage authentication and user permissions. The
following steps walk through creating the project, generating OAuth
credentials, and configuring the provider to connect with the project.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Project in the Google API Console

      Follow Google's :gcp:`official guide
      </resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects>` to create a new
      GCP project.


   .. step:: Generate OAuth Client Credentials

      .. tabs-realm-sdks::
         :hidden:

         .. tab::
            :tabid: javascript


         .. tab::
            :tabid: android


         .. tab::
            :tabid: ios

            .. note::

               For iOS client applications, you need to create both a Web
               OAuth Client ID and an iOS OAuth Client ID. The former is
               used by App Services, while the latter will be used by the app
               itself.

               Refer to the :guilabel:`Web` tab of this section for
               instructions on creating the web application Client ID for
               App Services.

      Follow Google's support guide on `Setting up OAuth 2.0
      <https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en>`_ for your
      project.

      .. tabs-realm-sdks::
         :hidden:

         .. tab::
            :tabid: javascript

            You will need to create a web application :guilabel:`Client ID`
            and provide several App Services-related values.

            For :guilabel:`Authorized JavaScript Origins`, enter the
            following URL:

            .. code-block:: none

               https://services.cloud.mongodb.com

            For :guilabel:`Authorized Redirect URIs`, enter the App Services
            authentication callback URL that corresponds to the
            :ref:`deployment region <deployment-region>`
            of your application. The following table lists the callback URL
            for each region:

            .. include:: /includes/deployment-region-auth-callback-urls.rst

         .. tab::
            :tabid: android

            Use the following values when configuring your Android
            application :guilabel:`Client ID`:

            .. list-table::

               * - :guilabel:`Application Type`
                 - Android

               * - :guilabel:`Name`
                 - The name you wish to associate with this :guilabel:`Client ID`.

               * - :guilabel:`Signing-certificate Fingerprint`
                 - The SHA-1 fingerprint of your application signing
                   certificate. See :google:`Authenticating Your
                   Client <android/guides/client-auth>` for instructions
                   on generating this value.

         .. tab::
            :tabid: ios

            Use the following values when configuring your iOS application
            :guilabel:`Client ID`:

            .. list-table::

               * - :guilabel:`Application Type`
                 - iOS

               * - :guilabel:`Name`
                 - The name you wish to associate with this :guilabel:`Client ID`.

               * - :guilabel:`Bundle ID`
                 - The Bundle ID for your iOS application. You can find
                   this value in XCode on the :guilabel:`General` tab for
                   the app's primary target.


   .. step:: Configure the Google Authentication Provider

      To connect your GCP project to App Services add the OAuth 2.0
      :guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret` you generated in
      the previous step to your authentication provider :ref:`configuration
      <auth-google-configuration>`.

            :tabid: android


         .. tab::
            :tabid: ios

            .. note::

               Make sure that you add the *web application* credentials
               to the provider configuration. If you add the iOS
               credentials instead, Google authentication will fail.

Configure in App Services
-------------------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      You can enable and configure the Google authentication provider
      from the App Services UI by selecting :guilabel:`Google` from the
      :guilabel:`Authentication` page.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      To enable and configure the Google authentication provider with
      the {+cli-ref+}, define a :ref:`configuration 
      object <appconfig-auth>` for it in ``/auth/providers.json``.

      Google provider configurations have the following form:
      
      .. code-block:: none
         :caption: /auth/providers.json
      
         {
           "oauth2-google": {
             "name": "oauth2-google",
             "type": "oauth2-google",
             "disabled": <boolean>,
             "config": {
               "clientId": <string>,
               "openId": <boolean>
             },
             "secret_config": {
               "clientSecret": <string>
             },
             "metadata_fields": [<document>, ...],
             "redirect_uris": [<string>, ...],
             "domain_restrictions": [<string>, ...]
           }
         }

The Google authentication provider has the following configuration
options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | :guilabel:`Client ID`
       | *config.clientId*
       
     - Required. An :guilabel:`OAuth 2.0 Client ID` for your project
       in the Google API Console.
       
       See :ref:`auth-gcp-project-setup` for information about setting
       up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project.
       
   * - | :guilabel:`Client Secret` 
       | *secret_config.clientSecret*
       
     - Required. The name of a :ref:`Secret <app-secret>` that stores
       an :guilabel:`OAuth 2.0 Client Secret` for your project from the
       Google API Console.
       
       See :ref:`auth-gcp-project-setup` for information about setting
       up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project.
       
   * - | :guilabel:`Metadata Fields`
       | *metadata_fields*

     - Optional. A list of fields describing the authenticated user that
       your application will request from the :google:`Google Identity API
       <identity/sign-in/web/reference#googleusergetbasicprofile>`.

       All metadata fields are omitted by default and can be required on
       a field-by-field basis. Users must explicitly grant your app
       permission to access each required field.
       If a metadata field is required and exists for a particular user,
       it will be included in their user object.
       
       To require a metadata field from an import/export
       configuration file, add an entry for the field to the
       ``metadata_fields`` array. Each entry should be a document of
       the following form:
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
       
          { name: "<metadata field name>", required: "<boolean>" }

   * - | :guilabel:`Redirect URIs`
       | *redirect_uris*

     - Required for web applications.
       A list of allowed redirect :abbr:`URIs (Uniform Resource
       Identifiers)`.

       Once a user completes the authentication process on Google, App Services
       redirects them back to either a specified redirect URI or, if no
       redirect URI is specified, the URL that they initiated the
       authentication request from. App Services will only redirect a user to a
       URI that exactly matches an entry in this list, including the
       protocol and any trailing slashes.

   * - | :guilabel:`Domain Restrictions`
       | *domain_restrictions*

     - Optional. A list of approved :wikipedia:`domains <Domain_name>`
       for user accounts.

       If specified, the provider checks the domain of a user's primary
       email address on Google and only allows them to authenticate if
       the domain matches an entry in this list.

       For example, if ``example1.com`` and ``example2.com`` are listed,
       a Google user with a primary email of ``joe.mango@example1.com``
       would be allowed to log in, while a user with a primary email of
       ``joe.mango@example3.com`` would not be allowed to log in.

       .. note::

          If you've specified any domain restrictions, you must also
          require the email address field in the :guilabel:`Metadata
          Fields` setting.

   * - | :guilabel:`OpenID Connect`
       | *config.openId*

     - Optional. Default ``false``.
     
       If ``true``, the provider uses :google:`OpenID Connect
       <identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect>` to authenticate users.
       
       .. important:: OpenID Connect Support Varies by SDK

          Refer to SDK-specific documentation about support for OpenID Connect. 
          Not all SDK implementations of Google Authentication support OpenID Connect, 
          while others require it. 

       
       .. note:: OpenID Connect Does Not Support Metadata Fields
          
          Google supports OpenID as part of their OAuth 2.0 implementation but does
          not provide access to restricted scopes for OpenID authentication. This
          means that App Services cannot access metadata fields for users authenticated
          with OpenID Connect.
