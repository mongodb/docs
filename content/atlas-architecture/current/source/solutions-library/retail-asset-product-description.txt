Solution Overview
-----------------

In this solution, you will learn how to build a generative AI-powered
architecture that processes images using advanced vision models,
generating accurate and compelling descriptions of an image. MongoDB
Atlas serves as the operational data layer, leveraging its flexible data
model to scale seamlessly as new descriptions are added and ensuring
efficient data management and effortless scalability.

This solution proves particularly valuable in the retail industry. The
process of onboarding a new product to a retailer’s catalog can be
time-consuming, especially when it comes to crafting product
descriptions—in multiple languages and in different geographies. This
solution helps streamline that workflow by automating the initial
content creation through `generative AI
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai>`__,
providing retailers with a solid foundation for each product
description, ultimately speeding up the time to market and improving
consistency across their catalog UX writing.

The Importance of a Good Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Did you know that around `70% of people leave a product page when the
product description is poor or incomplete?
<https://www.businessdasher.com/importance-of-product-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`__ 

Product descriptions play a crucial role in the customer's journey.
Shoppers rely on them to make buying decisions. When descriptions are
weak or missing, businesses risk losing potential revenue and leaving
customers frustrated.

Having a great description can enhance user engagement and satisfaction
as `87% of online shoppers consider product descriptions to be crucial
when making a buying decision.
<https://www.businessdasher.com/importance-of-product-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`__
On the other hand, having inaccurate descriptions can result in revenue
loss and trust decline with your customer base as `40% of consumers have
returned online purchases due to poor product content.

Challenges with the Traditional Product Description Writing Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The journey of writing high-quality descriptions involves numerous
details and careful considerations. Some of the challenges that present
include:

- **Crafting compelling descriptions:** A product description that is
  well-written will address their target’s needs and desires while
  maintaining a consistent tone that aligns with the business’s UX writing
  strategy and brand identity.

- **SEO optimization:** Creating SEO-optimized product descriptions to
  drive organic traffic and improve search engine rankings.

- **Multilingual complexity:** For retailers with multilingual portals
  and with multiple operating geographies this process increases in
  complexity.
  
- **Content approval delays:** Even after a description is written, too
  often there is still a writing approval process that needs to happen,
  delaying the time to market.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

With MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the core of this architecture we have three key components: 

- `MongoDB Atlas
  <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database>`__: A
  powerful, general-purpose data platform that
  seamlessly manages our data in the cloud. MongoDB's flexible document
  model allows products to scale easily by adding more descriptions
  (i.e. for translations in multiple languages) without introducing
  complexity. 

- **The object storage:** An effective system for efficient product image
  file storage and retrieval. This can be built with Google Cloud
  storage, Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3. 

- `Together AI <https://www.together.ai/>`__: Offers a variety of
  generative AI services, making it easy to run or fine-tune leading
  open source models with only a few lines of code. This solution uses
  their available `vision LLMs <https://www.together.ai/models>`__ to
  generate the product descriptions.

   Figure 1. Product description generative AI architecture

The journey starts on the left side of the diagram with the *User/Event*
label. A laptop icon represents the “Product Description Generator”
system. First, a new product is received, this can be added manually by
a user or in bulk through an automated event. 

Then, retailers generate the descriptions by sending a *query* to Together
AI’s endpoint, utilizing their vision models, combining computer vision
and natural language processing (NLP) to process and understand images
alongside text. The request includes the image URL, the desired
description length, the vision model utilized, and the languages for the
description. 

Then, Together AI takes this data and uses one of its Llama3 vision
models to scan the image and generate a description that matches the
specified requirements, and returns the *product description* to the
application.

Finally, the product along with its description will be upserted inside
the catalog on MongoDB, ensuring real-time availability across all
connected systems.

To illustrate the scalability of this architecture, consider the diagram
below. By integrating `MongoDB Change Streams
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/>`__, it allows
real-time updates on any application listening to the catalog. For
example, the e-commerce portal, a social media platform, and any other
touchpoints.

Building the Solution
---------------------

Building this solution can be broken down in five major steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Replicate the demo database

      Provision a cluster within your `Atlas account
      <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>`__ and populate
      your database with the data required for the demo. You can quickly
      replicate the database using a data dump found in the `github
      repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/description-generator/tree/main/resources/dump/TogetherMDB>`__
      with a single `mongorestore
      <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/>`__
      command.

   .. step:: Retrieve MongoDB Atlas connection string

      Navigate to your cluster and click on *Connect*. Copy the
      connection string provided and save it for your .env file.

   .. step:: Create your Together AI account

      Sign in to `Together AI <https://www.together.ai/>`__. Navigate to
      your account and retrieve your user key, which can be found inside
      your *Profile*, then go to *Settings* and select *API Keys*. Save this
      key, as you will need it in your .env file.

   .. step:: Create your object storage

      Create a new bucket in your AWS account and generate an IAM user
      with programmatic access. Save the access key and secret key for
      your .env file.

   .. step:: Configure your application frontend

      Obtain the demo code by cloning the GitHub repository to your
      local machine, configure the environment variables and install the
      dependencies. Finally, run the app locally at
      http://localhost:3003.
