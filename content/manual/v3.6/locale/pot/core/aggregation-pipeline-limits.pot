msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits.txt:24
msgid "The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return either a cursor or store the results in a collection. When returning a cursor or storing the results in a collection, each document in the result set is subject to the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, currently 16 megabytes; if any single document that exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, the command will produce an error. The limit only applies to the returned documents; during the pipeline processing, the documents may exceed this size. The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a cursor by default."

msgid "The :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stage must stay within the 100 megabyte memory limit. If ``allowDiskUse: true`` is specified for the :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` operation, the :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stage ignores the option. If there are other stages in the :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` operation, ``allowDiskUse: true`` option is in effect for these other stages."
