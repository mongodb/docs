Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to connect your PHP application
to MongoDB with various settings.

.. tip::

  To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <php-connect-sample>` or your own application.
Make sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as
``<hostname>``, with the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

.. _php-connect-sample:

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/sample-app-intro.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-sample-app.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7

.. important:: Percent-Encoding

   You must :wikipedia:`percent-encode <Percent-encoding>` a username and password before
   you include them in a MongoDB URI. You can use the ``rawurlencode()`` method to encode 
   these values according to the URI syntax specified in `RFC 3986 <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986.html>`__.
   Don't percent-encode the username or password when passing them in an options array
   parameter to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor.

Connection
----------

Atlas
~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a MongoDB Atlas deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-atlas
    :end-before: end-atlas

To learn more about connecting to an Atlas deployment, see :ref:`php-connection-atlas`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a local MongoDB deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-local
    :end-before: end-local

.. note::

   If you don't specify the ``$uri`` parameter, the connection URI defaults to
   ``'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'``.

To learn more about connecting to a local deployment, see :ref:`php-connection-local`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a replica set deployment:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-replica-set-client
         :end-before: end-replica-set-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-replica-set-uri
         :end-before: end-replica-set-uri

.. tip::

   To maintain your connection to a replica set deployment when one
   host is down, you can provide multiple replica set members in the
   connection URI.

To learn more about connecting to a replica set, see :ref:`php-connection-replica-set`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
------------------------------

Enable TLS
~~~~~~~~~~

         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-enable-tls-client
         :end-before: end-enable-tls-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php

To learn more about specifying a CRL, see :ref:`php-crl` in the TLS
configuration guide.

Present a Client Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the client certificate that
the driver presents to your MongoDB deployment:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-client-cert-client
         :end-before: end-client-cert-client

the TLS Configuration guide.

Provide a Certificate Key File Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the password for your
client certificate:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php

         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-key-file-uri
         :end-before: end-key-file-uri

.. important::

   When replacing the ``<password>`` placeholder in the connection URI, ensure
   that you :wikipedia:`percent-encode <Percent-encoding>` the value.

To learn more about providing a key file password, see :ref:`php-key-file-password` in
the TLS Configuration guide.

Allow Insecure TLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to relax TLS constraints, which has the same
effect as disabling both :ref:`certificate validation <php-connect-disable-cert>`
and :ref:`hostname verification <php-connect-disable-hostname>`:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-insecure-tls-client
         :end-before: end-insecure-tls-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-insecure-tls-uri
         :end-before: end-insecure-tls-uri

To learn more about allowing insecure TLS, see :ref:`php-insecure-tls` in
the TLS Configuration guide.

.. warning::

   Setting the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``true`` might expose your application
   to security risks. Enabling this option makes your application insecure and
   potentially vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.

.. _php-connect-disable-cert:

Disable Certificate Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-disable-cert-client
         :end-before: end-disable-cert-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php

To learn more about disabling certificate validation, see :ref:`php-insecure-tls` in
the TLS Configuration guide.

.. _php-connect-disable-hostname:

Disable Hostname Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to disable hostname verification:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-disable-hostname-client
         :end-before: end-disable-hostname-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php

         :end-before: end-disable-hostname-uri

To learn more about disabling hostname verification, see :ref:`php-insecure-tls` in
the TLS Configuration guide.
