When you select an Authentication Mechanism for your |mms| project, 
this enables access control for all managed deployments in your |mms|
project.

With access control enabled, clients must authenticate to the MongoDB
process as MongoDB users. Once authenticated, these users only have
privileges granted by their assigned roles. You can assign MongoDB's
:manual:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` to a user as well
as :doc:`custom roles </tutorial/manage-mongodb-roles>`.

You can create MongoDB users before or after enabling accessing
control, but your MongoDB instances do not require user credentials if
access control is not enabled.

.. important::
   MongoDB users are separate from |mms| :doc:`users
   </tutorial/manage-users>`. MongoDB users have access to MongoDB
   databases, while |mms| users access the |mms| application itself.
