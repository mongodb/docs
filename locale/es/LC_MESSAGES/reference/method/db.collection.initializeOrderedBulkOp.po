"together. For example, if an ordered list has two insert operations "
"followed by an update operation followed by another insert operation, "
"MongoDB groups the operations into three separate groups: first group "
"contains the two insert operations, second group contains the update "
"operation, and the third group contains the last insert operation. This "
