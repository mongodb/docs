.. versionadded:: 12.0.0

Geospatial data, or "geodata", specifies points and geometric objects on the Earth's 
surface. With the geodata types, you can create queries that check whether a given  
point is contained within a shape. For example, you can find all coffee shops within 
15Â km of a specified point.

.. versionchanged:: ``realm@12.3.0``
   Geospatial data supported in Atlas Device Sync

Realm.js v12.3.0 and later adds support for geospatial data
in Atlas Device Sync. This allows you to subscribe to geospatial queries
in a synced realm. If you try to subscribe to a geospatial query with an older version of the SDK,
you will receive a server error with a compensating write.
For more information about managing your Sync subscriptions,  
refer to :ref:`<react-native-data-types-geospatial>`.

For more information on querying geospatial data with Device Sync, 
refer to :ref:`<geospatial>` in the App Services documentation.

Geospatial Data Types
---------------------

The SDK supports geospatial queries using the following data types:

- GeoPoint
- GeoCircle
- GeoBox
- GeoPolygon

The SDK provides these geospatial data types to simplify querying geospatial data. You *cannot* persist these data types directly. 

For information on how to persist geospatial data, refer to the 
:ref:`<react-native-persist-geopoint>` section on this page.

To query against geospatial data, you can use the ``geoWithin`` operator 
with :ref:`RQL <rql>`. The ``geoWithin`` operator takes the ``coordinates`` 
property of an embedded object that defines the point we're querying, and 
one of the geospatial shapes to check if that point is contained within 
the shape. 

.. note::

   The format for querying geospatial data is the same, regardless of the 
   shape of the geodata region.

.. _react-native-geopoint:

GeoPoint
~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPoint <types/Realm.GeoPoint.html>` defines a specific 
location on the Earth's surface. All of the geospatial data types use ``GeoPoints`` 
to define their location. 

``GeoPoint`` can be one of three types:

- An object with:

  - ``latitude``: a number value
  - ``longitude``: a number value
  - ``altitude``: an optional number value
- ``CanonicalGeoPoint``:  an interface that satisfies the GeoJSON specifications for a point
- ``GeoPosition``: an array with longitude, latitude, and an optional altitude

A GeoPoint is used only as a building block of the other shapes: 
GeoCircle, GeoBox, and GeoPolygon. These shapes, and the GeoPoint type, 
are used in queries, not for persistance.

To save geospatial data to realm, refer to Persist Geospatial Data on this page.

.. _react-native-geocircle:

GeoCircle
~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoCircle <types/Realm.GeoCircle.html>` defines a circle on 
the Earth's surface. You define a ``GeoCircle`` by providing:

- A ``GeoPoint`` for the center of the circle
- A number for the distance (radius) of the circle 

The radius distance uses radians as the unit of measure. The SDK 
provides the methods ``kmToRadians`` and ``miToRadians`` to convert 
kilometers or miles to radians.

The following code shows two examples of creating a circle:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.geocircle.tsx.rst

The following image shows the results of creating two objects: a small circle
and a large circle.

Queries against geospatial data return realm objects within the shapes you
define. From the example above, this is the result of our queries:

.. _react-native-geobox:

GeoBox
~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoBox <types/Realm.GeoBox.html>` defines a rectangle on  
the Earth's surface. You define the rectangle by specifying the bottom left 
(southwest) corner and the top right (northeast) corner. A GeoBox behaves 
in the same way as the corresponding GeoPolygon.

The following example creates 2 boxes:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.geobox.tsx.rst

The following image shows the results of creating two objects: a small box
and a large box.

define. From the example above, this is the result of our queries:

.. _react-native-geopolygon:

GeoPolygon
~~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPolygon <types/Realm.GeoPolygon.html>` defines a polygon 
on the Earth's surface. Because a polygon is a closed shape, you must provide a 
minimum of 4 points: 3 points to define the polygon's shape, and a fourth to 
close the shape.

.. important::

   The fourth point in a polygon must be the same as the first point.

You can also exclude areas within a polygon by defining one or more "holes". A 
hole is another polygon whose bounds fit completely within the outer polygon. 
The following example creates 3 polygons: one is a basic polygon with 5 points, 
one is the same polygon with a single hole, and the third is the same polygon 
with two holes:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.geopolygon.tsx.rst

The following image shows the results of creating three objects: a polygon,
a polygon with one hole, and a polygon with two holes.

Persist Geospatial Data
-----------------------

.. include:: /includes/important-cant-persist-geospatial.rst

If you want to persist geospatial data, it must conform to the 
`GeoJSON spec <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`_. 

Create a GeoJSON-Compatible Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a class that conforms to the GeoJSON spec, you:

1. Create an embedded realm object. For more information about embedded
   objects, refer to :ref:`react-native-data-types-embedded-objects`.

#. At a minimum, add the two fields required by the GeoJSON spec:

   - A field of type ``double[]`` that maps to a "coordinates" (case sensitive) 
     property in the realm schema. 

   - A field of type ``string`` that maps to a "type" property. The value of this 
     field must be "Point".

To simplify geodata persistance, you can define a model that implements 
``CanonicalGeoPoint``, which already has the correct shape. The following 
example shows an embedded class named ``MyGeoPoint`` that is used 
to persist geospatial data.

You then use the custom ``MyGeoPoint`` class in your realm model, as shown in the 
following example. You add instances of your class to the realm just like any other Realm 
model. However, in this example, because the ``MyGeoPoint`` class does not 
extend ``Realm.Object``, we must specify ``MyGeoPoint.schema`` when opening 
the realm:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.open-realm-geospatial.tsx.rst

Write the Embedded Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within ``RealmProvider``, create your geospatial objects by combining the
embedded class with classes that extend ``Realm.Object``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.write-geospatial-object.tsx.rst

The following image shows the results of creating these two company objects.
