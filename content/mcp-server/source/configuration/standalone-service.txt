You can start the MCP Server as a standalone service, which allows the
MCP Server to run independently from an AI client. To start the MCP
Server as a standalone service, use the ``npx`` command.

Standalone Service Using Environment Variables
----------------------------------------------

You can use ``npx`` to start the MCP Server and use environment
variables. You must define the MCP Server environment variables
in the operating system before running ``npx``.

The following examples define MCP Server Unix environment variables to
connect to an Atlas cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID="<atlas-service-account-client-id>"
   export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET="<atlas-service-account-client-secret>"
   export MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://<user-name>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<database-name>"

To use the example, consider these points:

- Replace the option values with your connection information and other
  details.
- To define environment variables for other operating systems, see
  :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-environment-variables`. 
- To examine the list of MCP Server options, see
  :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-options`.
- To create an Atlas service account, see :ref:`mcp-server-prerequisites`.

The following example uses the previous environment variables that have
the connection information, and also sets additional command line
options:

.. code-block:: bash

   npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --readOnly --indexCheck --loggers mcp stderr --logPath=<log-path>

Replace ``<log-path>`` with the directory path to store the log files.

Standalone Service Running as an HTTP Server
--------------------------------------------

The default MCP Server transport protocol is ``stdio``, which is
suitable for integration with most MCP clients.

You can also use the HTTP transport protocol with the MCP Server. HTTP
is useful if you want to interact with the MCP Server from a Web client
or to configure the MCP Server to respond to requests on a specific
port.

.. note::

   HTTP transport is not recommended for production use without
   implementing authentication and security measures. Only use HTTP
   transport if you must use HTTP to interact with the MCP Server.

Security guidelines:

- Implement authentication. For example, use an API gateway or a reverse
  proxy.
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption.
- Deploy the MCP Server behind a firewall or in a private network.
- Implement rate limiting.
- Never expose connection credentials.

To view security recommendations, see :ref:`mcp-server-security` and
:ref:`mcp-server-security-best-practices`.

To start the MCP Server with HTTP transport, use ``--transport http``.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --transport http --readOnly

By default, the MCP Server responds to requests on
``http://127.0.0.1:3000`` and only accepts local connections.

Client Connection URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you connect an MCP client to the HTTP server, the client's connection URL
must include the ``/mcp`` endpoint path. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp

.. _mcp-remote-connections:

Remote Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow remote connections from other computers or containers, bind
the server to all network interfaces using ``--httpHost=0.0.0.0``, 
and the client can then connect from another computer using the 
server's IP address or hostname.

.. warning::

   With Streamable HTTP, the MCP Server is bound to ``localhost
   (127.0.0.1)`` by default. This ensures the MCP Server only accepts
   connections that originate on the same computer.
