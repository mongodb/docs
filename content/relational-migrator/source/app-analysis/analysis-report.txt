The analysis report lists the migration risks detected in your database, and
provides suggested mitigation actions for each one. To see all the potential
migration risks that Relational Migrator can detect, see the :ref:`Migration
Risk Reference <rm-app-analysis-risk-reference>`.

Summary
-------

The :guilabel:`Summary` section lists the overall migration readiness of your
database, and provides a breakdown of the metrics that affect that readiness
level.

Detection Breakdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Detection Breakdown shows how many detections have Actions Required,
are Potential Risks, or are strictly Informational.

Database Object Overview 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Database Object Overview shows detections for Tables, Stored Procedures,
Triggers, and Views. Table risks are further categorized as Data Type, Schema,
Unsupported Feature, or Performance.

.. note::

   Pre-Migration Analysis doesn't analyze the SQL code of stored
   procedures, views, and triggers. If your database has procedures that may
   present an issue, please contact your account representative.

Once you've addressed the migration risks, you can run Pre-Migration Analysis
again by clicking :guilabel:`Rerun analysis` to confirm that there aren't any
more issues.

Database
--------

The :guilabel:`Database` section lists all detected risks for your relational
database. If you use the :guilabel:`Status` column of the table to mark
resolved risks, they are hidden from the list. Check :guilabel:`Include
resolved detections` to show them.

You can switch between tabs for more information on different types of 
detections.

The All detections tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default tab, and shows all detections in a single table. You can
use the dropdown to switch between :guilabel:`Show all`, :guilabel:`Tasks
only`, :guilabel:`Risks only`, and :guilabel:`Notes only`. 

The Tables tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Tables` tab lists detections for each table. The
:guilabel:`Overview and Analysis` toggle shows detections. Switch it to
:guilabel:`Columns` to see the column definitions for the selected table.

The Stored Procedures tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Pre-Migration Analysis doesn't analyze stored procedure SQL code 
   for risks.

The :guilabel:`Stored Procedures` tab shows each procedure. Switch the 
:guilabel:`Overview and Analysis` toggle to :guilabel:`SQL code`
to see the code for the selected procedure.

The Triggers tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Pre-Migration Analysis doesn't analyze trigger SQL code for
   risks, because MongoDB doesn't natively support triggers. Consider using
   :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` to convert your SQL to
   :atlas:`Atlas Triggers </atlas-ui/triggers/>`, in order to replicate
   existing behavior.

The :guilabel:`Triggers` tab shows each trigger. Switch the 
:guilabel:`Overview and Analysis` toggle to :guilabel:`SQL code`
to see the code for the selected trigger.

The Views tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Pre-Migration Analysis doesn't analyze view definitions for
   risks, because views must be converted to MQL. Consider using :ref:`Query
   Converter <rm-query-converter>` to migrate views.

The :guilabel:`Views` tab shows each view. Switch the 
:guilabel:`Overview and Analysis` toggle to :guilabel:`SQL code`
to see the SQL definition for the selected view.

The Incompatible features tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Incompatible features` tab lists incompatible features in your
source database that either don't have a MongoDB equivalent, or work
differently enough that Relational Migrator can't automatically migrate them.

Prerequisites
-------------

The :guilabel:`Prerequisites` section lists necessary tasks to prepare your
database for migration. This is a targeted list of recommendations based on the
information gathered during Pre-Migration Analysis. For more information on
prerequisites, see your database's specific documentation in the  
:ref:`<rm-database-connections>` section.

Resources
---------

The :guilabel:`Planning Resources` section lists links to MongoDB blogs and
documentation content about data modeling and migration.
