   type: Getting Started
   level: beginner
   result_description:
     This guide shows you how to set up a basic React web application that
     connects to your MongoDB Realm app and authenticates an anonymous user.
     
     We put together a finished version of this quickstart on CodeSandbox. All
     you have to do is paste in your Realm App ID to connect to your app.
     
     - `JavaScript CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io/s/realm-web-react-quickstart-rd8j2?file=/src/App.js>`__

   prerequisites:
     This guide assumes that you have already created a MongoDB Realm
     application and enabled anonymous authentication. For details on how to do
     this, see `Create a Realm App <https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/procedures/create-realm-app>`__
     and `Enable Anonymous Authentication <https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/procedures/create-realm-app>`__.
   check_your_environment:
     To create and run this application you will need `npm
     <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__ installed on your machine.
     
     The `create-react-app
     <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/>`__ documentation
     recommends that you install `npx <https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx>`__ to
     run ``create-react-app`` rather than using a version that's installed on
     your machine.

   summary:
     If you have successfully completed this guide, you have created a React
     application that can connect to a MongoDB Realm app and authenticates an
     anonymous user.
