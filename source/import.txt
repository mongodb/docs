Data Import Tools
-----------------

You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments or JSON/CSV files
into |service| using one of the following:

   * - Tools
     - Use Case

   * - :doc:`Live Migrate a replica set </import/live-import>`.

     - To migrate from a MongoDB *replica set*
       into an |service| replica set cluster.

       |service| replica set live migration supports the following
       migration paths:

       .. include:: /includes/list-tables/mongomirror-upgrade-path.rst

       See :doc:`replica set live migration </import/live-import>`
       documentation for complete prerequisites and instructions.

   * - :doc:`Live Migrate a sharded cluster </import/live-import-sharded>`.

     - To migrate from a MongoDB sharded cluster to an |service|
       sharded cluster. |service|
       :doc:`global clusters </global-clusters>` are not valid
       destinations for Live Migration.

       .. include:: /includes/list-tables/mongomirror-upgrade-path-sharded.rst

       See :doc:`sharded cluster live migration </import/live-import-sharded>`
       documentation for complete prerequisites and instructions.

   * - Live Migrate a standalone MongoDB node.

     - :manual:`Convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`
       the standalone MongoDB node to a single-node replica set and
       then use the :doc:`Live Migration </import/live-import>`
       service.

   * - :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>`

     - To migrate from a MongoDB *replica set* into an |service|
       cluster.

       :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>` does not require you to
       shut down your existing replica set or applications.

       .. important::

          :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>` does not import
          user/role data or copy the ``config`` database.

       See the tutorial :doc:`/import/mongomirror`.

   * - :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`

     - To seed an |service| cluster with a BSON dump backup of an
       existing MongoDB deployment.

       .. important::

          :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>` does not restore
          ``system.profile`` collection data.

       See the tutorial :doc:`/import/mongorestore`.

   * - :doc:`mongoimport </import/mongoimport>`

     - To load data from a ``JSON`` or a ``CSV`` file into an |service|
       cluster.

       .. important::

          :binary:`mongoimport` uses :manual:`strict mode
          representation for certain BSON types
          </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`

       See the tutorial :doc:`/import/mongoimport`.

   * - :compass:`MongoDB Compass </import-export/>`

     - To use a :abbr:`GUI (Graphical User Interface)` to load data
       from a ``JSON`` or a ``CSV`` file into an |service| cluster.

       See the tutorial
       :compass:`Import and Export Data in MongoDB Compass </current/import-export>`.

You can also restore from an |service| cluster backup data to another
|service| cluster. For information, see :doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/restore`.

Import Strategies for Common Cluster Configurations
---------------------------------------------------

The following table covers the best import strategy for common cluster
configurations.

.. note::

   If have a source cluster with authentication and you wish to use an
   import strategy which includes using :binary:`mongorestore
   <bin.mongorestore>` with the :option:`--oplogReplay
   <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>` option, you must delete the ``admin``
   directory from the ``dump`` directory created by :binary:`mongodump
   <bin.mongodump>`. The ``admin`` directory contains database user
   information which you cannot add to an Atlas cluster with
   ``mongorestore``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55

   * - Cluster Configuration
     - Import Strategy

   * - A :term:`replica set`.

     - Use :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>`.

       You must provide the hostname of the :term:`primary` to the Live
       Migrate tool.

       If the cluster is running a MongoDB version earlier than 2.6,
       you must first upgrade it to at least MongoDB 2.6.

       You must have access to the primary node's :term:`oplog`. If the
       cluster runs with authentication, you must have credentials that
       provide read access to the primary and its :term:`oplog`.

       See :ref:`live-import-migration-validation` for the full
       list of migration requirements.

   * - A sharded cluster with multiple shards.

     - If your application can tolerate a short period of downtime, use
       :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import-sharded>`. The source
       cluster must run MongoDB 3.6. If the sharded cluster is not
       running MongoDB 3.6, you must upgrade it to MongoDB 3.6.

       If the source cluster enforces authentication, specify a user to
       |service| that exists on every shard *and* the config server
       replica set. The user must have permission to:

       - Stop or start the sharded cluster balancer.
       - Read all databases and collections on the host.
       - Read the oplog on the host.

       See :ref:`live-import-sharded-migration-validation` for the full
       list of migration requirements.

       If near-continuous uptime is a requirement, please contact
       MongoDB. From the |service| UI, click :guilabel:`Support`. Fill
       out a Support ticket, noting your uptime requirements and cluster
       configuration in the :guilabel:`More details` text entry.

       If some downtime is OK and your sharded cluster does not run a
       supported MongoDB version, you may use :binary:`mongodump` and
       :binary:`mongorestore`. See :doc:`/import/mongorestore` and
       :manual:`Backup Sharded Cluster with Database Dumps
       </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>`.

   * - A "single :term:`shard`" :term:`sharded cluster` in ``Compose``.
       This is the standard configuration for new MongoDB deployments
       in ``Compose``.

     - Use :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>`.

       You must `enable the oplog proxy <https://www.compose.com/articles/connecting-to-the-oplog-on-the-new-mongodb/>`_.

       You must specify the hostname and credentials for the oplog
       proxy when connecting from Live Migrate.

       See :ref:`live-import-migration-validation` for the full
       list of migration requirements.

       .. seealso::

          `Migrate from Compose to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-compose/>`_

   * - A standalone MongoDB node.

     - :manual:`Convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`
       the standalone MongoDB node to a single-node replica set and
       then use the :doc:`Live Migration </import/live-import>`
       service.

       If the standalone is running a MongoDB version earlier than 2.6,
       you must first upgrade it to at least MongoDB 2.6.

       If you are running with authentication enabled, you must have
       credentials that provide read access to the primary and its oplog.

       If you cannot convert the standalone to a replica set, use
       :binary:`mongodump` and :binary:`mongorestore`. See
       :doc:`/import/mongorestore`.

   * - A shared multi-tenant cluster, or a cluster where you have no oplog
       access.

     - Use :binary:`mongodump` and :binary:`mongorestore`. See
       :doc:`/import/mongorestore`.

       If you are running with authentication enabled, you must have
       credentials that provide read access to the primary.


|service| has built-in support for :doc:`scaling </scale-cluster>` an ``M0``
Free Tier cluster to an ``M10+`` paid cluster. Alternatively, use
:binary:`mongodump` and :binary:`mongorestore` to copy data from an ``M0``
Free Tier cluster to an ``M10+`` cluster. See :doc:`/import/mongorestore`.
