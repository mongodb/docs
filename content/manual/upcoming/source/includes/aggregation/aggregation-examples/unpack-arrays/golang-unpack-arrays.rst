Create the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses an ``orders`` collection, which contains documents
describing product orders. Because each order contains multiple products,
the first step of the aggregation unpacks the products array into
individual product order documents.

First, create Go structs to model the data in the ``orders``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/models.snippet.order-and-product.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

To create the ``orders`` collection and insert the sample data, add the
following code to your application:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/load-data.snippet.example.go
   :language: go
   :copyable: true
   :category: usage example

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add an unwind stage to unpack the array of product orders.

      First, add an :pipeline:`$unwind` stage to separate the
      entries in the ``products`` array into individual documents:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.unwind.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a match stage for products that cost more than $15.

      Next, add a :pipeline:`$match` stage that matches
      products with a ``products.price`` value greater than ``15``:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.match.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a group stage to group by product type.

      Add a :pipeline:`$group` stage to collect
      order documents by the value of the ``prod_id`` field. In this
      stage, add aggregation operations that create the
      following fields in the result documents:

      - ``product``: the product name
      - ``total_value``: the total value of all the sales of the product
      - ``quantity``: the number of orders for the product

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.group.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add a set stage to display the product ID.

      Add a :pipeline:`$set` stage to recreate the
      ``product_id`` field from the values in the ``_id`` field
      that were set during the ``$group`` stage:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.set.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Add an unset stage to remove unneeded fields.

      Finally, add an :pipeline:`$unset` stage. The
      ``$unset`` stage removes the ``_id`` field from the result
      documents:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.unset.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

   .. step:: Run the aggregation pipeline.

      Add the following code to the end of your application to perform
      the aggregation on the ``orders`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/run-pipeline.snippet.run-agg.go
         :language: go
         :copyable: true
         :category: syntax example

      Finally, run the application and inspect the results.

   .. step:: Interpret the aggregation results.

      The aggregation returns the following summary of customers' orders
      from 2020:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/go/driver/aggregation/pipelines/unwind/output.txt
         :language: text
         :copyable: false
         :category: example return object

      The result documents contain details about the total value and
      quantity of orders for products that cost more than $15.
