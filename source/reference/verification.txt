Before you switch your application load from the source cluster
to the destination cluster, you should verify that the migration
was successful.

Tasks
-----

You should verify your data after every sync. This is important
in cases where you plan to move your application load from the
source to the destination cluster.

   * - Verification Method
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Document Counts <c2c-verify-doc-counts>`
     - The most basic method of verification is to compare the
       number of documents in each synced collection on the
       source cluster to the number on the destination cluster.
       
       Before you can verify data transfer with this method,
       ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.

       This method only verifies a successful sync when run
       against clusters with insert-only workloads.

   * - :ref:`Hash Comparison <c2c-verify-hash-comp>`
     - You can verify sync by comparing MD5 hashes of
       collections synced from the source cluster to the
       destination cluster.

       Before you can verify data transfer with this method,
       ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.

       While hash comparison ensures that the destination
       cluster has received all changes from the source, the
       :dbcommand:`dbHash` command locks the cluster, preventing
       additional writes until it completes.

       Hash comparison is **not** possible with sharded
       clusters. It also does not work with standalone servers
       and replica sets that use MongoDB 4.4 or earlier
       releases, since the document field order can vary.

   * - Document Comparison
     - You can verify sync by comparing documents on the source
       and destination clusters. 

       Write a script that queries collections on the source
       cluster and then checks that the correct documents,
       indexes, collections, metadata, and views exist with the
       same values on the destination cluster.

       Before you can verify data transfer with this method,
       ``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state.

   * - .. _c2c-index-comparison: 

       Index Comparison
     - To verify the transfer of indexes, run the
       :method:`db.collection.getIndexes` method on the source
       and destination clusters and compare the results. 

   * - .. _c2c-metadata-comparison:

       Metadata Comparison
     - To verify the transfer of metadata, run the
       :method:`db.getCollectionInfos` method on the source and
       destination clusters and compare the results.

   * - .. _c2c-shardkey-comparison: 

       Shard Key Comparison
     - To verify the transfer of shard keys to a synced collection, run a query on the ``config.collections``
       collection to find a document whose ``_id`` value is the namespace of the target collection. 
       Compare the ``key`` value of this document in the source and destination clusters.

       For example, for a collection named ``pets`` in the ``records`` database, you can verify the shard key
       using the following query in :binary:`mongosh`: 

       .. io-code-block:: 
          :copyable: true

          .. input::
             :language: javascript 

             db.getSiblingDB("config").collections.find({ _id : "records.pets" }) 

          .. output:: 
             :language: javascript
             :emphasize-lines: 5-7
             :visible: false

             {
                 "_id" : "records.pets",
                 "lastmod" : ISODate("2021-07-21T15:48:15.193Z"),
                 "timestamp": Timestamp(1626882495, 1),
                 "key" : {
                       "_id" : 1
                 },
                 "unique" : false,
                 "lastmodEpoch" : ObjectId("5078407bd58b175c5c225fdc"),
                 "uuid" :  UUID("f8669e52-5c1b-4ea2-bbdc-a00189b341da")
             }

   * - :ref:`Migration Verifier <c2c-migration-verifier>`
     - Migration Verifier connects to the source and destination
       clusters and performs a series of verification checks,
       comparing documents, views, and indexes to confirm the
       sync was successful.

The specific method you use to verify your data depends on your
application workload and the complexity of the data.
