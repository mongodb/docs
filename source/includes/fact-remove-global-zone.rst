If you are using the :manual:`standard connection string format
</reference/connection-string#connections-standard-connection-string-format>`
rather than the :abbr:`DNS (Domain Name Service)` seedlist format,
removing an entire zone from an existing global cluster may result
in a new connection string. 

To verify the correct connection string after deploying the changes:

1. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|. 
 
#. Click :guilabel:`Connect` from the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view.
