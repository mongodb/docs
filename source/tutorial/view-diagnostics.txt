       Chart Selection
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       |mms| displays the available metrics to chart for the selected
       deployment under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` header. Metrics
       are grouped into two sections:

       :guilabel:`MongoDB Metrics`
         Metrics associated with the MongoDB process. For metrics
         related to database performance, such as
         :guilabel:`DB Storage`, |mms| presents the sum total across
         all databases in the deployment.

         If you enable
         :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts`,
         |mms| replaces the :guilabel:`Opcounters` option with the
         individual components of that chart.

       :guilabel:`Hardware Metrics`
         Metrics associated with the host machines supporting the
         deployment.

            - When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``, displays the name
              of each shard in the sharded cluster deployment.

              When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``MONGOS`` or ``CONFIGS``,
              displays the name of each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` or
              config server :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process in the
              sharded cluster deployment.

              Click on a listed component to open the
              :guilabel:`Metrics` view for that component.

          * - :guilabel:`Alerts`

       View Metrics for a Single MongoDB Process
       -----------------------------------------

       To view the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in a
       |mms| deployment, click on that process from the
       :guilabel:`Cluster` view. The |mms| process view displays
       three tabs for monitoring metrics for the process:

       - The :guilabel:`Status` tab displays the process metrics |mms|
         collects from the selected :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or
         :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` process.

       - The :guilabel:`Hardware` tab displays hardware metrics for
         the host machine supporting the selected
         :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
         process.

       - The :guilabel:`DB Stats` tab displays the database metrics for the
         selected database.

         |mms| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but
         adjusts frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on database
         performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
         performance, you can disable collection by clicking
         :guilabel:`Settings` from the left-hand navigation,
         then :guilabel:`Project Settings`, and then setting
         :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to :guilabel:`No`.

       The view for each tab has three distinct sections:

       Chart Controls

          * - :guilabel:`Hottest Collections`

            - Displays the collections with the most operations that
              :manual:`mongotop </reference/program/mongotop/#fields>`
              has reported. For each hot collection, the table also
              displays the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` for the
              collection.

              :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is calculated from the 
              read and write times that 
              :manual:`mongotop </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`
              has reported during a sample period. Specifically, the
              :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is the percentage
              (rounded to the nearest 0.1%) of the read and write
              times for a collection relative to the read and write
              times for all collections in the deployment during the
              sample period. If no read and write operation occur
              during this period, the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent`
              may be 0%.

              The hottest collections correspond to the most current
              time displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is
              running (i.e. not paused), the collections correspond to
              the hottest collections at the current timestamp. If the
              display is paused, the collections correspond to the
              hottest collections at the paused time.

          * - :guilabel:`Slowest Operations`

            - Displays the slowest operations that the
              :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
              has reported.

              The operations correspond to the most current time
              displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is
              running (i.e. not paused), the operations correspond to
              the slowest operations at the current timestamp. If the
              display is paused, the operations correspond to the
              slowest operations at the paused time.

              Click on the operation to view the detailed JSON
              document that 
              :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
              has reported for the operation.

              Users with the
              :ref:`Data Access Admin <data-access-admin-role>`
              role can access buttons to force stop an operation or
              an inactive transaction in the operation details panel.

              - Click :guilabel:`Kill Op` to kill a slow operation.

              - Click :guilabel:`Kill Session` to kill an inactive
