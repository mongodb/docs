Getting Started with Hadoop
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB and Hadoop are a powerful combination and can be used together
to deliver complex analytics and data processing for data stored in
MongoDB. The following guide shows how you can start working with the
MongoDB-Hadoop adapter. Once you become familiar with the adapter, you
can use it to pull your MongoDB data into Hadoop Map-Reduce jobs,
process the data and return results back to a MongoDB collection.

Prerequisites
-------------

Hadoop
~~~~~~

In order to use the following guide, you should already have Hadoop up
and running. This can range from a deployed cluster containing multiple
nodes or a single node pseudo-distributed Hadoop installation running
locally. As long as you are able to run any of the examples on your
Hadoop installation, you should be all set. The following versions of
Hadoop are currently supported:

- 0.20/0.20.x
- 1.0/1.0.x
- 1.1/1.1.x
- 0.21/0.21.x
- CDH3
- CDH4

MongoDB
~~~~~~~

The latest version of MongoDB should be installed and running. In
addition, the MongoDB commands should be in your ``$PATH``.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to Hadoop, you should also have ``git`` and JDK 1.6
installed.

Building MongoDB Adapter
------------------------

The MongoDB-Hadoop adapter source is available on github. First, clone
the repository and get the ``r-1.1.0`` tag:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop.git
   git checkout r1.1.0

Now, edit :file:`build.sbt` and update the build target in ``hadoopRelease`` in
``ThisBuild``. In this example, we're using the CDH3 Hadoop distribution
from Cloudera so I'll set it as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   hadoopRelease in ThisBuild := "cdh3"

If you're using some other distribution of hadoop, you'll need to set this to
the correct value for the distribution you're using. For a list of all
the support distributions and what setting to use to build for each one, check the
listing in the detailed documentation on mongo-hadoop versions 
`here <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/blob/master/README.md#supported-distributions-of-hadoop>`_

To build the adapter, use the self-bootstrapping version of ``sbt`` that
ships with the MongoDB-Hadoop adapter:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./sbt package

Once the adapter is built, you will need to copy it and the latest
stable version of the `MongoDB Java driver`_ to your
``$HADOOP_HOME/lib`` directory. For example, if you have Hadoop
installed in ``/usr/lib/hadoop``:

.. code-block:: sh

   wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/downloads/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/mongo-2.7.3.jar
   cp mongo-2.7.3.jar /usr/lib/hadoop/lib/
   cp core/target/mongo-hadoop-core_cdh3u3-1.0.0.jar /usr/lib/hadoop/lib/

.. _`MongoDB Java driver`: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/downloads

Examples
--------

Load Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB-Hadoop adapter ships with a few examples of how to use the
adapter in your own setup. In this guide, we'll focus on the Treasury Yield example.
To get started, first load the sample data for these examples:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongoimport -d mongo_hadoop -c yield_historical.in examples/treasury_yield/src/main/resources/yield_historical_in.json

To confirm that the sample data was loaded, start the :program:`manual:mongo`
client and look for the ``mongo_hadoop`` database and be sure that it
contains the ``yield_historical.in`` collection:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mongo
   MongoDB shell version: 2.4.3
   connecting to: test
   > show dbs
   mongo_hadoop    0.078GB
   > use mongo_hadoop
   switched to db mongo_hadoop
   > show collections
   system.indexes
   yield_historical.in

Treasury Yield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First let's build the Treasury Yield example:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./sbt treasury-example/package

The treasury yield example comes with a bash script to simplify setting up and
running the job, and will allow you to modify the job settings without needing to
re-compile the package each time. To use it, you will need to tweak the settings 
in the script to reflect your environment.
Edit the script to set the input and output URIs for the job:

.. code-block:: sh

   vim examples/treasury_yield/run_job.sh

In the beginning of the script, you will need to set the following variables:

- INPUT_URI, the mongodb URI where the input data is loaded from
- OUTPUT_URI, the mongodb URI where the job output will be written to
- HADOOP_HOME, the location of your hadoop directory, which must contain a bin/hadoop path.

Once this is ready, you can run the script to submit the job:

.. code-block:: sh

   bash examples/treasury_yield/run_job.sh

This job should only take a few moments as it's a relatively small
amount of data. Now check the output collection data in MongoDB to
confirm that the MapReduce job was successful:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mongo
   MongoDB shell version: 2.0.5
   connecting to: test
   > use mongo_hadoop
   switched to db mongo_hadoop
   > db.yield_historical.out.find()
   { "_id" : 1990, "value" : 8.552400000000002 }
   { "_id" : 1991, "value" : 7.8623600000000025 }
   ...

Where to go from here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the full documentation on the mongo-hadoop adapter 
`here <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/blob/master/README.md#supported-distributions-of-hadoop>`_.
To modify configuration options, you can put additional lines in the run_job.sh script to set
properties passed to hadoop at runtime. Read the full comments of the script to see details on
using these options to read/write from BSON as well as mongoDB collections.
