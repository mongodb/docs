You must be using MongoDB version 3.0 or greater in order to use the
WiredTiger storage engine. If using an earlier MongoDB version, you
must upgrade your MongoDB version before proceeding to change your
storage engine. To upgrade your MongoDB version, refer to the
appropriate version of the manual.
