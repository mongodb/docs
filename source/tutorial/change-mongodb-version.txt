You can upgrade or downgrade MongoDB versions within the same Feature
Compatibility Version (FCV) in |mms| :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`,
:manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, and :term:`standalone MongoDB instances <standalone>`
while maximizing the availability of your deployments.

You can :doc:`add custom-built versions of MongoDB </tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version>`
for |mms| to download.

If |mms| does not manage your deployment, you need to change the version
of MongoDB manually. To learn more, see upgrade tutorials for each 
:manual:`MongoDB release </release-notes>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Remove Incompatible MongoDB Features when Downgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB deployment has set its
:guilabel:`Feature Compatibility Version` to the same release series
as its :guilabel:`Version`, you must first downgrade the
:manual:`featureCompatibilityVersion</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of the instance manually.
