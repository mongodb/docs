Use Second Person and Imperative Mood
=====================================

Write to the User
-----------------

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. Use
*second person* to talk to users directly, addressing the user as
*you*. Second person promotes a friendly tone.

-  Use second person with the imperative mood (in which the subject
   *you* is understood) and active voice to eliminate wordiness and
   confusion about who or what initiates an action, especially in
   procedural steps.

   .. tip::

      All of the guidelines in this list, and most of the guidelines in
      the style guide, use second person, imperative mood, and active
      voice.

-  Use second person to avoid the use of gender-specific, third-person
   pronouns:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 4

      - *he*
      - *she*
      - *his*
      - *hers*
      - *him*
      - *her*
      - *himself*
      - *herself*

   If you must use third person, use the pronouns:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 4

      - *they*
      - *them*
      - *their*
      - *themselves*

   Verify that the pronoun's antecedent is plural.

   Using third person rarely makes sense. Second person should address
   most reference and instructional material.

-  Use first-person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These
   pronouns emphasize the writer or MongoDB rather than the user.
   Before using first-person pronouns, consider second person or
   imperative mood instead.

   - Use *we recommend* rather than *it's recommended* or *MongoDB
     recommends*. Limit how often you state recommendations. This
     expresses an opinion on behalf of MongoDB. Make sure that the
     engineering team or TSE team has expressed this opinion before
     stating anything as a recommendation. You should be prepared to
     defend any recommendations you publish with a ticket number from
     engineering or the TSE organization.

   - You can use *we* in the place of *MongoDB* if necessary.

-  Use the first-person singular pronoun *I* only in the question part
   of FAQs.

-  Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document.

Avoid the Subjunctive Mood

readers about our content!* Avoid words that imply uncertainty:

- should
- could
- would

Readers expect documentation to be authoritative. If you don't know
which one of two options is correct, research or ask engineering to
find the exact answer. Document what you discover. Don't use language
that gives the user more questions.

.. note::

   Production notes and other similar resources where we recommend best practices configuration settings for use with MongoDB offerings.

   .. example::

      You should set your ``vm.swappiness`` to ``1`` if possible.

   This language presents an ideal configuration, but does not
   *mandate* it.
