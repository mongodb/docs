You can store :term:`vector embeddings <vector embeddings>` 
alongside your other MongoDB data. These embeddings 
capture meaningful relationships in your data and allow you 
to perform semantic search and implement :ref:`RAG <avs-rag>`.

Get Started
-----------

Use the following tutorial to learn how to 
create vector embeddings and query them using vector search.
Specifically, you perform the following actions:

#. Define a function that uses an :ref:`embedding model
   <choose-embedding-method>` to generate vector embeddings.

   Select whether you want to
   use a proprietary or open-source model. 
   For state-of-the-art embeddings, use Voyage AI.

#. Create embeddings from your data and store 
   them in MongoDB.
    
   Select whether you want to create embeddings from new data 
   or from existing data that you already have in MongoDB.

#. Create embeddings from your search terms and 
   run a vector search query.
  
For production applications, you typically write a script 
to generate vector embeddings. You can start with the sample
code on this page and customize it for your use case.

   Create Embeddings from Data
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In this section, you create vector embeddings from your data 
   using the function that you defined, and then you store these embeddings
   in a MongoDB collection.

   Create Embeddings for Queries
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In this section, you index the vector embeddings in your collection 
   and create an embedding that you use to run a sample vector search query.

   The vector search returns documents 
   whose embeddings are closest in distance to the embedding 
   from your query. This indicates that they 
   are similar in meaning.

.. _embeddings-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

Consider the following factors when creating vector embeddings:

.. _choose-embedding-method:

Choosing a Method to Create Embeddings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to create vector embeddings, you must use an 
:ref:`embedding model <choose-embedding-model>`.
Embedding models are algorithms that you use to 
generate numerical representations of your data.
Choose one of the following ways to access an embedding model:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - Load an open-source model
     - If you don't have an |api| key for a proprietary embedding model,
       load an open-source embedding model locally from your application.

   * - Use a proprietary model
     - Most AI providers offer |api|\s for their proprietary 
       embedding models that you can use to create vector embeddings.
       For state-of-the-art embeddings, use `Voyage AI 
       <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/introduction>`__.

   * - Leverage an integration
     - You can :ref:`integrate <vector-search-integrations>` {+avs+} 
       with open-source frameworks and AI services to quickly connect to 
       both open-source and proprietary embedding models 
       and generate vector embeddings for {+avs+}. 
       
       To learn more, see :ref:`vector-search-integrations`.

.. _choose-embedding-model:

Choosing an Embedding Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The embedding model you choose affects your query results
and determines the number of dimensions you 
specify in your {+avs+} index. Each model offers 
different advantages depending on your data and use case.
For state-of-the-art embeddings, including multi-modal
and domain-specific embedding models, use `Voyage AI
<https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/introduction>`__.

When choosing an embedding model for {+avs+},
consider the following metrics:

- **Embedding Dimensions**: The length of the vector embedding.

  Smaller embeddings are more storage efficient, while larger embeddings 
  can capture more nuanced relationships in your data. 
  The model you choose should strike a balance between 
  efficiency and complexity.

- **Max Tokens**: The number of `tokens 
  <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them>`__
  that can be compressed in a single embedding.

- **Model Size**: The size of the model in gigabytes. 

  While larger models perform better, they require
  more computational resources as you
  scale {+avs+} to production.

- **Retrieval Average**: A score that measures the performance of retrieval systems.
  
  A higher score indicates that the model is 
  better at ranking relevant documents higher in the list of retrieved 
  results. This score is important when choosing a model 
  for :ref:`RAG <avs-rag>` applications.

.. _avs-vector-compression:

Vector Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a large number of float vectors and want to reduce the
storage and :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger/>` footprint 
(such as disk and memory usage) in ``mongod``, compress your embeddings 
by converting them to ``binData`` vectors.

:manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` is a |bson| data type 
that stores binary data. The default type for vector embeddings is an
array of 32-bit floats (``float32``). Binary data is more storage efficient than 
the default array format, and therefore requires three times less disk space.

Storing ``binData`` vectors improves query performance
since less resources are needed to load a document into the working set. 
This can significantly improve query speed for vector queries where you are 
returning over 20 documents. If you compress your ``float32`` embeddings, 
you can query them with either ``float32`` or ``binData`` vectors.

The tutorial on this page includes an :ref:`example function 
<define-embedding-functions>` that you can use to convert your 
``float32`` vectors to ``binData`` vectors.
  
Supported Drivers
`````````````````

|bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors
are supported by the following drivers:

.. include:: /includes/avs/bson-bindata-vectors/avs-bson-bindata-supported-drivers.rst

Background
``````````

Float vectors are typically difficult to compress because each 
element in the array has its own type (despite most vectors 
being uniformly typed). For this reason, converting 
the float vector output of an embedding model to a ``binData`` 
vector with subtype ``float32`` is a more efficient 
serialization scheme. ``binData`` vectors store a single type 
descriptor for the entire vector, which reduces storage overhead.

.. _validating-embeddings:

Validating Your Embeddings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following strategies to ensure that your 
embeddings are correct and optimal:

.. collapsible:: 
   :heading: Best Practices
   :sub_heading: Learn best practices when creating embeddings.
   :expanded: false

   Consider the following best practices
   when generating and querying your embeddings:

   - **Test your functions and scripts**.

     Generating embeddings takes time and computational resources. 
     Before you create embeddings from large datasets or collections, 
     test that your embedding functions or scripts work as expected
     on a small subset of your data.

   - **Create embeddings in batches**.

     If you want to generate embeddings
     from a large dataset or a collection with many documents, 
     create them in batches to avoid memory issues and optimize performance.

   - **Evaluate performance**.

     Run test queries to check if your search results are relevant 
     and accurately ranked. 
     
     To learn more about how to evaluate your results and fine-tune
     the performance of your indexes and queries, see 
     :ref:`avs-improve-results` and :ref:`avs-performance-tuning`.

.. collapsible:: 
   :heading: Troubleshooting
   :sub_heading: Learn strategies to troubleshoot issues with your embeddings.
   :expanded: false

   Consider the following strategies if you encounter issues 
   with your embeddings:

   - **Verify your environment**.

     Check that the necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date. 
     Conflicting library versions can cause unexpected behavior. 
     Ensure that no conflicts exist by creating a new environment and 
     installing only the required packages.

     .. include:: /includes/avs/facts/fact-colab-ip-address.rst

   - **Monitor memory usage**.

     If you experience performance issues, check your RAM, CPU, and disk usage
     to identify any potential bottlenecks. For hosted environments 
     like Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, ensure that your instance is 
     provisioned with sufficient resources and upgrade the instance 
     if necessary.

   - **Ensure consistent dimensions**.
     
     Verify that the {+avs+} index definition matches the dimensions of the   
     embeddings stored in MongoDB and your query embeddings match the 
     dimensions of the indexed embeddings. Otherwise, you might
     encounter errors when running vector search queries.

   To troubleshoot specific problems, see :ref:`vector-search-troubleshooting`.

Next Steps  
----------

Once you've learned how to create embeddings and 
query your embeddings with {+avs+}, start building 
generative AI applications by implementing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):

- :ref:`avs-rag`
- :ref:`local-rag`

You can also quantize your 32-bit float vector 
embeddings into fewer bits to further reduce 
resource consumption and improve query speed. 
To learn more, see :ref:`avs-quantization`.
