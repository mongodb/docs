----------

.. pipeline:: $redact

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Restricts the contents of the documents based on information stored
   in the documents themselves.

   .. include:: /images/redact-security-architecture.rst

   The :pipeline:`$redact` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $redact: <expression> }

   The argument can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves to `$$DESCEND`_,
   `$$PRUNE`_, or `$$KEEP`_ system variables. For more information on
   expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 50

      * - System Variable

        - Description

      * - _`$$DESCEND`

        - :pipeline:`$redact` returns the fields at the current document level,
          excluding embedded documents. To include embedded documents and
          embedded documents within arrays, apply the :expression:`$cond`
          expression to the embedded documents to determine access for these
          embedded documents.

      * - _`$$PRUNE`

        - :pipeline:`$redact` excludes all fields at this current
          document/embedded document level, **without** further inspection of
          any of the excluded fields. This applies even if the excluded
          field contains embedded documents that may have different access
          levels.

      * - _`$$KEEP`

        - :pipeline:`$redact` returns or keeps all fields at this
          current document/embedded document level, **without** further
          inspection of the fields at this level. This applies even if
          the included field contains embedded documents that may have
          different access levels.

Examples
--------

The examples in this section use the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper provided in the 2.6 version
of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

Evaluate Access at Every Document Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``forecasts`` collection contains documents of the following form
where the ``tags`` field lists the different access values for that
document/embedded document level; i.e. a value of ``[ "G", "STLW" ]``
specifies either ``"G"`` or ``"STLW"`` can access the data:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    _id: 1,
    title: "123 Department Report",
    tags: [ "G", "STLW" ],
    year: 2014,
    subsections: [
      {
        subtitle: "Section 1: Overview",
        tags: [ "SI", "G" ],
        content:  "Section 1: This is the content of section 1."
      },
      {
        subtitle: "Section 2: Analysis",
        tags: [ "STLW" ],
        content: "Section 2: This is the content of section 2."
      },
      {
        subtitle: "Section 3: Budgeting",
        tags: [ "TK" ],
        content: {
          text: "Section 3: This is the content of section3.",
          tags: [ "HCS" ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }

A user has access to view information with either the tag ``"STLW"`` or
``"G"``. To run a query on all documents with year ``2014`` for this
user, include a :pipeline:`$redact` stage as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var userAccess = [ "STLW", "G" ];
   db.forecasts.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { year: 2014 } },
        { $redact: {
           $cond: {
              if: { $gt: [ { $size: { $setIntersection: [ "$tags", userAccess ] } }, 0 ] },
              then: "$$DESCEND",
              else: "$$PRUNE"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
   );

The aggregation operation returns the following "redacted" document:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "_id" : 1,
    "title" : "123 Department Report",
    "tags" : [ "G", "STLW" ],
    "year" : 2014,
    "subsections" : [
      {
        "subtitle" : "Section 1: Overview",
        "tags" : [ "SI", "G" ],
        "content" : "Section 1: This is the content of section 1."
      },
      {
        "subtitle" : "Section 2: Analysis",
        "tags" : [ "STLW" ],
        "content" : "Section 2: This is the content of section 2."
      }
    ]
  }

.. seealso:: :expression:`$size`, :expression:`$setIntersection`

Exclude All Fields at a Given Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection ``accounts`` contains the following document:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    _id: 1,
    level: 1,
    acct_id: "xyz123",
    cc: {
      level: 5,
      type: "yy",
      num: 000000000000,
      exp_date: ISODate("2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
      billing_addr: {
        level: 5,
        addr1: "123 ABC Street",
        city: "Some City"
      },
      shipping_addr: [
        {
          level: 3,
          addr1: "987 XYZ Ave",
          city: "Some City"
        },
        {
          level: 3,
          addr1: "PO Box 0123",
          city: "Some City"
        }
      ]
    },
    status: "A"
  }

In this example document, the ``level`` field determines the access
level required to view the data.

To run a query on all documents with status ``A`` and exclude *all*
fields contained in a document/embedded document at level ``5``, include a
:pipeline:`$redact` stage that specifies the system variable
``"$$PRUNE"`` in the ``then`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.aggregate(
     [
       { $match: { status: "A" } },
       {
         $redact: {
           $cond: {
             if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] },
             then: "$$PRUNE",
             else: "$$DESCEND"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   );

The :pipeline:`$redact` stage evaluates the ``level`` field to
determine access. If the ``level`` field equals ``5``, then exclude all
fields at that level, even if the excluded field contains embedded documents
that may have different ``level`` values, such as the ``shipping_addr``
field.

The aggregation operation returns the following "redacted" document:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "_id" : 1,
    "level" : 1,
    "acct_id" : "xyz123",
    "status" : "A"
  }

The result set shows that the :pipeline:`$redact` stage excluded
the field ``cc`` as a whole, including the ``shipping_addr`` field
which contained embedded documents that had ``level`` field values equal to
``3`` and not ``5``.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/implement-field-level-redaction` for
   steps to set up multiple combinations of access for the same data.
