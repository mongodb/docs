  To change a field value, MongoDB provides update operators, such as
  :mongodb:update:`~up.$set` to modify values. Some update operators, including ``$set``,
  will also create a new field if the specified field does not exist in
  the document.

  The following operation updates the **first** document with ``item`` equal
  to ``paper`` and uses :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>` to
  reference the ``uom`` field in the ``size`` embedded document. The
  operation also uses the :mongodb:update:`~up.$currentDate` operator to
  set the ``lastModified`` field to the current date.
