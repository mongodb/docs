{+df+} Costs
---------------------

You incur {+adf+} costs for the following items:

- Storage on the cloud object storage
- Data processed by {+df+}
- Data returned by {+df+}

Total Data Processed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that {+df+} processes 
from your |aws| S3 buckets, rounded up to the nearest megabyte. 
|service| charges **$5.00 per TB** of processed data, with a minimum of 
**10 MB** or **$0.00005 per query**.

.. include:: /includes/data-federation/fact-partition-cost-benefit.rst

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |aws| |s3| to
reduce the amount of processed data.

Total Data Returned and Transferred
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned and 
transferred by {+df+}. This total is the sum of all the following 
data transfers:

- The number of bytes transferred between internal {+df+} service nodes
- The number of bytes transferred from {+df+} to the client
- The number of bytes written by {+df+} during 
  :ref:`adf-out-stage` or :ref:`adf-merge-stage` operations

Returned data is billed as outlined in the :guilabel:`Data Transfer
Fees` section of the `Atlas pricing page 
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing?tck=docs_atlas>`_. The 
cost of data transfer depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges 
for same-region, region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer.

Current pricing can be found at 
:website:`MongoDB.com/pricing </pricing>`.
