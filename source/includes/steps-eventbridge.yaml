  To send trigger events to AWS EventBridge, you need the :guilabel:`AWS
  account ID` of the account that should receive the events.

  Open the `Amazon EventBridge console
  <https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/>`_ and click
  :guilabel:`Partner event sources` in the navigation menu. Search for
  the :guilabel:`MongoDB` partner event source and then click
  :guilabel:`Set up`.

title: Configure the Trigger
ref: configure-the-trigger
content: |
  Once you have the :guilabel:`AWS account ID`, you can configure a
  trigger to send events to EventBridge. In the Atlas UI, create and
  configure a new :ref:`database trigger <database-triggers>` or
  :ref:`scheduled trigger <scheduled-triggers>` and select the
  :guilabel:`EventBridge` event type.

  Paste in the :guilabel:`AWS Account ID` that you copied from
  EventBridge and select an AWS Region to send the trigger events to.

  Go back to the EventBridge console and choose Partner event sources in
  the navigation pane. In the :guilabel:`Partner event sources` table,
  find and select the :guilabel:`Pending` trigger source and then click
  :guilabel:`Associate with event bus`.

  On the :guilabel:`Associate with event bus` screen, define any
  required access permissions for other accounts and organizations and
  then click :guilabel:`Associate`.

  Once confirmed, the status of the trigger event source changes from
  :guilabel:`Pending` to :guilabel:`Active`, and the name of the event
  bus updates to match the event source name. You can now start creating
  rules that trigger on events from that partner event source. For more
  information, see `Creating a Rule That Triggers on an SaaS Partner
  Event
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-rule-partner-events.html>`_.
