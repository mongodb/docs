   There are two mutually exclusive options for shard keys:

   - Check :guilabel:`hashed` if you want to use a
     :manual:`hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` shard key. You can expand  
     :guilabel:`Advanced Settings` to optionally optimize the
     distribution of documents in your collection. To optimize, you can
     do the following: 

     - Select the checkbox for ``presplitHashedZones`` to perform
       initial chunk creation and distribution for an empty or
       non-existing collection based on the defined zones and zone
       ranges for the collection. 
     - Specify the minimum number of chunks to create initially when
       sharding an empty collection with a hashed shard key. We
       recommend ``2`` chunks, but you can specify up to ``8192`` per
       shard. This setting corresponds to the MongoDB
       ``numInitialChunks`` setting for sharded collections.
       
     To learn more about these options, see
     :manual:`sh.shardCollection()
     </reference/method/sh.shardCollection/>`.  

   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A Shard Key cannot be unique *and* hashed.

   - You may hash up to one key in a compound shard key.
   
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A compound shard key cannot include more than three keys.

   .. important::
      
      Hashing a compound shard key is supported starting in MongoDB 
      version 4.4. If you hash a compound shard key and want to 
      downgrade to |fcv-link| 4.2, you must first drop the sharded 
      collection with a hashed key.
