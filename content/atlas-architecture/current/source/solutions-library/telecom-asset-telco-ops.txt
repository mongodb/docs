Streamline network management with AI-powered solutions,
to reduce human effort while gaining valuable insights.

**Use cases:** `Gen AI`_

**Industries:** Telecommunications_

**Products:** `MongoDB Atlas`_, :ref:`MongoDB Aggregation
Pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>`, `MongoDB Atlas Vector
Search`_, `MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing`_

Solution Overview
-----------------

Communication Service Providers (CSPs) manage massive volumes of
data generated by billions of connected devices to ensure
seamless and uninterrupted operations. To accomplish this, they
rely on data-intensive network management systems that monitor
critical performance metrics, like latency, maintain reliability
during network congestion, and uphold stringent security
measures to protect against cyberattacks. 

This solution integrates MongoDB with `Large Language Models`_
(LLM) and adopts a `Retrieval-Augmented Generation`_ (RAG)
strategy to implement a chatbot. The chatbot taps into network
logs, maintenance records, customer data, and sensor data stored
in MongoDB to provide actionable insights for anomaly detection,
root-cause analysis, mitigation recommendations, and more.

The chatbot empowers network operators to manage complex
workflows with minimal human involvement, accelerating the
rollout of new services.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

There are three main components of this solution:

- **Source data ingestion:** This component ingests log entries
  and telemetry events in real time to capture details, like IP
  addresses, geographic data, request paths, timestamps, router
  logs, and sensor data. Stream processing capabilities of
  MongoDB allows it to automatically capture and process
  incoming data into MongoDB Atlas and create a comprehensive
  view of network activity.

- **Question-based data selection:** Network managers then pose
  questions, such as "What might cause video streaming issues
  for a client in Toronto?" The query undergoes initial
  processing where the LLM generates a custom aggregation
  pipeline to select select the appropriate data for analysis.
  Concurrently, `vector-embedded data`_ is efficiently retrieved
  through `semantic search`_, allowing for the extraction of
  closely related information.

- **Inference and natural language output:** A subsequent LLM
  translates relevant data retrieved from MongoDB into natural
  language explanations for the user. The LLM analyzes the data
  to detect patterns and anomalies, enabling precise
  identification of root cause candidates and supporting
  informed decision-making. For example, it might uncover that
  an overloaded local CDN node, along with high requests from
  older routers, are causing the problem.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

This solution leverages server network logs, organized as time
series data, using the following MongoDB schema:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   {
      "_id": ObjectId("..."),
      "source_id": 12345,  
      "source_type": "webserver",  
      "timestamp": ISODate("2025-02-19T15:12:57.000Z"),  
      "category": "accesslog",  
      "event": "GET",  
      "value": { 
         "type": "url", 
         "data": "https://mytv.telco.com/login" 
      }
   }

Build the Solution
---------------------

This AI-powered network management solution employs a RAG
framework with MongoDB Atlas to enhance data-driven diagnostics
in complex telecommunication environments.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **MongoDB and gen AI transform network management:**
  Integrate LLMs with MongoDB's capabilities like aggregation
  pipelines and vector search to streamline network management by
  reducing human intervention, optimizing processes, and
  automating critical operations.

- **Data management is critical:** Network management systems
  produce vast amounts of data from network logs and user
  requests, creating substantial challenges in data
  interoperability, privacy, and efficient processing. Effective
  solutions require flexible, scalable databases that can store
  and handle high-frequency, complex data streams.

- **MongoDB offers tools to drive AI-powered solutions:** A
  robust database infrastructure, combined with a flexible
  document model and advanced vector search capabilities, allow
  CSPs to develop AI applications. Vector search streamlines the
  retrieval of semantically relevant content, boosting the
  performance of the LLMs behind chatbot technologies.
