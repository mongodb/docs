  To configure additional cluster options, toggle
  :guilabel:`Select Multi-Region, Workload Isolation, and Replication Options (M10+ clusters)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`. Use these options to add cluster nodes in
  different geographic regions with different workload priorities,
  and direct application queries to the appropriate cluster nodes.

  .. note:: AWS Only

     If this is the first ``M10+`` dedicated paid cluster for the
     selected region or regions *and* you plan on creating one or more
     |vpc| peering connections, please review the documentation
     on :doc:`VPC Peering Connections </security-vpc-peering>` before
     continuing.

  The following options are available when configuring cross-region
  clusters:

  :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`
     .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/multicloud/electable-nodes-high-avail.rst

     Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to add a new row for region
     selection and select the region from the dropdown. Specify the
     desired number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region. The total
     number of electable nodes across all regions in the cluster must
     be 3, 5, or 7.


     When selecting a :guilabel:`Region`, regions marked as
     :guilabel:`Recommended` provide higher availability compared to
     other regions. For more information, see:

     - :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`.
     - :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`.

     Each node in the selected regions can participate in replica set
     :term:`elections <election>`, and can become the :term:`primary`
     as long as the majority of nodes in the replica set are available.

     You can improve the replication factor of single-region clusters
     by increasing the number of :guilabel:`Nodes` for your
     :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region. You do not have to add
     additional regions to modify the replication factor of your
     :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

     To remove a region, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon next to that
     region. You cannot remove the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

     |service| provides checks for whether your selected cross-regional
     configuration provides availability during partial or whole
     regional outages. To ensure availability during a full region
     outage, you need at least one node in three different regions. To
     ensure availability during a partial region outage, you must have
     at least 3 electable nodes in a :guilabel:`Recommended` region
     *or* at least 3 electable nodes across at least 2 regions.

  :guilabel:`Read-only nodes for optimal local reads`
     Use read-only nodes to optimize local reads in
     the nodes' respective service areas.

     Click :guilabel:`Add a region` to select a region in which to
     deploy read-only nodes. Specify the desired number of
     :guilabel:`Nodes` for the region.

     Read-only nodes cannot provide high availability because they
     cannot participate in :term:`elections <election>`, or become the
     :term:`primary` for their cluster. Read-only nodes have
     :ref:`distinct replica set tags <replica-set-tags>`
     that allow you to direct queries to desired regions.

     To remove a read-only region, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon
     next to that region.

  :guilabel:`Analytics nodes for workload isolation`
     .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/multicloud/create-cluster-analytics-nodes.rst

     Analytics nodes cannot participate in
     :term:`elections <election>` or become the :term:`primary` for
     their cluster.

     To remove an analytics node, click the :icon:`trash-alt` icon
     next to that region.

     </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>` in the MongoDB manual.

  .. note::

     Having a large number of regions or having nodes spread across
     long distances may lead to long election times or replication lag.

  Select your preferred cluster tier. The selected cluster tier
  dictates the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops| specification for each
  data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the cluster.

  |service| categorizes the cluster tiers as follows:

  :guilabel:`Shared Clusters`
    Sandbox replica set clusters for getting started with MongoDB.
    These clusters deploy to a shared environment with access to a
    subset of |service| features and functionality. For complete
    documentation on shared cluster limits and restrictions,
    see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

    |service| provides an option to deploy
    one ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} replica set per project. You can
    :doc:`scale up </scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} to
    a {+Flex-cluster+} or a {+Dedicated-cluster+} at any time.

    ``M2`` and ``M5`` are :ref:`deprecated <flex-migration>` low-cost
    {+Shared-cluster+} tiers. These cluster tiers provide the following
    additional features and functionality compared to ``M0`` cluster tiers:

    - :ref:`Backups <m2-m5-snapshots>` for your cluster data.

    - Increased storage.

    - :doc:`API access </api>`.

    .. note::

       |service| deploys the latest supported MongoDB version for all
       cluster tiers in the :guilabel:`Shared Clusters` tier. However,
       Shared Clusters may not support all functionality. To learn more,
       see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

    |service| supports shared cluster deployment in a subset of
    Cloud Providers and Regions. |service| greys out any
    shared cluster tier not supported by the selected
    cloud service provider and region. For a complete list of
    regions that support shared cluster deployments, see:

    - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
    - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
    - :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Clusters (for development and low-traffic applications)`
    Cluster tiers that support development environments and low-traffic
    applications.

    These cluster tiers support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
    provide full access to |service| features and functionality.

  :guilabel:`Dedicated Clusters (for production and high-traffic applications)`
    Clusters that support production environments with high traffic
    applications and large datasets.

    These cluster tiers support replica set and sharded cluster
    deployments with full access to |service| features and
    functionality.

    Some cluster tiers have variants, denoted by the |angle| character.
    When you select these cluster tiers, |service| lists the variants
    and tags each cluster tier to distinguish their key characteristics.

    .. note::

       Changing the cluster tier for a production cluster will
       require downtime if you are scaling up a tenant cluster (M0, Flex, M2, M5)

ref: cluster-option-customizeStorage
content: |

  Each cluster tier comes with a default set of resources.
  Clusters of size M10 and larger provide the ability to customize
  your storage capacity.

  |service| provides the following storage configuration options,
  depending on the selected cloud provider and cluster tier.

  .. _storage-class-ui:

  - :guilabel:`Cluster Class` (AWS only)

    Clusters of size M40 and larger on AWS offer multiple options,
    including:

    - :guilabel:`Low CPU`
    - :guilabel:`General`
    - :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD`

      Locally attached ephemeral :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>`
      offer the highest level of speed and performance.

    Select the :guilabel:`Class` box with your preferred speed.
    Changes to cluster class affect :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

  .. _storage-capacity-ui:

  - :guilabel:`Storage Capacity`

    The size of the server data volume. To change this, either:

    - Specify the exact disk size in the text box, *or*

    - Move the slide bar until the text box displays your preferred
      disk size.

    Changes to storage capacity affect
    :ref:`cost <instance-size-costs>`.

    .. include:: /includes/fact-auto-expand-storage.rst

  .. _storage-iops-ui:

  - :guilabel:`IOPS` (configurable for AWS only)

    .. important::

       .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/minimum-iops.rst

       .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/extended-storage-limit.rst

       For clusters with :guilabel:`Auto-Expand Storage` enabled,
       |service| respects the calculated maximum storage for the
       selected cluster tier. Users whose disk capacity reaches the
       allowable limit receive notification by email.

  To deploy your cluster as a :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>`,
  toggle :guilabel:`Shard your cluster (M30 and up)` to ``Yes``.

  :term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` support horizontal scaling and
  consist of :manual:`shards </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`,
  :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` and
  :term:`mongos <mongos>` routers:

  .. include:: /includes/list-sharded-cluster-components.rst

  in the MongoDB manual.

---
ref: cluster-option-clusterShardingNum
content: |

  This field is visible only if the deployment is a sharded {+cluster+}.

  Your cluster can have between 1 and 70 shards, inclusive.

  To scale up a replica set to a multi-sharded {+cluster+},
  you must scale up to a **single** shard {+cluster+} first,
  restart your application and **reconnect to the cluster**, and then add
  additional shards.

  If you don't reconnect the application clients, your application may suffer
  from data outages.

  After you scale up a replica set {+cluster+} to a single-shard {+cluster+},
  you can set the number of shards to deploy with the sharded {+cluster+}.

  If you are reducing the number of shards in your sharded {+cluster+},
  |service| removes shards in descending order based on the number in the
  ``"_id"`` field (see :manual:`Sharded Cluster Configuration </tutorial/view-sharded-cluster-configuration/>`).
  For example, consider a sharded {+cluster+} with the following three shards:

  - ``"shard0"``
  - ``"shard1"``
  - ``"shard2"``

  If you set the number of shards to two, |service| 
  removes ``"shard2"`` from the {+cluster+}.

ref: cluster-option-clusterBackup
content: |
  
  Backups are automatically enabled for ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared-tier
  {+clusters+} and you can't disable them. To learn more, see
  :ref:`m2-m5-snapshots`.

  Backups are automatically enabled for {+Flex-clusters+} and you can't
  disable them. To learn more, see  :ref:`flex-snapshots`.

  To enable backups for an ``M10+`` |service| {+cluster+}, toggle
  :guilabel:`Turn on Backup (M10 and up)` to ``Yes``.
  If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at
  regular intervals and retains them according to your project's
  :ref:`retention policy <cloud-provider-retention-policy>`.

  |service| provides :ref:`/backup/cloud-backup/overview` for ``M10+``
  {+clusters+}.

  |service| takes either full copy snapshots (for Azure-backed
  clusters) or incremental snapshots (for AWS and GCP-backed
  clusters) of data in your cluster
  and allows you to restore from those snapshots. |service|
  stores snapshots in the same cloud provider region as the
  replica set member targeted for snapshots.

  If you enable {+Cloud-Backup+}s for your cluster, you
  also have the option to enable the {+PIT-Restore+}
  option. {+PIT-Restore+} allows you to restore your cluster
  to any time during your restore window, which you can configure
  with the :ref:`Backup Policy Editor <cps-backup-policies>`.

   To enable `BI Connector for Atlas
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/master/>`__ for this cluster,
   toggle :guilabel:`Enable Business Intelligence Connector (M10 and
   up)` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-bi-cluster-requirements.rst

   If enabled, select the node type from which |bic|
   should read.

   .. _bic-read-preferences:

   The following table describes the available read preferences for
   |bic| and their corresponding
   :manual:`readPreference </reference/read-preference>` and
   :manual:`readPreferenceTag </core/read-preference/#tag-sets>`
   connection string options.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 30 20 30

      * - |bic-short| Read Preference
        - Description
        - readPreference
        - readPreferenceTags

      * - Primary
        - Read from the :term:`primary` node.
        - ``primary``
        - None

      * - Secondary
        - Read from :term:`secondary` nodes.
        - ``secondary``
        - ``nodeType:ELECTABLE,nodeType:READ_ONLY``

      * - Analytics
        - |bic| reads from analytics nodes.
        - ``secondary``
        - ``nodeType:ANALYTICS``

   The ``nodeType`` read preference tag dictates the type of node |bic|
   connects to. The possible values for this option are as follows:

   - ``ELECTABLE`` restricts |bic-short| to the :term:`primary` and
     electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

   - ``READ-ONLY`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
     non-electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

   - ``ANALYTICS`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
     :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`.

     .. tip::

        When using a ``readPreference`` of ``"analytics"``,
        |service| places |bic| on the same hardware
        as the analytics nodes from which |bic| reads.

        By isolating electable data-bearing nodes from the
        |bic|, electable nodes do not compete for resources
        with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability
        and performance.

   For high traffic production environments, connecting to the
   :guilabel:`Secondary Node(s)` or :guilabel:`Analytics Node(s)` may
   be preferable to connecting to the :guilabel:`Primary Node`.

   For clusters with one or more
   :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`, select
   :guilabel:`Analytics Node` to isolate |bic| queries from
   your operational workload and read from dedicated, read-only
   analytics nodes. With this option, electable nodes do not compete
   for resources with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability and
   performance.

   The BI Connector generates a relational schema by
   :bic:`sampling data </schema/cached-sampling/>` from MongoDB. The
   following sampling settings are configurable:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 25 10 65

        - Type
        - Description

      * - Schema Sample Size
        - integer
        - *Optional.* The number of documents that the BI Connector
          samples for each database when gathering schema information.
          For more information, see the
          :bic:`BI Connector documentation </reference/mongosqld/#cmdoption-mongosqld-samplesize>`.

      * - Sample Refresh Interval
        - integer
        - *Optional.* The frequency, in seconds, at which the BI
          Connector re-samples data to recreate the schema. For more
          information, see the

  The |bic-official| (|bic-short|) is only available for ``M10`` and
  larger clusters.

  The |bic-short-no-link| is a powerful tool which provides users
  SQL-based access to their MongoDB databases. As a result, the
  |bic-short-no-link| performs operations which may be CPU and memory
  intensive. Given the limited hardware resources on ``M10`` and
  ``M20`` cluster tiers, you may experience performance degradation of
  the cluster when enabling the |bic-short-no-link|. If this occurs,
  scale up to an ``M30`` or larger cluster or disable the
  |bic-short-no-link|.

  .. note:: Configure Encryption at Rest using your Key Management for your |service| Project
  
     You must configure the |service| project for Encryption at Rest
     using your Key Management before enabling the feature for your
     |service| clusters. To learn more,
     see :ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

     |service| supports the following Encryption at Rest providers:

     - :ref:`AWS Key Management Services <security-aws-kms>`
     - :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`

  .. important::

     If you want to switch from one Encryption at Rest provider on your
     cluster to another, you must first disable Encryption at Rest for
     your cluster, then re-enable it with your desired Encryption at
     Rest provider. See :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`.

  |service| encrypts all cluster storage and snapshot volumes,
  ensuring the security of all cluster data at rest
  (Encryption at Rest). |service|
  :authrole:`Project Owners <project Owner>` can configure
  an additional layer of encryption on their data at rest using the
  MongoDB
  :manual:`Encrypted Storage Engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
  and their |service|-compatible Encryption at Rest provider.

  To enable |service| Encryption at Rest for this cluster,
  toggle :guilabel:`Encryption At Rest with WiredTiger Encrypted Storage Engine (M10 and up)`
  to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  |service| Encryption at Rest using your Key Management supports
  ``M10`` or greater replica set clusters backed by
  :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` or
  :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` only.  Support for clusters deployed
  on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is in development. |service| Encryption
  at Rest supports encrypting :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` **only**.
  
  |service| clusters using Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
  incur an increase to their hourly run cost. For more information on
  |service| billing for advanced security features, see
  :ref:`advanced-security`.

  .. important::

     If |service| cannot access the |service| project key management
     provider or the encryption key used to encrypt a cluster, then
     that cluster becomes inaccessible and unrecoverable. Exercise
     extreme caution before modifying, deleting, or disabling an
     encryption key or key management provider credentials used by
     |service|.
