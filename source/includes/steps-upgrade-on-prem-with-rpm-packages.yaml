title: "Install the |onprem| package on each server being used for |onprem| services."

ref: install
content: |

  Install the ``.rpm`` package on each |application| server by issuing the
  following command, where ``<version>`` is the version of the ``.rpm``
  package:

  .. class:: copyable-code
  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo rpm -Uvh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  The installer preserves the existing ``conf-mms.properties`` configuration
  file and names the new configuration file ``conf-mms.properties.rpmnew``.
  Both are located in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/``.

# .. note::

#    If the server runs only a Backup Daemon and does not have an existing
#    ``conf-mms.properties`` file, copy the file from an |application| server
#    to the Backup Daemon server. This preserves the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
#    string for connecting to the Backup Database. Copy the
#    ``conf-mms.properties`` file to the ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf`` directory
#    on Backup Daemon server. Create the directory if it does not exist.


# On servers that run the |onprem| Application, the installer preserves your existing
# ``conf-mms.properties`` configuration file and names the new configuration
# file ``conf-mms.properties.rpmnew``. Both are located in
# ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/``.

# On servers that run only the Backup Daemon, the installer creates the
# ``/opt/mongodb/mms/`` directory and creates the ``conf-mms.properties``
# configuration file in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/``.
