Install and configure the |monitoring|, as described in the
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/monitoring-getting-started` documentation.

If your MongoDB instances operate within a firewall, configure your
network infrastructure to allow outbound connections on port ``443``
(SSL) to ``api-backup.mongodb.com``.

If you use |backup| with a MongoDB deployment that uses
authentication, see the following before installing
the |backup| Agent:

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-deployments-with-auth`
