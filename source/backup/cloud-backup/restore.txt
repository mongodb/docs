Restore a {+Cluster+} from a {+Cloud-Backup+}
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-free-tier-only-limits.rst

|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled {+Cloud-Backup+}.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/backup-restore-roles.rst

.. seealso::

   - To learn more about {+Cloud-Backup+}, see
     :doc:`/backup/cloud-backup/overview`.

   - To learn how to restore data from a
     :doc:`{+old-backup+} snapshot </backup/legacy-backup/overview>`,
     see :doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/restore`.

Restore Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The target cluster must run the same or the next major release 
  version of MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version.

  .. example::

     You can restore a MongoDB 4.2 snapshot to an |service| cluster running MongoDB 4.4.
     If you try to restore a MongoDB 4.2 snapshot to an |service| cluster running MongoDB 5.0,
     you receive the following error:

     .. code-block:: none

        Error: The requested restore could not be started: The source and destination 
        mongoDB versions are incompatible.

- The source and target sharded cluster must have the same number of 
  shards.

- |service| can only restore to a :term:`replica set` or
  :term:`sharded cluster` that uses the same encryption provider as
  the source snapshot cluster.

- |service| can't restore a sharded cluster snapshot to a replica set.

- If the ``DefaultRWConcern`` value on the source snapshot differs
  from the ``DefaultRWConcern`` value on the target cluster, |service|
  overrides the value on the source snapshot with the value on the
  target cluster. If there is no value configured for the
  ``DefaultRWConcern`` on the target cluster, [service] keeps the value
  of ``DefaultRWConcern`` from the snapshot without explicit
  configuration. This may differ from the default value for that MongoDB
  version.

  .. note::
  
     From MongoDB 4.4 to MongoDB 5.0, MongoDB uses different default
     values for ``DefaultRWConcern``..

.. _cps-failback-snapshots:

Fallback Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a scheduled snapshot fails for any reason, |service| attempts to
repeat the snapshot process. If necessary, you may use the resulting
fallback snapshot to :ref:`restore the cluster
<restoration-cloud-provider-snapshot>`. This isn't recommended:
fallback snapshots use a different process from regular snapshots. They
may contain inconsistent data.

Fallback snapshots are marked in the UI with a warning icon, and a
warning message appears in the restore modal window if the restore uses
a fallback snapshot.

.. warning::

   Restoring your cluster from a fallback snapshot may result in
   inconsistent data across your cluster, and should be considered an
   option of last resort.

.. include:: /includes/fact-stop-ops-during-restore.rst

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Restoring Snapshots for Clusters using Encryption at Rest

   |service| automatically encrypts
   :ref:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s <backup-cloud-provider>` for
   clusters using :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`, in addition to the
   existing encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot
   volumes. For documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, see
   :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`

   The following instructions only apply to snapshots for
   clusters not using Encryption at Rest.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Restore
      :tabid: snapshot-restore

      #. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
         are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
         You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Select a cluster's snapshot to restore.

         Click :guilabel:`Restore` or :guilabel:`Download`.

      #. Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

         - :ref:`Download your snapshot via HTTPS <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>`.

         - :ref:`Restore your snapshot to an Atlas cluster <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-atlas>`.

   .. tab:: {+PIT-Restore+}
      :tabid: pit-restore

      You can enable {+PIT-Restore+}s when you :ref:`create
      <create-new-cluster>` or :ref:`scale <scale-cluster-backups>` a
      cluster.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

      #. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

         If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service|
         backups are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are
         available. You can enable backups when
         :ref:`scaling the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore` button on the far
         right side of the screen.

      #. Select either the :guilabel:`Date & Time` or :guilabel:`Oplog
         Timestamp` tab.

         .. note::

            If you select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` option, you can
            specify the time of restore with one minute of granularity.
            If you select the :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp` option, you
            can specify the time of restore with one second of
            granularity.

      #. Enter the desired point in time to restore from.

         .. important::

            You can restore a {+cluster+} from any time during its 
            {+pit-restore+} window **except** between when you 
            initiated a restore and when |service| completes a 
            snapshot after the restore.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

      #. Choose a project and cluster to restore to from the dropdown
         menus.

         .. important::

            |service| might create a host rollback alert due to
            differences in the data between the source and target
            clusters. You can ignore this alert.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.

      After the restore completes, |service| takes a snapshot of
      the restored {+cluster+}. This snapshot has a retention period
      equal to the {+cluster+}'s {+pit-restore+} window.

Restore a Snapshot of a Cluster with Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Snapshots of clusters using
   :doc:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management </security-kms-encryption>`
   can only restore to other clusters that use Encryption at Rest. You
   cannot restore a snapshot with Encryption at Rest to a |mms|
   project.

   If the target project does not have a cluster with Encryption at
   Rest enabled, you can either
   :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a cluster with
   Encryption at Rest, or
   :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
   in an existing cluster.

   Clusters which use :ref:`AWS KMS <security-aws-kms>` encrypt their
   |pit| restore :term:`oplog` data with the customer's |cmk|. The
   current |cmk| must be valid for the encrypted oplog data to perform
   a restore from a snapshot.

#. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

#. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

   If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
   are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
   You can enable backups when
   :ref:`modifying the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target |service|
   :guilabel:`Project` to which you want to restore. You can restore to
   any |service| project for which the authenticated |service| user has
   the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Cluster` to restore to. You can only restore
   to an |service| replica set running Encryption at Rest. The target
   cluster must run the same or greater version of MongoDB as the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Version` of the snapshot.


   After the restoration procedure, |service| triggers a key rotation
   for MongoDB encryption key. |service| then encrypts the new MongoDB
   encryption keys based on the configured Encryption at Rest provider
   for the target cluster.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target
   cluster.

Troubleshooting Encryption at Rest
``````````````````````````````````

If |service| has an issue with the encryption of either the snapshot
or the target cluster, it displays one of the following errors:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error

     - Result

   * - Cannot restore a non-encrypted snapshot to a cluster with
       Encryption at Rest enabled.

     - The snapshot cannot be restored to |service|.

   * - Target cluster does not have encryption enabled.

     - You can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       a new target cluster with Encryption at Rest, or
       :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       on your desired target cluster.

   * - Encryption provider of target cluster does not match selected
       snapshot's encryption provider.

     - The encryption provider for the snapshot and target cluster
       do not match. You can either:

       1. Create a new snapshot with the same encryption provider.
       #. Change the encryption provider for the target cluster.

   * - Encryption credentials on snapshot are not present.

     - |service| cannot restore a snapshot whose encryption key was
       deleted.

Restore a {+Cluster+} from an M2/M5 Snapshot
--------------------------------------------

|service| lets you restore data from an
:ref:`M2 or M5 {+cluster+} snapshot <m2-m5-snapshots>`. You can restore
``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots to a {+cluster+} tier ``M2`` or greater.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/backup-restore-roles.rst

Restore Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- |service| can restore ``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots only to a
  :term:`replica set` that does *not* use
  :doc:`Encryption at Rest </security-aws-kms>`.

- The target {+cluster+} must run the same major release version of
  MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version. For example, you can
  restore a snapshot using MongoDB 4.0 only to a target {+cluster+} 
  running MongoDB 4.0.

- Starting with MongoDB 5.0, you can restore snapshots of {+clusters+}
  that run only the two most recent major versions of MongoDB to
  ``M2`` and ``M5`` {+clusters+}.

  .. example::

     - You can restore snapshots taken from {+clusters+} that run 
       MongoDB 4.2 to an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+cluster+} that runs MongoDB
       5.0. 
     - You can't restore snapshots taken from {+clusters+} that run
       MongoDB 4.0 to an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+cluster+} that runs MongoDB 5.0.

.. _serverless-restore-snapshot:

Restore a {+Serverless-Instance+} from a Snapshot
-------------------------------------------------

|service| lets you restore data to a {+serverless-instance+} from a
snapshot.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/backup-restore-roles.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`serverless-snapshots`.

Restore Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you use :guilabel:`Basic Backup`, you can restore from only the 
  two most recent snapshots of a {+serverless-instance+}.

- If you use :guilabel:`Serverless Continuous Backup`, you can restore
  your data to a selected point in time using only 
  :guilabel:`Date & Time`. 

- You can't restore snapshots from {+shared-clusters+}, 
  {+dedicated-clusters+}, or from |mms| to {+serverless-instances+}.

.. note:: {+atlas-cli+} Limitation

   You can't restore snapshots to 
   {+serverless-instances+} using the {+atlas-cli+}.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop Client Operations during Restoration
`````````````````````````````````````````

You must ensure that the target {+serverless-instance+} doesn't receive
client requests during restoration. You can restore to a new
{+serverless-instance+} and reconfigure your application to use that 
new {+serverless-instance+} once it is running for maximum uptime.

.. important::

   |service| disables database users on a target {+serverless-instance+}
   during a restore to prevent the target from receiving client
   requests.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   |service| deletes all existing data on the target 
   {+serverless-instance+} prior to the restore. The 
   {+serverless-instance+} is **unavailable** for the duration of
   the restore.

View the Status of Snapshot Restorations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: {+atlas-cli+} Limitation

   You can't view the status of snapshot restorations for 
   {+serverless-instances+} using the {+atlas-cli+}.

|service| provides a detailed list of completed and in-progress
snapshot restorations, including when |service| took the snapshot and
the snapshot's delivery type. To view this list, from a
{+serverless-instance+}'s :guilabel:`Backup` tab, click the 
:guilabel:`Restores` tab.

The :guilabel:`Status` column of the table displays the results of
completed snapshots, and the progress of snapshots currently
restoring.

The :guilabel:`Status` column updates as the restoration
progresses on the {+serverless-instance+}. When the restoration 
completes, the column displays the time of completion and the 
{+serverless-instance+} that |service| restored the snapshot to.


Manually Restore One Snapshot
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-api-free-tier-limits.rst

|service| provides a mechanism for downloading cloud provider,
{+old-backup+}, and M2/M5 snapshots as compressed files.

.. note::

   You can't download snapshots for {+serverless-instances+}.

The downloaded files consist of the raw files copied from the ``data`` 
directory. ``mongorestore`` is incompatible with these files. To access 
the data files, use the following procedure to start a 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and point it to the extract directory.

      Considerations
      ``````````````

      When you manually download a cloud backup snapshot, your download 
      might get interrupted for some reason. |service| keeps
      the request alive and allows you to restart it as long as the 
      most recent download failure occurred no more than one hour ago.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/manual-restore-mtm.rst

Restore One Cloud Manager Snapshot to |service|
-----------------------------------------------

You can automatically restore a backup for a |mms| deployment to an 
|service| deployment. Before you restore a snapshot from a |mms| 
deployment to an |service| deployment, ensure that the hosts for 
your |service| deployment have sufficient storage space for the 
restored databases, plus additional space for dataset growth. Use 
:manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
to find the current database size.

The MongoDB server version must be one of the following:

- The same on both deployments.

- One version higher on the |service| deployment. 

Also, the instance types of the nodes in the |service| 
deployment should have at least as much memory and throughput capacity 
as the nodes in the |mms| deployment.

To learn more, see :cloudmgr:`Restoring a Deployment to MongoDB Atlas</tutorial/restore-deployment-to-atlas>`.
