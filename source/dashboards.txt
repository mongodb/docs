Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display. Dashboards can be shared with other users.

Dashboards Page
---------------

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` page shows all dashboards you have access to
view. To learn more about dashboard permissions in |charts|, see
:ref:`Dashboard Permissions <dashboard-permissions>`.

   :alt: Charts Dashboard Tab

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

Refresh Dashboard Data
----------------------

|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh dashboard data at any time.

.. _configure-auto-refresh:

Configure Auto Refresh Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Charts on a dashboard automatically refresh once their data becomes out
of date. You can specify how stale your charts' data can be before it is
refreshed. This is known as your staleness tolerance. The default
behavior is to refresh when data is one hour stale.

To configure auto-refresh settings for a dashboard:

1. Select a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

#. Click :guilabel:`Settings` at the top of the dashboard.

#. Select your data staleness tolerance from the dropdown.
   |charts-short| supports staleness tolerances between 1 minute and 30
   days.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Behavior
````````

- When |charts-short| refreshes dashboard data, only charts with data
  older than your specified staleness tolerance are refreshed.
  |charts-short| does not refresh the entire dashboard at once.

- Auto-refresh settings are stored in the local browser state. These
  settings are not persisted with the dashboard or shared between
  users.

- When |charts| loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently
  query the data source for each chart. Instead, |charts| queries the
  data sources when the dashboard first loads, and that data is cached
  on both the client and server. 

- When a dashboard refreshes automatically:

  - If a chart's data is within the staleness tolerance period,
    |charts-short| doesn't refresh the chart's data.

  - If a chart's data is outside of the staleness tolerance period, 
    |charts-short| returns the latest data from the server cache. If the
    server cache contains stale data, |charts-short| queries the data 
    source for the latest data, refreshes the chart, and updates the 
    data cached on both the client and server.
    
- When you manually refresh a dashboard, |charts-short| updates all chart
  data by querying the data source for the latest data even if the chart
  data is within the specified staleness tolerance period.

Manually Refresh Dashboard Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manually refresh dashboard data:

1. Select a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

#. Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Settings` button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Force Refresh`.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen View
---------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and expands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To open a dashboard in fullscreen view, first select a dashboard from
the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, then click the expanding arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard:

.. figure:: /images/charts/full-screen-view.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Fullscreen Arrows

.. note::

   You can still :ref:`remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
   <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
   <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`access editing
   <dashboard-edit-chart>` for charts in fullscreen view by hovering
   over the desired chart.

   Additionally, in fullscreen view you can still configure
   auto-refresh settings and manually refresh chart data.

To exit fullscreen view, either click the contracting arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard or press the escape key.
