Overview
--------

When writing data to a synced realm using Flexible Sync, you can use the 
same APIs as writing to a local realm. However, there are some differences
in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.

When you write to a synced realm, your write operations must match *both*
of the following:

- **The sync subscription query.**
    - If your write operation doesn't match the query in the subscription,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal compensating write error (ErrorCompensatingWrite).
- **The permissions** in your App Services App.
    - If your try to write data that doesn't match the permissions expression,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal permission denied error. In the client,
      this shows as an error (ErrorCompensatingWrite). On the server, you can see more
      details about how the write was denied was by a write filter in the role.
    - To learn more about configuring permissions for your app, see
      :ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide` in the
      App Services documentation.

.. warning:: Multiprocess Sync is Not Supported

   Device Sync does not currently support opening or writing to a synced 
   realm from more than one process. For more information, including 
   suggested alternatives, refer to: :ref:`multiprocess-sync-not-supported`.

Determining What Data Syncs
---------------------------

The data that you can write to a synced realm is the intersection of your Device
Sync configuration, your permissions, and the Flexible Sync subscription query
that you use when you open the realm.

The examples on this page use the following configurations and models:

App Services Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``complexity``
- ``ownerId``

The App Services App has permissions configured to let users read and write only their own
data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "owner-read-write", 
     "apply_when": {},
     "document_filters": {
       "read": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" },
       "write": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" }
     },
     "read": true,
     "write": true
   }

Client Data Model and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use the following object model:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.flexible-sync-crud-model.swift
   :language: swift

Using that object model, the synced realm configuration syncs objects that 
match the subscription query where the ``complexity`` property's value 
is less than or equal to ``4``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.flexible-sync-subscription-setup.swift
   :language: swift

What Data Syncs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subscription query combined with the permissions mean that the synced realm
only syncs objects where:

- The ``ownerId`` matches the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user (from the permissions)
- The ``complexity`` property's value is less than or equal to ``4`` (from the subscription query)

Any object in the Atlas collection where the ``ownerId`` does not match 
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user, or the ``complexity`` property's 
value is greater than ``4``, cannot sync to this realm.

Write to a Synced Realm
-----------------------

Writes to Flexible Sync realms may broadly fall into one of two categories: 

- **Successful writes**: The written object matches both the query subscription
  and the user's permissions. The object writes successfully to the realm,
  and syncs successfully to the App Services backend and other devices.

- **Compensating writes**: When the written object does not match
  the subscription query, or where the user does not have sufficient 
  permissions to perform the write, Realm reverts the illegal write.

.. _swift-successful-writes:

Successful Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the write matches both the :ref:`permissions <permissions>` and the
:ref:`Flexible Sync subscription query
<swift-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>` in the client, the Realm Swift SDK
can successfully write the object to the synced realm. This object syncs with
the App Services backend when the device has a network connection.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.successful-write.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, a write that initially appears to succeed is actually an 
illegal write. In these cases, the object writes to the database, but when 
the database syncs to the backend, Realm reverts the write in a non-fatal 
error operation called a compensating write. Compensating writes can occur
when:

- **Writes don't match the query subscription**: The written object matches 
  the user's permissions, but does not match the query subscription. 
- **Writes don't match permissions**: The written object matches the query
  subscription, but does not match the user's permissions.

In more detail, when you write data that is outside the bounds of a query
subscription or does not match the user's permissions, the following occurs:

#. Because the client realm has no concept of "illegal" writes,
   the write initially succeeds until realm resolves the changeset
   with the App Services backend.
#. Upon sync, the server applies the rules and permissions.
   The server determines that the user does not have authorization to perform the write.
#. The server sends a revert operation, called a "compensating write", back to the client.
#. The client's realm reverts the illegal write operation.

Any client-side writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost.

In practice, this may look like an object being written to the realm, and
then disappearing after the server sends the compensating write back to 
the client.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

The :ref:`App Services logs <logs-sync>` contain more information about 
why a compensating write error occurs.

Compensating Write Error Information
````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 10.37.0

You can get additional information in the client about why a compensating 
write occurs. The Swift SDK exposes a :swift-sdk:`compensatingWriteInfo 
<Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift21CompensatingWriteInfoa>` field on a 
SyncError whose code is ``.writeRejected``. You can access this information
through the :ref:`Sync error handler <swift-sync-error-handler>`. 

This field contains an array of :objc-sdk:`RLMCompensatingWriteInfo 
<Classes/RLMCompensatingWriteInfo.html>` objects, which provide:

- The ``objectType`` of the object the client attempted to write
- The ``primaryKey`` of the specific object
- The ``reason`` for the compensating write error

This information is the same information you can find in the App Services logs.
It is exposed on the client for convenience and debugging purposes.

.. example::

   This error handler shows an example of how you might log information 
   about compensating write errors:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Errors.snippet.access-compensating-write.swift
      :language: swift

   The example error handler above produces this output when a compensating
   write error occurs:

   .. code-block:: console

      A write was rejected with a compensating write error
      The write to object type: Optional("Item") 
      With primary key of: objectId(641382026852d9220b2e2bbf) 
      Was rejected because: Optional("write to \"641382026852d9220b2e2bbf\" in table \"Item\" not 
      allowed; object is outside of the current query view")

   - The ``Optional("Item")`` in this message is an ``Item`` object used in the 
     :github:`Swift Template App <mongodb/template-app-swiftui-todo>`.
   - The primary key is the ``objectId`` of the specific object the client 
     attempted to write. 
   - The ``table \"Item"\`` refers to the Atlas collection where this object
     would sync.
   - The reason ``object is outside of the current query view`` in this example
     is because the query subscription was set to require the object's ``isComplete``
     property to be ``true``, and the client attempted to write an object where
     this property was ``false``.

.. _swift-writes-outside-subscription:

Writes that Don't Match the Query Subscription
``````````````````````````````````````````````

You can only write objects to a Flexible Sync realm if they match the 
subscription query. If you perform a write that does not match the 
subscription query, Realm initially writes the object, but then performs 
a compensating write. This is a non-fatal operation that 
reverts an illegal write that does not match the subscription query.

In practice, this may look like the write succeeding, but then the 
object "disappears" when Realm syncs with the App Services backend and 
performs the compensating write.

If you want to write an object that does not match the query subscription,
you must open a different realm where the object matches the query 
subscription. Alternately, you could write the object to a :ref:`non-synced 
realm <swift-synced-realms-vs-non-synced-realms>` that does not enforce 
permissions or subscription queries.

Code Example
++++++++++++

Given the configuration for the Flexible Sync realm above, attempting to 
write this object does not match the query subscription:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.write-outside-flexible-sync-query.swift
   :language: swift

Client Error
++++++++++++

The error message in the client-side logs in this scenario is: 

.. code-block:: console

   Sync: Connection[1]: Session[1]: Received: ERROR "Client attempted a 
   write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been 
   reverted" (error_code=231, try_again=true, error_action=Warning)

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs in this scenario is:

.. code-block:: console

   "FlexibleSync_Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7\" 
       in table \"FlexibleSync_Item\" not allowed; object is outside of 
       the current query view"
   }

.. _swift-writes-outside-permissions:

Writes That Don't Match Permissions
```````````````````````````````````

Attempting to write to the client can also trigger a compensating write 
error when the object does not match the user's server-side write permissions. 

On the client, this type of write behaves the same as a write that doesn't 
match the query subscription. In practice, this may look like the write 
succeeding, but then the object "disappears" when Realm syncs with the 
App Services backend and performs the compensating write.

Code Example
++++++++++++

Given the permissions in the Device Sync Configuration detailed above, 
attempting to write an object where the ``ownerId`` property does not match
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user is not a legal write:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/SyncedRealmCRUD.snippet.write-outside-permissions.swift
   :language: swift

Client Error
++++++++++++

The client error in this scenario is the same as when you attempt to write
an object that is outside the query filter:

.. code-block:: console

   Sync: Connection[1]: Session[1]: Received: ERROR "Client attempted a 
   write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been 
   reverted" (error_code=231, try_again=true, error_action=Warning)

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs provides some additional 
information to help you determine that it is a permissions issue,
and not a query subscription issue. In this example, the error message shows
that the the object does not match the user's role:

.. code-block:: console

   "FlexibleSync_Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8\" 
       in table \"FlexibleSync_Item\" was denied by write filter in role 
       \"owner-read-write\""
   }

Don't Write to a Synced Realm in an App Extension
-------------------------------------------------

If you are developing an app that uses App Extensions, such as a Share 
Extension, avoid writing to a synced realm in that extension. Device Sync
supports opening a synced realm in at most one process. In practice, this
means that if your app uses a synced realm in an App Extension, it may 
crash intermittently.

Crashes Related to Opening a Synced Realm in Multiple Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you attempt to open a synced realm in a Share Extension or other App 
Extension, and that realm is not open in the main app, a write from a Share
Extension may succeed. However, if the synced realm is already open in the 
main app, or is syncing data in the background, you may see a crash related 
to ``Realm::MultiSyncAgents``. In this scenario, you may need to restart 
the device.

Alternatives to Writing to a Synced Realm in an App Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to read from or write to a synced realm from an App Extension, 
there are a few recommended alternatives:

- **Offline-first**: pass data on disk to or from the main app
- **Always up-to-date**: communicate directly with the backing 
  Atlas collection across a network connection

Pass Data On Disk
`````````````````

If offline-first functionality is the most important consideration for your app,
you can pass data on disk to or from your main app. You could copy objects
to a non-synced realm and read and share it between apps in an App Group.
Or you could use an on-disk queue to send the data to or from the main app and 
only write to the synced realm from there. Then, regardless of the device's 
network connectivity, information can be shared any time to or from the App 
Extension.

Communicate Directly with the Backing Atlas Collection
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If having the information always up-to-date across all devices is the most 
important consideration for your app, you can read or write data directly 
to or from the backing Atlas collection across the network. Depending on your 
needs, you may want to use one of these tools to communicate directly with 
Atlas:

- Query Atlas with the :ref:`Realm Swift SDK MongoClient <ios-mongodb-data-access>`
- Pass data to an :ref:`App Services Function <ios-call-a-function>` 
- Make HTTPS calls with the :ref:`Data API <data-api>`

Then, any device that has a network connection is always getting the most 
up-to-date information, without waiting for the user to open your main app 
as in the option above.

This option does require your user's device to have a network connection 
when using the App Extension. As a fallback, you could check for a network
connection. Then, use the on-disk option above in the event that the user's 
device lacks network connectivity.
