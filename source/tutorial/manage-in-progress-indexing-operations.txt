==========================================================
Monitor and Manage In Progress Index Creation and Building
==========================================================

To see the status of the indexing processes, you can use the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell. The value
of the ``query`` field and the ``msg`` field will indicate if the
operation is an index build. The ``msg`` field also indicates the
percent of the build that is complete.

To terminate an ongoing index build, use the
:method:`db.killOp()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell.

For more information about the output of :method:`db.currentOp()`, see
the :doc:`/reference/current-op`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4
   Before MongoDB 2.4, you could *only* terminate *background* index
   builds. After 2.4, you can terminate any index build, including
   foreground index builds.
