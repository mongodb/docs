.. _mongosniff:

==============
``mongosniff``
==============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

:program:`mongosniff` provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view
into database activity in real time. Think of :program:`mongosniff` as a
MongoDB-specific analogue of ``tcpdump`` for TCP/IP network
traffic. Typically, :program:`mongosniff` is most frequently used in driver
development.

.. _mongosniff-libcap:

.. note::

   :program:`mongosniff` requires ``libpcap`` and is only available for
   Unix-like systems. Furthermore, the version distributed with the
   MongoDB binaries is dynamically linked against aversion 0.9 of
   ``libpcap``. If your system has a different version of ``libpcap``, you
   will need to compile :program:`mongosniff` yourself or create a
   symbolic link pointing to ``libpcap.so.0.9`` to your local version
   of ``libpcap``. Use an operation that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ln -s /usr/lib/libpcap.so.1.1.1 /usr/lib/libpcap.so.0.9

   Change the path's and name of the shared library as needed.

As an alternative to :program:`mongosniff`, Wireshark, a popular
network sniffing tool is capable of inspecting and parsing the MongoDB
wire protocol.

.. _mongosniff-options:

Options
-------

.. binary:: mongosniff

.. program:: mongosniff

.. include:: /includes/options-mongosniff.rst

.. option:: <port>

   Specifies alternate ports to sniff for traffic. By default,
   :program:`mongosniff` watches for MongoDB traffic on port 27017. Append
   multiple port numbers to the end of :program:`mongosniff` to monitor
   traffic on multiple ports.

Usage
-----

Use the following command to connect to a :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` running on port 27017 *and* 27018 on the localhost
interface:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongosniff --source NET lo 27017 27018

Use the following command to only log invalid :term:`BSON` objects for
the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` running on the localhost
interface and port 27018, for driver development and troubleshooting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongosniff --objcheck --source NET lo 27018

Build ``mongosniff``
--------------------

To build ``mongosniff`` yourself, Linux users can use the following
procedure:

1. Obtain prerequisites using your operating
   systems package management software. Dependencies include:

   - ``libpcap`` - to capture network packets.
   - ``git`` - to download the MongoDB source code.
   - ``scons`` and a C++ compiler - to build :program:`mongosniff`.

2. Download a copy of the MongoDB source code using ``git``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      git clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git

3. Issue the following sequence of commands to change to the
   ``mongo/`` directory and build :program:`mongosniff`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd mongo
      scons mongosniff

.. note::

   If you run ``scons mongosniff`` before installing ``libpcap`` you
   must run ``scons clean`` before you can build :program:`mongosniff`.
