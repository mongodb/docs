.. _amazon-aws-availability-zones:

Amazon Availability Zones
-------------------------

A given Amazon region includes a set number of independent availability zones.
For regions that have at least three availability zones (3AZ), |service|
deploys clusters across three availability zones. For regions that only
have two availability zones (2AZ), |service| deploys clusters across two
availability zones.

The |service| :doc:`Add New Cluster </create-new-cluster>` form marks regions
that support at least three availability zones as :guilabel:`Recommended`, as
they provide higher availability.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-aws.rst

For more information on the number of availability zones in a
given region, see the Amazon documentation on `global infrastructure
<https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/>`_.

For more information on Amazon AWS regions and availability zones, see the
Amazon documentation on
`using regions and availability zones
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html>`_

Regions with at Least Three Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| clusters deployed in regions with at least three availability zones
are split across three availability zones. For example, a three node replica
set cluster would have one node deployed onto each availability zone.

.. include:: /images/amazon-aws-3az.rst

:abbr:`3AZ (Three Availability Zone)` clusters have higher availability
compared to :abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` clusters. However, not all
regions support :abbr:`3AZ (Three Availability Zone)` clusters.

Regions with Only Two Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| clusters deployed in regions with two availability zones are split
across the two availability zones. For example, a three node replica set
cluster would have two nodes deployed to one availability zone and the
remaining node deployed to the other availability zone.

.. include:: /images/amazon-aws-2az.rst

:abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` clusters have a higher chance of loss of
availability in the event of the loss of an availability zone than :abbr:`3AZ
(Three Availability Zone)` clusters. However, where latency or location are a
priority, a region that supports :abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` clusters
may be preferred.
