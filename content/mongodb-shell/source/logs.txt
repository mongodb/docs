The |mdb-shell| stores a log for each session. The log contains a record
of commands run, server connections, and other useful information about
actions performed in the |mdb-shell|.

Get Started
-----------

You can view or tail the logs for a |mdb-shell| session based on its log
ID.

The |mdb-shell| uses `Newline delimited JSON
<https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec>`__ to store session logs, which
is the same log format used for :ref:`MongoDB server logs
<log-messages-ref>`.
