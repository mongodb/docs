In this guide, you learn how to get started with the MongoDB MCP Server
by configuring and using it in your AI client.

.. _mcp-get-started-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the MongoDB MCP server, you must have the following:
  
- An Atlas cluster or a self-hosted MongoDB deployment.

  To learn more, see :atlas:`Create a Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster/>`
  or :ref:`tutorials-installation`.

- Any `supported MCP client. <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients>`__

- `Node.js <https://www.nodejs.org/>`__ installed, using one of the following versions:

  - Version 20.19.0 or later.
  - If you use version 22, you must use version 22.12.0 or later.
  - Otherwise, use version 23 or later.

  .. note::

     Alternatively, you can run the server in Docker container,
     which does not require installing Node.js. To learn more,
     see :github:`Using Docker <mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server#option-5-using-docker>`.

.. _mcp-get-started-configure:

Configure the MCP Server
------------------------

Complete the following steps to configure the MongoDB MCP Server.

Select your MCP client and MongoDB deployment type from the drop-down menus
to see the corresponding configuration steps. If your preferred client isn't listed, 
use these steps as guidelines and refer to the documentation for your 
client for specific steps.

.. tip:: Using VS Code?

   If you're using VS Code, the MongoDB VS Code Extension
   includes the MongoDB MCP Server with automatic setup and connection management.
   To learn more, see :ref:`MongoDB MCP Server in VS Code Extension <vsce-mcp-server>`.

Use the MCP Server
------------------

After you configure the MongoDB MCP Server, use it to 
interact with your MongoDB data and deployments from your AI client.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Check that the server is running.

      In your AI client, check that the MongoDB MCP server is 
      running and verify that your list of MCP tools includes
      the MongoDB MCP tools if possible.

   .. step:: Test the MCP server tools.

      Run prompts in your AI client to test the MongoDB MCP server tools.
      Your exact responses will vary depending on the data in your MongoDB
      deployment, and the AI client and model that you're using. 
      The following sample prompts assume that the MCP server has both read and 
      write access to your MongoDB deployment.

      a. First, create a new database and collection to work 
         with by running the following prompt:

         .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/create-collection.rst

      #. Now that you have a MongoDB collection with some sample data, 
         run prompts to interact with it using the MCP tools:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Explore and query
            :tabid: data-exploration

            Run the following prompts in your AI client 
            to explore and query your data in natural language:

            .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/explore-and-query.rst

            .. collapsible::

         .. tab:: Manage your database
            :tabid: database-management

            If you have an Atlas cluster and enabled the Atlas-specific MCP tools,
            run the following prompts in your AI client to perform some administrative tasks:

            .. include:: /includes/get-started/prompts/database-management.rst

         .. tab:: Generate code
            :tabid: code-generation

            Run the following prompt to generate code related to your MongoDB data.
            Providing context, such as schemas and data structures, enables more accurate code generation, 
            reducing hallucinations and enhancing agent capabilities.
