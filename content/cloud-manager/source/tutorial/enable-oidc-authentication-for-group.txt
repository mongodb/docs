You can authenticate and authorize access to |mms| deployments for both human users 
and applications with your own identity provider that supports |oidc| or {+oauth2+}. 

You can use your existing identity provider to configure single-sign-on for 
human user access to |mms| deployments with 
{+wif+}. You can similarly use your existing cloud provider application users, 
such as Azure Service Principals, Azure Managed Identities, or GCP Service 
Accounts, for application access to |mms| deployments with {+workload+}.

You can manage authentication all in one place, either using your |oidc| 
provider for human user access, or your {+oauth2+} provider for application 
access. The following table compares the |oidc| and {+oauth2+} access options.

.. note::

   If you already use other authentication mechanisms, such as SCRAM or X.509,
   you can continue to use them for database access.
