AWS Marketplace `model packages
<https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=c9032c7b-70dd-459f-834f-c1e23cf3d092>`__
are containerized solutions that include the model and inference
code. You deploy them in your account and virtual private cloud
(VPC). Model packages have the following key benefits:

1. **Data flow and access control**: Deploy models in your account
   and VPC to maintain full control over data flow and API access.
   This addresses data privacy risks associated with third-party or
   multi-tenant serving.
2. **Reliability and compliance backed by AWS**: AWS serves as your
   sub-processor, so you inherit all AWS reliability and compliance
   guarantees.
3. **Billing and payment through AWS**: Use your existing AWS billing
   information and credits to purchase Voyage AI models
   through marketplace listings. You don't need to manage a separate
   third-party payment and billing system.

You can deploy a model package as a `real-time inference API endpoint
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints.html>`__
or a `batch transform job
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html>`__.
Real-time inference API endpoints provide persistent, fully managed
API endpoints for request-by-request inference. Batch transform jobs
run finite execution processes for bulk inference on datasets,
writing predictions to a file. Both deployment types run on AWS
instances, such as GPUs.

Available Models
----------------

To see which models you can deploy, 
go to the `MongoDB Marketplace Seller Profile
<https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=c9032c7b-70dd-459f-834f-c1e23cf3d092>`__.

To learn more about Voyage AI models, see :ref:`voyage-models`.

Pricing
-------

Pricing for the use of a Voyage AI model package consists of
software pricing and infrastructure pricing, both at an hourly rate.
Software pricing covers the cost of model usage, while your total
hourly cost is the sum of the software pricing and the infrastructure
pricing. Pricing rates vary based on deployment type (real-time
inference API endpoint versus batch transform job), instance type,
and region. All Voyage models come with a free trial. You can
find the pricing details for each model package on the product
listing page in the AWS Marketplace.

The following sections demonstrate how to subscribe and deploy the
models.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have the following AWS identity access management (IAM)
permissions to subscribe to AWS Marketplace listings.

- `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess.html>`__
  (AWS Managed Policy)
- ``aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions``
- ``aws-marketplace:Subscribe``
- ``aws-marketplace:Unsubscribe``

To add them, `sign into your AWS account console
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`__ and review the `AWS
documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#add-policies-console>`__
for instructions.

Procedure
---------

To subscribe by using the AWS Marketplace:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select the model package.

      Select the Voyage AI model package to subscribe to in
      the `AWS Marketplace
      <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=c9032c7b-70dd-459f-834f-c1e23cf3d092>`__.

   .. step:: Click **Continue to Subscribe**.

   .. step:: Click **Accept Offer**.

   .. step:: Confirm you have successfully subscribed and close the window.

You can also confirm and manage your AWS Marketplace subscriptions
through the console's `manage subscription page
<https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library/ref=gtw_navgno_library>`__.
You can `cancel your subscription
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/cancel-machine-learning-subscription.html>`__
at any time, but note that canceling your subscription **does not**
terminate your existing real-time inference endpoints or batch
transform jobs. To learn more, see :ref:`aws-delete-endpoints`.

Model package deployment requires specific SageMaker instances (e.g.,
ml.g5.xlarge). The exact quota names for these instances end with
"endpoint usage" and "transform job usage" (e.g., "ml.g5.2xlarge for
endpoint usage", and "ml.g5.2xlarge for transform job usage"). These
`quotas
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html#limits_sagemaker>`__
are typically set to zero by default. To `request quota increases
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html>`__
if needed, go to the `SageMaker Service Quotas console
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/sagemaker/quotas>`__.

If you need help subscribing and deploying a Voyage AI model
package from the AWS Marketplace, contact `MongoDB support
<https://www.mongodb.com/services/support>`__.

Model Package Deployment
------------------------

This section includes guidance on how to deploy a model package using
Amazon SageMaker Studio and Jupyter Notebooks.

Amazon SageMaker Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Amazon SageMaker Studio <https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/>`__
is a web-based interface for ML and AI development that includes a
hosted notebook environment already authenticated to your AWS
account. You can skip this section if you have another preferred
Jupyter notebook execution environment, such as your local machine,
where you can authenticate to your AWS account from the environment.
Follow the SageMaker documentation to `launch SageMaker Studio
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-updated-launch.html>`__,
and then `launch a JupyterLab environment
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-updated-jl-user-guide.html>`__.

Jupyter Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `example Jupyter notebook
<https://github.com/voyage-ai/voyageai-aws/blob/main/deploy_mongodb_voyage_model_package_sagemaker.ipynb>`__
to get started with Python by using the AWS SDK (`Boto3
<https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html>`__)
and the `Amazon SageMaker Python SDK
<https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__. You can run the
notebook in SageMaker Studio or your preferred Jupyter notebook
execution environment after cloning the `Voyage AI AWS repo
<https://github.com/voyage-ai/voyageai-aws/tree/main>`__. For
example, by running ``git clone
https://github.com/voyage-ai/voyageai-aws.git``.

Alternatively, you can directly download the notebook from GitHub and
upload it to SageMaker Studio or your preferred notebook environment.

Once the notebook is in SageMaker Studio or your preferred execution
environment, you can run the provided code to deploy the models.

.. _aws-delete-endpoints:

Delete Real-Time Inference Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not run real-time inference endpoints longer than necessary. If
you do, they might incur wasteful costs and lead to unexpected
charges. If you're using the provided Jupyter notebook, ensure that
you run the **Clean Up** code, which deletes the endpoint and
associated endpoint configuration. You can manage and delete
endpoints through SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker console. To learn
more, see `AWS documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-manage.html>`__.

Advanced Deployment
-------------------

The Jupyter notebook described in the previous section is meant to
get you started and help you learn how to deploy model packages.
However, there are several other ways to deploy model packages, such
as CloudFormation, the SageMaker Console, and the AWS CLI. These
alternative methods might be better suited for your existing
production workflows. For example:

- CloudFormation for declarative infrastructure specification
- SageMaker Console for interactive UI-based deployment
- AWS CLI for programmatic shell orchestration

To configure and deploy a model package using these methods:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Go to the product listing page.

      Go to the product listing page for the subscribed MongoDB
      Voyage model from the `AWS Marketplace
      <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=c9032c7b-70dd-459f-834f-c1e23cf3d092>`__.

   .. step:: Click on **Continue to Subscribe** in the upper-right corner.

   .. step:: Continue to configuration.

      In the **Subscribe to this software** page, you should see that
      you are **Already Subscribed**. Click on the **Continue to
      configuration** button.

   .. step:: Select launch method.

      In the **Configure and launch** page, you can select your
      desired launch method. The configuration settings update
      according to the corresponding instructions and resources for
      the selected method.
