Overview
--------

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling for
large data sets and enable high throughput operations by distributing the data
set across a group of servers. See the :manual:`Sharding Introduction
</core/sharding-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual for more information.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster managed by |mms|. Later, you
can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance operations on the
cluster.

Unique Names for Deployment Items
---------------------------------

Use unique names for the new cluster and its shards.

Configuration Server Deployment Architecture
--------------------------------------------

.. only:: onprem

     .. versionadded:: Ops Manager 4.0

If you select MongoDB 3.2 or later for your configuration server
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes, |mms| deploys your 
configuration servers as a replica set. If you select
MongoDB 3.0 or earlier for your configuration server 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes, |mms| deploys mirrored 
configuration servers. 

For more information on Config Server Replica Sets (CSRS) and 
mirrored configuration servers (SCCC), see 
:manual:`Config Servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`.
