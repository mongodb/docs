.. include:: /includes/api/no-query-parameters.rst

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify an array of documents, where each document represents one
access list entry you want to add to the project. You must specify an
array even if you are only associating a single access list entry to the
project.

When you submit a ``POST`` request containing ``ipAddress`` or
``cidrBlock`` values which are not already present in the access list,
|mms| adds those entries to the list of existing entries in the
access list. |mms| does not set the access list to only contain the
entries specified in the request.

In the following table, ``[i]`` represents an array index.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 10 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``[i].ipAddress``
     - string
     - IP address to be added to the access list for the
       service account. This field is mutually exclusive with the
       ``cidrBlock`` field.

   * - ``[i].cidrBlock``
     - string
     - Access list entry in |cidr| notation to be added for the
       service account. This field is mutually exclusive with the
       ``ipAddress`` field.

Response
--------

.. include:: /includes/api/get-all-note.rst

Each object within the ``results`` array is one access list entry.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 75

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``cidrBlock``
     - string
     - CIDR-notated range of IP addresses in the access list.

   * - ``requestCount``
     - number
     - Total number of requests that have originated from this IP
       address.

   * - ``createdAt``
     - date
     - Date this IP address was added to the access list.

   * - ``ipAddress``
     - string
     - IP address in the access list.

   * - ``lastUsedAt``
     - date
     - Date of the most recent request that originated from this IP
       address. This field only appears if at least one request has
       originated from this IP address, and is only updated when a
       resource is retrieved from the access list.

   * - ``lastUsedAddress``
     - string
     - IP address from which the last call to the API was issued. This
       field only appears if at least one request has originated
       from this IP address.
