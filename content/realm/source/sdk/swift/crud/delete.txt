Delete Realm Objects
--------------------

Deleting Realm Objects must occur within write transactions. For
more information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Transactions <ios-write-transactions>`.

If you want to delete the Realm file itself, see: :ref:`Delete a Realm 
<swift-delete-a-realm>`.

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete

   You cannot access or modify an object after you have deleted it from
   a realm. If you try to use a deleted object, Realm throws an
   error.

.. _ios-chaining-delete:

Delete an Object and Its Related Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, you want to delete related objects when you delete the parent 
object. We call this a **chaining delete**. Realm does not delete 
the related objects for you. If you do not delete the objects yourself, 
they remain orphaned in your realm. Whether or not this is a problem 
depends on your application's needs.

The best way to delete dependent objects is to iterate through 
the dependencies and delete them before deleting the parent object.

.. _ios-delete-all-object-of-a-specific-type:

Delete All Objects of a Specific Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To delete all objects of a given object type from a realm, pass
      the result of :swift-sdk:`Realm.objects(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V7objectsyAA7ResultsVyxGxmSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`
      for the type you wish to delete to :swift-sdk:`Realm.delete(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6deleteyyxSTRzSo13RLMObjectBaseC7ElementRczlF>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.delete-all-of-class.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To delete all objects of a given object type from a realm, pass
      the result of :objc-sdk:`+[YourRealmObjectClass
      allObjectsInRealm:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)allObjectsInRealm:>`
      to :objc-sdk:`-[Realm deleteObjects:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)deleteObjects:>`
      inside of a write transaction. Replace ``YourRealmObjectClass``
      with your Realm object class name.

.. _ios-delete-all-objects-in-a-realm:

Delete All Objects in a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To delete all objects from the realm, call
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll()
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9deleteAllyyF>` inside of a
      write transaction. This clears the realm of all object instances
      but does not affect the realm's schema.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.delete-all.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To delete all objects from the realm, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMRealm
      deleteAllObjects]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)deleteAllObjects>`
      inside of a write transaction. This clears the realm of all object
      instances but does not affect the realm's schema.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.delete-all.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _swift-delete-map:

Delete Map Keys/Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete :swift-sdk:`map <Classes/Map.html>` entries in a few ways:

- Use ``removeObject(for:)`` to remove the key and the value
- If the dictionary's value is optional, you can set the value of the key to 
  ``nil`` to keep the key.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.map.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-delete-mutableset-elements:

Delete MutableSet Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete specific elements from a :swift-sdk:`MutableSet 
<Classes/MutableSet.html>`, or clear all of the elements from the set.
If you are working with multiple sets, you can also remove elements in one
set from the other set; see: :ref:`swift-update-mutableset-property`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.set-collections.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-remove-anyrealmvalue:

Delete the Value of an AnyRealmValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete the value of an AnyRealmValue, set it to ``.none``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.mixed-data-type.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-delete-object-async:

Delete an Object Asynchronously
-------------------------------

You can use Swift concurrency features to asynchronously delete objects 
using an actor-isolated realm. 

This function from the example ``RealmActor`` :ref:`defined on the 
Use Realm with Actors page <swift-define-realm-actor>` shows how you might
delete an object in an actor-isolated realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.delete-async.swift
   :language: swift

And you might perform this deletion using Swift's async syntax:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmActor.snippet.delete-object.swift
   :language: swift

This operation does not block or perform I/O on the calling thread. For
more information about writing to realm using Swift concurrency features, 
refer to :ref:`swift-actor-isolated-realm`.
