msgid "The :query:`$geoIntersects` operator is a geospatial query operator that selects all locations that intersect with a :term:`GeoJSON` object. A location intersects a GeoJSON object if the intersection is non-empty. This includes documents that have a shared edge. The :query:`$geoIntersects` operator uses spherical geometry."
