Overview
--------

This procedure uses the :method:`db.changeUserPassword()` method to change a
user's password.

Prerequisites
-------------

Users with :authaction:`changeOwnPassword` access on their databases can
change their own passwords.

Users with :authaction:`changeAnyPassword` access on a database can modify
the passwords for any user on that database.


Procedure
---------

To update the password, pass the user's username and the new password to the
:method:`db.changeUserPassword()` method.

.. example:: The following operation changes the ``reporting`` user's
   password to ``SOhSS3TbYhxusooLiW8ypJPxmt1oOfL``:

 .. code-block:: javascript

      db = db.getSiblingDB('records')
      db.changeUserPassword("reporting", "SOhSS3TbYhxusooLiW8ypJPxmt1oOfL")

.. end-reference-example-content

.. note::

   For information on changing a user's password prior to version 2.5.3,
   see :v2.4:`Change a User's Password in the v2.4 Manual
   </tutorial/change-user-password>`.

.. NOTE the primary reason for the above note is that the 2.4 page includes
   info on changes between 2.2 and 2.4, changes we don't want to document here.
