You can create a project using a live database connection. 
Creating a project is the first step in the migration process. 
When creating a project with a live connection you:

- Provide the connection details for your source relational database.

- Provide the connection details for your destination MongoDB deployment.

- Select the database, schema, and tables that are part of the migration.

About this Task
---------------

Creating a project with a live connection is the recommended process for starting a new Relational Migrator project. 

.. include:: /includes/project-initial-mappings-att.rst

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`New Project` at the top-right of the Relational Migrator home screen. 

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Connect database` button.

      To use a saved :ref:`relational database connection <rm-save-relational-connection>`, 
      click :guilabel:`Use a saved connection` and select it from the 
      drop-down, then enter credentials if required.
        
      To create a new connection, click :guilabel:`Add a new connection`:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-create-relational-connection-short.rst
   
   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Select tables` screen, indicate the tables you want to migrate and click :guilabel:`Next`.
   
      The following table explains the different ways you can select tables to migrate: 
   
      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 75
   
         * - Target
           - Action
   
         * - All tables within a database
           - Click the check mark for the target database.
   
         * -  All tables within a schema
           - Expand the target database and click the check mark for the target schema.
   
         * - Specific tables within a schema
           - Expand the target database and schema. Select the target tables individually.
       
         * - Specific table names
           - Use the :guilabel:`Filter` bar above the :guilabel:`Relational Schema` list.
   
   .. step:: Choose a :guilabel:`Global casing` option for collection names. 
      
      This option affects the names of your collections created from the tables in your relational database:
   
      - :guilabel:`Keep Original`: Keep the original casing used in your
        relational database table name.
   
      - :guilabel:`Override with Global Casing`: Override the original table name
        with a global casing convention.
   
        - ``TitleCase``
        - ``camelCase``
        - ``kebab-case``
        - ``snake_case``
        - ``UPPER_SNAKE_CASE``
   
   .. step:: Choose an :guilabel:`Initial mappings` option for your MongoDB schema.
      
      .. include:: /includes/project-initial-mappings.rst
   
   .. step:: Enter a name for your project.
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Done`.
