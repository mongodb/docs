Required Access for MongoDB Agent

   :description: Authenticate the Ops Manager MongoDB Agent with proper roles for deployments enforcing access control without Automation.

If your MongoDB deployment enforces access control, the |mms|
{+mdbagent+} must authenticate to MongoDB as a
:manual:`user with the proper access </core/security-users>`.

.. note::

   The instructions on this page are for deployments that do not use {+aagent+}. If you use {+aagent+}, |mms| manages authentication for you and the following instructions do not apply.

To authenticate, create a user with the appropriate roles in MongoDB.
The following tutorials include instructions and examples for creating
the {+mdbagent+} user in your MongoDB deployment:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-scram`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-kerberos`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-x509`.

MongoDB user roles are separate from |mms|
:doc:`user roles </reference/user-roles>`. These roles and their
privileges are described in the MongoDB manual beginning with the
:manual:`Authorization </core/authorization>` page.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations-mongodb-agent-access-control.rst

.. important::

   Every ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` process in your |mms| deployment
   must use the same username and roles for the {+mdbagent+} user.

Automation
----------

.. include:: /includes/prerequisites-create-user-for-agent.rst

To automate MongoDB instances, the {+mdbagent+} must authenticate
on the ``admin`` database as a MongoDB user with the following roles:

- :authrole:`clusterAdmin`
- :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`
- :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`
- :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase`
- :authrole:`backup`
- :authrole:`restore`

Backup
------

To backup MongoDB instances, the {+mdbagent+} must authenticate on the
listed database as a MongoDB user with the required roles.

Monitoring
----------

To monitor MongoDB instances, the {+mdbagent+} must authenticate on the
``admin`` database as a MongoDB user with the
:authrole:`clusterMonitor` role.

Monitoring includes gathering :dbcommand:`dbStats` and
:doc:`database profiling </tutorial/profile-database>` information.

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

To authenticate, create the user in MongoDB with the appropriate
access. The authentication method that the MongoDB deployment uses
determines which options to set when creating the user as well as
determining any additional {+mdbagent+} configuration:
