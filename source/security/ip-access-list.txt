|service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in
the project's IP access list. Each entry is either a single IP address
or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses. For |aws| clusters with one or
more :ref:`VPC Peering <vpc-peering>` connections to the same |aws|
region, you can specify a Security Group associated with a peered
|vpc|.

For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
:ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the IP addresses of your |gcp| or |azure|
services to |service| project IP access list to grant those services
access to the cluster.

The IP access list applies to all clusters in the project and can have
up to 200 IP access list entries, with the following exception:
projects with an existing sharded cluster created *before* August 25,
2017 can have up to 100 IP access list entries.

|service| supports creating temporary IP access list entries that
expire within a user-configurable 7-day period.
