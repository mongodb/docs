  On **server 1**, download the latest version of the |onprem|
  package by issuing ``curl -OL`` with the URL for the latest version. If
  the **server 1** does not have Internet access, download the package to
  another server and ``scp`` it to **server 1**.

  To download the |onprem| package:

  a. In a browser, go to `http://www.mongodb.com/download <http://www.mongodb.com/download>`_.

  b. On the :guilabel:`MongoDB Ops Manager Downloads` page, copy the link
     address of the :guilabel:`RPM` link.

  c. Open a system prompt.

  d. Download the |onprem| package by issuing a ``curl`` command that uses the copied link address:

     .. code-block:: none

        curl -OL <link-address-for-ops-manager-rpm>

     The downloaded package is named ``mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm``,
     where ``<version>`` is replaced by the version number.

title: "Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the **server 1** to **server 2**."
stepnum: 7
level: 4
ref: sync-genkey
pre: |
  |onprem| requires an identical :ref:`gen-key` file be stored on both
  servers running |onprem| and uses the file to encrypt data at rest in
  the |application| Database and Backup Database.

  Use ``scp`` to copy the ``gen.key`` file from the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/``
  directory on **server2** to the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` directory on
  **server2**. You must copy the ``gen.key`` file before starting |onprem|
  on **server2**.
