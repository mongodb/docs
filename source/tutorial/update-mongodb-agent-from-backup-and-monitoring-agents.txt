Next Steps

After the {+mdbagent+} update completes:

- If Automation did not previously manage your Monitoring and/or
  Backup Agents, activate :ref:`{+bagent+} <activate-backup>`
  and/or :ref:`{+magent+} <activate-monitoring>` on your MongoDB
  deployment.

- If Automation did previously manage your Monitoring and/or Backup
  Agents, they are now activated. To verify that they
  are activated, click :guilabel:`Deployment` :icon-fa5:`arrow-right`

- If you want to activate {+aagent+},
  :ref:`add a deployment <activate-automation>` to your MongoDB
  project.
