title: Create and apply RBAC resources to each cluster.
content: |

  Use :github:`these RBAC resource examples </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/1.20.1/samples/multi-cluster-cli-gitops/resources/rbac>` to create your own. To learn more about these 
  RBAC resources, see :ref:`multi-cluster-rbac-manual`.
  
  To apply them to your central and member clusters with GitOps, you can use a tool like `Argo CD <https://argoproj.github.io/cd>`__.

ref: create-configmap-gitops
title: Create and apply the ConfigMap file.
content: |

  The |k8s-op-short| keeps track of its member clusters using a |k8s-configmap-def| file. Copy, modify, and apply the following example ConfigMap:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     data:
       cluster1: ""
       cluster2: ""
     metadata:
       namespace: <namespace>
       name: mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list
       labels:
         multi-cluster: "true"

ref: configure-kubeconfig-gitops
title: Configure the ``kubeconfig`` secret for the |k8s-op-short|.
content: |

  The |k8s-op-short|, which runs in the central cluster, communicates with the Pods in 
  the member clusters through the Kubernetes API. For this to work, the |k8s-op-short| 
  needs a :k8sdocs:`kubeconfig </concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/>` 
  file that contains the service account tokens of the member clusters. Create this 
  ``kubeconfig`` file by following these steps: 

  1. Obtain a list of |k8s-service-accounts| configured in the |k8s-op-short|'s namespace.  For example, if you chose to use the default ``mongodb`` namespace, then you can obtain the service accounts using the following command:

     .. code-block:: sh
        
        kubectl get serviceaccounts -n mongodb

  #. Get the secret for each service account that belongs to a member cluster.

     .. code-block:: sh

        kubectl get secret <service-account-name> -n mongodb -o yaml

  #. In each service account secret, copy the |certauth| certificate and token. For example, copy ``<ca_certificate>`` and ``<token>`` from the secret, as shown in the following example:  

     .. code-block:: yaml

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: my-service-account
          namespace: mongodb
        data:
          ca.crt: <ca_certificate>
          token: <token>

  #. Copy the following ``kubeconfig`` example for the central cluster and replace 
     the placeholders with the ``<ca_certificate>`` and ``<token>`` you copied from the service account secrets.

     .. code-block:: yaml
          
        apiVersion: v1
        clusters:
        - cluster:
            certificate-authority-data: <cluster-1-ca.crt>
            server: https://:
          name: kind-e2e-cluster-1
        - cluster:
            certificate-authority-data: <cluster-2-ca.crt>
            server: https://:
          name: kind-e2e-cluster-2
        contexts:
        - context:
            cluster: kind-e2e-cluster-1
            namespace: mongodb
            user: kind-e2e-cluster-1
          name: kind-e2e-cluster-1
        - context:
            cluster: kind-e2e-cluster-2
            namespace: mongodb
            user: kind-e2e-cluster-2
          name: kind-e2e-cluster-2
        kind: Config
        users:
        - name: kind-e2e-cluster-1
          user:
            token: <cluster-1-token>
        - name: kind-e2e-cluster-2
          user:
            token: <cluster-2-token>

  #. Save the ``kubeconfig`` file.
  
  #. Create a secret in the central cluster that you mount in the |k8s-op-short| as illustrated in :github:`the reference Helm chart </mongodb/helm-charts/blob/enterprise-operator-1.20.1/charts/enterprise-operator/templates/operator.yaml#L191-L197/>`. For example:

     .. code-block:: sh

        kubectl --context="${CTX_CENTRAL_CLUSTER}" -n <operator-namespace> create secret --from-file=kubeconfig=<path-to-kubeconfig-file> <kubeconfig-secret-name>
