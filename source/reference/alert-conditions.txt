Review Alert Conditions
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: twocols

This page describes the conditions for which you can trigger alerts. 
You specify conditions and thresholds when :doc:`configuring alerts 
</configure-alerts>`. To learn more, see :ref:`alerts-workflow`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-free-shared-alerts.rst

Host Alerts
-----------

The conditions in this section apply if you select :guilabel:`Host` as
the alert target when configuring the alert. You can apply the
condition to all hosts or to specific type of host, such as
:term:`primaries <primary>` or
:term:`config servers <config server>`.

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-host-alerts.rst

Advisor
~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host has index suggestions

   Raised if :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`
   has index suggestions for the host.

   If the :ref:`query targeting ratio <query-targeting-resolution>` for
   a host is high for a period of 10 minutes, Performance Advisor 
   checks the host for inefficient queries and possible indexes to 
   improve performance. If Performance Advisor determines that the host 
   benefits from one or more indexes, this alert triggers and directs 
   you to create the suggested indexes.

   This alert is only available for ``M10+`` clusters, and is enabled
   by default for ``M10+`` clusters that have
   :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` enabled. This alert
   does not trigger for clusters where Performance Advisor is disabled.

Asserts
~~~~~~~

The following alert conditions measure the rate of asserts for a
MongoDB process, as collected from the MongoDB ``serverStatus``
command's :serverstatus:`asserts` document. You can view asserts
through :doc:`cluster monitoring </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

   .. note::

      |service| triggers this alert only for AWS EC2 clusters that

Restarts
~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Restarts in Last Hour is

   Raised if the number of times a host restarts within the
   previous hour exceeds the specified threshold.

Host Down
~~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host is Down
   
   Raised if |service| is unable to reach a host for several
   minutes.

   .. important::

      You should only configure this alert if you depend on secondary
      reads. For more information on secondary reads, see
      :ref:`replica-set-tags` and :ref:`replica-set-read-preference`.

   This alert is generally triggered by one of the following
   conditions:

   - The cluster has experienced a failure and is being auto-healed.
   - The cluster could not be reached because of a network issue.

   |service-fullname| checks that the downtime did not occur because of
   your actions, such as :manual:`rolling index builds
   </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>`. If |service-fullname| confirms
   that the downtime was not intentional, |service-fullname| attempts to replace
   the affected node. If failures occur, |service| clusters maintain node
   availability for both reads and writes as long as a majority of nodes are
   running. To learn more, see :ref:`How does MongoDB Atlas deliver high
   availability? <high-availability>`.

Replica Set Alerts
------------------

The following alert conditions apply to

.. alert:: Number of elections in last hour is > X

   Raised when the number of elections that have occurred in
   the last hour exceeds the user-specified value of ``X``. The value
   of ``X`` is set when you create the alert. This alert might indicate
   that the cluster's replication is not in a healthy state, as

.. _billing-alerts:

Billing Alerts
--------------

The following alert conditions apply to |service| billing. You can 
configure billing alerts from the {+atlas-ui+} at the organization 
level or the project level.

To configure organization-level alerts, select your organization and 
navigate to :guilabel:`Alerts`.

To configure project-level alerts, select your project. Navigate 
to your project settings and then to :guilabel:`Alerts`, or click the 
:icon-mms:`bell` icon in the top right corner of your project cluster 
view.

.. note::

   All amounts billed are in :abbr:`USD (United States Dollars)`.

.. alert:: Amount billed ($) yesterday is above the threshold

   Raised if the organization or project's last daily amount
   billed exceeds your configured threshold. |service| does not account
   for any credits applied for the previous day when calculating the
   billed amount.

   This condition applies to both organizations and projects.
   
.. alert:: Credit card is about to expire

   Raised if the credit card on file is about to expire. The

   this alert resets.

   This alert condition applies to organizations only.

.. _federation-alerts:

Federation Alerts
-----------------
   
.. alert:: Organization's IdP certificate is about to expire

   organization for which you have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
   role expires within 14 days. |service| sends this alert daily until 
   you acknowledge it.
   
   .. note::
      
      |service| creates this alert automatically when you

      <atlas-map-org-idp>`. If you remove the mapping, |service| 
      deletes all instances of this alert.

.. _alert-conditions-encryption-at-rest:

Encryption at Rest Alerts
-------------------------

The following alert conditions apply to projects using
:ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

.. alert:: AWS encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days

   Raised if the AWS Customer Master Key (CMK) used by the
   |service| project has been active for more than the configured
   number of days (90 by default). You can modify the alert
   threshold from the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab of the
   :guilabel:`Alerts` view.

   |service| automatically rotates MongoDB master encryption keys
   every 90 days, but does not rotate the project's
   :abbr:`CMK (Customer Master Key)`. To prevent receiving this
   alert prematurely, you can :ref:`modify <configure-alerts>` the
   default alert period. If you :ref:`configure <configure-alerts>` the
   default 90 days :alert:`alert <AWS encryption key elapsed time since
   last rotation is above (n) days>` to be greater than the |aws| |kms|
   CMK rotation, |service| won't create the alert because |aws| would
   have automatically rotated your |cmk|.  

   This alert resets automatically if you rotate the project
   :abbr:`CMK (Customer Master Key)`. For documentation on how to
   rotate your project :abbr:`CMK (customer master key)`, see
   :ref:`security-aws-kms-rotate-key`.

.. alert:: Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days

   Raised if the Azure Key Vault Key Identifier used by the
   |service| project has been active for more than the configured
   number of days (90 by default). You can modify the alert threshold
   from the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab of the
   :guilabel:`Alerts` view.

   |service| automatically rotates MongoDB master encryption keys every
   90 days, but does not rotate the project's Key Identifier.

   This alert resets automatically if you rotate the project Key
   Identifier. For documentation on how to rotate your project Key
   Identifier, see :ref:`azure-kms-rotate-key`.

.. alert:: GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days

   Raised if the GCP Key Version Resource ID used by the
   |service| project has been active for more than the configured
   number of days (90 by default). You can modify the alert threshold
   from the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab of the
   :guilabel:`Alerts` view.

   |service| automatically rotates MongoDB master encryption keys every
   90 days, but does not rotate the project's Key Version Resource ID.

   This alert resets automatically if you rotate the project
   Key Version Resource ID.

   .. seealso::

      To learn how to rotate your project Key Version Resource ID, see
      :ref:`gcp-kms-rotate-key`.
