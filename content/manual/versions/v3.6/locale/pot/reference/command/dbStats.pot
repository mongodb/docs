#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:18
msgid "The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command returns storage statistics for a given database. The command takes the following syntax:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:27
msgid "``scale`` is optional and defaults to ``1``."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:29
msgid "In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :method:`db.stats()` function provides a wrapper around :dbcommand:`dbStats`."

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:33
msgid "Behavior"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:35
msgid "The ``scale`` argument allows you to specify how to scale byte values. For example, a ``scale`` value of ``1024`` will display the results in kilobytes rather than in bytes:"

msgid "Scaling rounds values to whole numbers."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:48
msgid "The time required to run the command depends on the total size of the database. Because the command must touch all data files, the command may take several seconds to run."

msgid "After an unclean shutdown of a :binary:`~bin.mongod` using the :doc:`Wired Tiger </core/wiredtiger>` storage engine, |opt| statistics reported by |cmd| may be inaccurate."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-unexpected-shutdown-accuracy.rst:5
msgid "The amount of drift depends on the number of insert, update, or delete operations performed between the last :ref:`checkpoint <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>` and the unclean shutdown. Checkpoints usually occur every 60 seconds. However, :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running with non-default :option:`--syncdelay <mongod --syncdelay>` settings may have more or less frequent checkpoints."
