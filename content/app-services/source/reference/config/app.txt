You configure Application-level settings like your App name,
environment, and deployment configuration in ``root_config.json``.

.. code-block:: none
   
   app/
   └── root_config.json

.. tip::

   If you're using the {+cli+}, you can find metadata information about
   your specific deployed App instance in :ref:`the .mdb directory <dot-mdb>`.

Root Configuration
------------------

Your configuration directory must include a ``root_config.json`` file
with the following structure:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :caption: /root_config.json

   {
     "name": "<App Name>",
     "deployment_model": "<Deployment Model Type>",
     "provider_region": "<Cloud Provider Region Name>",
     "environment": "<Environment Name>",
     "allowed_request_origins": ["<Request Origin URL>", ...]
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | ``name``
       | ``string``

     - The application's name.

       .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst

   * - | ``deployment_model``
       | ``string``

     - The application's :ref:`deployment model <realm-deployment-models>`.

       Valid options:

       - ``"GLOBAL"`` for :ref:`Global Deployment <global-deployment>`
       - ``"LOCAL"`` for :ref:`Local Deployment <local-deployment>`

   * - | ``provider_region``
       | ``string``

     - The name of the :ref:`cloud region <deployment-regions>` that the
       application is deployed in.

       - :ref:`Global applications <global-deployment>` process
         all database writes in this region, but serve other application
         requests in the nearest deployment region.

       - :ref:`Local applications <local-deployment>` process all
         application requests and database writes in this region.

   * - | ``environment``
       | ``string?``

     - The name of the environment the app should use when evaluating
       :ref:`environment values <environment-values>`.

       Valid options:

       .. include:: /includes/list-of-environment-names.rst

       Default: ``""``

   * - | ``allowed_request_origins``
       | ``string[]?``

     - An array of URLs that incoming requests may originate from. If you define
       any allowed request origins, then Atlas App Services blocks any incoming
       request from an origin that is not listed.

       .. tip::

          Request origins are URLs with the following form:

          .. code-block:: text

             <scheme>://<host>[:port]

          For example, the following are both valid request origins:

          .. code-block:: text

             https://www.example.com
             https://www.example.com:443
