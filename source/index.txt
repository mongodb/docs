   :class: note

   - Ability to :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` ``M0`` Free Tier clusters to
     ``M10+`` paid clusters.

   - Available in Beta: |stitch-docs|_.
        MongoDB Stitch is a backend as a service that provides an HTTP
        API to MongoDB, integration with other services, and a
        declarative rules infrastructure which spans database and
        service actions.

   - Improved the average time to create a new |service| cluster.

   - Redesign of the Connect dialog for |service|.

   - Ability to specify MongoDB user roles at :ref:`a collection level
     <add-mongodb-users>`.

   - Ability for owners of a project to :ref:`kill slow running
     operations <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

   - Ability to :doc:`live migrate </import/live-import/>` MongoDB
     version 3.0/3.2 replica set to an |service| 3.4 cluster.

   - Ability to :doc:`restore </restore-cluster>` to clusters in
     different project.

   - Support for :ref:`deploying clusters <create-new-cluster>` on
     the :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp>` and :ref:`Microsoft Azure 
     <microsoft-azure>`

.. admonition:: Video Series Available
   :class: note

   `Tutorial Series [Video]: Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas
   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIiVjgEDI7M&list=PL4RCxklHWZ9smTpR3hUdq53Su601yCPLj>`_

`MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com?jmp=docs>`_ is a cloud
service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments,
including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB
instances. In addition, |service| provides the ability to
:doc:`introspect collections <data-explorer>`, :doc:`query backups
<query-backup>`, and :doc:`migrate data from existing MongoDB replica
set </import/live-import>` into an |service| cluster.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`.

MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-instance.rst

Depending on the cloud provider and region selected for the |service| project,
|service| distributes each cluster across the region for high availability.
For more information on how |service| manages cluster distribution, see
:ref:`amazon-aws-availability-zones` for :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`,
:ref:`google-gcp-availability-zones` for :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)`,
and :ref:`microsoft-azure-availability-zones` for :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft
Azure)`.

|service| deploys each cluster with mandatory :ref:`security
<overview-security>`. 

|service| Project
-----------------

Your |service| project manages your MongoDB deployments. An |service|
project can have multiple MongoDB clusters.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-vpc-per-project.rst

.. _overview-security:

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of :ref:`TLS/SSL
<security-tls>`, :ref:`virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
<security-vpc>` with :ref:`IP whitelists <add-to-whitelist>`, and
:ref:`user authentication and authorization <mongodb-users>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.

Next Steps
----------
