You must create a database user to access your cluster. For
security purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB
database users to access clusters.

Database users are separate from |service| users:

- Database users can access databases hosted in |service|.

- |service| users can log in to |service| but do not have access to
  MongoDB databases.

Required Access
---------------

To create a database user, you must have
:authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Project Charts Admin` access to
the project.

Procedure
---------

To add a database user to your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-add-mongodb-users.rst

.. seealso::

   To learn more about configuring additional database users on your
   cluster, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users/`.

Next steps
----------

Now that you have a database user for your cluster, proceed to 
:doc:`Connect to Your Cluster </tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster>`.
