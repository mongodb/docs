~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Enable MongoDB Usage UI and MongoDB Usage Data Collection
   :class: important

   If :setting:`MongoDB Usage UI` is set to ``true``, this page
   displays information about the MongoDB Usage collected via daily
   snapshots.

   If this page contains no data, you can populate it with data with one of two methods:

   - Set :setting:`MongoDB Usage Data Collection` to ``true`` and wait
     for the daily usage snapshot to generate within 24 hours.

   - Request the
     :doc:`Daily Usage Snapshot API resource </reference/api/usage/generate-daily-usage-snapshot>`.


Sections of the Page
````````````````````

This page has two parts: a usage summary and a table of MongoDB deployments.

Usage Summary
+++++++++++++

This card contains a section for each server type that your |onprem| deployment between the dates selected.

Each server type section contains three headings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Heading
     - Description
   * - :guilabel:`RAM Used`
     - Greatest amount of RAM used on the date with the greatest use.
   * - :guilabel:`Total Nodes`
     - Count of nodes used on the date with the greatest use.
   * - :guilabel:`Date`
     - When this server type had its greatest use.

The *date of greatest use* depends on the server type:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Server Type
     - Date of Greatest Use Measured
   * - RAM Pool
     - When the greatest amount of RAM was used for all hosts running
       that server type.
   * - All other server types
     - When the greatest number of all hosts of that server type were
       running.

Deployments Table
+++++++++++++++++

This table contains each server and describes the server type associated, as well as important information about the server's processes and their deployments.


Actions
```````

From this page, you can:

Determine Server Type Usage over Time
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To review which server types were in use for your MongoDB Enterprise
installations during a given time period:

1. Select a start date from the :guilabel:`From` box.

2. Select an end date from the :guilabel:`To` box.

The Usage Summary updates automatically with the applicable values.

Apply New Server Type to Multiple Hosts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To change the server type of multiple hosts at once:

1. Check the box at the left the columns containing the hosts to which
   you wish to apply the new server type.

2. Select the desired server type from the
   :guilabel:`Apply a Server Type` dropdown.

This action updates these hosts to have that server type for all
*existing* and *future* usage snapshots. The new server type does not
apply to the timeframe you specified using the date selectors.

Apply New Server Type to Specific Host
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To change the server type of one host, use the dropdown in its row
under the :guilabel:`Server Type` column.

This action updates this host to have that server type for all

       daemon or blockstore.

     - Click the name of the daemon or blockstore.

   * - Toggle whether a job :term:`journals <journal>` its
       :term:`head database`.

     - Select or clear :guilabel:`Journal Head` to turn on or off
       journaling for your head database.

       .. note::
          Changing this setting at the job level overrides the
          deployment-wide setting.

       See :setting:`mms.backup.journal.heads` for how to enable or
       disable journaling for all head databases in your group.

Manage Backup Resources
```````````````````````

From the :guilabel:`Jobs` page, you can assign backup resources to a
particular :term:`group`.

You can make these changes for existing backups, but only new
:term:`backup jobs <backup job>` will follow the new rules. Making
these changes does not affect existing deployments. For additional
procedural information, see
:doc:`/tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Task

     - Procedure

   * - Assign a group to particular :term:`daemons <Backup Daemon>`,
       :term:`blockstores <blockstore>`
       or :term:`oplog stores <Oplog Store Database>`.

     - Click the group to open the group's assignment page; make the
       assignments; select :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

   * - Assign a group to a labelled set of daemons, blockstores,
       and oplog stores.

     - First assign the label on the Admin page for each resource. See
       :ref:`daemons-interface`, :ref:`blockstores-page`,
       and :ref:`oplog-stores-page`.

       Then, on the :guilabel:`Jobs` page:

       1. Click the group name to open the group's assignment page.

       2. In the :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` list box, click
          :guilabel:`Select Labels`.

       3. Select the label. Each selected label must exist on at least
          one daemon, one blockstore, and one oplog store. If you
          select multiple labels, the resource must meet all selected
          labels.

          Keep in mind that the resource must also meet any other
          selected criteria on this page. For example, for a daemon to
          match, it must also meet any selections you have made in the
          :guilabel:`Backup Daemon` field.

       4. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

:guilabel:`Job Timeline` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page displays a graphical representation of information found on
other :guilabel:`Admin` pages, in particular the :guilabel:`Jobs`
page. The :guilabel:`Job Timeline` page displays critical timestamps
(:term:`head <head database>`, last snapshot, next snapshot) and
offers a way to assign a :term:`daemon <Backup Daemon>` to a given job.

.. _resource-usage-page:

:guilabel:`Resource Usage` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page provides key size and throughput statistics on a per-job
basis for all groups for which Backup is enabled. The page displays
the size of the data set, how active it is, and how much space is
being used on the snapshot store.

To export the information, click :guilabel:`Export as CSV`.

.. _grooms-page:

:guilabel:`Grooms` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page lists active and recent :term:`groom` jobs. Groom jobs
remove unused :term:`blocks <block>` on
:term:`blockstores <blockstore>` and
:term:`S3 Snapshot Stores <S3 Snapshot Store>` to reclaim storage
space. If no existing :term:`snapshots <snapshot>` reference a given
block, it is considered *unused*. |onprem| grooms blockstores at least
once a year and :abbr:`S3 (Simple Storage Service)` snapshot stores at
least every two weeks.

A groom job forces the backup process to:

1. Write all new data to a new location,

#. Copy all existing, needed data from the old location to the new one,

#. Update references to maintain data relationships, and

#. Drop the old database.


.. admonition:: File Size Changes during Grooming
   :class: note

   During grooming operations, you may notice that the file sizes of
   blockstores and :abbr:`S3 (Simple Storage Service)` snapshot stores
   fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. This is normal during these
   operations.

You can manually direct |onprem| to move blocks between blockstores
through the :ref:`groom-priority-page`.

You can also :doc:`/tutorial/configure-block-size`.

.. _groom-priority-page:

:guilabel:`Groom Priority` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page displays a list of the status of all of the backup jobs and
their blockstores. There are three types of jobs that run to maintain
a blockstore:

Tracking jobs
  Scheduled to run every three days unless a previously scheduled
  blockstore job has not finished in that time. Tracking jobs also are
  scheduled to run immediately after a groom job. Tracking jobs
  determine the current ratio of living to dead blocks
  in blockstores.

Groom jobs
  Scheduled to run when the ratio of living to dead
  bytes drops below ``0.45``. To learn more about grooming, see
  :ref:`Groom page <grooms-page>`

Integrity Check Jobs
  Scheduled to run every seven days unless a previously scheduled
  blockstore job has not finished in that time. These checks make sure
  that the blockstore has no data integrity issues.

Each blockstore can run only one blockstore job (groom, track, or
integrity check) at a time unless you change its
:ref:`Load Factor <edit-blockstore>`. The :guilabel:`Load Factor` sets
how many jobs that a blockstore can run at the same time. It is set to
``1`` by default.

To learn how to change the :guilabel:`Load Factor`, see
:ref:`Edit a Blockstore <edit-blockstore>`.

Each row in this table lists a backup job. Its background color
indicates if the state of its associated blockstore is accurate and
current.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Color
     - Blockstore Storage Usage Status

   * - Blue
     - Amount of blockstore storage usage is changing. Blockstore groom
       job is in progress.

   * - Green
     - Amount of blockstore storage usage is accurate. Blockstore has
       run a tracking job since last groom job ran.

   * - Red
     - Amount of blockstore storage usage is stale. Blockstore has run
       a groom job since its last tracking job ran.

Manual Blockstore Maintenance
`````````````````````````````

From this page, you can also perform three kinds of blockstore
maintenance manually:

Move Blocks to a Different Blockstore
  To move a backup's chunks to a different blockstore, select the
  destination blockstore in the backup's :guilabel:`Blockstore List`
  column. You might want to do this if you add a new blockstore and
  would like to balance data.

Groom a Blockstore
  To initiate a groom job, click :guilabel:`Schedule` in the
  :guilabel:`Groom Action` column for the blockstore
  :term:`replica set` you want to groom. You should not need to
  manually schedule groom jobs. |onprem|
  :ref:`runs the jobs automatically <grooms-page>`.

Check Blockstore Integrity
  To initiate an integrity check, click :guilabel:`IntegCheck` in the
  :guilabel:`Integrity Action` column for the blockstore
  :term:`replica set` you want to check. The
  :guilabel:`Integrity Schedule Result` modal appears and displays the
  status of the blockstore.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-block-size`.

.. _daemons-interface:

:guilabel:`Daemons` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page lists all active :term:`Backup Daemons <Backup Daemon>` and
provides configuration options. |onprem| automatically detects Backup
Daemons and displays them here. You can reconfigure daemons from this
page. Changes can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.

Click :guilabel:`Pre-Configure New Daemon` at the bottom of the page if
you want to add a daemon but do not want it to take new jobs. Type the
``<machine>:<roothead path>`` in the text field above
:guilabel:`Pre-Configure New Daemon`. Click the button to configure the
new Backup Daemon.

For each daemon, the page lists the server name, configuration,
:term:`head <head database>` space used, head space free, the number of
replica sets backed up, the percentage of time the Backup Daemon
Service was busy, and job runtime counts by 1 minute, 10 minutes,
60 minutes, less than or equal to 180 minutes, and greater than 180
minutes.

The page includes the following fields and links to manage and
configure daemons:

.. These table fields are internal only:
   Queryable Restore Jobs, Archive Jobs, Git Commit Hash: internal

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Show Detailed JSON`
     - Displays the Backup Daemon JSON. When the JSON displays, the
       :guilabel:`View raw runtime data` link appears under the code,
       allowing you to view the raw data.

   * - :guilabel:`Move all heads`
     - Moves all the Backup Daemon jobs that live on this daemon to a
       new daemon location.

       #. Click the link.
       #. Click the location.
       #. Click :guilabel:`Move all heads`.

   * - :guilabel:`Delete Daemon`
     - Deletes a Backup Daemon.

   * - :guilabel:`Assignment`
     - Allows the daemon to process more jobs. If the daemon's disk
       fills, clear this so the host is not overloaded.

   * - :guilabel:`Backup Jobs`
     - Allows the daemon to process more backup jobs. Clear this when
       performing maintenance on a daemon's host.

   * - :guilabel:`Resource Usage`
     - Collects information on :term:`blockstore` use (i.e., which
       snapshots still reference how many blocks). |onprem| uses this
       information to generate the :ref:`resource-usage-page` page and
       to prioritize garbage collection.

       .. note::

          If this |onprem| instance is running as a dedicated restore
          daemon host, you may want to clear this checkbox to ensure
          the fastest possible restore time.

   * - :guilabel:`Garbage Collection`
     - Allows the daemon to schedule :term:`groom` jobs to remove
       unused blocks and expired snapshots.

       .. note::

          If this |onprem| instance is running as a dedicated restore
          daemon host, you may want to clear this checkbox to ensure
          the fastest possible restore time.

   * - :guilabel:`Head Disk Type`
     - Indicates whether the disk type is SSD or HDD. If you change a
       daemon to SSD, then only jobs with an :term:`oplog` greater than
       1GB/hour will go to this daemon unless no HDD daemon is
       available. Jobs with an oplog less than 1GB/hour can go to this
       daemon only if no HDD daemon is available.

       .. warning::
          If you run |onprem| 2.0.3 or earlier, jobs with an oplog less
          than 1GB/hour *cannot* be bound to an to SSD-backed daemon.

   * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels`
     - Creates one or more labels that can be used to assign the daemon
       to a specific group.

   * - :guilabel:`Number of Workers`
     - Number of concurrent backup tasks processed at a time.

.. _blockstores-page:

:guilabel:`Snapshot Storage` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB database backups called *snapshots* and they are stored in
containers called *snapshot stores*. This page lists existing snapshot
stores and allows you to create or modify snapshot stores.

|mms| supports the following snapshot stores:

- On a File System,
- In a MongoDB database (:term:`blockstore`), or
- In an S3 Bucket (S3 blockstore)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Storage Method
     - Name
     - Description

   * - File System
     - File System Store
     - Snapshots are stored in a directory on a file system. Each
       snapshot is found in its own sub-directory. The snapshot files
       can be compressed individually based upon its
       :setting:`setting:: File System Store Gzip Compression Level`.
       To create or edit a file system store, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-filestore-storage`.

   * - Database Storage
     - Blockstore
     - Snapshots are stored in a managed MongoDB database in a
       compressed, de-duplicated format. Depending on data usage
       patterns the :term:`deduplication` can provide significant
       storage savings without the need for any specialized hardware or
       other software. To create or edit a blockstore, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage`

   * - |aws| |s3| Bucket
     - |s3| Blockstore
     - Snapshot data is stored as blocks in an
       |aws| `S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ bucket. Snapshot
       metadata is stored in a managed MongoDB database. The metadata
       database tracks which blocks comprise each snapshot. The blocks
       are compressed and de-duplicated. To create or edit an S3
       blockstore, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage`

You can add, edit or delete any snapshot store listed.

.. _oplog-stores-page:

:guilabel:`Oplog Stores` Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page configures the backing replica sets that store oplog slices.
Oplog slices are compressed batches of the entries in the tailed
:term:`oplogs <oplog>` of your backed-up deployments.

.. warning::

   Do not modify the oplog store’s connection string to point to a
   different replica set. Existing data will not be copied and a resync
   will be required.

From this page you can:

- Add a member to a replica set by adding the host to the replica set
  connection string in the :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>` field. Do
  **not** modify the connection string to point to a different replica
  set.

- Change the authentication credentials or connection options for a
  oplog store by modifying the appropriate fields.

- Add an additional oplog store by clicking the :guilabel:`Add New
  Oplog Store` button at the bottom of the page.

- Enable and disable new assignments to oplog stores using the
  checkboxes in the :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` column.

- Assign labels that can be used to assign the oplog store to a
  specific group. Enter labels in :guilabel:`Assignment Labels`.
  Separate multiple labels with commas.

After saving changes to the oplog store’s values, you must restart all
the |onprem| instances, including those running activated Backup
Daemons, for the changes to take effect.

This page allows for the administration of the
:doc:`server pool </tutorial/server-pool>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-server-pools-deprecated.rst

.. _server-pool-servers:

``Servers``
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Servers` tab allows Administators to view information
regarding servers in the pool, such as availability, as well as cancel
pending requests and recycle servers that have been terminated but
*not* returned to the pool. The :guilabel:`Servers` tab provides three
views:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - View
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Server List`

     - Lists servers in the pool and their availability (i.e. whether
       they are bound to a specific |mms| group or unbound). From this
       list, Administrators can terminate unbound servers.

       For servers bound to a group, owners of the group can terminate
       the servers from their :guilabel:`Deployment` view.

   * - :guilabel:`Pending Requests`
     - Lists the pending :doc:`requests
       </tutorial/request-servers-from-pool>`. Administrator can cancel
       pending requests from this view.

   * - :guilabel:`Recycle Bin`

     - Lists terminated servers that have not been returned to the
       pool. From this view, Administrator can recycle terminated
       servers to return them to the pool.

       If the list of terminated servers exceed the list displayed on
       the current page, :guilabel:`Recycle All` recycles *all*
       terminated servers in the recycle bin, not just the servers
       displayed on the current page.

.. _server-pool-server-request-options:

Servers Request Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Servers Request Options` tab allows Administrators to
control which server options are displayed to the users when users make
a server request. These options are the properties and values specified
in the :asetting:`serverPoolPropertiesFile` file.
