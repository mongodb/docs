Lookup fields allow you to create a chart that joins data from multiple
collections in the same database. A lookup field brings in documents from a
second collection whose values correspond to a field in your chart's main
data source.

Lookup fields are useful for leveraging parent/child and primary key/foreign
key relationships between collections, or any situation in which a field
in one collection references a field in another collection. Lookup fields
use :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup>` to retrieve
matching documents from a remote collection.

Create a New Lookup Field
-------------------------

You can create a lookup field from any field in your chart's data source
which is not an :ref:`embedded object <embedded-objects-arrays>` and which
contains matching data with a field in another collection. The remote
collection must be:

- An existing |charts-short| data source.
- Part of the same database as the local collection.

.. note::

   You can also use the local collection as a lookup field source.

To add a lookup field, mouse over an existing field and click on the
:guilabel:`ellipsis (...)` to the right of the field name. Select
:guilabel:`Lookup field` from the dropdown menu. A modal window appears:

   :figwidth: 350px
   :alt: Lookup field modal window

Select the desired collection and field from the dropdown menus. The remote
field must contain at least one document with data that matches the local
field, or the lookup field will be empty.

You have the option to either return all matching documents from the foreign
collection or only the first matching document. Returning all matching
documents is recommended for one-to-many relationships, such as parent/child
and primary key relationships. Returning only the first document is recommended
for one-to-one and many-to-one relationships, such as reference data codes.
If you want to return only the first matching document, check the
:guilabel:`Return only first matching document` radio button.

|charts-short| suggests a name for the new field, but you can enter a name
of your choosing if you prefer. Click :guilabel:`Save` to create the new
field.

The new field appears with a :guilabel:`binoculars` icon, indicating that
it is a lookup field.

.. important::

   Be sure that any field you use as a lookup field is appropriately
   :manual:`indexed </indexes/>`. Lookup operations on an
   unindexed field in a large collection can cause significant performance
   issues or timeouts.

To remove a lookup field from your field panel, mouse over the lookup
field and click on the :guilabel:`ellipsis (...)` to the right of the
field name. Select :guilabel:`Remove field` from the dropdown menu.

Example
-------

The following example uses two data sources, one called ``product_catalog``
and one called ``orders``.

The ``product_catalog`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 76234, "item" : "21 inch monitor" }
   { "_id" : 38921, "item" : "USB C cable" }
   { "_id" : 21167, "item" : "keyboard" }
   { "_id" : 90252, "item" : "60 GB external hard drive" }

The ``orders`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : 1, "sku": 38921, "quantity": 50 }
   { "_id" : 2, "sku": 21167, "quantity": 75 }
   { "_id" : 3, "sku": 76234, "quantity": 15 }
   { "_id" : 4, "sku": 21167, "quantity": 20 }

Records in the ``orders`` collection use the ``sku`` field to reference
the ``_id`` field in the ``product_catalog`` collection.

The goal is to create a :ref:`column chart <column-bar-chart-ref>` showing
the number of ordered items. The following chart uses ``orders`` as its
data source. The lookup field ``sku_lookup_product_catalog`` is created
from the ``orders.sku`` field. It uses the ``product_catalog`` collection
as its remote data source and ``product_catalog._id`` as its remote field.

The chart uses ``product_catalog.item`` as its X axis and ``orders.quantity``
as its Y axis.
