Auditing

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB Enterprise includes an auditing capability for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. The auditing
facility allows administrators and users to track system activity for
deployments with multiple users and applications. The auditing facility
can write audit events to the console, the :term:`syslog`, a JSON file,
or a BSON file. For details on the audit log formats, see
:doc:`/reference/audit-message`.

Audit Events and Filter
-----------------------

The auditing system can record the following operations:

- schema (DDL),
- replica set,
- authentication and authorization, and
- general operations.

See :ref:`audit-action-details-results` for the specific actions
recorded.

By default, the auditing system records all these operations; however,
you can configure the :option:`--auditFilter` option to restrict the
events captured.

To enable and configure auditing for MongoDB Enterprise, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing`. To set up filters, see
:ref:`audit-filter`.

Audit Guarantee
---------------

The auditing system writes every audit event [#filter]_ to an
in-memory buffer of audit events. MongoDB writes this buffer to disk
periodically. For events collected from any single connection, the
events have a total order: if MongoDB writes one event to disk, the
system guarantees that it has written all prior events for that
connection to disk.

If an audit event entry corresponds to an operation that affects the
durable state of the database, such as a modification to data, MongoDB
will always write the audit event to disk *before* writing to the
:term:`journal` for that entry.

That is, before adding an operation to the journal, MongoDB writes all
audit events on the connection that triggered the operation, up to and
including the entry for the operation.

These auditing guarantees require that MongoDB runs with
the :setting:`journal` enabled.

.. warning:: MongoDB may lose events **if** the server terminates
   before it commits the events to the audit log. The client may
   receive confirmation of the event before MongoDB commits to the
   audit log. For example, while auditing an aggregation operation, the
   server might crash after returning the result but before the audit
   log flushes.

.. [#filter] Audit configuration can include a :ref:`filter
   <audit-filter>` to limit events to audit.
