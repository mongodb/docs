Sharded Clusters
----------------

``sh.removeTagRange()`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complement the existing :method:`sh.addTagRange()` helper, 2.8 adds
the :method:`sh.removeTagRange()` helper to improve management of
sharded collections with tags.

SecondaryThrottle parameter enhancements for chunk migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General Improvements
--------------------

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial sync builds indexes more efficiently for each collection and
  applies oplog entries in batches using threads.

- Definition of w:'majority' write concern changed to mean majority of
  voting nodes.

- Removed the ``local.slaves`` collection. The ``local.slaves``
  collection was a mirror of the internal table keeping track of all
  the slaves' replication progress. Instead, will be replaced by new
  information in the 'repl' section of serverStatus.

- Cannot longer parse oplog entries without v:2; i.e. oplog entries
  created by MongoDB 2.2 and prior. A 2.8 secondary will abort if it
  encounters such oplog entries.

- Secondaries may abort if they replay an oplog from 2.4 or prior with
  an index build operation that would normally fail on a 2.6 or later primary.

- Stronger restrictions on :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`. For
  details, see :ref:`2.8-compatibility-repl-set-config`.

.. important:: Do we need to document the following:

   For pre-existing collections on secondary, no longer build missing ``_id``
   indexes automatically.

Geospatial Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add support for "Big Polygons"; i.e. polygons that represents an area
larger than a hemisphere.

Logging Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve usability of the log messages for diagnosis, MongoDB
categorizes some log messages under specific components, or operations,
and provides the ability to set the verbosity level for these
components. For information, see :doc:`/reference/log-messages`.

Windows Performance Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parallel index builds with createIndexes cmd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operational Changes
-------------------

SSL Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

All MongoDB processes that contain SSL support now include the
``--sslAllowInvalidHostnames`` that disable the validation of the
hostname specified in the SSL certificate when connecting to a
MongoDB instance.

MongoDB Tool Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All MongoDB tools are now written in go.

- Smaller binaries.

- New options for parallelized :program:`mongodump` and
  :program:`mongorestore`. You can control the number of collections
  that :program:`mongorestore` will restore at a time with the
  ``--numParallelCollections`` option.

- New options ``-excludeCollection`` and
  ``--excludeCollectionsWithPrefix`` for :program:`mongodump` to
  exclude collections

- :program:`mongorestore` can now accept BSON data input from standard
  input in addition to reading BSON data from file.

- Removed ``--dbpath`` and ``--filter`` options for
  :program:`mongorestore`, :program:`mongoimport`,
  :program:`mongoexport`, :program:`bsondump`.

- Removed ``--locks`` option for :program:`mongotop`.

- :program:`mongostat` and :program:`mongotop` can now return output
  in JSON format with the ``--json`` option.

- Added configurable :term:`write concern` to :program:`mongoimport`,
  :program:`mongorestore`, and :program:`mongofiles`. Use the
  ``--writeConcern`` option.

- :program:`mongofiles` now allows you to configure the GridFS prefix
  with the ``--prefix`` option so that you can use custom namespaces
  and store multiple GridFS namespaces in a single database.

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

Audit Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`/core/auditing` in MongoDB Enterprise can filter on CRUD
operations.

.. important:: Todos

   add a code sample
   update /reference/audit-message


Additional Information
----------------------

Changes Affecting Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: This will probably be its own page

.. _2.8-compatibility-repl-set-config:

Replica Set Configuration Restrictions
``````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB now enforces stricter restrictions on
:doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`:

- Arbiters can no longer have 0 votes. Will fail to load. Must fix
  on primary and restart node

- Nodes can **only** have
  :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value of ``0`` or
  ``1``. Will fail to load. Must fix on primary and restart node

- :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` must specify the same
  ``_id`` name as that specified by ``--replSet`` or
  ``replication.replSetName``;

- Unrecognized configuration fields produce an invalid config and an
  error. Previously, ignored these fields. For example, tokutek adds a
  ``protocolVersion`` field, which will now result in error.


- Disallows ``getLastErrorDefaults: 0`` in a config.


Deprecate Access to ``system.indexes`` and ``system.namespaces``
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Deprecate *direct* access to ``system.indexes`` and
``system.namespaces``. Instead use :dbcommand:`createIndexes` and
:dbcommand:`listIndexes`.

Remove ``dropDups`` Option
``````````````````````````

``dropDups`` option is no longer available for
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` and :dbcommand:`createIndex`.

.. important:: todo

   remove option from reference pages
   also, the drop duplicates section in /tutorial/create-a-unique-index,
   etc.

Background Indexes
``````````````````

Background index builds will no longer automatically interrupt if
:dbcommand:`dropDatabase`, :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`, :dbcommand:`drop`
occur. The :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`, :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`,
:dbcommand:`drop` commands will still fail with ``background job in
progress``, as in 2.6

Remove ``releaseConnectionsAfterResponse`` Parameter
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB now always releases connections after response.
``releaseConnectionsAfterResponse`` parameter is no longer available.

``powerOf2Sizes``
``````````````````

Deprecate paddingFactor in mmapv1.

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drop commercial support for linux32 and win32; however, continue to
build them.
