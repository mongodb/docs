.. dbcommand:: setAllowMigrations

   Prevents the start of new :ref:`automatic migrations 
   <sharding-chunk-migration-automatic>` on a collection, prevents

   from committing, and excludes the collection from new balancer 
   rounds.

       - MongoDB prevents new :ref:`automatic migrations 
         <sharding-chunk-migration-automatic>` on the collection
       - in-flight :ref:`manual migrations 
         <sharding-chunk-migration-manual>` will not be committed
       - the collection will be excluded from new balancer rounds
 
       If ``true``: 
       
       - MongoDB allows new :ref:`automatic migrations 
         <sharding-chunk-migration-automatic>` on the collection
       - in-flight :ref:`manual migrations 
         <sharding-chunk-migration-manual>` will be committed
       - the collection will be included in new balancer rounds
 
Behavior
--------

:dbcommand:`setAllowMigrations` requires the same privileges as 
:authaction:`moveChunk`.

Example
-------

This operation prevents migrations on the ``store.inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setAllowMigrations: "store.inventory",
      allowMigrations: false
   } )
