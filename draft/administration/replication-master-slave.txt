============
Master Slave
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

*Use only for versions prior to 1.6*

.. important:: Use :doc:`replica sets </replication>` rather than the
   :term:`master`\ -:term:`slave` configuration. Replica sets are a
   functional superset of master-slave and are more robust. Master-slave
   configuration preceded replica sets, which were introduced in MongoDB
   version 1.6. This documentation is intended for users of MongoDB
   versions prior to MongoDB 1.6.

   To download a newer version of MongoDB, see `MongoDB Downloads <http://mongodb.org/downloads>`_.

.. warning::

   Master-slave configuration is a legacy configuration and should not
   be used with MongoDB version 1.6 or higher. Instead use :doc:`replica
   sets </replication>`, which provide automated failover and backups,
   and which ensure high availability.

Master Slave vs. Replica Sets
-----------------------------

In MongoDB 1.6+, :term:`replica sets <replica set>` replaced
:term:`master`-:term:`slave` as the preferred configuration
for :doc:`replication </replication>`.

The following replica set configuration is equivalent to a two-node
master-slave setup with hosts ``M`` (master) and ``S`` (slave):

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = {
     _id : 'mysetname',
     members : [
       { _id : 0, host : 'M', priority : 1 },
       { _id : 1, host : 'S', priority : 0, votes : 0 }
     ]
   };

Configuration and Setup
-----------------------

*Use only for versions prior to 1.6*

To configure an instance of :program:`mongod` to be a :term:`master`
database in a master-:term:`slave` configuration, start two instances of
the database, one in *master* mode, and the other in *slave* mode.

.. note:: The following examples explicitly specify the location of
   the data files on the command line. This is unnecessary if you are
   running the master and slave on separate machines. But for readers
   who are going try this setup on a single node, the examples specify
   the data files in the interest of safety.

.. code-block:: javascript

   bin/mongod --master [--dbpath /data/masterdb/]

As a result, the master server process will create a
``local.oplog.$main`` collection. This is the "transaction log" that
queues operations that will be applied at the slave.

To configure an instance of :program:`mongod` to be a slave database in a
master-slave configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bin/mongod --slave --source <masterhostname>[:<port>] [--dbpath /data/slavedb/]

Details of the source server are then stored in the slave's
``local.sources`` collection. Instead of specifying the ``--source``
parameter, you can add an object to ``local.sources`` that specifies
information about the master server:

.. code-block:: javascript

   bin/mongo <slavehostname>/local
   db.sources.find(); // confirms the collection is empty. then:
   db.sources.insert( { host: <masterhostname> } );

- ``host: masterhostname`` is the IP address or FQDN of the master
  database machine. Append ``:port`` to the server hostname if you want
  to run on a nonstandard port number.

- ``only: databasename`` (optional) if specified, indicates that only
  the specified database should replicate.

A slave may become out of sync with a master if:

- The slave falls far behind the data updates available from that
  master.

- The slave is terminated and then restarted some time later when
  relevant updates are no longer available from the master.

If a slave becomes out of sync, replication terminates. Operator
intervention is required if replication is to be restarted. An operator
can restart replication using the ``{resync:1}`` command. Alternatively,
the :option:`--autoresync` option causes a slave to restart replication
automatically (after ten second pause) if the slave becomes out of sync.
If :option:`--autoresync` is specified, the slave does not attempt an
automatic resync more than once in a ten minute period.

The :option:`--oplogSize` option can be specified (along with
``--master``) to configure the amount of disk space in megabytes that will
be allocated for storing updates to be made available to slave nodes. If
:option:`--oplogSize` is not specified, the amount of disk space for
storing updates will be 5% of available disk space, with a minimum of
1GB) for 64bit machines and 50MB for 32bit machines.

Command-line Options
--------------------

*Use the master-slave configuration only for versions prior to 1.6*

Master Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `--master`: The :term:`master` mode.

- :option:`--oplogSize`: This takes an argument and specifies the size
  limit in MB for the oplog.

Slave Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `--slave`: The :term:`slave` mode.

- `--source`: This takes an argument and specifies the master as
  <server:port>.

- `--only`: This takes an argument and specifies a single database to
  replicate.

- :data:`--slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>`: This takes an argument
  and specifies the delay (in seconds) to be used when applying master
  ops to slave.

- :option:`--autoresync`: Automatically resync if slave data is stale.

--slavedelay
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is beneficial to have a :term:`slave` that is purposefully
many hours behind, to prevent human error. In MongoDB 1.3.3+ you can
specify this with the :data:`--slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>`
command line option. Specify the delay to be used (in seconds) when
applying :term:`master` operations to the slave.

Specify this option at the slave:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongod --slave --source mymaster.foo.com --slavedelay 7200

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

To have MongoDB inspect the contents of local.oplog.$main on the
:term:`master` and report status, issue the following command from the
:program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.printReplicationInfo()

To have MongoDB inspect the contents of ``local.sources`` on the
:term:`slave` and report status, issue the following command from the
:program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()

Alternately, in MongoDB 1.3.2+, you can issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db._adminCommand( { serverStatus : 1 , repl : N } )

``N`` is the level of diagnostic information and can have the following
values:

- 0 - none
- 1 - local (doesn't have to connect to other server)
- 2 - remote (has to check with the master)

Security
--------

*Use the master-slave configuration only for versions prior to 1.6*

When security is enabled, you must configure a user account for the
local database that exists on both servers.

The :term:`slave`-side of a replication connection first looks for a
user repl in ``local.system.users``. If present, that user is used to
authenticate against the local database on the source side of the
connection. If repl user does not exist, the first user object in
``local.system.users`` is tried.

The ``local`` database works like the ``admin`` database: an account for
local has access to the entire server.

The following is an example security configuration when security is enabled:

.. code-block:: javascript

   $ mongo <slavehostname>/admin -u <existingadminusername> -p<adminpassword>
   > use local
   > db.addUser('repl', <replpassword>);
   ^c
   $ mongo <masterhostname>/admin -u <existingadminusername> -p<adminpassword>
   > use local
   > db.addUser('repl', <replpassword>);

Administrative Tasks for Master-Slave Configurations
----------------------------------------------------

*Use the master-slave configuration only for versions prior to 1.6*

Failing over to a Slave (Promotion)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To permanently fail over from a down :term:`master` (``A``) to a
:term:`slave` (``B``):

1. Shut down ``A``.

2. Stop :program:`mongod` on ``B``.

3. Back up or delete local.* datafiles on ``B``.

4. Restart :program:`mongod` on ``B`` with the ``--master`` option.

.. note:: This is a one time cutover. The "mirror" is broken. ``A``
   cannot be brought back in sync with ``B`` without a full resync.

Inverting Master and Slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a :term:`master` (``A``) and a :term:`slave` (``B``) and you
would like to reverse their roles, follow this recommended sequence. The
sequence assumes ``A`` is healthy, up-to-date and up.

If ``A`` is not healthy but the hardware is okay (power outage, server
crash, etc.), skip steps 1 and 2 and in step 8 replace all of ``A``'s
files with ``B``'s files in step 8.

If ``A`` is not healthy and the hardware is not okay, replace ``A`` with
a new machine. Also follow the instructions in the previous paragraph.

To invert master and slave:

1. Halt writes on ``A`` using the :term:`fsync` command.

2. Make sure ``B`` is caught up.

3. Shut down ``B``.

4. Wipe local.* on ``B`` to remove old ``local.sources``.

5. Start up ``B`` with the ``--master`` option.

6. Do a write on ``B``, which primes the :term:`oplog` to provide a new
   sync start point.

7. Shut down ``B``. ``B`` will now have a new set of ``local.*`` files.

8. Shut down ``A`` and replace ``A``'s ``local.*`` files with a copy of
   ``B``'s new ``local.*`` files. Remember to compress the files before/while
   copying them. They can be quite large.

9. Start ``B`` with the ``--master`` option.

10. Start ``A`` with all the usual slave options plus --:setting:`fastsync`.

Creating a Slave from an Existing Master's Disk Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can stop write operations to the :term:`master` for an indefinite
period, you can copy the data files from the master to the new
:term:`slave` and then start the slave with --:setting:`fastsync`.

.. warning::

   Be careful with :setting:`fastsync`. If the data is not perfectly in
   sync, a discrepancy will exist forever.

:setting:`fastsync` is a way to start a slave by starting with an
existing master disk image/backup. This option declares that the
administrator guarantees the image is correct and completely up-to-date
with that of the master. If you have a full and complete copy of data
from a master you can use this option to avoid a full synchronization
upon starting the slave.

Creating a Slave from an Existing Slave's Disk Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can just copy the other :term:`slave's <slave>` data file snapshot
without any special options. Note data snapshots should only be taken
when a :program:`mongod` process is down or in ``fsync-and-lock`` state.

Resyncing a Slave that is too Stale to Recover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Slaves <slave>` asynchronously apply write operations from the
:term:`master`. These operations are stored in the master's
:term:`oplog`. The oplog is finite in length. If a slave is too far
behind, a full resync will be necessary.

To resync the
slave, open the :program:`mongo` shell and point it at the slave:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongo <slave_host_and_port>

Then run the :dbcommand:`resync` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand({resync: 1})

This forces a full resync of all data (which will be very slow on a
large database). The same effect can be achieved by stopping
:program:`mongod` on the slave, delete all slave data files, and
restarting it.

Slave Chaining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Slaves <slave>` cannot be "chained." They must all connect to the
:term:`master` directly. If a slave is chained to another slave you may
see the following in the logs:

.. code-block:: none

   assertion 13051 tailable cursor requested on non capped collection
   ns:local.oplog.$main

Correcting a Slave's Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change a :term:`slave's <slave>` source, manually modify the slave's
``local.sources`` collection.

.. example::

   For example, say you accidentally type the wrong host for the slave's
   source:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave --source prod.mississippi

   You can restart the slave without the --slave and --source arguments.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod

   Now start the shell and update the ``local.sources`` collection.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use local

      db.sources.update( { host : "prod.mississippi" }, { $set : { host : "prod.mississippi" } } )

   Restart the slave with the correct command line arguments or with no
   ``--source`` argument. Once ``local.sources`` is set, no ``--source``
   is necessary.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave --source prod.mississippi

   or

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --slave

   The slave now points to the correct :term:`master`.
