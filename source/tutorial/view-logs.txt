Overview
--------

.. only:: cloud

   MMS collects log information for both MongoDB and the MMS agents. For
   MongoDB deployments, MMS provides access to both real-time logs and on-disk
   logs.

.. only:: classic or onprem

   MMS collects log information for both MongoDB and the MMS agents.

MongoDB Real-Time Logs
----------------------

The Monitoring Agent collects real-time log information from each MongoDB
deployment by issuing the :manual:`getLog </reference/command/getLog>` command
with every monitoring ping. The :manual:`getLog </reference/command/getLog>`
command collects log entries from the MongoDB RAM cache.

MMS enables real-time log collection by default. You can disable log
collection for either the whole MMS group or for individual deployments. If
you disable log collection, MMS continues to display previously collected log
entries.

   MongoDB On-Disk Logs
   --------------------

   MMS can collect on-disk logs even if the MongoDB instance is not running.
   The Automation Agent collects the logs from the location specified by the
   MongoDB ``systemLog.path`` :manual:`configuration option
   </reference/configuration-options>`. The MongoDB on-disk logs are a subset
   of the real-time logs and therefore less verbose.

   You can configure log rotation for the on-disk logs. MMS enables log
   rotation by default.
