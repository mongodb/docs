To start a migration job, Relational Migrator must connect to your MongoDB 
database. Relational Migrator requires a username and password which has ``readWrite`` 
access in the target database. This page describes 
the procedure to make an authenticated user account and the Uniform Resource 
Identifier (URI) formats for defining connections to your target 
MongoDB database. 

About this Task
---------------

- Relational Migrator supports all connection string options except 
  :urioption:`appName`. Relational Migrator overrides the ``appName`` 
  connection string option when connecting to your MongoDB deployment. 
  For details on MongoDB connection string options, see 
  :ref:`<mongodb-uri>`.

- Relational Migrator can use both Atlas and on-premises URIs. This page 
  provides separate instructions for each deployment type.

Atlas
-----

Connect to Your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provision user accounts in Atlas you need to be 
`logged in to the Atlas GUI <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/>`__.

Create a New User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation, click :guilabel:`Database Access`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add New Database User`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Authentication Method` section of the :guilabel:`Add New Database User` modal window, select the box labeled :guilabel:`Password`.
#. Under :guilabel:`Password Authentication`, enter the username ``migrator-service`` for the new user in the top text field.
#. Enter the password ``password`` for the new user in the lower text field.
#. Under :guilabel:`Database User Privileges`, click :guilabel:`Built-in Role`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Read and write to any database`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add User`.

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the previously created account credentials, format the connection
URI for the target database. In this case ``MongoEnterprises``.

.. code-block::

   mongodb+srv://migrator-service:password@sandbox.xxxxx.mongodb.net/MongoEnterprises

On-Premises
-----------

In this example, use ``mongosh`` to provision a user account that 
connects to the ``MongoEnterprises`` database.

This examples assume your deployment is running on ``localhost`` and the 
default port of ``27017``.

Connect to Your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to your deployment, your user account requires the 
`createRole <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.createRole/>`__
permission in both the ``admin`` and ``MongoEnterprises`` databases.
Copy the following code with your admin credentials into a terminal to 
connect to your deployment with ``mongosh``.

.. code-block::

   mongosh "mongodb://myadminuser:myadminpassword@localhost:27017/admin"

For details on ``mongosh`` connections see : 
`Connecting to your MongoDB Deployment <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/connect/>`__.

Create a New User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``mongosh``, run the following command to create a 
user in the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block::

   use admin

   db.createUser(
      { user: "migrator-service",
         pwd: "password",
         roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
      }
   )

Create the same user in the user in the ``MongoEnterprises`` database:

.. code-block::

   use MongoEnterprises
   db.createUser(
      { user: "migrator-service",
         pwd: "password",
         roles:[{role: "readWrite" , db:"MongoEnterprises"}]
      }
   )

These commands:

- Create a new user ``migrator-service`` with the password ``password`` 
  in the ``admin`` and ``MongoEnterprises`` databases.
- Apply the ``readWrite`` system role to the ``MongoEnterprises``
  database for the user ``migrator-service``.

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the previously created account credentials, format the connection
URI for the target database. In this case ``MongoEnterprises``.

.. code-block::

   mongodb://migrator-service:password@localhost:27017/MongoEnterprises

Results
-------

The MongoDB connection URI is optionally specified as part of the process for
creating a Relational Migrator project or when creating a sync job.
