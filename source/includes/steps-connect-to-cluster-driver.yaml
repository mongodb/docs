  for the cluster to which you wish to connect.

ref: go-clusters-review-whitelist
content: |

  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the project whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` modal under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of the machine hosting your application on the
  list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address.
    This only grants your application access to the |service| cluster if the
    machine you are using to access the |service| UI is also hosting your
    application.
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
  
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| project being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.

title: "Select :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`."
level: 4
ref: connect-details
content: |

  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays the :manual:`URI connection string
  </reference/connection-string/>` for connecting to the |service| cluster
  with a MongoDB driver.
  
  The URI connection string uses a MongoDB user set up for
  the project as the user to authenticate as. Update the ``<PASSWORD>``
  placeholder with the password for this user.
  
  .. important::

     If the password contains reserved URI characters, you must escape
     the characters per `RFC 2396
     <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`_. For example, if your
     password is ``@bc123``, you must escape the ``@`` character when
     specifying the password in the connection string; i.e. ``%40bc123``.
     
  To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the ``USERNAME`` and
  ``PASSWORD`` components of the URI connection string with the username and
  password of a different MongoDB user.
  
  .. code-block:: shell
  
     mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@...
     
  You must also replace the ``<DATABASE>`` placeholder in the URI connection
  string with the database you want your application to connect to.
