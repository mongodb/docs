====================================
Connect to an AWS Server through SSH
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A server provisioned through MMS on Amazon Web Services (AWS) is
accessible through its ``mongodbdns.com`` hostname listed on the
:guilabel:`Servers` page.

You can use an SSH operation that resembles the following to connect to
the server:

.. code-block:: sh

   ssh -i <ssh-key> <ec2-user-name>@<server-on-aws>

Prerequisites
-------------

To connect to an AWS server through SSH, you must have the public key that
matches the shared private key you created when :doc:`provisioning the
server </tutorial/provision-aws-servers>`.

To provide MMS with a public key for use when provisioning AWS servers,
see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`.
