A MongoDB subscription offers flexible payment terms and advanced support
options. Subscriptions allow for billing in different currencies, billing
in arrears, billing monthly or for annual invoicing  with |ach| payments
or wire transfers. Subscriptions provide order forms [#order-form]_ and
an Enterprise Customer Service Agreement (CSA).

.. _purchase-subscription:

Purchase a Subscription
-----------------------

To purchase a subscription, contact 
:website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`.

When you purchase a subscription, you are asked to provide a 
*billing contact* email address. Your billing contact receives invoices.

.. note::
   
   MongoDB recommends inviting your billing contact to your 
   subscription-paying organization.

.. _activate-subscription:

Activate a Subscription
-----------------------

.. note::
   You must be an :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
   or :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` to activate a subscription.

When you purchase a subscription from
:website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`,
MongoDB sends you an email containing an activation code.
To apply this subscription to your |service| organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps-billing-apply-credit.rst

With an active subscription, |service| displays a confirmation icon
and message in the :guilabel:`Payment Method` card.

.. figure:: /images/active-subscription-confirmation.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: While your organization has an active subscription, all charges are deducted from your available credits.

.. note::

   - If you do not add your subscription activation code within the
     first 30 days of use, MongoDB charges the credit card associated
     with the account. Credit card charges are non-refundable.

   - If you lose your activation code,
     :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

.. _expiring-subscription:

Subscription Expiration
-----------------------

If your subscription expires:

- |service| uses your configured payment method to pay any remaining 
  charges. 
- |service| downgrades any :doc:`support plan </support>` that you've
  purchased with your subscription.

If you have no payment method added to your organization, |service| 
prompts you to :ref:`set a payment method <payment-method>` when you 
make billing changes through the {+atlas-ui+} or Admin API. If your
payment method declines, your account will be at risk of suspension.

Once you :ref:`activate <activate-subscription>` your next subscription, 
|service| bills you for any unpaid charges. If your subscription becomes 
delayed, contact your :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>` 
representative.

To stop incurring any future charges, you must :ref:`terminate 
<pause-terminate-cluster>` your deployments.

.. _subscription-level:

View Available Subscription Credits
-----------------------------------

To view active and upcoming subscription credits:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-billing.rst

   .. step:: View the available credits.

      a. If it isn't already selected, click the :guilabel:`Overview` 
         tab.

      #. Review the :guilabel:`Available Credits` table.

.. figure:: /images/available-credits-table.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: You can view your subscription credits at the bottom of your organization's Billing Overview.

The :guilabel:`Available Credits` table displays:

- An :guilabel:`Elastic Billing Enabled` indicator if your organization 
  has :ref:`Elastic Billing <elastic-subscription-invoicing>` enabled.
- Your active available credits. Active credit items display a progress 
  bar to show your usage to date of that total pool of credits.
- :ref:`Elastic Billing <elastic-subscription-invoicing>` 
  subscriptions, represented as infinite available credit. An active 
  Elastic Billing subscription means you're charged for |service| 
  usage as you go.
- Upcoming available credits that you have not yet started to spend, 
  displayed in gray.

Available credits are drawn from the top item to the bottom in the order
they appear on the table. 

To view your expired credits, see the :guilabel:`History` table located
below the :guilabel:`Available Credits` table.

.. _annual-commitment-invoicing:

Monthly Commitment Subscription Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your subscription includes a commitment for a term (e.g. annual), 
you can view your month's spending against your commitment on your 
organization's :guilabel:`Available Credits` table.

.. figure:: /images/monthly-commitment.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: You can view your monthly commitment information in the Available Credits table.

At the end of the month, if your usage is lower than your prorated
monthly commitment, you are charged for the prorated commitment. 
Unused credits can be applied at a later date during the term to cover 
overages.

If you use all your monthly commitment subscription credits before your
subscription expires and your subscription has :ref:`Elastic Billing
<elastic-subscription-invoicing>` enabled, |service| bills
you for usage beyond your subscription credits. When your Monthly Commitment Subscription transitions to Elastic Billing:

- You receive two tax invoices for the same billing period
- Your cloud invoice displays an |service| Elastic Invoice and your
  final |service| Monthly Commit payment in the :guilabel:`Payment Details`

To review your used credits and confirm if your subscription has entered Elastic Billing:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Review your used credits.

      Do one or both of the following steps:

      - .. include:: /includes/nav/list-org-billing.rst
      
        Details appear on the :guilabel:`Overview` tab.
      
      - .. include:: /includes/nav/list-org-activity-feed.rst
      
        |service| creates the following event: :guilabel:`Active Invoicing Period initiated. MongoDB will invoice your organization based on your monthly usage.`

   .. step:: Confirm whether your subscription has entered Elastic Billing.

.. _elastic-subscription-invoicing:

Elastic Billing Subscription 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an active Elastic Billing subscription, you are charged for 
your usage as you go.

.. note:: 
   If Elastic Billing is enabled, an indicator displays at the top of 
   the :guilabel:`Available Credits` table.

   The Elastic Billing indicator does not necessarily mean your Elastic 
   Billing subscription is active, only that it is enabled. If you run 
   out of credits, your organization will automatically transition to 
   Elastic Billing.

.. figure:: /images/available-credits-table-elastic.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: On your Available Credits table, Elastic Billing subscriptions display an infinity symbol in the "Available" column.

The :guilabel:`Used` column displays your elastic usage to date.

{+gcp+} Monthly Commitment Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a {+gcp+} Monthly Commitment subscription, you have a minimum monthly 
commitment you must pay Google each month. Your minimum monthly amount due 
is your total commitment value divided by the number of months 
in your commitment. Whether you use less or more than your monthly 
commitment, you are billed at least this amount.

.. note::
  After your cumulative subscription usage exceeds your total commitment value, 
  |service| transitions your account to elastic billing. 
  With elastic billing, |service| 
  bills you the full value of your usage each month 
  for the remainder of your commitment. Your {+gcp+} invoice reflects 
  your elastic billing charges in addition to your monthly minimum commitment.

.. example::
  For a $12,000 total annual commitment, 
  after you accrue $12,000 of usage, {+gcp+} bills the monthly commitment 
  of $1,000 plus any additional usage as reported by |service|. 
  If your usage for a given
  month after you exhaust your total annual commitment is $4,000, 
  {+gcp+} charges $5,000 for that month 
  ($1,000 monthly minimum + $4,000 elastic billing).

View Subscription Charges
-------------------------

In each one of your invoices, the :guilabel:`Summary By Project` and 
:guilabel:`Summary By Service` tables list your usage in terms of |usd|.

In addition, you can examine the :ref:`Payment and Usage Details
<payment-details>` for your subscription.

To view your monthly commitment subscription charges in the
:ref:`Payment Details <payment-details>` section of your invoice:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-billing.rst

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Invoices` tab.

   .. step:: Select the invoice and click the link under :guilabel:`Invoice Date` or :guilabel:`Invoice Period`.

   .. step:: Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Payment Details` section of your invoice.
   
      The :ref:`Payment Details <payment-details>` table lists payment
      methods in the left-most column and shows all the related payment
      information for each payment method.

   .. step:: Locate the :guilabel:`Atlas monthly commitment` in the :guilabel:`Payment method` column.
       
   .. step:: Locate the :guilabel:`Total` column for the :guilabel:`Atlas monthly commitment` row.

      The :guilabel:`Total` column shows your total subscription cost
      for that invoice period.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Actions` column, click :guilabel:`View Details`.

      The pop-up informational card opens that shows the details of your
      monthly commitment for your subscription. This card compares your
      subscription commitment to your usage during the invoice period.
      You are charged the greater of your monthly commit or your usage.
      Unused credits are applied to cover overages during the term of
      your subscription.


.. _pay-subscription-charges:

Pay Subscription Charges
------------------------

With a subscription, you receive two invoices each month:

- A *cloud invoice* detailing your MongoDB Cloud usage, viewable 
  in |service| on your organization's :guilabel:`Billing` page.

- A *tax invoice* emailed to your 
  :ref:`billing contact <purchase-subscription>` with MongoDB bank 
  details and an amount due.

.. note::

   If you purchase a MongoDB subscription from a marketplace, you
   do not receive a tax invoice. Instead, you receive an invoice 
   with an amount due through that marketplace.

Your cloud invoice represents MongoDB Cloud usage in |usd| and does not 
account for currency conversions or other adjustments. The tax invoice 
emailed to your billing contact provides the amount to pay.

If your subscription covers the billing period, pay the invoice emailed 
to your billing contact. If your subscription does not cover the 
billing period, your payment method on file is charged.

If you are a YayPay customer, you can pay your monthly commitment or
elastic invoices directly from the :guilabel:`Payment Details` section
of your invoice page. To learn more, see :ref:`View and Pay Your Current
Invoice <view-current-invoice>`.

See also :ref:`pay-subscription-with-credit-card`.
