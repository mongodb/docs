Introduction
------------

|service| issues alerts for the database and server conditions configured in
your :doc:`alert settings </configure-alerts>`. When a condition triggers an
alert, |service| displays a warning symbol on the cluster and sends alert
notifications. Your alert settings determine the notification methods.
|service| continues sending notifications at regular intervals until the
condition resolves or you delete or disable the alert.

View Alerts
-----------

To view an alert, click the :guilabel:`Alerts` tab.

Acknowledge Alerts
------------------

To acknowledge an alert, click the :guilabel:`Alerts` tab, locate the alert,
and click :guilabel:`Acknowledge`.

If an alert uses PagerDuty for alert notifications, you can acknowledge the
alert only on your PagerDuty dashboard.

When you acknowledge an alert, |service| sends no further notifications until
either the acknowledgement period ends, you resolve the alert condition, or
you unacknowledge alert. If an alert condition ends during an acknowledgment
period, |service| sends a notification.

Increase Cluster Capacity
-------------------------

To resolve an alert by increasing your cluster's capacity, see
:doc:`/scale-cluster`.

View All Activity
-----------------

To view cluster events, click the :guilabel:`Alerts` tab, then click
:guilabel:`All Activity`. You can filter the list by date and by activity
type.

To download the list, click the :guilabel:`Download Activity Feed` button.
