Members of a replica set or a sharded cluster can use :ref:`X.509
certificates <internal-auth-x509>` for membership authentication to
identify other servers in the same deployment. This tutorial describes how to 
perform a rolling update to rotate X.509 certificates on a cluster
that doesn't use the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509` settings
to configure Distinguished Name (DN) attributes. 

.. note::

   To perform a rolling update to rotate certificates on a cluster that uses 
   the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509` settings or on a cluster that will use
   these settings after the update, see :ref:`x509-rotate-member-certs`.
   
When a server node receives a connection request, it compares the Distinguished Name (DN)
attributes in the ``subject`` field of the presented certificates to the subject DN attributes of its own certificates. 
The certificates match if their subjects contain the same values for the Organization (``O``), Organizational Unit (``OU``), 
and Domain Component (``DC``) attributes. 
A server's configuration file can also specify alternative DN attributes to use for matching in the 
:parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter.
If the server's subject DN attributes or configured :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` value 
match the subject DN attributes of the presented certificate, the server node treats the 
connection as a cluster member.  

In some situations, you may need to update the member certificates to
new certificates with new subject Distinguished Name (DN) attributes, such as if
an organization changes its name. 
In a rolling update, member certificates are updated one at a time, and
your deployment does not incur any downtime. 

Clusters adopting new certificates can use the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter to accept x.509 
certificates with different subject DN attributes during the certificate rotation procedure.
Once all members use certificates with the new value, remove the override to begin rejecting the now out of date certificates.

About This Task
---------------

Consider a replica set where each member's X.509 certificates, 
set using the :setting:`~net.tls.clusterFile` and :setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFile` settings,  
have subject DN attributes of ``"OU=10gen Server,O=10gen"``. 

A member of this replica set has the following configuration file: 

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 2,6

   net.tls.mode: requireTLS
   net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/10gen-server1.pem"
   net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

   security.clusterAuthMode: x509
   net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/10gen-cluster1.pem"
   net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

The following procedure updates each member's certificates to new certificates that have
subject DN attributes of ``"OU=MongoDB Server, O=MongoDB"``.

Steps 
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Set override parameter on all members. 

      During a rolling update, members are restarted one at a time with a new configuration. 
      To allow server nodes with the the old subject DN attributes to identify nodes with the new 
      subject DN attributes as cluster members, set the override parameter to the new subject DN attributes on all running members. 

      To do this, modify the configuration file of each server to set the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter 
      to use the subject DN attributes of the new certificate:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 9-10

         net.tls.mode: requireTLS
         net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/10gen-server1.pem"
         net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

         security.clusterAuthMode: x509
         net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/10gen-cluster1.pem"
         net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

         setParameter:
            tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride: "OU=MongoDB Server,O=MongoDB"
   
      This configuration will not be taken into consideration until you restart each member.

   .. step:: Restart all members. 
   
      To perform a rolling restart of all members, 
      restart each secondary and then the primary. 

      **For each secondary member**, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the
      member, then: 

      a. Use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` method to shut down the member:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            use admin
            db.shutdownServer()

      #. Restart the member. 

         Before restarting the next secondary, ensure this member has 
         reached :replstate:`SECONDARY` state. To determine the member state, 
         run :method:`rs.status()` and read the value of the ``stateStr`` field. 

         .. code-block:: sh 

            rs.status().members 
            
      **For the primary member**, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the member, then: 

      a. Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the member:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.stepDown()

      #. Use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` method to shut down the member:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            use admin
            db.shutdownServer()

      #. Restart the member.

      All servers in the replica set can now use the override parameter to accept peer connections 
      from members using certificates with the new subject DN attributes.

   .. step:: Modify configuration of all members. 
 
      Update the configuration file of each server:

      - Change the :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` setting to the new certificate.

      - Change the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` setting to the new certificate. 

      - Set the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter to use the
        DN attributes of the old certificate.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         net.tls.mode: requireTLS
         net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem"
         net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

         security.clusterAuthMode: x509
         net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem"
         net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

         setParameter:
            tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride: "OU=10Gen Server,O=10Gen"

      This configuration will not be taken into consideration until you restart each
      member.

   .. step:: Restart all members.

      To apply the updated configuration to each member, perform a rolling 
      restart of the server nodes by repeating the procedure from step 2. 

      During this process, nodes that have been restarted with new certificates will use the 
      old DN attributes stored in :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` to identify nodes 
      presenting old certificates. Nodes that still have old certificates will use the new DN 
      stored in :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` to identify nodes presenting new certificates. 

   .. step:: Remove override parameter from all members. 

      To prevent the updated server nodes from treating clients presenting the
      old certificate as peers, remove the ``tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride``
      parameter from all server node configuration files. 

      For example: 

      .. code-block:: yaml

         net.tls.mode: requireTLS
         net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem"
         net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

         security.clusterAuthMode: x509

         net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem"
         net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

      This configuration will not be taken into consideration until you restart each
      member.

   .. step:: Restart all members.

      To apply the updated configuration to each member, perform a rolling 
      restart of the server nodes by repeating the procedure from step 2. 

      All servers in the replica set now accept peer connections only from members
      using certificates that have the new subject DN attributes.
