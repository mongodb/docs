stepnum: 1
ref: set-up-server
content: |

  15 GB memory and 50 GB disk space:
    The server must have 15 GB of memory and 50 GB of disk space for
    the root partition. You can meet the size requirements by using an
    Amazon Web Services EC2 ``m3.xlarge`` instance and changing the
    size of the root partition to 50 GB. When you log into the
    instance, execute ``df -h`` to verify the root partition has 50 GB
    of space.

  Root access:
    You must have root access to the server.

  The install creates the following:

  - The base directory for the |onprem| software, which is:

    ``/opt/mongodb/mms/``

  - A new system user, ``mongodb-mms``, under which the server runs.

  - The ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file, which contains the connection string to access the Application Database. The default is ``locahost``, port ``27017``, so no changes are necessary.

        Do not use this directory for any other purpose:

     .. cssclass:: copyable-code

     .. cssclass:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo chown mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms /data/backupDaemon

  c. In |onprem|, while logged in as the user you registered during
     installation, click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top right of
     the page.

  d. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

  e. Follow the prompts to configure the Backup storage.
     |onprem| walks you through the configuration. 

     For :term:`snapshot storage <snapshot>`, select either the local
     filesystem or the backup database. If you use a :term:`File System
     Store`, you still need a small MongoDB database for :term:`oplog
     storage <Oplog Store Database>`. At the prompt to configure the
     connection string to the backup database, enter the following:
