.. index:: index; overview
.. _index-overview-synopsis:

Synopsis
--------

An index is a data structure that allows you to quickly locate documents
based on the values stored in certain specified fields. Fundamentally,
indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other database systems.
MongoDB supports indexes on any field or sub-field contained in
documents within a MongoDB collection.

MongoDB indexes have the following core features:

- MongoDB defines indexes on a per-:term:`collection` level.

- You can create indexes on a single field or on multiple fields using
  a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`.

- Indexes enhance query performance, often dramatically.
  However, each index also incurs some overhead for every write
  operation.
  Consider the queries, the frequency of these queries, the size of
  your working set, the insert load, and your application's
  requirements as you create indexes in your MongoDB environment.

- All MongoDB indexes use a B-tree data structure. MongoDB can use
  these representation of the data to optimize query responses.

- Every query, including update operations, use one and only one
  index. The :ref:`query optimizer <read-operations-query-optimization>`
  selects the index empirically by
  occasionally running alternate query plans and by selecting the plan
  with the best response time for each query type. You can override
  the query optimizer using the :method:`cursor.hint()` method.

- An index "covers" a query if:

  - all the fields in the :ref:`query <read-operations-query-document>`
    are part of that index, **and**

  - all the fields returned in the documents that match the query are
    in the same index.

  When an index covers a query, the server can both match the
  :ref:`query conditions <read-operations-query-document>` **and**
  return the results using only the index; MongoDB does not need to
  look at the documents, only the index, to fulfill the query.
  Querying the index can be faster than querying the documents outside
  of the index.

  See :ref:`indexes-covered-queries` for more information.

- Using queries with good index coverage reduces the number of full
  documents that MongoDB needs to store in memory, thus maximizing database
  performance and throughput.

- If an update does not change the size of a document or cause the
  document to outgrow its allocated area, then MongoDB will update an
  index *only if* the indexed fields have changed. This improves
  performance. Note that if the document has grown and must move, all
  index keys must then update.

.. index:: index types
.. _index-types:

Index Types
-----------

This section enumerates the types of indexes available in MongoDB.
For all collections, MongoDB creates the default :ref:`_id index
<index-type-id>`. You can create additional indexes with the
:method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` method on any
single field or :ref:`sequence of fields <index-type-compound>` within
any document or :ref:`sub-document <index-sub-document>`. MongoDB also
supports indexes of arrays, called :ref:`multi-key indexes
<index-type-multi-key>`.

.. index:: _id index
.. index:: _id
.. index:: index; _id
.. index:: index types; primary key
.. _index-type-id:

_id Index
~~~~~~~~~

The ``_id`` index is a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
[#unique-index-report]_ on the ``_id`` field, and MongoDB creates this
index by default on all collections. [#capped-collections]_
You cannot delete the index on ``_id``.

The ``_id`` field is the :term:`primary key` for the collection, and
every document *must* have a unique ``_id`` field. You may store any
unique value in the ``_id`` field. The default value of ``_id`` is
:term:`ObjectId` on every insert() <db.collection.insert()` operation. An :term:`ObjectId`
is a 12-byte unique identifiers suitable for use as the value of an
``_id`` field.

.. note::

   In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field
   to prevent errors.  This is most-often done by using a standard
   auto-generated :term:`ObjectId`.

.. [#unique-index-report] Although the index on ``_id`` *is* unique,
   the :method:`getIndexes() <db.collection.getIndexes()>` method will
   *not* print ``unique: true`` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

.. [#capped-collections] Before version 2.2 capped collections did not
   have an ``_id`` field. In 2.2, all capped collections
   have an ``_id`` field, except those in the ``local`` :term:`database`.
   See the :ref:`release notes <2.2-id-indexes-capped-collections>`
   for more information.

.. todo:: fix the above when a full capped-collection page exists.
   2012.11.08>note: The capped-collection page is now created and in the draft folder.

Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All indexes in MongoDB are :term:`secondary indexes <secondary
index>`. You can create indexes on any field within any document or
sub-document. Additionally, you can create compound indexes with
multiple fields, so that a single query can match multiple components
using the index while scanning fewer whole documents.

In general, you should create indexes that support your primary, common,
and user-facing queries. Doing so requires MongoDB to scan the fewest
number of documents possible.

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can create an index by calling the
:method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` method.
Arguments to :method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "field": 1 }
   { "product.quantity": 1 }
   { "product": 1, "quantity": 1 }

For each field in the index specify either ``1`` for an
ascending order or ``-1`` for a descending order, which represents the
order of the keys in the index. For indexes with more than one key (i.e.
:ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>`) the sequence of fields is
important.

.. index:: index; subdocuments
.. _index-subdocuments:
.. _index-sub-documents:
.. _index-subdocument:
.. _index-sub-document:

Indexes on Sub-documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create indexes on fields that hold sub-documents as in the
following example:

.. example::

   Given the following document in the ``factories`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id": ObjectId(...), metro: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )

   You can create an index on the ``metro`` key. The following queries would
   then use that index, and both would return the above document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.factories.find( { metro: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } );

      db.factories.find( { metro: { $gte : { city: "New York" } } } );

   The second query returns the document because ``{ city: "New York"
   }`` is less than ``{ city: "New York", state: "NY" }`` The order of
   comparison is in ascending key order in the order the keys occur in
   the :term:`BSON` document.

.. index:: index; embedded fields
.. _index-embedded-fields:

Indexes on Embedded Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create indexes on fields in sub-documents, just as you can
index top-level fields in documents. [#sub-document-indexes]_ These
indexes allow you to use a "dot notation," to introspect into
sub-documents.

Consider a collection named ``people`` that holds documents that resemble
the following example document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"_id": ObjectId(...)
    "name": "John Doe"
    "address": {
           "street": "Main"
           "zipcode": 53511
           "state": "WI"
           }
   }

You can create an index on the ``address.zipcode`` field, using the
following specification:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { "address.zipcode": 1 } )

.. [#sub-document-indexes] :ref:`index-sub-documents`, by contrast
   allow you to index fields that hold documents, including the full
   content, up to the maximum :limit:`Index Size` of the sub-document
   in the index.

.. index:: index; compound
.. index:: compound index
.. _index-type-compound:

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports "compound indexes," where a single index structure
holds references to multiple fields within a collection's
documents. Consider a collection named ``products`` that holds documents
that resemble the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...)
    "item": "Banana"
    "category": ["food", "produce", "grocery"]
    "location": "4th Street Store"
    "stock": 4
    "type": cases
    "arrival": Date(...)
   }

If most applications queries include the ``item`` field and a
significant number of queries will also check the ``stock`` field, you
can specify a single compound index to support both of these queries:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "item": 1, "location": 1, "stock": 1 } )

Compound indexes support queries on any prefix of the fields in the
index. [#prefix]_ For example, MongoDB can use the above index to
support queries that select the ``item`` field and to support queries
that select the ``item`` field **and** the ``location`` field. The
index, however, would not support queries that select the following:

- only the ``location`` field
- only the ``stock`` field
- only the ``location`` and ``stock`` fields
- only the ``item`` and ``stock`` fields

When creating an index, the number associated with a key specifies the
direction of the index. The options are ``1`` (ascending) and ``-1``
(descending). Direction doesn't matter for single key indexes or for
random access retrieval but is important if you are doing sort
queries on compound indexes.

The order of fields in a compound index is very important. In the
previous example, the index will contain references to documents
sorted first by the values of the ``item`` field and, within each
value of the ``item`` field, sorted by the values of ``location``, and
then sorted by values of the ``stock`` field.

.. [#prefix] Index prefixes are the beginning subset of fields. For
   example, given the index ``{ a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }`` both ``{ a: 1 }``
   and ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }`` are prefixes of the index.

.. index:: index; sort order
.. _index-ascending-and-descending:

Indexes with Ascending and Descending Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending or descending
order. For single-field indexes, the order of keys doesn't matter,
because MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction. However,
for :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>`, if you need to order results against two fields,
sometimes you need the index fields running in opposite order relative
to each other.

To specify an index with a descending order, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "field": -1 } )

More typically in the context of a :ref:`compound
index<index-type-compound>`, the specification would resemble the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "fieldA": 1, "fieldB": -1 } )

Consider a collection of event data that includes both usernames and a
timestamp. If you want to return a list of events sorted by username
and then with the most recent events first. To create this index, use
the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.ensureIndex( { "username" : 1, "timestamp" : -1 } )

.. index:: index; multikey
.. _index-type-multi-key:
.. _index-type-multikey:

Multikey Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you index a field that contains an array, MongoDB indexes each
value in the array separately, in a "multikey index."

.. example::

   Given the following document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
        "name" : "Warm Weather",
        "author" : "Steve",
        "tags" : [ "weather", "hot", "record", "april" ] }

   Then an index on the ``tags`` field would be a multikey index and
   would include these separate entries:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { tags: "weather" }
      { tags: "hot" }
      { tags: "record" }
      { tags: "april" }

   Queries could use the multikey index to return queries for any of
   the above values.

You can use multikey indexes to index fields within objects embedded in
arrays, as in the following example:

.. example::

   Consider a ``feedback`` collection with documents in the following
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
       "_id": ObjectId(...)
       "title": "Grocery Quality"
       "comments": [
          { author_id: ObjectId(...)
            date: Date(...)
            text: "Please expand the cheddar selection." },
          { author_id: ObjectId(...)
            date: Date(...)
            text: "Please expand the mustard selection." },
          { author_id: ObjectId(...)
            date: Date(...)
            text: "Please expand the olive selection." }
       ]
      }

   An index on the ``comments.text`` field would be a multikey index
   and would add items to the index for all of the sub-documents in
   the array.

   With an index, such as ``{ comments.text: 1 }``, consider the
   following query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.feedback.find( { "comments.text": "Please expand the olive selection." } )

   This would select the document, that contains the following
   document in the ``comments.text`` array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { author_id: ObjectId(...)
        date: Date(...)
        text: "Please expand the olive selection." }

.. admonition:: Compound Multikey Indexes May Only Include One Array Field

   While you can create multikey :ref:`compound indexes
   <index-type-compound>`, at most one field in a compound index may hold
   an array. For example, given an index on ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }``, the
   following documents are permissible:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {a: [1, 2], b: 1}

      {a: 1, b: [1, 2]}

   However, the following document is impermissible, and MongoDB
   cannot insert such a document into a collection with the ``{a: 1,
   b: 1 }`` index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {a: [1, 2], b: [1, 2]}

   If you attempt to insert a such a document, MongoDB will reject the
   insertion, and produce an error that says ``cannot index parallel
   arrays``. MongoDB does not index parallel arrays because they
   require the index to include each value in the Cartesian product of
   the compound keys, which could quickly result in incredibly large
   and difficult to maintain indexes.

.. index:: index; unique
.. _index-type-unique:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A unique index causes MongoDB to reject all documents that
contain a duplicate value for the indexed field. To create a unique index
on the ``user_id`` field of the ``members`` collection, use the
following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.addresses.ensureIndex( { "user_id": 1 }, { unique: true } )

By default, ``unique`` is ``false`` on MongoDB indexes.

If you use the unique constraint on a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` then MongoDB will enforce uniqueness on the
*combination* of values, rather than the individual value for any or all
values of the key.

If a document does not have a value for the indexed field in a unique
index, the index will store a null value for this document. MongoDB
will only permit one document without a unique value in the collection
because of this unique constraint. You can combine with the
:ref:`sparse index <index-type-sparse>` to filter these null values
from the unique index.

.. index:: index; sparse
.. _index-type-sparse:

Sparse Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the
indexed field. [#null-values-are-indexed-in-sparse-indexes]_ Any
document that is missing the field is not indexed. The index is
"sparse" because of the missing documents when values are missing.

By contrast, non-sparse indexes contain all documents
in a collection, and store null values for documents that do not
contain the indexed field. Create a sparse index on the ``xmpp_id``
field, of the ``members`` collection, using the following operation in
the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.addresses.ensureIndex( { "xmpp_id": 1 }, { sparse: true } )

By default, ``sparse`` is ``false`` on MongoDB indexes.

.. warning::

   Using these indexes will sometimes result in incomplete results
   when filtering or sorting results, because sparse indexes are not
   complete for all documents in a collection.

.. note::

   Do not confuse sparse indexes in MongoDB with `block-level`_
   indexes in other databases. Think of them as dense indexes with a
   specific filter.

   You can combine the sparse index option with the :ref:`unique
   indexes <index-type-unique>` option so that :binary:`~bin.mongod` will
   reject documents that have duplicate values for a field, but that
   ignore documents that do not have the key.

   .. _`block-level`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index#Sparse_index

.. [#null-values-are-indexed-in-sparse-indexes] All documents that
   have the indexed field *are* indexed in a sparse index, even if
   that field stores a null value in some documents.

.. index:: index; options
.. _index-creation-operations:
.. _index-operations:

Index Creation Options
----------------------

You specify index creation options in the second argument in
:method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`.

The options :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`, :ref:`unique
<index-type-unique>`, and :ref:`TTL <index-feature-ttl>` affect the
kind of index that MongoDB creates. This section addresses,
:ref:`background construction <index-creation-background>` and
:ref:`duplicate dropping <index-creation-duplicate-dropping>`, which
affect how MongoDB builds the indexes.

.. index:: index; background creation
.. _index-creation-background:

Background Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, creating an index is a blocking operation. Building an
index on a large collection of data can take a long
time to complete. To resolve this issue, the background option can
allow you to continue to use your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance during
the index build.

For example, to create an index in the background of the ``zipcode``
field of the ``people`` collection you would issue the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { zipcode: 1}, {background: true} )

By default, ``background`` is ``false`` for building MongoDB indexes.

You can combine the background option with other options, as in the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { zipcode: 1}, {background: true, sparse: true } )

Be aware of the following behaviors with background index
construction:

- A :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance can only build one background index per
  database, at a time.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.2
     Before 2.2, a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance could only build
     one index at a time.

- The indexing operation runs in the background so that other database
  operations can run while creating the index. However, the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell session or connection where you are creating
  the index will block until the index build is complete. Open another
  connection or :binary:`~bin.mongo` instance to continue using commands
  to the database.

- The background index operation use an incremental approach that is
  slower than the normal "foreground" index builds. If the index is
  larger than the available RAM, then the incremental process
  can take *much* longer than the foreground build.

- If your application includes :method:`ensureIndex()
  <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` operations, and an index *doesn't*
  exist for other operational concerns, building the index can have a
  severe impact on the performance of the database.

  Make sure that your application checks for the indexes at start up
  using the :method:`getIndexes() <db.collection.getIndexes()>` method
  or the :api:`equivalent method for your driver <>` and terminates if
  the proper indexes do not exist. Always build indexes in production
  instances using separate application code, during designated
  maintenance windows.

.. admonition:: Building Indexes on Secondaries

   Background index operations on a :term:`replica set`
   :term:`primary` become foreground indexing operations on secondary
   members of the set. All indexing operations on secondaries block
   replication.

   To build large indexes on secondaries the best approach is to
   restart one secondary at a time in :term:`standalone` mode and build the
   index. After building the index, restart as a member of the
   replica set, allow it to catch up with the other members of the
   set, and then build the index on the next secondary. When all the
   secondaries have the new index, step down the primary, restart it
   as a standalone, and build the index on the former primary.

   Remember, the amount of time required to build the index on a
   secondary node must be within the window of the :term:`oplog`, so
   that the secondary can catch up with the primary.

   See :ref:`index-building-replica-sets` for more information on
   this process.

   Indexes on secondary members in "recovering" mode are always built in
   the foreground to allow them to catch up as soon as possible.

   See :ref:`index-building-replica-sets` for a complete procedure for
   rebuilding indexes on secondaries.

.. note::

   If MongoDB is building an index in the background, you cannot
   perform other administrative operations involving that collection,
   including :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, drop that collection
   (i.e. :method:`db.collection.drop()`,) and
   :dbcommand:`compact`. These operations will return an error during
   background index builds.

Queries will not use these indexes until the index build is complete.

.. index:: index; duplicates
.. index:: index; drop duplicates
.. _index-creation-duplicate-dropping:

Drop Duplicates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB cannot create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on a
field that has duplicate values. To force the creation of a unique
index, you can specify the ``dropDups`` option, which will only index
the first occurrence of a value for the key, and delete all subsequent
values.

.. warning::

   As in all unique indexes, if a document does not have the indexed
   field, MongoDB will include it in the index with a "null" value.

   If subsequent fields *do not* have the indexed field, and you have
   set ``{dropDups: true}``, MongoDB will remove these documents from
   the collection when creating the index. If you combine ``dropDups``
   with the :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` option, this index will
   only include documents in the index that have the value, and the
   documents without the field will remain in the database.

To create a unique index that drops duplicates on the ``username``
field of the ``accounts`` collection, use a command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.ensureIndex( { username: 1 }, { unique: true, dropDups: true } )

.. warning::

   Specifying ``{ dropDups: true }`` will delete data from your
   database. Use with extreme caution.

By default, ``dropDups`` is ``false``.

Index Features
--------------

.. index:: index; TTL index
.. index:: TTL index
.. _index-feature-ttl:

TTL Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~

TTL indexes are special indexes that MongoDB can use to automatically
remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of
time. This is ideal for some types of information like machine
generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to
persist in a database for a limited amount of time.

These indexes have the following limitations:

- :ref:`Compound indexes <index-type-compound>` are *not* supported.

- The indexed field **must** be a date :term:`type <bson types>`.

- If the field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed data
  in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest*
  (i.e. earliest) matches the expiration threshold.

.. include:: /includes/note-ttl-collection-background-timing.rst

In all other respects, TTL indexes are normal indexes,
and if appropriate, MongoDB can use these
indexes to fulfill arbitrary queries.

.. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data`

.. index:: index; geospatial
.. index:: geospatial index
.. _index-feature-geospatial:

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides "geospatial indexes" to support location-based and
other similar queries in a two dimensional coordinate systems. For
example, use geospatial indexes when you need to take a collection of
documents that have coordinates, and return a number of options that
are "near" a given coordinate pair.

To create a geospatial index, your :term:`documents <document>` must
have a coordinate pair. For maximum compatibility, these coordinate
pairs should be in the form of a two element array, such as ``[ x , y
]``. Given the field of ``loc``, that held a coordinate pair, in the
collection ``places``, you would create a geospatial index as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { loc : "2d" } )

MongoDB will reject documents that have values in the ``loc`` field
beyond the minimum and maximum values.

.. note::

   MongoDB permits only one geospatial index per collection. Although,
   MongoDB will allow clients to create multiple geospatial indexes, a
   single query can use only one index.

See the :query:`$near`, and the database command
:dbcommand:`geoNear` for more information on accessing geospatial
data.

.. _index-geohaystack-index:

Geohaystack Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo:: update links in the following session as needed:

In addition to conventional :ref:`geospatial indexes
<index-feature-geospatial>`, MongoDB also provides a bucket-based
geospatial index, called "geospatial haystack indexes." These indexes
support high performance queries for locations within a small area,
when the query must filter along another dimension.

.. example::

   If you need to return all documents that have coordinates within 25
   miles of a given point *and* have a type field value of "museum," a
   haystack index would be provide the best support for these queries.

Haystack indexes allow you to tune your bucket size to the
distribution of your data, so that in general you search only very
small regions of 2d space for a particular kind of document. These
indexes are not suited for finding the closest documents to a
particular location, when the closest documents are far away compared
to bucket size.

.. index:: index; limitations
.. _index-limitations:

Index Behaviors and Limitations
-------------------------------

Be aware of the following behaviors and limitations:

..
  - MongoDB indexes are case-sensitive.

- A collection may have no more than :ref:`64 indexes <limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection>`.

- Index keys can be no larger than :ref:`1024 bytes <limit-index-size>`.

  ..

    Documents with fields that have values greater than
    this size cannot be indexed.

    To query for documents that were too large to index, you can use a
    command similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       db.myCollection.find({<key>: <value too large to index>}).hint({$natural: 1})

- The name of an index, including the :term:`namespace` must be
  shorter than :ref:`128 characters <limit-index-name-length>`.

- Indexes have storage requirements, and impacts insert/update speed
  to some degree.

- Create indexes to support queries and other operations, but do not
  maintain indexes that your MongoDB instance cannot or will not use.

- For queries with the :query:`$or` operator,
  each clause of an :query:`$or` query executes in parallel, and
  can each use a different index.

- For queries that use the :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` method and
  use the :query:`$or` operator, the query **cannot** use the
