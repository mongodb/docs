Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the Java Driver, the official
MongoDB driver for synchronous Java applications.
Follow the :ref:`Quick Start <java-sync-quickstart>` guide to learn how
to add the driver to your project by using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ and how to set up a runnable app.

If your Java application requires asynchronous stream processing, use the
:driver:`Reactive Streams Driver </reactive-streams/>` which uses Reactive
Streams to make non-blocking calls to MongoDB.

Connect to a Compatible MongoDB Deployment
------------------------------------------

You can use the {+driver-short+} to connect to MongoDB
deployments running on one of the following hosted services or editions:
