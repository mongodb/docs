Overview
--------

MongoDB :ref:`stores times in UTC <document-bson-type-date>` by default, and will convert
any local time representations into this form. Applications that must operate or
report on some unmodified local time value may store the time zone alongside the
UTC timestamp, and compute the original local time in their application logic.

Example
-------

In the MongoDB shell, you can store both the current date and the current
client's offset from UTC.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var now = new Date();
   db.data.save( { date: now,
                   offset: now.getTimezoneOffset() } );

You can reconstruct the original local time by applying the saved offset:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var record = db.data.findOne();
   var localNow = new Date( record.date.getTime() -  ( record.offset * 60000 ) );
