Delete a Project

   To delete a project for an organization, you must either have the 
   ``Owner`` role for the project or have the ``Organization Owner`` 
   role for the project's organization.

You can delete a project for an organization either from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

   tabs:

   - id: projects-view

     name: "Delete from Projects view"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   To delete an organization, you must have the
