msgid "MongoDB :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances route queries and write operations to :term:`shards <shard>` in a sharded cluster. :binary:`~bin.mongos` provide the only interface to a sharded cluster from the perspective of applications. Applications never connect or communicate directly with the shards."

msgid "The :binary:`~bin.mongos` tracks what data is on which shard by caching the metadata from the :ref:`config servers <sharded-cluster-config-server>`. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` uses the metadata to route operations from applications and clients to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. A :binary:`~bin.mongos` has no *persistent* state and consumes minimal system resources."

msgid "The first case occurs when the merge part of the split pipeline contains a stage which *must* run on a primary shard.
