To help MongoDB engineers analyze server behavior, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` processes include a Full Time Diagnostic Data
Capture (FTDC) mechanism. FTDC is enabled by default. Due to its
importance in debugging deployments, FTDC thread failures are fatal and
stop the parent ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process.

Behavior
--------

.. note:: FTDC User Permissions on Windows
   
   .. include:: /includes/fact-ftdc-windows-user-permissions.rst

FTDC periodically collects statistics produced by the following 
commands:

- :dbcommand:`serverStatus`
- :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` (:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` only)
- :dbcommand:`collStats` for the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection (:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` only)
- :dbcommand:`connPoolStats` (:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` only)
- :dbcommand:`getParameter`
- :dbcommand:`getClusterParameter`

Depending on the host operating system, the diagnostic data may include
one or more of the following utilization statistics:

- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Disk utilization related to performance. FTDC does not include
  data related to storage capacity.
- Network performance statistics. FTDC only captures metadata and
  does not capture or inspect any network packets.

.. note::

   If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process runs in a :term:`container`, FTDC 
   reports utilization statistics from the perspective of the container 
   instead of the host operating system. For example, if a the 
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` runs in a container that is configured with RAM 
   restrictions, FTDC calculates memory utilization against the container's 
   RAM limit, as opposed to the host operating system's RAM limit.

FTDC collects statistics produced by the following commands on
file rotation or startup:

- :dbcommand:`getCmdLineOpts`
- :dbcommand:`buildInfo`
- :dbcommand:`hostInfo`

FTDC Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` processes store FTDC data files in a 
``diagnostic.data`` directory under the instances 
:setting:`storage.dbPath`. All diagnostic data files are stored
under this directory. For example, given a :setting:`~storage.dbPath`
of ``/data/db``, the diagnostic data directory would be
``/data/db/diagnostic.data``. 

:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes store FTDC data files in a 
diagnostic directory relative to the :setting:`systemLog.path` log 
path setting. MongoDB truncates the logpath's file extension and 
concatenates ``diagnostic.data`` to the remaining name. For example, 
given a :setting:`~systemLog.path` setting of
``/var/log/mongodb/mongos.log``, the diagnostic data directory would be 
``/var/log/mongodb/mongos.diagnostic.data``.

FTDC Privacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FTDC data files are compressed and not human-readable. They inherit
the same file access permissions as the MongoDB data files. Only
users with access to FTDC data files can transmit the FTDC data.

MongoDB engineers cannot access FTDC data without explicit
permission and assistance from system owners or operators.

FTDC data **never** contains any of the following information:

- Samples of queries, query predicates, or query results
- Data sampled from any end-user collection or index
- System or MongoDB user credentials or security certificates

FTDC data contains certain host machine information such as
hostnames, operating system information, and the options or settings
used to start the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`. This information may be
considered protected or confidential by some organizations or
regulatory bodies, but is not typically considered to be Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). For clusters where these fields are
configured with protected, confidential, or PII data, please notify
MongoDB engineers before sending FTDC data to coordinate
appropriate security measures.

Details
-------

You can view the FTDC source code on the
`MongoDB Github Repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/src/mongo/db/ftdc>`_.
The ``ftdc_system_stats_*.ccp`` files specifically define any
system-specific diagnostic data captured.

FTDC Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FTDC runs with the following defaults:

- Data capture every 1 second
- 200MB maximum ``diagnostic.data`` folder size. 

These defaults are designed to provide useful data to MongoDB 
engineers with minimal impact on performance or storage size. These 
values only require modifications if requested by MongoDB engineers 
for specific diagnostic purposes.

Disable FTDC
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable FTDC, start up the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` with the 
``diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled: false`` option in the 
:setting:`setParameter` settings of your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   setParameter:
     diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled: false

Disabling FTDC may increase the time or resources required when 
analyzing or debugging issues with support from MongoDB engineers.
