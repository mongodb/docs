=================================
Change Hostnames in a Replica Set
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For most :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, the hostnames in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` field never change.
However, if organizational needs change, you might need to migrate some
or all host names.

.. note:: Always use resolvable hostnames for the value of the
   :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` field in the replica
   set configuration to avoid confusion and complexity.

Overview
--------

This document provides two separate procedures for changing the
hostnames in the :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host`
field. Use either of the following approaches:

- :ref:`Change hostnames without disrupting availability
  <replica-set-change-hostname-no-downtime>`. This approach ensures your
  applications will always be able to read and write data to the replica
  set, but the approach can take a long time and may incur downtime at
  the application layer.

  If you use the first procedure, you must configure your applications
  to connect to the replica set at both the old and new locations, which
  often requires a restart and reconfiguration at the application layer
  and which may affect the availability of your applications.
  Re-configuring applications is beyond the scope of this document.

- :ref:`Stop all members running on the old hostnames at once
  <replica-set-change-hostname-downtime>`. This approach has a shorter
  maintenance window, but the replica set will be unavailable during
  the operation.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration Process
   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`,
   :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`, and
   :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.

Assumptions
-----------

Given a :term:`replica set` with three members:

- ``database0.example.com:27017`` (the :term:`primary`)

- ``database1.example.com:27017``

- ``database2.example.com:27017``

And with the following :method:`rs.conf()` output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id" : "rs",
       "version" : 3,
       "members" : [
           {
               "_id" : 0,
               "host" : "database0.example.com:27017"
           },
           {
               "_id" : 1,
               "host" : "database1.example.com:27017"
           },
           {
               "_id" : 2,
               "host" : "database2.example.com:27017"
           }
       ]
   }

The following procedures change the members' hostnames as follows:

- ``mongodb0.example.net:27017`` (the primary)

- ``mongodb1.example.net:27017``

- ``mongodb2.example.net:27017``

Use the most appropriate procedure for your deployment.

.. _replica-set-change-hostname-no-downtime:

Change Hostnames while Maintaining Replica Set Availability
-----------------------------------------------------------

This procedure uses the above :ref:`assumptions <procedure-assumption-change-hostnames-replica-set>`.

#. For each :term:`secondary` in the replica set, perform the
   following sequence of operations:

   a. Stop the secondary.

   #. Restart the secondary at the new location.

   #. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the replica set's
      primary. In our example, the primary runs on port ``27017`` so you
      would issue the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --port 27017

   #. Use :method:`rs.reconfig()` to update the :doc:`replica set
      configuration document </reference/replica-configuration>` with
      the new hostname.

      For example, the following sequence of commands updates the
      hostname for the secondary at the array index ``1`` of the
      ``members`` array (i.e. ``members[1]``) in the replica set
      configuration document:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         cfg = rs.conf()
         cfg.members[1].host = "mongodb1.example.net:27017"
         rs.reconfig(cfg)

      For more information on updating the configuration document, see
      :ref:`replica-set-reconfiguration-usage`.

   #. Make sure your client applications are able to access the
      set at the new location and that the secondary has a chance to
      catch up with the other members of the set.

      Repeat the above steps for each non-primary member of the set.

#. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the primary and step
   down the primary using the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

   The replica set elects another member to the become primary.

#. When the step down succeeds, shut down the old primary.

#. Start the :program:`mongod` instance that will become the new primary
   in the new location.

#. Connect to the current primary, which was just elected, and update
   the :doc:`replica set configuration document
   </reference/replica-configuration>` with the hostname of the node that
   is to become the new primary.

   For example, if the old primary was at position ``0`` and the new
   primary's hostname is ``mongodb0.example.net:27017``, you would run:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[0].host = "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

#. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the new primary.

#. To confirm the new configuration, call :method:`rs.conf()` in the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

   Your output should resemble:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          "_id" : "rs",
          "version" : 4,
          "members" : [
              {
                  "_id" : 0,
                  "host" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 1,
                  "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27017"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 2,
                  "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27017"
              }
          ]
      }

.. _replica-set-change-hostname-downtime:

Change All Hostnames at the Same Time
-------------------------------------

This procedure uses the above :ref:`assumptions  <procedure-assumption-change-hostnames-replica-set>`.

#. Stop all members in the :term:`replica set`.

#. Restart each member *on a different port* and *without* using the
   :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` run-time option. Changing
   the port number during maintenance prevents clients from connecting
   to this host while you perform maintenance. Use the member's usual
   :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, which in this
   example is ``/data/db1``. Use a command that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db1/ --port 37017

#. For each member of the replica set, perform the following sequence
   of operations:

   a. Open a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongod`
      running on the new, temporary port. For example, for a member
      running on a temporary port of ``37017``, you would issue this
      command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --port 37017

   #. Edit the replica set configuration manually. The replica set
      configuration is the only document in the ``system.replset``
      collection in the ``local`` database. Edit the replica set
      configuration with the new hostnames and correct ports for all
      the members of the replica set. Consider the following sequence of
      commands to change the hostnames in a three-member set:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use local

         cfg = db.system.replset.findOne( { "_id": "rs" } )

         cfg.members[0].host = "mongodb0.example.net:27017"

         cfg.members[1].host = "mongodb1.example.net:27017"

         cfg.members[2].host = "mongodb2.example.net:27017"

         db.system.replset.update( { "_id": "rs" } , cfg )

   #. Stop the :program:`mongod` process on the member.

#. After re-configuring all members of the set, start each
   :program:`mongod` instance in the normal way: use the usual port
   number and use the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db1/ --port 27017 --replSet rs

#. Connect to one of the :program:`mongod` instances
   using the :program:`mongo` shell. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --port 27017

#. To confirm the new configuration, call :method:`rs.conf()` in the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

   Your output should resemble:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          "_id" : "rs",
          "version" : 4,
          "members" : [
              {
                  "_id" : 0,
                  "host" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 1,
                  "host" : "mongodb1.example.net:27017"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 2,
                  "host" : "mongodb2.example.net:27017"
              }
          ]
      }
