=====================================
Add Monitored Processes to Automation
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| can automate operations for your monitored MongoDB processes.
Adding your processes to Automation lets you reconfigure, stop, and
restart MongoDB through the |mms| interface.

.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-automation-needs-automation-agent.rst

Adding monitored processes involves two steps. First, install the
Automation Agent on each server hosting a monitored MongoDB process.
Second, add the processes to Automation through the |mms| interface.

Considerations
--------------

Automation supports most but not all available MongoDB options. Automation
supports the options described in
:doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options`.

Prerequisites
-------------

|mms| is Monitoring the Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| must be currently monitoring the MongoDB processes, and the
Monitoring Agent must be running. The processes must appear in the |mms|
:guilabel:`Deployment` tab. If this is not the case, see
:doc:`/tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring`.

Procedures
----------

Install the Automation Agent on Each Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the Automation Agent on each server that hosts a monitored MongoDB
process.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the Automation Agent. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
Automation Agent.

For additional information on installing the agent, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.
