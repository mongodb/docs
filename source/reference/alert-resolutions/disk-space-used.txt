``Disk Space % Used`` alerts indicate the percentage of used disk space
on a partition reaches a specified threshold.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`Disk space % used on Data Partition
<Disk space % used on Data Partition is>` occurs when the
percentage of disk space used on any partition that contains the
MongoDB collection data meets or exceeds a certain threshold.
:ref:`By default <default-alert-settings>`, the threshold is 90
percent of the cluster's :doc:`configured storage size </scale-cluster>`.

:alert:`Disk space % used on Index Partition
<Disk space % used on Index Partition is>`
occurs when the percentage of disk space used on any
partition that contains the MongoDB index data meets or exceeds a
certain threshold. You specify the threshold when you
:ref:`configure this alert <configure-alert-settings>`.

:alert:`Disk space % used on Journal Partition
<Disk space % used on Journal Partition is>` occurs when the
percentage of disk space used on the partition that contains the
MongoDB :term:`journal` meets or exceeds a certain threshold. You
specify the threshold when you :ref:`configure this alert
<configure-alert-settings>`. This alert only occurs when
:manual:`journaling </core/journaling>` is enabled.

Common Triggers
---------------

The following common events can trigger ``Disk Space % Used`` alerts:

- The disk is full and :ref:`Auto-Expand Storage
  <scale-cluster-storage>` is not enabled.

- Auto-Expand Storage is enabled, but the disk filled too quickly
  for |service| to expand the cluster's storage space. This
  can happen during data migration.

- Auto-Expand Storage is enabled, but |service| cannot expand the
  cluster's storage space because it has reached the maximum storage
  capacity for this cluster. For more information on cluster tier
  limits, see the :ref:`Amazon Web Services <amazon-aws-configuration-options>`,
  :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp-configuration-options>`, and
  :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure-configuration-options>`
  instance configuration options.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider the following actions to help resolve ``Disk Space % Used``
alerts through the {+atlas-ui+} or API.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      - :ref:`Enable Auto-Expand Storage <scale-cluster-storage>`.

        .. note::

    		   If the disk fills too quickly, |service| might not be
    		   able to expand the cluster's storage space in time,
    		   even if Auto-Expand Storage is enabled.

      - Manually increase the :guilabel:`Storage` of this cluster
        in the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section of the
        :ref:`configuration page <scale-cluster-storage>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: atlas-api

      - :doc:`Enable Auto-Expand Storage
        </reference/api/clusters-modify-one>` using the
        ``autoScaling.diskGBEnabled`` parameter.

        .. note::

    		   If the disk fills too quickly, |service| might not be
    		   able to expand the cluster's storage space in time,
    		   even if Auto-Expand Storage is enabled.

      - :doc:`Increase the storage of this cluster
        </reference/api/clusters-modify-one>` using the
        ``diskSizeGB`` parameter.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Consider the following long-term solutions to help resolve 
``Disk Space % Used`` alerts through the {+atlas-ui+} or API.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      If you have reached the maximum storage capacity for this
      cluster, upgrade to a larger cluster tier in the
      :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section of the 
      :ref:`configuration page <scale-cluster-instance>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: atlas-api

      If you have reached the maximum storage capacity for this
      cluster, :doc:`specify a larger cluster tier
      </reference/api/clusters-modify-one>` using the
      ``providerSettings.instanceSizeName`` parameter.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

You can observe a high percentage of used disk space in the following
ways:

- In the cluster :doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`, the
  :guilabel:`Disk Usage` graph displays the used disk space in
  yellow. This indicates that the used disk space is approximately
  70 percent of the |service| cluster's :doc:`configured storage
  size </scale-cluster>`.

- |service| nodes are unhealthy, because the
  used disk space reached the cluster's
  :ref:`configured storage size <scale-cluster-instance>`.

- The cluster refuses writes and connections from the client.
