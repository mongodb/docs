You can configure your MongoDB resources to bind to specific storage in 
your ``MongoDB`` |k8s-crd|. The ``persistence`` field in the MongoDB |k8s-crd| 
allows you to more precisely manage where |k8s| stores the logs and metadata 
generated from MongoDB custom resources. Controlling log and metadata storage 
allows you to have more fine-grained control of processes that manage and 
interact with this generated metadata.

You can configure persistence settings per component in the MongoDB |k8s-crd|. 
These settings allow you to specify the relationship between a given 
component and one or more related ``PersistentVolume`` resources, which
store output from your MongoDB custom resources.

The ``persistence`` setting specifies the number of and storage capacity 
of ``persistentVolumes`` associated with MongoDB custom resource-managed objects 
in your |k8s| cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

To configure storage options for your 
MongoDB deployment, you must either have a MongoDB replica set deployed 
through the MongoDB |k8s| Operator or meet the following prerequisites:

- An :ref:`Ops Manager instance <deploy-om-container>` or a :opsmgr:`Cloud Manager organization </tutorial/manage-organizations/#create-organization>`.

- The :ref:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator <install-k8s>`.

- A :ref:`Kubernetes Operator ConfigMap <create-k8s-project>`.

- :ref:`Credentials for the Kubernetes Operator <create-k8s-credentials>` or 
  configure :ref:`a different secret storage tool <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>`.

Procedure
---------

To create a single ``PersistentVolume`` in which a given component will store 
all MongoDB |k8s-crd| output, define the component's ``persistence`` as ``single``. To create a 
distinct ``PersistentVolume`` for the component's ``data``, ``journal``, 
and ``logs``, define the component's ``persistence`` as ``multiple``.
