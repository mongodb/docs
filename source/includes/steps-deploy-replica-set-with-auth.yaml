  This :binary:`~bin.mongod`  should *not* enable :setting:`auth`.

title: Create administrative users.
stepnum: 2
ref: create-administrative-users
pre: |
  The following operations will create two users: a user administrator
  that will be able to create and modify users (``siteUserAdmin``),
  and a :authrole:`root` user (``siteRootAdmin``) that you will use to
  complete the remainder of the tutorial:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.addUser( {
        user: "siteUserAdmin",
        pwd: "<password>",
        roles: [ "userAdminAnyDatabase" ]
      });
    db.addUser( {
        user: "siteRootAdmin",
        pwd: "<password>",
        roles: [ "userAdminAnyDatabase",
                 "readWriteAnyDatabase",
                 "dbAdminAnyDatabase",
                 "clusterAdmin" ]
      });

title: Copy the key file to each member of the replica set.
stepnum: 5
ref: copy-key-file
content: |
  Copy the ``mongodb-keyfile`` to all hosts where components of a
  MongoDB deployment run. Set the permissions of these files to
  ``600`` so that only the *owner* of the file can read or write this
  file to prevent other users on the system from accessing the shared
  secret.

title: Start each member of the replica set with the appropriate options.
stepnum: 6
ref: start-mongod
pre: |
  For each member, start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` and specify the key file and
  the name of the replica set. Also specify other parameters as needed for
  your deployment. For replication-specific parameters, see
  :ref:`cli-mongod-replica-set` required by your deployment.

      The following example specifies parameters through the :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>`
      and :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` command-line options:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongod --keyFile /mysecretdirectory/mongodb-keyfile --replSet "rs0"
  - pre: |
      The following example specifies parameters through a configuration file:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongod --config $HOME/.mongodb/config
post: |
  In production deployments, you can configure a :term:`control script` to
  manage this process. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

title: "Connect to the member of the replica set where you created the administrative users."
stepnum: 7
ref: connect-and-auth
pre: |
  Connect to the replica set member you started and authenticate as
  the ``siteRootAdmin`` user. From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the
  following operation to authenticate:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.auth("siteRootAdmin", "<password>");
