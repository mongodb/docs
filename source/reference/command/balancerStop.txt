.. dbcommand:: balancerStop

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Disables the balancer in a sharded cluster. If a balancing round is
   in progress, the operation waits for balancing to complete before
   stopping the balancer.
   
   You can only issue the :dbcommand:`balancerStop` against the
   ``admin`` database.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { balancerStop: 1, maxTimeMS: <number> } )

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-balancerStop-field.rst

Example
-------

To stop the balancer thread, connect to a :program:`mongos` instance
and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { balancerStop: 1 } )
