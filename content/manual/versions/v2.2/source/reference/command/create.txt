.. dbcommand:: create

   The ``create`` command explicitly creates a collection. The command
   uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { create: <collection_name> }

   To create a :term:`capped collection` limited to 40 KB, issue command in
   the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { create: "collection", capped: true, size: 40 * 1024 }

   The options for creating capped collections are:

   :option capped: Specify ``true`` to create a :term:`capped collection`.

   :option autoIndexId: Specify ``false`` to disable the automatic
                        index created on the ``_id`` field. Before
                        2.2, the default value for ``autoIndexId`` was
                        ``false``. See :ref:`2.2-id-indexes-capped-collections`
                        for more information.

   :option size: The maximum size for the capped collection. Once a
                 capped collection reaches its max size, MongoDB will
                 drop old documents from the database to make way for
                 the new documents. You must specify a ``size``
                 argument for all capped collections.

   :option max: The maximum number of documents to preserve in the
                capped collection. This limit is subject to the
                overall size of the capped collection. If a capped
                collection reaches its maximum size before it contains
                the maximum number of documents, the database will
                remove old documents. Thus, if you use this option,
                ensure that the total size for the capped collection
                is sufficient to contain the max.

   The :method:`db.createCollection()` provides a wrapper function that
   provides access to this functionality.

   .. note::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed. The write
      lock for this operation is typically short lived; however,
      allocations for large capped collections may take longer.
