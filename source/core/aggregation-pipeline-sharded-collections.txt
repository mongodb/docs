Aggregation Pipeline and Sharded Collections
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The aggregation pipeline supports operations on :term:`sharded
<sharded cluster>` collections. This section describes behaviors
specific to the :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` and
sharded collections.

Behavior
--------

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

When operating on a sharded collection, the aggregation pipeline is
split into two parts. The first pipeline runs on each shard, or if an
early :pipeline:`$match` can exclude shards through the use of the
shard key in the predicate, the pipeline runs on only the relevant
shards.

The second pipeline consists of the remaining pipeline stages and runs
on the :ref:`primary shard <primary-shard>`. The primary shard merges
the cursors from the other shards and runs the second pipeline on these
results. The primary shard forwards
the final results to the :program:`mongos`. In previous versions, the
second pipeline would run on the :program:`mongos`.

Optimization
------------

When splitting the aggregation pipeline into two parts, the pipeline is
split to ensure that the shards perform as many stages as possible with
consideration for optimization.

To see how the pipeline was split, include the :method:`explain
<db.collection.aggregate()>` option in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method.

.. [#agg-pipeline-upgrade]
   Until all shards upgrade to v2.6, the second pipeline runs on the
   :program:`mongos` if any shards are still running v2.4.
