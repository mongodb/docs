         This page provides examples of delete operations using the
         following methods in the :program:`mongo` shell:
         
         - :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()` 
         - :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()`

         This page provides examples of delete operations using the
         following methods in the `PyMongo <https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/index.html>`_
         Python driver:
         
         - :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_many`
         - :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_one`
         
The examples on this page use the ``inventory`` collection. To populate
the ``inventory`` collection, run the following:

Delete All Documents
--------------------

     - id: shell

         To remove all documents from a collection, pass an empty
         :ref:`filter<document-query-filter>` document ``{}`` to the
         :method:`db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

     - id: python

         To remove all documents from a collection, pass an empty
         :ref:`filter<document-query-filter>` document ``{}`` to the
         :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_many` method.

The following example deletes *all* documents from the ``inventory``
collection:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-delete-56.rst

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-delete-result.rst

Delete All Documents that Match a Condition
-------------------------------------------

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to
delete. These :ref:`filters <document-query-filter>` use the same
syntax as read operations:

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/filter-equality.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/filter-query-operators.rst

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: shell
       content: |
         To delete all documents that match a deletion criteria, pass a
         :ref:`filter <document-query-filter>` parameter to the
         :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

     - id: python
       content: |
         To delete all documents that match a deletion criteria, pass a
         :ref:`filter <document-query-filter>` parameter to the
         :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_many` method.

The following example removes all documents from the ``inventory``
collection where the ``status`` field equals ``"A"``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-delete-57.rst

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-delete-result.rst

Remove Only One Document that Matches a Condition
-------------------------------------------------

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: shell
       content: |
         To delete at most a single document that matches a specified
         filter (even though multiple documents may match the specified
         filter) use the :method:`db.collection.deleteOne()` method.

     - id: python
       content: |
         To delete at most a single document that matches a specified
         filter (even though multiple documents may match the specified
         filter) use the
         :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_one` method.

The following example deletes the *first* document where ``status`` is
``"D"``.

Delete Behavior
---------------

Indexes
~~~~~~~

Delete operations do not drop indexes, even if deleting all documents
from a collection.

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single
document. For more information on MongoDB and atomicity, see
:doc:`/core/write-operations-atomicity`.

Write Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With write concerns, you can specify the level of acknowledgement
requested from MongoDB for write operations. For details, see
:doc:`/reference/write-concern`.
