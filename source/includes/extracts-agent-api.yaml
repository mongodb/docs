   With the new Agent API Key model, multiple Agent API Keys can be
   associated with a group. This gives users the ability to perform
   Agent key rotation.

   In addition, the new Agent API Key model improves on security as the
   keys are displayed only once upon creation and |mms|  no longer
   stores or displays these keys.

   You can use an Agent API key that you have already generated for the
   group. Otherwise, you can generate a new Agent API key. A group can
   have more than one Agent API key, and any of the group's agents can
   use any of the keys. For more information, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`.

   To generate an Agent API key, go to the :guilabel:`Agent API Keys`

      When you generate an Agent API key, |mms| displays it **one time
      only**. You must copy it and store it in a secure place. |mms| will never
      display the full key again.

   .. note::

      The button appears only if the current user is the group owner and
      the group either has no Agent API keys or just the Original Group
      API key. An Original Group API key exists only in groups created prior
      to the new Agent API Key model. The new model allows a group to have more
      than one key and permits any of the group's agents to use
      any of the keys.  For more information, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`.
      If you do not see the :guilabel:`+ Generate Key` button and do not
      remember your existing agent api key, you can generate a key on the
      :guilabel:`Agent API Keys` tab. To navigate to the tab, select 
      :guilabel:`Deployment`  view, then click the :guilabel:`Agents` tab
      and then the :guilabel:`Agent API Keys` tab.
