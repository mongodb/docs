   In the update document, use the :update:`$[\<identifier\>]` filtered
   positional operator to define an identifier, which you then reference
   in the array filter documents. You cannot have an array filter
   document for an identifier if the identifier is not included in the
   update document.

   .. note::
      The ``<identifier>`` must begin with a lowercase letter and
      contain only alphanumeric characters.

   You can include the same identifier multiple times in the update
   document; however, for each distinct identifier (``$[identifier]``)
   in the update document, you must specify **exactly one**
   corresponding array filter document. That is, you cannot specify
   multiple array filter documents for the same identifier. For
   example, if the update statement includes the identifier ``x``
   (possibly multiple times), you cannot specify the following for
   ``arrayFilters`` that includes 2 separate filter documents for ``x``:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      // INVALID

      [
        { "x.a": { $gt: 85 } },
        { "x.b": { $gt: 80 } }
      ]

   However, you can specify compound conditions on the same identifier
   in a single filter document, such as in the following examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // Example 1
      [
        { $or: [{"x.a": {$gt: 85}}, {"x.b": {$gt: 80}}] }
      ]
      // Example 2
      [
        { $and: [{"x.a": {$gt: 85}}, {"x.b": {$gt: 80}}] }
      ]
      // Example 3
      [
        { "x.a": { $gt: 85 }, "x.b": { $gt: 80 } }
      ]

   When updating an array field, you can specify ``arrayFilters`` that 
   determine which array elements to update.

   ``arrayFilters`` is not available for updates that use an
   aggregation pipeline.
