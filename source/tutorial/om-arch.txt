You can use the |k8s-op-short| to deploy |onprem| and MongoDB resources
to a |k8s| cluster. The |k8s-op-short| manages the lifecycle of each of
these deployments differently.

All |k8s| |k8s-secrets| that the |k8s-op-short|
creates can later be migrated to a different :ref:`secret storage tool <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>` 
to avoid storing secrets in |k8s|.

The ``MongoDBOpsManager`` Custom Resource Definition
----------------------------------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| manages |onprem| deployments using the
``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-custom-resource|. The |k8s-op-short| watches
the custom resource's specification for changes. When the
specification changes, the |k8s-op-short| validates the changes and
makes the appropriate updates to the resources in the |k8s| cluster.

``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-custom-resource|\s specification defines the
following |onprem| components:

- the Application Database,
- the |onprem| application, and
- the Backup Daemon.

Application Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Application Database, the |k8s-op-short| deploys a MongoDB
replica set as a |k8s-statefulset| to the |k8s| cluster. |k8s| creates
one Pod in the StatefulSet for each member
that comprises your Application Database replica set. Each Pod in
the StatefulSet runs a ``mongod`` and the {+mdbagent+}.

To enable each {+mdbagent+} to start |mongod| on its
Pod in the StatefulSet, you must specify a specific MongoDB Server
version for the Application Database using the
:opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.version` setting. The version
that you specify in this setting must correspond to the tag in the
:qr-mdb:`container registry 
</mongodb-enterprise-appdb-database?tab=tags>`. Each {+mdbagent+} 
starts the Application Database with the specified version on its Pod 
in the StatefulSet.

After each {+mdbagent+} starts |mongod|\s on its Application Database
Pod, the {+mdbagent+}\s add all |mongod| processes to the Application
Database replica set.

You configure the number of replicas in and other
configuration options for the Application Database replica set in the
:opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase` collection in the
``MongoDBOpsManager`` custom resource. The |k8s-op-short| passes
this configuration to the {+mdbagent+}\s using a |k8s-secret| that the
|k8s-op-short| mounts to each Pod in the Application Database StatefulSet.

Each time that you update
the :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase` collection, the
|k8s-op-short| applies the changes to the {+mdbagent+} configuration and
the StatefulSet specification, if applicable. If the StatefulSet
specification changes, |k8s| upgrades the Pods in a rolling
fashion and restarts each Pod.

The |k8s-op-short| creates a |k8s-service| with ``clusterIp=none`` to
provide connectivity to each Application Database Pod from within the
|k8s| cluster.

.. note::

   Depending on the |k8s-sc| or the environment to which you deploy the
   |k8s-op-short|, |k8s| might create the |k8s-pvs| using
   :k8sdocs:`dynamic volume provisioning </concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/>`.

You can customize the |k8s-pvcs| for the Application Database Pods using
the :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.podSpec.persistence.single
<spec.applicationDatabase>` or
:opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.podSpec.persistence.multiple
<spec.applicationDatabase>` options.

|application|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the Application Database reaches a **Running** state, the
|k8s-op-short| starts the |application|. For |onprem|, the
|k8s-op-short| deploys a StatefulSet to the |k8s| cluster. |k8s|
creates one Pod in the StatefulSet for each |onprem| replica that
you want to deploy. Each Pod contains one |application| process.

.. note::

   :ref:`Deploy <deploy-om-container>` multiple |onprem| replicas to
   make your deployment highly available in the event of an |onprem| Pod
   failure.

The |k8s-op-short| creates a |k8s-service| with ``clusterIp=none`` to
allow clients deployed to the |k8s| cluster to connect to |onprem|. To
allow clients external to the |k8s| cluster to connect to |onprem|,
configure the :opsmgrkube:`spec.externalConnectivity` collection in the
specification for your |onprem| deployment.

Backup Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` is **true**, the |k8s-op-short|
starts the Backup Daemon after the |application| reaches a **Running**
stage. For the Backup Daemon, |k8s-op-short| deploys a StatefulSet
to the |k8s| cluster. |k8s| creates one pod in the
StatefulSet for the Backup Daemon. 

If you enable backup, you must provide additional fields in the
:opsmgrkube:`spec.backup <spec.backup.enabled>` collection to configure:
the :term:`oplog store <oplog store database>` and a :term:`blockstore
<Backup Blockstore Database>` or an |s3| :term:`snapshot store <S3
Snapshot Store>`. 

If you enable backup, the |k8s-op-short| creates a |k8s-pvc| for the
Backup Daemon's :term:`head database`. You can
configure the head database using the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.headDB`
setting.

The |k8s-op-short| invokes |onprem| APIs to ensure that the
|application|\'s backup configuration matches the one that you define in
the custom resource definition.

Reconciling the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` Custom Resource
-----------------------------------------------------

The following diagram describes how the |k8s-op-short| reconciles
changes to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-crd|.

         Operator reconciles changes to the MongoDBOpsManager 
         Custom Resource Definition

.. _om-arch-steps:

1. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the
   ``<om_resource_name>-db-config`` secret. This secret contains
   the configurations that the {+mdbagent+} uses to start the
   Application Database replica set.

2. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the ``<om_resource_name>-db``
   Application Database StatefulSet. This StatefulSet contains at
   least three |k8s-pods|.

   - Each Pod runs one {+mdbagent+} instance. Each {+mdbagent+} starts a
     |mongod| instance on its Pod.
   - The |k8s-op-short| mounts the ``<om_resource_name>-db-config``
     secret to each Pod. The {+mdbagent+} uses this secret to
     configure the Application Database replica set.

3. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the ``<om_resource_name>``
   StatefulSet. This StatefulSet contains one Pod for each
   |onprem| replica. Each |onprem| replica connects to the Application
   Database.

   .. note::

      Most changes to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-custom-resource|
      trigger a rolling upgrade of the Pods in the
      ``<om_resource_name>`` StatefulSet. :ref:`Enabling TLS for the
      Application Database <secure-om-db-tls>` also triggers a rolling
      restart because the connection string to the Application Database
      changes.

      Changes to the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup <spec.backup.enabled>`
      ``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-custom-resource| collection don't
      trigger a rolling upgrade.

4. The |k8s-op-short| invokes |onprem| APIs to create an admin user.
   The |k8s-op-short| saves this admin user's credentials in the
   ``<om_resource_name>-admin-key`` secret. The |k8s-op-short|
   uses these credentials for all other |onprem| API invocations.

   .. note::

      This reconciliation step happens only once: when you use the
      |k8s-op-short| to create an |onprem| resource. The
      |k8s-op-short| skips this step when it updates the resource.

5. The |k8s-op-short| performs a rolling upgrade of the Pods in the
   ``<om_resource_name>-db`` Application Database StatefulSet
   to enable |onprem| to monitor it.

   .. note::

      This reconciliation step happens only when you enable Monitoring
      for an application database for the first time. This happens most
      often when you deploy a new |onprem| resource.

6. If :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` is **true**, the |k8s-op-short|
   creates the ``<om_resource_name>-backup-daemon`` StatefulSet or
   verifies that it is running. The |k8s-op-short| mounts a |k8s-pv| for
   the head database.

   .. note::

      The Backup Daemon connects to the same Application Database as the
      |onprem| deployment.

7. If :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` is **true**, the |k8s-op-short|
   invokes |onprem| APIs to ensure that the |application|\'s backup
   configuration matches the one that you define in the custom resource
   definition.
