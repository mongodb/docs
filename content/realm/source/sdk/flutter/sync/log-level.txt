.. versionchanged:: 1.1.0: Deprecated in favor of Realm Logger

.. warning::

   This page shows how to set a Sync client log level in Realm Flutter SDK
   versions 1.0.3 and earlier. Realm Flutter SDK v1.1.0 supersedes this 
   logging implementation with a Realm logger you can set and configure
   per-isolate. For information on how to set a Realm logger in a later 
   version, refer to :ref:`flutter-logging`.

You can set the realm sync client log level. You might want to do this
to log different amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

To learn more about all available logging levels, refer to the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmLogLevel documentation <realm/RealmLogLevel-class.html>`.

Set the log level to ``debug`` or ``trace`` to diagnose and troubleshoot errors
while developing your application. For production deployments,
decrease the log level for improved performance.

To configure the log level, set the static property :flutter-sdk:`Realm.logger.level <realm/Realm/logger.html>`
to one of the ``Logger`` levels provided by ``RealmLogLevel``.

You must set the log level **before** you open a synced realm.
