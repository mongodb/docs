You can use {+avs+} with popular AI providers and |llm|\s through
their standard |api|\s. MongoDB and partners also provide 
specific product integrations to help you leverage {+avs+}
in your generative AI and AI-powered applications. 

This page highlights notable AI integrations 
that MongoDB and partners have developed. For a complete 
list of integrations and partner services, 
see :ref:`explore-ecosystem`.

Key Concepts
------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-ai-key-concepts.rst

Frameworks
----------

You can integrate {+avs+} with the following open-source frameworks
to store custom data in |service| and implement |rag| with {+avs+}.

LangChain
~~~~~~~~~

`LangChain <https://langchain.com/>`__ is a framework
that simplifies the creation of |llm| applications
through the use of "chains," which are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined together for a variety of use 
cases, including |rag|.

To get started, see the following tutorials:

- :ref:`langchain`.
- :ref:`langchain-js`.

LlamaIndex
~~~~~~~~~~

`LlamaIndex <https://llamaindex.ai/>`__ is a framework 
that simplifies how you connect custom data sources to |llm|\s. 
It provides several tools to help you load and prepare vector embeddings 
for |rag| applications.

To get started, see :ref:`llamaindex`.

Semantic Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microsoft `Semantic Kernel 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/>`__
is an SDK that allows you to combine various AI services
with your applications. You can use Semantic Kernel for a variety 
of use cases, including |rag|.

To get started, see :ref:`semantic-kernel`.

Services
--------

You can also integrate {+avs+} with the following AI services.

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Amazon Bedrock <https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/>`__ is a fully-managed 
service for building generative AI applications. You can integrate 
{+avs+} as a `knowledge base <https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/>`__
for Amazon Bedrock to store custom data in |service| and implement |rag|.

To get started, see :ref:`amazon-bedrock`.

API Resources
-------------

Refer to the following |api| resources as you develop
with AI integrations for {+avs+}:

- `LangChain Python API Reference <https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/mongodb_api_reference.html>`__
- `LangChain JS/TS API Reference <https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_mongodb.html>`__
- `LlamaIndex API Reference <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/vector_store/mongodb/>`__
- :github:`Semantic Kernel Python API Reference </microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/python/semantic_kernel/connectors/memory/mongodb_atlas/>`
- `Semantic Kernel C# API Reference <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.connectors.mongodb>`__
