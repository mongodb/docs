movePrimary
===========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`sharded cluster`, :dbcommand:`movePrimary` reassigns the
   :term:`primary shard` which holds all un-sharded collections in
   the database.  :dbcommand:`movePrimary` first changes the primary shard in
   the cluster metadata, and then migrates all un-sharded collections to the
   specified :term:`shard`. Use the command with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { movePrimary : "test", to : "shard0001" }

   When the command returns, the database's primary location will
   shift to the designated shard. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command that is only available
   for :program:`mongos` instances.

Considerations
--------------

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Avoid accessing an un-sharded collection during migration.
:dbcommand:`movePrimary` does not prevent reading and writing during its
operation, and such actions yield undefined behavior.

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` may take significant time to complete, and
you should plan for this unavailability.

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` will fail if the destination shard contains a
conflicting collection name.  This may occur if documents are written to an
un-sharded collection while the collection is moved away, and later the original
primary shard is restored.

Use
~~~

If you use the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command to move un-sharded
collections, you must either restart all :program:`mongos` instances,
or use the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command on all
:program:`mongos` instances before writing any data to the
cluster. This action notifies the :program:`mongos` of the new shard
for the database.

If you do not update the :program:`mongos` instances' metadata cache
after using :dbcommand:`movePrimary`, the :program:`mongos` may not
write data to the correct shard. To recover, you must manually
intervene.
