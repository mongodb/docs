title: "Run an |fts| diacritic-insensitive query."
content: |
  This query uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection:

  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-constant-desc.rst 
       
  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-stage.rst

  To run this query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the following 
     pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the dropdown and adding
     the query for that stage. Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add 
     additional stages.

  .. include:: /includes/fts/diacritic-insensitive/tutorial.rst

  If you enabled :guilabel:`Auto Preview`, |compass| displays the 
  following documents next to the ``$project`` pipeline stage:
