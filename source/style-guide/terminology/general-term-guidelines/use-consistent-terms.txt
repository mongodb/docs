Use Consistent Terminology
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted
industry dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project.
Each word or phrase should have only one meaning, and should be used
consistently throughout the documentation.

- Use American English spelling instead of British English spelling.
  
  .. example::

     Use "gray" instead of "grey" and "color" instead of "colour".

- The |mdbsg| uses the *Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary*. 11th
  ed. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 2003. Continually updated at
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/.

-  Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts.

   .. example::
      Don't use *agent* to refer to both a person and a process.

-  If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't
   use it to express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the
   general meaning.

   .. example::

      Use *interface* as a noun that means user interface. Instead of also using *interface* as a verb, use *interact*.

-  Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the
   use of one word for a particular object. Technical writing isn't
   creative writing. You shouldn't be concerned that you will bore
   users with colorless prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a
   precise set of terms consistently is required. Following is a common
   example of multiple terms that refer to the same thing:

   -  menu command *(the preferred term)*
   -  menu item
   -  menu option

-  Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly
   used as a verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as *display*.
   However, using the same word as more than one part of speech in the
   same document can be confusing to users and translators, so avoid
   it when possible.

-  Avoid neologisms. Examples of neologisms (newly invented words) 
   include *marketecture* or *edutainment*. Most of these words are specific 
   to a single business culture and aren't understood in other cultures.

-  Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.

-  Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms
   have similar but distinct meanings and shouldn't be used
   interchangeably.

   .. example::

      -  environment, platform
      -  version, release
      -  panel, screen
      -  window, dialog box
