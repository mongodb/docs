Enabling :guilabel:`Sample Mode` in MongoDB Charts restricts the input
collection to ``1000`` randomly selected documents. To toggle
:guilabel:`Sample Mode`, use the toggle above the
:guilabel:`Data Source` dropdown. The sample mode setting for a chart
persists when the chart is rendered on a dashboard, meaning that if
you enable sample mode when building a chart, the data rendered in the
dashboard will also be sampled.

.. note::

   When sampling mode is enabled and you have specified a
   :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>`, the sample of ``1000``
   documents is taken *before* the filter is applied, meaning there may
   be fewer than ``1000`` documents used to plot the chart.

Use Cases
---------

Consider using sample mode in the following scenarios:

- When drafting a chart and heavily modifying chart options. In this
  situation, sampling mode allows the chart to render quickly during
  the building process. Once you are satisfied with your chart you can
  disable sample mode to have all documents included in your
  final visualization if desired.

- When visualizing a large data source and the chosen data is
  sufficiently aggregated (e.g. showing averages of fields) so
  not all documents are needed to obtain a useful visualization.
  In this case, leaving sample mode enabled for the rendered dashboard
  allows you to retain a useful chart.

.. note::

   Due to the random nature of sampling, when Sample Mode is enabled,
   it is possible your visualizations will change each time the
   chart is loaded.
