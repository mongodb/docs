This section covers configuring a new |service| |global-write-cluster|
for using |global-write|.

Considerations
--------------

- |service| supports enabling Global Writes when deploying an M30 or
  greater sharded cluster.

- Once deployed, you cannot convert a |global-write-cluster| to a
  standard sharded cluster. Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the
  :doc:`/global-clusters` documentation before creating a
  |global-write-cluster|.
