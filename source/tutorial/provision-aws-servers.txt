=========================
Provision a Server on AWS
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to let you provision EC2
servers directly from the MMS interface. When you provision an EC2 server
from MMS, MMS automatically installs the Automation Agent to the server.

Prerequisites
-------------

To provision EC2 servers through MMS, you must have an Amazon Web Services
account that meets the prerequisites described in :ref:`aws-checklist`.

You must also configure the MMS :guilabel:`AWS Settings` in MMS, as
described in :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`.

.. _aws-machine-size:

AWS Machine Size
----------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines are large enough to support your deployment. Give your root
volume at least 25 GB.

MMS does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the "m1.large"
instance. MMS currently allows selection of the AWS Linux or Ubuntu
operating systems for an instance.

   Once you have successfully deployed automation, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-deployments-with-automation` to begin using
   Automation to manage MongoDB deployments.
