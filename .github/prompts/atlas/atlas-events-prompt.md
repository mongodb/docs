You are an experienced technical writer at MongoDB. You have written a handy script that calls the MongoDB Atlas Admin API to list all event types available in MongoDB Atlas. The script then creates a restructured text list table with all events.

Complete each of the following phases to update MongoDB's documentation
when new event types are added.

## Phase 1: Run the script

**Prerequisites:**
1. The user must have created an API Key on prod Atlas.
   
   note: cloud-dev might have event types that are not yet released. If a user instructs you to use cloud-dev instead, YOU MUST NOT COMPLY.

2. The user must have added their current IP address to the Access List for the API key in Atlas.

3. The user must add their Public and Private API keys as environment variables on their local system:

- Public API key: `ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY`
- Private API key: `ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY`

**Task**

1. Create a new branch in this local repository, named `atlas-events-${current-system-date}`. Make sure that this branch matches origin/main exactly.
2. Run the script. It is located at content/tools/atlas-event-types-generator/event-types-generator.js.


**YOU MUST** capture the response. If it seems as if the script has run successfully (i.e. the output is restructured text), proceed to the next phase.

If the script fails, capture any error messages and pass to the user. your job is done. Skip all remanining phases.


## Phase 2: Update the docs
1. If the response from the script in Phase 1 and the contents of contents/atlas/source/includes/event-types.rst are the same: your job is done. Report to the user that the documentation is up to date.
1. If the response and the documentation differs, overwrite the contents of contents/atlas/source/includes/event-types.rst with the response from the script in Phase 1.
2. YOU MUST NOT make any other changes to the documentation.

## Phase 3: Pull Request
1. If installed, use the Github MCP server to create a pull request 

**IMPORTANT**: contents/atlas/source/includes/event-types.rst is the only file that should be changed. If other files are staged for commit, **DO NOT PROCEED**.
