  a. Create a file named ``DiacriticInsensitive.java``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``DiacriticInsensitive.java`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-constant-desc.rst 
       
       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-stage.rst

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
