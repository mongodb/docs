Authentication verifies the identity of a user. The process uses either
something you *have* or something you *know*. You *know* your password.
You *have* an app that gives you a one-time token. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA) uses both.

Considerations
--------------

When enabling |mfa|, |service| requests two forms of identification:
your password and one of the following factors:

- Okta Verify Mobile App
- WebAuthn
- Google Authenticator
- Email
- SMS

Set Up Backup Multi-Factor Authentication Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Enable a minimum of two methods so that you can still access your 
   account if you lose access to one method. 

While you can set up one, some, or all of the available methods, we 
strongly recommend that you set up at least two methods. When |service|
requires |mfa|, it offers you the choice of which method to use. If you 
have less than two methods set up, |service| prompts you to set up 
|mfa| and a backup method at login.

Required Access
---------------

To use |mfa|, an :authrole:`Organization Owner` must enable it for
their organization. All members of that organization must enable
|mfa| for their accounts. Those members who haven't enabled |mfa|
can't access the organization.

Prerequisites
-------------

Disable Legacy Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use :ref:`legacy two-factor authentication
<security-two-factor-auth>`, disable it before setting up |mfa|.

To disable legacy |2fa|, complete the following procedure:

1. Click on your name in the upper right corner of the |service|
   console. A dropdown menu displays.
#. Click :guilabel:`User Preferences`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Legacy 2FA` on the left-hand menu.
#. Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` :guilabel:`Edit`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Okta Verify Mobile App
      :tabid: okta

      Download the Okta Verify app to your
      `iOS <{+ios-store+}/okta-verify/id490179405>`__ or
      `Android <{+play-store+}com.okta.android.auth>`__ device.

   .. tab:: Security Key / Biometric
      :tabid: webauthn

      Install and configure a |fido2| compatible device (like a 
      YubiKey) or operating system feature (like Windows Hello).

      .. note::

         |fido2| compatibility varies. It depends on your platform
         and browser. Consult `Okta's documentation <https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa-webauthn.htm#WebAuthn2>`__
         before choosing this method.

   .. tab:: Authenticator App
      :tabid: authapp

      Download an Authenticator App (for example, Google Authenticator 
      or Microsoft Authenticator) to your iOS or Android device.

   .. tab:: Email
      :tabid: email

      1. Verify the email address you used to sign up for your MongoDB
         account.

      2. Verify that this email address can receive email from the
         ``mongodb.com`` domain.

   .. tab:: SMS
      :tabid: sms

      Verify that your mobile phone account allows |sms| messages.
