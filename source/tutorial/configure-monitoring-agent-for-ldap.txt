Considerations
--------------

You must configure LDAP authentication separately for each agent.
See: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap` for
configuration instructions for the Backup Agent.

You can configure LDAP authentication when adding a host or by editing
an existing host. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group` for instructions.

Procedures
----------

Create User in MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To monitor MongoDB 2.6+ instances that are using LDAP authentication,
add a user that possess the required roles to the ``$external`` database
in MongoDB. The ``$external`` database allows :program:`mongod` to
consult an external source, such as an LDAP server, to authenticate.
