Logging - Node.js SDK

You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different
amounts of data depending on the app's environment. You can specify 
different log levels or custom loggers.

   This page shows how to set a Realm logger, which was added
   in Realm Node.js SDK v12.0.0. This supersedes setting the Sync client 
   log level in earlier versions of the Realm Node.js SDK. For information 
   on how to set the Sync client log level in an earlier version, refer to
   :ref:`node-client-log-level`.

.. _node-set-the-client-log-level:

Set or Change the Realm Log Level
---------------------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by the Realm Node.js SDK. To configure
the log level, pass :js-sdk:`Realm.setLogLevel() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogLevel>`
to a valid level string value:

- "all" 
- "trace" 
- "debug" 
- "detail" 
- "info" 
- "warn" 
- "error" 
- "fatal"
- "off"

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/logger.test.snippet.set-log-level.ts
   :language: typescript

You can set different log levels to increase or decrease verbosity at different
points in your code. This behavior differs from the deprecated 
:ref:`sync client log level <node-client-log-level>`, which had to be set
before opening a synced realm and could not be changed.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/logger.test.snippet.change-log-level.ts
   :language: typescript

.. _node-customize-logger:

Customize the Logger
--------------------

To set a custom logger, call :js-sdk:`setLogger() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogger>`.
This method recieves ``level`` and ``message`` arguments from the Realm logger.
You can use these arguments to define your own logging behavior.

      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/logger.test.snippet.set-custom-logger.js
        :language: javascript

This sets the logging behavior for all Realm logging in your application. If you
do not provide a log level, the default value is "info".

.. _node-turn-off-logging:

Turn Off Logging
----------------

You can turn off logging by setting the log level to ``RealmLogLevel.off``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/logger.test.snippet.disable-logger.ts
   :language: typescript

Performance and console.log()
-----------------------------

You should avoid using ``console.log()`` in production because it will negatively
affect your app's performance. It can also be hard to account for all of the
method's quirks in Node.js.

For details about ``console.log()`` behavior, check out the `Node.js docs
<https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#a-note-on-process-io>`__.
