Overview
--------

By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client
has exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped
collections </core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable
Cursor* that remains open after the client exhausts the results in the
initial cursor. Tailable cursors are conceptually equivalent to the
``tail`` Unix command with the ``-f`` option (i.e. with "follow"
mode.) After clients insert new additional documents into a capped
collection, the tailable cursor will continue to retrieve
documents.

Use tailable cursors on capped collections with high numbers of write
operations for which an index would be too expensive. For instance,
MongoDB :doc:`replication </core/replication>` uses tailable cursors to
tail the primary's :term:`oplog`.

.. note::

   If your query is on an indexed field, do not use tailable cursors,
   but instead, use a regular cursor. Keep track of the last value of
   the indexed field returned by the query. To retrieve the newly
   added documents, query the collection again using the last value of
   the indexed field in the query criteria, as in the following
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.<collection>.find( { indexedField: { $gt: <lastvalue> } } )

Consider the following behaviors related to tailable cursors:

- Tailable cursors do not use indexes and return documents in
  :term:`natural order`.

- Because tailable cursors do not use indexes, the initial scan for the
  query may be expensive; but, after initially exhausting the cursor,
  subsequent retrievals of the newly added documents are inexpensive.

- Tailable cursors may become *dead*, or invalid, if either:

  - the query returns no match.

  - the cursor returns the document at the "end" of the collection and
    then the application deletes that document.

  A *dead* cursor has an id of ``0``.

See your :doc:`driver documentation </applications/drivers>` for the
driver-specific method to specify the tailable cursor. For more
information on the details of specifying a tailable cursor, see
:meta-driver:`MongoDB wire protocol </legacy/mongodb-wire-protocol>`
documentation.

C++ Example
-----------

The ``tail`` function uses a tailable cursor to output the results from
a query to a capped collection:

- The function handles the case of the dead cursor by having the query
  be inside a loop.

- To periodically check for new data, the ``cursor->more()`` statement
  is also inside a loop.

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "client/dbclient.h"

   using namespace mongo;

   /*
    * Example of a tailable cursor.
    * The function "tails" the capped collection (ns) and output elements as they are added.
    * The function also handles the possibility of a dead cursor by tracking the field 'insertDate'.
    * New documents are added with increasing values of 'insertDate'.
    */

   void tail(DBClientBase& conn, const char *ns) {

       BSONElement lastValue = minKey.firstElement();

       Query query = Query().hint( BSON( "$natural" << 1 ) );

       while ( 1 ) {
           auto_ptr<DBClientCursor> c =
               conn.query(ns, query, 0, 0, 0,
                          QueryOption_CursorTailable | QueryOption_AwaitData );

           while ( 1 ) {
               if ( !c->more() ) {

                   if ( c->isDead() ) {
                       break;
                   }

                   continue;
               }

               BSONObj o = c->next();
               lastValue = o["insertDate"];
               cout << o.toString() << endl;
           }

           query = QUERY( "insertDate" << GT << lastValue ).hint( BSON( "$natural" << 1 ) );
       }
   }

The ``tail`` function performs the following actions:

- Initialize the ``lastValue`` variable, which tracks the last
  accessed value. The function will use the ``lastValue`` if the
  cursor becomes *invalid* and ``tail`` needs to restart the
  query. Use :method:`~cursor.hint()` to ensure that the query uses
  the :operator:`$natural` order.

- In an outer ``while(1)`` loop,

  - Query the capped collection and return a tailable cursor that
    blocks for several seconds waiting for new documents

    .. code-block:: cpp

       auto_ptr<DBClientCursor> c =
            conn.query(ns, query, 0, 0, 0,
                       QueryOption_CursorTailable | QueryOption_AwaitData );

    - Specify the capped collection using ``ns`` as an argument
      to the function.

    - Set the ``QueryOption_CursorTailable`` option to create a
      tailable cursor.

    - Set the ``QueryOption_AwaitData`` option so that the returned
      cursor blocks for a few seconds to wait for data.

  - In an inner ``while (1)`` loop, read the documents from the cursor:

    - If the cursor has no more documents and is not invalid, loop the
      inner ``while`` loop to recheck for more documents.

    - If the cursor has no more documents and is dead, break the inner
      ``while`` loop.

    - If the cursor has documents:

      - output the document,

      - update the ``lastValue`` value,

      - and loop the inner ``while (1)`` loop to recheck for more
        documents.

  - If the logic breaks out of the inner ``while (1)`` loop and the
    cursor is invalid:

    - Use the ``lastValue`` value to create a new query condition that
      matches documents added after the ``lastValue``. Explicitly
      ensure ``$natural`` order with the ``hint()`` method:

      .. code-block:: cpp

         query = QUERY( "insertDate" << GT << lastValue ).hint( BSON( "$natural" << 1 ) );

    - Loop through the outer ``while (1)`` loop to re-query with the new query
      condition and repeat.
