     * - Status
       - Description

     * - Not configured
       - |service| created the network load balancer and |vpc| endpoint 
         service, but |aws| hasn't yet created the :term:`interface endpoint`.
         Click :guilabel:`Edit` and complete the wizard to create the
         interface endpoint.

     * - Pending acceptance
       - |aws| has received the connection request from your 
         :term:`interface endpoint` to the |service| |vpc| endpoint 
         service.
       
     * - Pending
       - |aws| is establishing the connection between your
         :term:`interface endpoint` and the |service| |vpc| endpoint 
         service.

     * - Failed
       - |aws| failed to establish a connection between |service| 
         |vpc| resources and the :term:`interface endpoint` in your |vpc|. 
         Click :guilabel:`Edit`, verify that the information you 
         provided is correct, and then create the private endpoint 
         again.

         .. important::

            If your Interface Endpoint fails, you might see
            the following message:

            .. example::

               No dns entries found for endpoint vpce-<guid>, 
               your endpoint must be provisioned in at least one subnet 
               Click "Edit" to fix the problem.

            This message indicated that you didn't specify
            a subnet when you created the {+aws-pl+}
            connection. To resolve this error:
            
            1. Click :guilabel:`Edit`. 
            #. Click :guilabel:`Back`. 
            #. Specify at least one subnet.
            #. Follow the remaining instructions to create
               the {+aws-pl+} connection.

     * - Available
       - |service| |vpc| resources are connected to the :term:`interface endpoint` 
         in your |vpc|. You can connect to |service| clusters in this
         region using {+aws-pl+}.

     * - Deleting
       - |service| is removing the interface endpoint from the private
         endpoint service.

  a. For each resource that needs to connect to your |service| clusters
     using {+aws-pl+}, the resource's security group must allow
     outbound traffic to the :term:`interface endpoint's <interface
     endpoint>` private IP(s) on all ports.

     See :aws:`Adding Rules to a Security Group </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>`
     for more information.

  #. Your :term:`interface endpoint` security group must allow inbound
     traffic on all ports from each resource that needs to connect to
     your |service| clusters using {+aws-pl+}.

     :aws:`Whitelist instance IP addresses or security groups </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule>`
     to allow traffic from them to reach the
     :term:`interface endpoint` security group.
