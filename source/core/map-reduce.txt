Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes
of data into useful *aggregated* results. For map-reduce operations,
MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` database command.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-map-reduce-deprecation.rst

Consider the following map-reduce operation:

.. include:: /images/map-reduce.rst

In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each
input document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the
query condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those
keys that have multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which
collects and condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results
in a collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may
pass through a *finalize* function to further condense or process the
results of the aggregation.

All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run
within the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the
documents of a single :term:`collection` as the *input* and can perform
any arbitrary sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage.
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` can return the results of a map-reduce operation
as a document, or may write the results to collections.

.. note::

   For most aggregation operations, the
   :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline` provides better performance and
   more coherent interface. However, map-reduce operations provide
   some flexibility that is not presently available in the aggregation
   pipeline.

Map-Reduce JavaScript Functions
-------------------------------

In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom JavaScript functions to
*map*, or associate, values to a key. If a key has multiple values
mapped to it, the operation *reduces* the values for the key to a
single object.

The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to
map-reduce operations. For instance, when processing a document, the
map function can create more than one key and value mapping or no
mapping. Map-reduce operations can also use a custom JavaScript
function to make final modifications to the results at the end of the
map and reduce operation, such as perform additional calculations.

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.2.1, MongoDB deprecates the use of BSON type
   JavaScript code with scope (:doc:`BSON type 15
   </reference/bson-types/>`) for the ``map``, ``reduce``, and
   ``finalize`` functions. Using JavaScript code with scope with these
   functions will print a warning to the log. Instead, use BSON type
   String (:doc:`BSON type 2 </reference/bson-types/>`) or BSON type
   JavaScript (:doc:`BSON type 13 </reference/bson-types/>`). To pass
   constant values which will be accessible in the ``map``, ``reduce``,
   and ``finalize`` functions, use the ``scope`` parameter.

    
Map-Reduce Results
-------------------

In MongoDB, the map-reduce operation can write results to a collection
or return the results inline. If you write map-reduce output to a
collection, you can perform subsequent map-reduce operations on the
same input collection that merge replace, merge, or reduce new results
with previous results. See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and
:doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce` for details and
examples.

When returning the results of a map-reduce operation *inline*, the
result documents must be within the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit,
which is currently 16 megabytes. For additional information on limits
and restrictions on map-reduce operations, see the
:doc:`/reference/command/mapReduce` reference page.

Sharded Collections
-------------------

MongoDB supports map-reduce operations on :doc:`sharded collections
</sharding>`.

However, starting in version 4.2, MongoDB deprecates the map-reduce
option to *create* a new sharded collection and the use of the
``sharded`` option for map-reduce. To output to a sharded collection,
create the sharded collection first. MongoDB 4.2 also deprecates the
replacement of an existing sharded collection.

See :doc:`/core/map-reduce-sharded-collections`.
