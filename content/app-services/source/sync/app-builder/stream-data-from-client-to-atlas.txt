Stream Data Unidirectionally from a Client to Atlas

If you have a mobile or client application that produces a large volume of 
data you'd like to stream to MongoDB Atlas, you can sync data unidirectionally
using Device Sync. We call the feature that enables this unidirectional sync
**Data Ingest**.

You might want to sync data unidirectionally in IoT applications, such as 
a weather sensor sending data to the cloud. Data Ingest is also useful 
for writing other types of immutable data where you do not require conflict 
resolution, such as creating invoices from a retail app or logging 
application events.

Data Ingest is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy 
client-side *insert-only* workloads. You cannot read this data from the
realm where you're streaming it.

Currently Data Ingest is only available for the following Realm SDKs:

- C++ SDK
- .NET SDK
- Kotlin SDK
- Node.js SDK
- React Native SDK
- Swift SDK

Follow these high-level steps to get started:

Set up Atlas Access
-------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create an Atlas App Services App

      The App Services application is the gateway that enables your client 
      device to connect to MongoDB Atlas. When you create an App, you name
      it, link it to an Atlas cluster, and specify the deployment model and
      deployment region that work best for your application.

      To learn how to create an App Services App, see :ref:`Create an
      App <create-app>`.

   .. step:: Configure Device Sync and Data Ingest

      Device Sync is the service that synchronizes data to Atlas 
      and across your client devices. Device Sync, together with the
      Realm SDKs, automatically manages network connectivity, user 
      permissions, and conflict resolution. The App Services app provides 
      the built-in user authentication that Device Sync and the Realm SDKs
      leverage to secure your data.

      When you configure Device Sync, you specify the data source that the 
      client devices can access as well as the permissions that determine
      what data a user can write. 

      You can configure Device Sync via the :ref:`Atlas UI, the Atlas App 
      Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API 
      <enable-flexible-sync>`. The first time you configure Device Sync, 
      you may find it helpful to use the Atlas UI as it provides links and 
      information about various settings and options.
      
      To enable Data Ingest for one or more collections, you select 
      the collection or collections in the :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration` 
      section of your Device Sync configuration. Only collections with 
      an :ref:`App Services Schema <schemas>` are available to select in 
      this drop-down.
      
      If you have not yet created a schema for the collection that you 
      want to sync unidirectionally, you can either:

      - Generate an App Services schema from your Realm object model. 
        Refer to: :ref:`create-schema-from-rom`.
      - Manually create an App Services Schema. For more information, refer 
        to: :ref:`enforce-a-schema`.

   .. step:: Enable an Authentication Provider

      Your client devices must authenticate in order to access synced data.
      App Services provides several authentication providers, such as 
      email/password or anonymous authentication, to enable your users 
      to authenticate. Configure one or more of these authentication
      providers to enable authentication in your client application.

      You can configure authentication providers within the App Services App 
      UI by selecting :guilabel:`Authentication` in the left navigation menu, 
      and then click a provider to configure it. You can also configure 
      authentication providers by editing the App Services configuration 
      with the :ref:`Atlas App Services Command Line Interface 
      <appconfig-auth>`, or the `App Services Admin API 
      <{+base-url+}{+admin-api-page+}tag/authproviders>`__.

Add Sync to the Client Application
----------------------------------

After this, you've got everything set up that you need on the Atlas side,
and you can prepare your client application to sync data unidirectionally.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Connect the client to an App Services backend

      In your client application code, initialize an App client to connect
      your client to your App Services backend. This lets your client use
      App Services features like authentication, and enables opening a 
      synced realm.

      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services Backend - C++ SDK <cpp-connect-to-backend>`
      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services Backend - .NET SDK <dotnet-init-appclient>`
      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-connect-to-backend>`
      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services Backend - Node.js SDK <node-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app>`
      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services Backend - React Native SDK <react-native-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app>`
      - :ref:`Connect to an Atlas App Services backend - Swift SDK <ios-init-appclient>`

   .. step:: Authenticate a User

      Your client application user must be authenticated with the App Services
      backend in order to write synchronized data. Add logic to your 
      client app to register and log in users.

      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - C++ SDK <cpp-authenticate-users>`
      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - .NET SDK <dotnet-authenticate>`
      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-authenticate-users>`
      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - Node.js SDK <node-authenticate-users>`
      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - React Native SDK <react-native-authenticate-users>`
      - :ref:`Authenticate Users - Swift SDK <ios-authenticate-users>`

   .. step:: Open a Synced Realm

      Once you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced 
      instance of Realm Database to use for that user. Because Asymmetric
      Sync is write-only, you cannot define a Flexible Sync query to read 
      data on the device. This differs from bidirectional Flexible Sync, 
      where you would create a query subscription to determine what data 
      to sync to the device.

      - :ref:`Open a Synced Realm - C++ SDK <cpp-open-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Open a Synced Realm - .NET SDK <dotnet-configure-and-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Configure & Open a Synced Realm - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Open a Synced Realm - Node.js SDK <node-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Configure & Open a Synced Realm - React Native SDK <react-native-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Configure & Open a Synced Realm - Swift SDK <ios-configure-and-open-a-synced-realm>`

   .. step:: Create Asymmetric Objects and Write Data

      The Realm SDKs provide a special type of object to use with 
      Data Ingest: an Asymmetric Object. Refer to the Realm SDK 
      documentation for details on how to define Asymmetric Objects.

      Create and write Asymmetric Objects to a synced realm, and 
      the Realm SDKs use Device Sync manage the process of streaming the 
      data automatically. When the device has a network connection, the 
      SDKs stream data to the App Services backend and into Atlas. When
      the device does not have a network connection, the data persists on
      the device and automatically uploads when the network connection is 
      restored.

      Atlas Device Sync completely manages the lifecycle of this data. 
      It is maintained on the device until Data Ingest synchronization is 
      complete, and then removed from the device.
