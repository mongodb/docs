.. dbcommand:: group

   The :dbcommand:`group` command returns an array of grouped items. :dbcommand:`group`
   provides functionality analogous to the ``GROUP BY`` statement in
   SQL. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.runCommand( { group:
                             { key: { school_id: true },
                               cond: { active: 1 },
                               reduce: function(obj, prev) { obj.total += 1; },
                               initial: { total: 0 }
                              } } );

   More typically, in the :program:`mongo` shell, you will call the
   :dbcommand:`group` command using the :method:`group()`
   method. Consider the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.group( { key: { school_id: true },
                        cond: { active: 1 },
                        reduce: function(obj, prev) { obj.total += 1; },
                        initial: { total: 0 }
                       } );

   In these examples :dbcommand:`group` runs against the collection
   ``users`` and counts the total number of active users from each
   school. Fields allowed by the group command include:

   :field document key: Specify one or more fields to group by. Use the
                        form of a :term:`document`.

   :field reduce: Specify a reduce function that operates over all the
                  iterated objects. Typically these aggregator
                  functions perform some sort of summing or
                  counting. The reduce function takes two arguments:
                  the current document and an aggregation counter
                  object.

   :field initial: The starting value of the aggregation counter
                   object.

   :field keyf: Optional. A function that returns a "key
                object" for use as the grouping key. Use
                ``keyf`` instead of ``key`` to specify a key
                that is not a single/multiple existing
                fields. For example, use ``keyf`` to group by
                day or week in place of a fixed ``key``.

   :field cond: Optional. A statement that must evaluate to true for
                the :method:`db.collection.group()` to process this
                document. Essentially this argument specifies
                a query document (as for
                :method:`db.collection.find()`). Unless specified,
                :method:`db.collection.group()` runs the "reduce" function
                against all documents in the collection.

   :field finalize: Optional. A function that runs each item
                    in the result set before
                    :method:`db.collection.group()` returns the final
                    value. This function can either modify
                    the document by computing and adding an
                    average field, or return compute and
                    return a new document.

   .. note::

      The result set of the :method:`db.collection.group()` must fit
      within the size :ref:`maximum BSON document
      <limit-bson-document-size>`. Furthermore, you must ensure that
      there are fewer then 10,000 unique keys. If you have more than
      this, use :dbcommand:`mapReduce`.

   .. warning::

      :method:`group()` does not work in :term:`shard environments
      <shard cluster>`. Use the :term:`aggregation framework` or
      :term:`map-reduce` (i.e. :command:`mapReduce` in :term:`sharded
      environments <sharding>`.
