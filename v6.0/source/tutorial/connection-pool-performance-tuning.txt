   * - Problem

     - Solution

   * - Slow application-side operation times that are not reflected in 
       the database :doc:`server logs </reference/log-messages>` or the
       real time panel.
  
     - Use :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to ensure the driver does not 
       wait indefinitely during the connection phase.

       Set :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to a value greater than the 
       longest network latency you have to a member of the set. 
       
       For example: if a member has a latency of 10000 milliseconds, 
       setting :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` to ``5000`` 
       (milliseconds) prevents the driver from connecting to that 
       member.

   * - A misconfigured firewall closes a socket connection incorrectly
       and the driver cannot detect that the connection closed 
       improperly. 

     - Use :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to ensure that sockets are 
       always closed. 

       Set :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to two or three times the 
       length of the slowest operation that the driver runs.
     
   * - The :doc:`server logs </reference/log-messages>` or real time panel
       show that the application spends too much time creating new 
       connections.

     - Not enough connections are available at startup. 
       Allocate connections in the pool by setting 
       :urioption:`minPoolSize`. 
       
       Set :ref:`minPoolSize <minpoolsize-cp-setting>` to the number 
       of connections you want to be available at startup.
       
       The ``MongoClient`` instance ensures that number of 
       connections exists at all times. 

   * - The load on the database is low and there's a small number of 
       active connections at any time. Application performs fewer 
       operations at any one time than expected. 

     - Increase :ref:`maxPoolSize <maxpoolsize-cp-setting>`, or increase 
       the number of active threads in your application or the framework 
       you are using. 

   * - Database CPU usage is higher than expected. The 
       :doc:`server logs </reference/log-messages>` or real time panel
       show more connection attempts than expected.
     
     - Decrease the :ref:`maxPoolSize <maxpoolsize-cp-setting>` or 
       reduce the number of threads in your application. This can reduce 
       load and response times.

.. warning::

   Do not use :urioption:`socketTimeoutMS` to prevent long-running 
   server operations. Instead, use :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS` with 
   queries so that the server can cancel long-running operations.
       

Calculate Maximum Number of Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate usage to find the number of operations running for each
connection.

Consider four application servers connecting to a replica set with three
members. In this scenario, each of the four application servers
creates a connection pool for each replica set member.

Calculate the maximum number of connections that are opened by 
each application server by multiplying :urioption:`maxPoolSize` by the 
number of members.  

Calculate outgoing connections from an application to a three-member 
replica set:

**100** (:urioption:`maxPoolSize` default ``100``) x **3** (replica set members) = **300** (outgoing connections from the application).

Calculate incoming connections from four application servers to a 
replica set:

**100** (:urioption:`maxPoolSize` default ``100``) x **4** (application servers) = **400** (incoming connections to each mongod).
