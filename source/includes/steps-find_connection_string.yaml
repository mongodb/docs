  In the :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step in the modal
  window, check to make sure your IP address is
  in the whitelist for Atlas connections. If it is not, add it.

  The following Atlas screenshot shows the options for adding IP
  addresses in the Atlas UI:

  If your cluster already has one or more IP Whitelist entries you
  will not have access to the button to add your IP address in the
  modal. Instead, use the following procedure to add your IP address
  to the whitelist:
  
  1. Exit the modal window.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Security` tab in the Atlas UI.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`IP Whitelist` tab.

  #. Click the green :guilabel:`Add IP Address` button.

  #. Add your IP address.

  #. Return to the Clusters :guilabel:`Overview` tab.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button and proceed.

  For more information on whitelisting IP addresses, see
  `Configure Whitelist Entries
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-whitelist/>`_
  in the Atlas documentation.
