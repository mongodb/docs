Configure Worker Roles in Azure
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The following are the configuration options available as part of the
MongoDB Worker Role.

MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDBRole configuration
----------------------------------------------

- ``Configuration`` tab

  - ``.Net Trust Level``: Ensure this is set to ``Full Trust``.

  - ``Instance count``: Set to the number of replica set members you
    require. Default is ``3``. Setting this to ``1`` would run a replica set
    with 1 instance (equivalent to stand alone).

  - ``VM Size``: Choose size of ``Medium`` or higher. The I/O
    characteristics of small or extra small instance make these
    configurations unsuitable for MongoDB.

- ``Settings`` tab

  - ``MongoDBDataDir``: Storage for MongoDB data files ``--dbpath``.
    Configure for development or deployment. Data files are in a
    subdirectory called ``data``. Default is local DevStorage.

  - ``MongoDBDataDirSizeMB``: Size of blob (in megabytes) allocated for
    MongoDB data directory. Default is 1 GB for the emulator and 100 GB
    for deployed.

  - ``ReplicaSetName``: Name of the MongoDB replica set. Default is ``rs``.
    This also serves as the blob container name.

  - ``MongoDBLogVerbosity``: Verbosity with which to start
    :program:`mongod`. Default is ``null``.

  - ``RecycleOnExit``: This dictates whether the worker role is recycled
    when MongoDB exits. Default is ``false``. Hence if the
    :program:`mongod` process exits, the worker role instance is still
    up.

  - ``Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString``:
    Storage for diagnostics information.

    The following image shows the settings required in a local context.

- ``Endpoints`` tab

  - ``MongodPort``: Port on which :program:`mongod` listens. Default is
    ``27017``. If running locally on the Azure emulator, this is port
    for the first instance that is started.

- Local Storage

  - ``MongoDBLocalDataDir``: This specifies the size of the local
    storage used as a cache for the Windows Azure Drive used as the
    MongoDB data directory. Larger sizes provide better read performance.

  - ``MongodLogDir``: Size of storage allocated for ``mongod.log``. Make
    this large enough depending on verbosity chosen and instance size.

    Use the default settings for local storage as specified below when
    running on the Azure emulator. When deploying to Azure, change local
    storage size based on instance size chosen.

  - ``BackupDriveCache``: Size of local storage used as cache during the
    backup process.
