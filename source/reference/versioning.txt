MongoDB Versioning
==================

.. important:: 

   Always upgrade to the latest stable revision of your release series.

MongoDB versioning has the form ``X.Y.Z`` where ``X.Y`` refers to the
release series and ``Z`` refers to the patch number.

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, MongoDB is released as two different release
series:

- Major Releases
- Rapid Releases

Major Releases
--------------

Major Releases are made available approximately once a year, and
generally mark the introduction of new features and improvements that
may break backwards compatibility. Major Releases are appropriate for
all MongoDB deployments.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0``
- ``6.0``

Rapid Releases
--------------

Rapid Releases are made available approximately once each quarter
that does not contain a Major Release, and generally mark the
introduction of new features and improvements. Rapid Releases are
designed for use with `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_server>`_, and are not
generally supported for use in an on-premise capacity. Rapid Releases
are not available for use with `MongoDB Ops Manager
<https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/?tck=docs_server>`_, and
are not supported for :ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>`. If
arbiters are part of your MongoDB deployment, use the most recent
Major Release instead.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.1``
- ``5.2``
- ``5.3``

Patch Releases
--------------

Patch Releases are made available as needed to both
Major Releases and Rapid Releases, and generally
include bug fixes and backwards-compatible changes.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.1`` (a Major Release patch version)
- ``5.2.1`` (a Rapid Release patch version)

Release Candidate (RC) Releases
-------------------------------

In advance of new Major Releases or Rapid Releases, Release Candidates
are made available for early testing. A Release Candidate represents a
version of the upcoming release that is stable enough to begin testing,
but is not suitable for production deployment.

*Example versions:*

- ``5.0.0-rc0``
- ``5.0.0-rc1``
- ``5.1.2-rc5``

Driver Versions
---------------

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the :ecosystem:`MongoDB drivers </drivers>`.

MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
---------------------------

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, the `MongoDB Shell
<https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/>`__ (``mongosh``) is released
separately from the MongoDB Server, and uses its own version numbering
system.

Database Tools
--------------

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the `MongoDB Database Tools
<https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools>`__ are released separately
from the MongoDB Server, and use their own version numbering system.
