Starting in version 1.39.2, |compass| no longer supports migrating from legacy 
connection files that pre-date version 1.31.0. Legacy connections refer to an 
internal |compass-short| connection-options format that is stored on disk and no 
longer supported after version 1.39.0. 
    
If you have legacy connections saved in your favorites, export the 
connections on `version 1.39.0 
<https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass/releases/tag/v1.39.0>`_ to convert them 
into the new format before updating to version 1.39.2 or later.
