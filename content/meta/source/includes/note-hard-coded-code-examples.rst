.. note:: Avoid Hard-Coded Code Blocks for Code Examples

   To support continuously tested code examples in our docs, prefer
   linking to the generated code file by using ``literalinclude`` or
   ``io-code-block`` directives instead of hard-coding a code example
   on the page by using ``code-block``. See also :ref:`code-examples`.
