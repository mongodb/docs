You can configure |service| to send metric data about your project to
your |datadog| dashboards.

.. note::

   If you configure your |service| project to send alerts and events
   to Datadog, you do not need to follow this procedure. |service|
   sends project metrics to Datadog through the same integration used
   to send :ref:`alerts and events <notification-options>`.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| integration is available only on ``M10+`` clusters.

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have a Datadog account
and a Datadog |api| key. Datadog grants you an |api| key when you first
create a Datadog account.

If you do not have an existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
`<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To configure an |service| integration with |datadog|:

Performance Metrics Available to Datadog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| tracks the following metric data for your |service|
cluster. The metric names in parentheses are the names used in
the Datadog :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`. Datadog measures each metric
once per minute.

.. note::
   
   The ``clustername`` tag identifies the |service| cluster associated 
   with the metric.
