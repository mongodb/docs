Overview
--------

Additional Snapshot Stores can be added to meet storage requirements.
These additional stores can be deployed in the same data center as the
first store. There are times where these stores need to be deployed to
other data centers due to either network performance issues or
regulatory requirements.

You can bind specific |onprem| :opsmgr:`projects </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>` to specific
snapshot stores and particular data centers. This assigns the backups
of particular MongoDB deployments to specific data centers.

.. note:: 

   You can bind only projects to specific snapshot stores or 
   data centers. You cannot bind shards to a specific location.

This tutorial sets up two snapshot stores, one in each of two separate
data centers, and attaches a separate project to each.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Configure the two |application| instances to share a single dedicated
  :ref:`mms-application-database`.

  * The members of the |application| Database replica set can be put in
    each data center.

* Configure each {+bagent+} to use the URL for its local
  |application|.

  * Each |application| can use a different hostname or a split-horizon
    DNS to point each agent to its local |application|.

.. note::

   The |application| Database and the backup blockstore databases are
   MongoDB databases and can run as :term:`standalones <standalone>` or
   :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

   For production deployments, use replica sets to provide database
   :manual:`high availability </core/replica-set-high-availability>`.

Procedures
----------

Provision Servers in Each Data Center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each data center must host its own :term:`backup blockstore database`
or File System Store, :ref:`application` and
:doc:`{+mdbagent+} with Backup </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>`.

Each server must meet the cumulative hardware and software requirements
for the components it runs. See :doc:`/core/requirements`.

All servers running Backup and |application| Databases use MongoDB.
They must meet the configuration requirements in the :manual:`MongoDB
Production Notes </administration/production-notes>`.

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install MongoDB on the servers that host the:

- |application| database
- Blockstore databases

See :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation>` in the MongoDB manual to
find the correct install procedure for your operating system.

To run replica sets for the |application| database and blockstore
databases, see :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set
</tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` in the MongoDB manual.

Install and Start the |application|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the |application| in each data center.

.. note::

   See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-application` for instructions for
   your operating system.

.. important::
   
   Each set of installation instructions for each operating system
   covers how to create a multiple instances of an |application|. These
   activities need to be completed before binding projects to the backup
   resources.

Bind Projects to Backup Resources
