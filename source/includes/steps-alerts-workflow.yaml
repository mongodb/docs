  - For informational alerts like the 
    ``User joined the organization``. 
    alert, |mms| sends notifications as soon as the condition is 
    met. These alerts don't appear in the |mms| UI. The 
    informational alerts workflow ends here.

  - Otherwise, |mms| retrieves metrics at regular intervals 
    based on granularity. When the retrieved metrics indicate that 
    an alert condition is met, |mms| tracks the alert condition 
    until it ends, or until it remains past the amount of time 
    specified in the :guilabel:`send if condition lasts at least` 
    field.

    .. note::

       If the alert condition ends between sampling periods, 
       |mms| doesn't track the alert condition or send any 
       notifications.

  |mms| sends notifications. The alerts appear on the

  The following stages might occur:

  - You :ref:`acknowledge the alert <acknowledge-alert>`. |mms| 
    sends no further notifications until either the acknowledgement 
    period ends, you resolve the alert condition, or you 
    unacknowledge the alert. If an alert condition ends during an 
    acknowledgment period, |mms| sends a notification.

  - You :ref:`unacknowledge an alert <unacknowledge-alert>` that 
    you previously acknowledged. After you unacknowledge an active 
    alert, |mms| resumes sending notifications at regular 
    intervals until the condition resolves or you delete, disable, 
    or re-acknowledge the alert.

  - You :ref:`disable the alert <disable-enable-alert-setting>`. 
    |mms| cancels active alerts related to the setting. A disabled 
    alert setting remains visible but grayed-out and you can later 
    re-enable it.

  - You :ref:`enable an alert <disable-enable-alert-setting>` that 
    you previously disabled.

  - You :ref:`delete the alert <delete-alert-setting>`. |mms| 
    cancels active alerts related to the setting. A deleted alert 
    setting does not remain visible.

  - The alert condition resolves. The alert appears on the 
    :guilabel:`All Alerts` tab (organization alerts) or the 
    :guilabel:`Closed Alerts` tab (project alerts).
