Failed Rolling Upgrade
----------------------

To recover from a failed rolling upgrade follow these steps in the
following order:

1. Restart your |onprem| instances.

#. Check to see if you have upgraded *all* |onprem| hosts that support
   your |onprem| instance.

   If |onprem| detects two running versions, it remains in **Upgrade
   Mode**. Stop the |application| on the host running an earlier
   version, upgrade that host, then restart that host.

#. Restore the Application Database to a previous state after the
   upgrade process had started, but before it has completed.

   a. Copy of all the |onprem| log files.
   b. Stop all |onprem| instances including backup daemons.
   c. Restore the Application Database to a backup taken before the
      upgrade was started.
   d. Reinstall the previous version of |onprem|.
   e. Restart all |onprem| instances.
   f. Contact MongoDB Support and provide all details.

#. Leave |onprem| in **Upgrade Mode** and
   :website:`contact MongoDB Support </contact>`.

   - If migrations cannot be applied, |onprem| remains in Upgrade Mode.
   - If you can accept your |onprem| instance in this state within the
     bounds of your |sla|, contact MongoDB Support and provide details of the problem
