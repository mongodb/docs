This document provides advice for troubleshooting problems with
{+avs+}.  For direct assistance with {+avs+} issues, you can either
start a discussion on the `MongoDB Developer Community
<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/c/atlas/vector-search/168>`__
or :ref:`contact support <request-support>`.

Cannot use the ``$vectorSearch`` stage on {+service+} {+cluster+}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To use the ``$vectorSearch`` pipeline stage to query your {+cluster+},
your {+cluster+} must run MongoDB 6.0.11+ or 7.0.2+. If you invoke
``$vectorSearch`` on an incompatible version of MongoDB, you might see
the following error:

.. code-block:: sh

   OperationFailure: $vectorSearch is not allowed with the current
   configuration. You may need to enable the corresponding feature
   flag.

To check the MongoDB version of your {+cluster+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Locate the information pane of the {+cluster+} you want
      to use ``$vectorSearch`` on.

   .. step:: Consult the :guilabel:`Version` number in the bottom section
      of the information pane.

If your {+cluster+} runs a version of MongoDB earlier than 6.0.11 or
7.0.2, you must :ref:`upgrade the MongoDB version of the cluster
<scale-cluster-version>`.

Slow queries
------------

For recommendations on improving query performance, see
:ref:`avs-performance-tuning`.

``$vectorSearch`` returns no results
------------------------------------

If ``$vectorSearch`` queries return no results, ensure that you use the
same text embedding model to embed both your data and your query. If
you embed your query using a different model than you use to embed
your data, ``$vectorSearch`` can't identify matches.

``Error during document retrieval`` when using filtering with LangChain
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use LangChain to perform |rag| with pre-filtering, you might
encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: js

   Error during the document retrieval or generation process:
   MongoServerError: PlanExecutor error during aggregation :: caused
   by :: Path 'field' needs to be indexed as token

If an index on ``field`` exists, ensure you have created this index as
an {+avs+} index, not an {+fts+} index. If no index on ``field``
exists, :ref:`create one <avs-create-index>`. To learn more about
implementing |rag| with {+avs+} and LangChain, see
:ref:`langchain-rag`.

``Command not found`` when creating {+avs+} index
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to create an {+avs+} index programmatically, you
might encounter a ``Command not found`` error. This error occurs for
one of two reasons:

- You run the command against an {+service+} {+cluster+} running 
  a version of MongoDB earlier than 6.0.11 or 7.0.2. In this case,
  you must :ref:`upgrade the MongoDB version of the cluster
  <scale-cluster-version>` to enable {+avs+} for the {+cluster+}.
- You run the command against an ``M0`` Free Tier {+cluster+}. In this
  case, as long as the {+cluster+} is running a compatible MongoDB
  version, you can :ref:`create an {+avs+} index with the {+atlas-ui+}
  <avs-create-index-procedure>`.

Unable to filter on a given field
---------------------------------

{+avs+} currently supports filtering only on fields with boolean,
numeric, or string values.
