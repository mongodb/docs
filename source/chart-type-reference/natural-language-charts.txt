Natural language charts simplifies the chart creation process. 
It supports the following chart types, which are built with :ref:`series
<charts-series-encoding>` and :ref:`aggregation
<building-charts-aggregation>` :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

- Grouped Bar
- Stacked Bar
- Stacked 100% Bar
- Grouped Column
- Stacked Column
- Stacked 100% Column
- Discrete Line
- Discrete Area
- Stacked 100% Area
- Number
- Table
- Donut

These types of charts support boolean, date, string, and number
:ref:`filtering <interactive-filtering>`, :ref:`sorting
<charts-sort-data>`, :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>`, and
:ref:`limiting <charts-limit-data>`.

After you enter a prompt about a chart you would like to see, the AI
model creates the chart.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Add a natural language chart. 

      a. From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, select the dashboard 
         where you want to add a new chart. For instructions on setting 
         up a dashboard, see :doc:`Dashboards </dashboards>`.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Add Chart` button.

      #. In the :guilabel:`Select Data Source` modal, click the 
         :guilabel:`Project` tab. 

      #. In the cluster where you loaded the 
         sample data, select the ``listingsAndReviews`` collection 
         in the ``sample_airbnb`` database.

      #. Toggle the switch on the top navigation from :guilabel:`Classic` to :guilabel:`Natural Language`.

         When you toggle this, you must click the :guilabel:`Use
         Natural Language Mode` button in the :guilabel:`Natural
         Language Mode` modal to accept the `MongoDB Acceptable
         Use Policy
         <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy>`__ and
         `Privacy Policy
         <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy>`__.

         .. figure:: /images/charts/nl-mode-modal.png
            :figwidth: 300px
            :alt: Natural Language Mode Modal

         If you click :guilabel:`Back to Classic Mode`, |charts|
         switches you back to :guilabel:`Classic` mode.

         .. note::

            You can seamlessly switch between  :guilabel:`Classic`
            and :guilabel:`Natural Language` mode. |charts| retains
            the prompts and suggestions when you change modes as long
            as you keep the encoding and filter tabs the same in the
            chart builder.

   .. step:: Describe the chart you want to create.

      In the :guilabel:`Prompt` box, specify the chart you want |charts|
      to create.

      .. include:: /includes/nlc-prompt-writing-tips.rst

      .. note::

         Your prompt cannot exceed 500 characters.

      If you're unsure of what chart you would like to see, you can
      choose one of the :guilabel:`Suggested Prompts` and click
      :guilabel:`Select`.

      .. tip:: 
         
         If your :guilabel:`Suggested Prompts` section doesn't load,
         click :guilabel:`Retry`.

         .. figure:: /images/charts/nlc-suggested-prompts.png
            :figwidth: 508px
            :alt: Natural Language Charts Suggested Prompts Load Error

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Generate chart`.
       
      |charts| displays your chart and also generates a title based 
      on your prompt.
    
   .. step:: (Optional) Customize your chart.
       
      To :ref:`customize your chart <customize-charts>`, toggle the
      switch on the top navigation from :guilabel:`Natural Language`
      to :guilabel:`Classic`.
    
   .. step:: (Optional) Give feedback about your generated chart.

      On the bottom-left corner of your generated chart, click the
      thumbs up or thumbs down button.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save and Close`.
