|service| supports deploying clusters onto Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
This page provides reference material related to |service| cluster
deployments on |gcp|.

|service| supports the following |gcp| regions. The |service|
:doc:`API </api/>` uses the corresponding :guilabel:`Atlas Region`.

Cluster Configuration Options
-----------------------------

Each |service| cluster tier comes with a default set of resources.
|service| provides the following resource configuration options:

Custom Storage Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The size of the server root volume. |service| clusters deployed onto
|gcp| use |ssd| persistent storage [#google-disk-docs]_.

.. include:: /includes/note-ram-availability.rst

The following cluster tiers are available:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/instance-types/gcp.rst

.. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/cluster-naming-conventions.rst

Workloads typically require less than ``2TB`` of storage.

|service| configures the following resources automatically and does not
allow user modification:

Storage Speed
`````````````

The input/output operations per second (IOPS) [#google-disk-docs]_
the system can perform. This value is fixed at 30 |iops| per GB for
reads and 30 |iops| per GB for writes for a total of 60 |iops| per GB.

.. example::

   The ``M30`` cluster has a default storage size of 40 GB. This
   results in a maximum read speed of 1,200 |iops| and a maximum write
   speed of 1,200 |iops|. Increasing the storage size to 100 GB per
   cluster increases the maximum read speed of 3,000 |iops| and a
   maximum write speed of 3,000 |iops|.

Encrypted Storage Volumes
`````````````````````````

|gcp| storage volumes are
:gcp:`always encrypted </security/encryption-at-rest/>`.

.. _google-gcp-availability-zones:

GCP Zones
---------

Each |gcp| region includes a set number of independent zones. Each zone
has power, cooling, networking, and control planes that are isolated
from other zones. For regions that have at least three zones (3Z),
|service| deploys clusters across three zones. For regions that only
have two zones (2Z), |service| deploys clusters across two zones.

The |service| :doc:`Add New Cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>`
form marks regions that support :abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters as
:guilabel:`Recommended`, as they provide higher availability.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-gcp.rst

For general information on |gcp| regions and zones, see the Google
documentation on :gcp:`regions and zones
</compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones>`.

Regions with at Least Three Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the selected |gcp| region has at least three zones, |service|
clusters are split across three zones. For example, a three node
replica set cluster would have one node deployed onto each zone.

.. include:: /images/google-gcp-3az.rst

:abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters have higher availability
compared to :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters. However, not all
regions support :abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters.

..
   Regions with Only Two Zones
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If the selected |gcp| region has two zones, |service| clusters are
   split across the two zones. For example, a three node replica set
   cluster would have two nodes deployed to one zone and the remaining
   node deployed to the other zone.

   .. include:: /images/google-gcp-2az.rst

   :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters have a higher chance of loss of
   availability in the event of the loss of an zone than :abbr:`3Z
   (Three Zone)` clusters. However, where latency or location are a
   priority, a region that supports :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters
   may be preferred.

   :gcp:`Storage Options </compute/docs/disks/>`.
