Data Modeling
=============

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Although you
may be able to use different structures for a single data set in
MongoDB, different data models may have significant impacts on MongoDB
and applications performance. Consider :doc:`/core/data-modeling` for
a conceptual overview of data modeling problems in MongoDB, and the
:ref:`data-modeling-patterns` documents for examples of different
approaches to data models.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/use-cases` for overviews of application design,
   including data models, with MongoDB.
