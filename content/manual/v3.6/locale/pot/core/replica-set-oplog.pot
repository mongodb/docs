msgid "The :term:`oplog` (operations log) is a special :term:`capped collection` that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in your databases. MongoDB applies database operations on the :term:`primary` and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. The :term:`secondary` members then copy and apply these operations in an asynchronous process.  All replica set members contain a copy of the oplog, in the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection, which allows them to maintain the current state of the database."

For example, if an oplog is 5% of free disk space and fills up in 24 hours of operations, then secondaries can stop copying entries from the oplog for up to 24 hours without becoming too stale to continue replicating. However, most replica sets have much lower operation volumes, and their oplogs can hold much higher numbers of operations."
