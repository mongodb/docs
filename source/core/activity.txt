Activity
========

The :guilabel:`Activity` page has three sections in tabs:

- **All Activity** shows a feed of all MMS events as well as a :guilabel:`gear
  icon` to download the activity feed as a CSV file or filter the feed by date.

- **Closed Alerts** shows a list of alerts that users have closed
  explicitly or where the metric has dropped below the threshold of the alert.

- **Alert Settings** shows a list of active alerts with a :guilabel:`+Add
  Alert` button to create new alerts and a :guilabel:`gear icon` to edit,
  clone, disable, or delete existing alerts.

New groups automatically have two alerts created, a monitoring agent down alert
and a host is exposed to the public Internet alert. Existing groups must create
these alerts manually. See the :ref:`Exposed Host Alerts FAQ
<exposed-hosts-alert>` for details about that alert.
