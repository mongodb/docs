We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB {+language+} community that
includes users with varying levels of experience using the
{+driver-short+}. The quickest way to get support for general questions
is through the :community-forum:`MongoDB Community Forums </tag/kotlin>`.

Bugs / Feature Requests
-----------------------

If you have feedback about the {+driver-short+}, visit the `MongoDB
Feedback Engine <https://feedback.mongodb.com/>`__ and select
:guilabel:`Drivers` from the list of products on the right side of
your screen. You can propose improvements, report issues, and provide
other types of feedback by using this site.

You can also open a case in Jira, our issue management tool, to identify
bugs or propose improvements. The following steps describe how to create
a Jira issue:

1. Visit the `MongoDB Jira issue tracker <https://jira.mongodb.org/>`__ and click the 
   `signup link. <https://account.mongodb.com/account/register>`__
   Create an account, and then log in to Jira.
#. Navigate to the `JAVA Jira project. <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA>`__
#. Click :guilabel:`Create` to create a ticket. Please provide as much
   information as possible about the issue or request in the ticket.

.. note::

   Bug reports in the JAVA Jira project are publicly viewable.

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in any official MongoDB
product, please report it according to the instructions found in the
:manual:`Create a Vulnerability Report page. </tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`
