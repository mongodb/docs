Run the following commands in {+mongosh+} to create a persistent stream
processor named ``solarDemo``:

a. Connect to your {+spi+}.

   Use the connection string associated with your {+spi+}
   to connect using {+mongosh+}.

   i. In the pane for your {+spi+}, click :guilabel:`Connect`.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Connect to your instance` dialog, 
      select the :guilabel:`Shell` tab.

   #. Copy the connection string displayed in the dialog. It has
      the following format, where
      ``<atlas-stream-processing-url>`` is the URL of your {+spi+}
      and ``<username>`` is the username of a database user with
      the :atlasrole:`atlasAdmin` role:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongosh "mongodb://<atlas-stream-processing-url>/" 
         --tls --authenticationDatabase admin --username <username>  
         --password <password>   

   #. Paste the connection string into your terminal and replace
      the ``<password>`` placeholder with the credentials for the
      user. 
      
      Press Enter to run it and connect to your {+spi+}.

#. Configure a :pipeline:`$source` stage.

   Define a variable for a ``$source`` stage that ingests data from the
   ``sample_stream_solar`` source.

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: true

      let s = {
        $source: {
          connectionName: "sample_stream_solar"
        }
      }
	   
#. Configure a :pipeline:`$group` stage.

   Define a variable for a ``$group`` stage that derives the maximum
   temperature and the average, maximum, and minimum wattages
   of each solar device according to its ``group_id``.

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: true

      let g = {
        $group: {
          _id: "$group_id",
          max_temp: {
            $max: "$obs.temp"
          },
          avg_watts: {
             $avg: "$obs.watts"
          },
          max_watts: {
            $max: "$obs.watts"
          },
          min_watts: {
            $min: "$obs.watts"
          }
        }
      }

#. Configure a :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` stage.

   In order to perform accumulations such as ``$group`` on streaming
   data, {+atlas-sp+} uses :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` to bound
   the data set. Define a variable for a ``$tumblingWindow`` stage that
   separates the stream into consecutive 10-second intervals.

   This means, for example, that when the ``$group`` stage
   computes a value for ``max_watts``, it extracts the maximum
   value from the ``obs.watts`` values for all documents with a
   given ``group_id`` ingested in the previous 10 seconds.

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: true

      let t = {
        $tumblingWindow: {
          interval: {
            size: NumberInt(10),
            unit: "second"
          },
          pipeline: [g]
       }
     }

#. Configure a :ref:`$merge <atlas-sp-agg-merge>` stage.
   
   Define a variable for a ``$merge`` stage that writes the processed
   streaming data to a collection named ``solarColl`` in the ``solarDb``
   database of your connected {+service+} cluster.

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: true

      let m = {
        $merge: {
          into: {
            connectionName: "mongodb1",
            db: "solarDb",
            coll: "solarColl"
          }
        }
      }

#. Create the stream processor.

   Use the :method:`sp.createStreamProcessor()` method to assign a name
   to your new stream processor and declare its aggregation pipeline.
   The ``$group`` stage belongs to the nested pipeline of the
   ``$tumblingWindow``, and you must not include it in the processor
   pipeline definition.

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: true

      sp.createStreamProcessor("solarDemo", [s, t, m])

   This creates a stream processor named ``solarDemo`` that
   applies the previously defined query and writes the 
   processed data to the ``solarColl`` collection of the 
   ``solarDb`` database on the cluster you connected to.
   It returns various measurements derived from 10-second intervals
   of observations from your solar devices.

   databases, see :ref:`<atlas-sp-agg-merge>`.
