.. _dotnet-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For all :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>` except 
email/password authentication, Atlas App Services automatically creates a 
:ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time a user authenticates. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must first :ref:`register 
<dotnet-email-password-register-new-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<dotnet-email-password-confirm-user>` a user before App Services 
creates the user object.

.. _dotnet-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

To delete a user, call the :dotnet-sdk:`DeleteUserFromServerAsync(User) 
<reference/Realms.Sync.App.html#Realms_Sync_App_DeleteUserFromServerAsync_Realms_Sync_User_>` 
method. This deletes the user from the server, and also deletes the user's local 
data, but does not delete any custom user data. To delete custom user data, 
refer to :ref:`<dotnet-delete-custom-user-data>`.
