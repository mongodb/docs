Overview
--------

An |fts| analyzer prepares a set of documents to be indexed by 
performing a series of operations to transform, filter, and group 
sequences of characters. You can define a custom analyzer to suit your 
specific indexing needs.

.. _custom-analyzers-syntax:

Syntax 
------

A custom analyzer has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json

   "analyzers": [
     {
       "name": "<name>",
       "charFilters": [ <list-of-character-filters> ],
       "tokenizer": {
         "type": "<tokenizer-type>"
       },
       "tokenFilters": [ <list-of-token-filters> ]
     }
   ]

Attributes 
----------

A custom analyzer has the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 20 45 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Type
     - Description
     - Required?

   * - ``name``
     - string
     - Name of the custom analyzer. Names must be unique within an 
       index, and may not start with any of the following strings:

       - ``lucene.``
       - ``builtin.``
       - ``mongodb.``

     - yes

   * - ``charFilters``
     - list of objects
     - Array containing zero or more character filters. See 
       :ref:`custom-analyzers-usage` for more information.
     - no

   * - ``tokenizer``
     - object
     - Tokenizer to use to create tokens. See 
       :ref:`custom-analyzers-usage` for more information.
     - yes

   * - ``tokenFilters``
     - list of objects
     - Array containing zero or more token filters. See 
       :ref:`custom-analyzers-usage` for more information.
     - no

.. _custom-analyzers-usage:

Usage 
-----

To use a custom analyzer when indexing a collection, include the 
following in your :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>` ``analyzers`` field:

1. *Optional*. Specify one or more :ref:`character filters 
   <char-filters-ref>`. Character filters examine text one character at 
   a time and perform filtering operations.

2. *Required*. Specify the :ref:`tokenizer <tokenizers-ref>`. An 
   analyzer uses a tokenizer to split chunks of text into groups, or 
   tokens, for indexing purposes. For example, the whitespace tokenizer 
   splits text fields into individual words based on where whitespace 
   occurs.

3. *Optional*. Specify one or more :ref:`token filters 
   <token-filters-ref>`. After the tokenization step, the resulting 
   tokens can pass through one or more token filters. A token filter 
   performs operations such as:
   
   - Stemming, which reduces related words, such as "talking", "talked",
     and "talks" to their root word "talk".
   - Redaction, the removal of sensitive information from public 
     documents.

.. note:: 

   The text passes through character filters first, then a tokenizer, 
   and then the token filters.

Example Collection 
------------------

The :ref:`character-filters`, :ref:`tokenizers-ref`, and 
:ref:`token-filters-ref` pages contain sample index definitions and 
query examples for character filters, tokenizers, and token filters.
These examples use a sample ``minutes`` collection with 
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { 
     "_id": 1, 
     "page_updated_by": {
       "last_name": "AUERBACH",
       "first_name": "Siân",
       "email": "auerbach@example.com",
       "phone": "123-456-7890"
     },
     "title": "The weekly team meeting",
     "text" : "<head> This page deals with department meetings. </head>"
   }

.. code-block:: json

   { 
     "_id": 2, 
     "page_updated_by": {
       "last_name": "OHRBACH",
       "first_name": "Noël",
       "email": "ohrbach@example.com",
       "phone": "123-456-0987"
     },
     "title": "The check-in with sales team",
     "text" : "The head of the sales department spoke first."
   }

.. code-block:: json

   { 
     "_id": 3, 
     "page_updated_by": {
       "last_name": "LEWINSKY",
       "first_name": "Brièle",
       "email": "lewinsky@example.com",
       "phone": "123-456-9870"
     },
     "title": "The regular board meeting",
     "text" : "<body>We'll head out to the conference room by noon.</body>" 
   }

.. code-block:: json

   { 
     "_id": 4, 
     "page_updated_by": {
       "last_name": "LEVINSKI",
       "first_name": "François",
       "email": "levinski@example.com",
       "phone": "123-456-8907"
     },
     "title": "The daily huddle",
     "text" : "<body>The page has been updated with the items on the agenda.</body>"
