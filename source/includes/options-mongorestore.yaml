program: mongorestore
name: db
aliases: -d
directive: option
args:  <database>
description: |
  Specifies a database for {{program}} to restore data *into*.
  If the database does not exist, {{program}} creates the
  database. If you do not specify a ``<db>``, {{program}}
  creates new databases that correspond to the databases where data
  originated and data may be overwritten. Use this option to restore data
  into a MongoDB instance that already has data.

  {{role}} does *not* control which :term:`BSON` files
  {{program}} restores. You must use the
  {{program}} :ref:`path option <mongorestore-path-option>` to
  limit that restored data.
optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: collection
aliases: -c
directive: option
args: <collection>
description: |
  Specifies a single collection for {{program}} to restore. If
  you do not specify {{role}}, {{program}} takes
  the collection name from the input filename. If the input file has an
  extension, MongoDB omits the extension of the file from the collection
  name.
optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: objcheck
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Forces {{program}} to validate all requests from clients
  upon receipt to ensure that clients never insert invalid documents into
  the database. For objects with a high degree of sub-document nesting,
  {{role}} can have a small impact on performance.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.4
     MongoDB enables {{role}} by default, to prevent any
     client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
     database.
optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: drop
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Before restoring the collections from the dumped backup, drops the
  collections from the target database. {{role}} does not drop
  collections that are not in the backup.

  When the restore includes the ``admin`` database, {{program}} with
  {{role}} removes all user credentials and replaces them with the
  users defined in the dump file. Therefore, in systems with
  :setting:`~security.authorization` enabled, {{program}} must be able
  to authenticate to an existing user *and* to a user defined in the
  dump file. If {{program}} can't authenticate to a user defined in the
  dump file, the restoration process will fail, leaving an empty
  database.

optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: oplogReplay
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  After restoring the database dump, replays the :term:`oplog` entries
  from the :file:`oplog.bson` file located in the top level of the dump
  directory. When used in conjunction with :option:`mongodump --oplog
  <--oplog>`, :program:`mongorestore --oplogReplay <mongorestore>`
  restores the database to the point-in-time backup captured with the
  ``mongodump --oplog`` command. For an example of {{role}}, see
  :ref:`backup-restore-oplogreplay`.

  :program:`mongorestore --oplogReplay <mongorestore>` replays any
  valid :file:`oplog.bson` file found in the top level of the dump
  directory. That is, if you have a bson file that contains valid oplog
  entries, you can name the file ``oplog.bson`` and move it to the top
  level of the dump directory for :program:`mongorestore --oplogReplay
  <mongorestore>` to replay.

  .. seealso:: :ref:`mongorestore Required Access <mongorestore-required-access>`

optional: true

program: mongorestore
name: oplogLimit
directive: option
args: <timestamp>
description: |
  Prevents {{program}} from applying :term:`oplog` entries
  with timestamp newer than or equal to ``<timestamp>``. Specify
  ``<timestamp>`` values in the form of ``<time_t>:<ordinal>``, where
  ``<time_t>`` is the seconds since the UNIX epoch, and ``<ordinal>``
  represents a counter of operations in the oplog that occurred in the
  specified second.

  You must use {{role}} in conjunction with the
  :option:`--oplogReplay` option.
optional: true

program: mongorestore

directive: option

description: |
  Prevents {{program}} from upgrading the index to the latest
  version during the restoration process.
optional: true

  Prevents {{program}} from restoring and building indexes as

program: mongorestore
name: noOptionsRestore
directive: option

description: |
  Prevents {{program}} from setting the collection options,
  such as those specified by the :dbcommand:`collMod` :term:`database
  command`, on restored collections.
optional: true

program: mongorestore

optional: true

program: mongorestore
name: <path>
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  The final argument of the {{program}} command is a
  directory path. This argument specifies the location of the
  database dump from which to restore.

  You cannot specify both the ``<path>`` argument and the ``--dir``
  option, which also specifies the dump directory, to {{program}}.

optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: dir
directive: option
args: string
description: |
  Specifies the dump directory.

  - You cannot specify both the ``--dir`` option and the ``<path>``
    argument, which also specifies the dump directory, to {{program}}.

  - You cannot use the ``--archive`` option with the ``--dir`` option.

  error.
optional: true
---
program: mongorestore
name: archive
directive: option
args: <file or null>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.2

  Restores from an archive file or from the standard input (``stdin``).

  To restore from an archive file, run {{program}} with the ``--archive``
  option and the archive filename.

  To restore from the standard input, run {{program}} with the
  ``archive`` option but *omit* the filename.

  .. note::

     - You cannot use the ``--archive`` option with the ``--dir`` option.

     - {{program}} still supports the positional ``-`` parameter to
       restore a *single* collection from the standard input.

optional: true

program: mongorestore
name: gzip
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.2

  Restores from compressed files or data stream created by
  :program:`mongodump --archive <mongodump>`

  To restore from a dump directory that contains compressed files, run
  :program:`mongorestore` with the new ``--gzip`` option.

  To restore from a compressed archive file, run :program:`mongorestore` with
  the ``--gzip`` option in conjunction with the ``--archive`` option.
