- To view the keepalive setting on Linux, use one of the following
  commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time

   Or:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

   The value is measured in seconds.

   .. note::

      Although the setting name includes ``ipv4``, the
      ``tcp_keepalive_time`` value applies to both IPv4 and IPv6.

- To change the ``tcp_keepalive_time`` value, you can use one of the
  following commands, supplying a *<value>* in seconds:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=<value>

   Or:

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo <value> | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

   These operations do not persist across system reboots. To persist
   the setting, add the following line to ``/etc/sysctl.conf``,
   supplying a *<value>* in seconds, and reboot the machine:

   .. code-block:: sh

      net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = <value>

   Keepalive values greater than ``300`` seconds,
   (5 minutes) will be overridden on :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` sockets and set to ``300`` seconds.
