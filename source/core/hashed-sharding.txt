Hashed Sharding
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Hashed sharding uses either a :ref:`single field hashed index
<index-hashed-index>` or a :ref:`compound hashed index
<index-type-compound-hashed>` (*New in 4.4*) as the shard key to
partition data across your cluster. 

Sharding on a Single Field Hashed Index
  Hashed sharding provides a more even data distribution across the
  sharded cluster at the cost of reducing
  :ref:`sharding-query-isolation`. Post-hash, documents with "close"
  shard key values are unlikely to be on the same chunk or shard - the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` is more likely to perform
  :ref:`sharding-mongos-broadcast` to fulfill a given ranged query.
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` can target queries with equality matches to a
  single shard.

  Hashed indexes compute the hash value of a single field as the index
  value; this value is used as your shard key. [#hashvalue]_

Sharding on a Compound Hashed Index
  MongoDB 4.4 adds support for creating compound indexes with a single
  :ref:`hashed field <index-type-hashed>`. To create a compound hashed
  index, specify ``hashed`` as the value of any single index key when
  creating the index.

  Compound hashed index compute the hash value of a single field in the
  compound index; this value is used along with the other fields in the
  index as your shard key. 

  Compound hashed sharding supports features like :ref:`zone sharding
  <zone-sharding>`, where the prefix (i.e. first) non-hashed field or
  fields support zone ranges while the hashed field supports more even
  distribution of the sharded data. Compound hashed sharding also
  supports shard keys with a hashed prefix for resolving data
  distribution issues related to :ref:`monotonically increasing
  fields <shard-key-monotonic>`.

.. include:: /includes/warning-hashed-index-floating-point.rst

.. [#hashvalue]
   Starting in version 4.0, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
   method :method:`convertShardKeyToHashed()`. This method uses the
   same hashing function as the hashed index and can be used to see
   what the hashed value would be for a key.

.. _hashed-sharding-shard-key:

Hashed Sharding Shard Key
-------------------------

The field you choose as your hashed shard key should have a good
:ref:`cardinality<shard-key-range>`, or large number of different values.
Hashed keys are ideal for shard keys with fields that change
:ref:`monotonically<shard-key-monotonic>` like :term:`ObjectId` values or
timestamps. A good example of this is the default ``_id`` field, assuming
it only contains :term:`ObjectID` values.

To shard a collection using a hashed shard key, see
:ref:`deploy-hashed-sharded-cluster-shard-collection`.

Hashed vs Ranged Sharding
-------------------------

Given a collection using a monotonically increasing value ``X`` as the
shard key, using ranged sharding results in a distribution of incoming
inserts similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-monotonic-distribution.rst

Since the value of ``X`` is always increasing, the chunk with an upper bound
of :doc:`maxKey</reference/bson-types>` receives the majority incoming writes. This
restricts insert operations to the single shard containing this chunk, which
reduces or removes the advantage of distributed writes in a sharded cluster.

By using a hashed index on ``X``, the distribution of inserts is similar
to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-hashed-distribution.rst

Since the data is now distributed more evenly, inserts are efficiently
distributed throughout the cluster.

Shard the Collection
--------------------

Use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method, specifying the full namespace
of the collection and the target :doc:`hashed index</core/index-hashed>`
to use as the :term:`shard key`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( "database.collection", { <field> : "hashed" } )

To shard a collection on a 
:ref:`compound hashed index <index-type-compound-hashed>`, specify
the full namespace of the collection and the target compound
hashed index to use as the :term:`shard key`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(
     "database.collection", 
     { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB" : 1, "fieldC" : "hashed" }
   )

.. important::

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can refine a collection's shard key
     by adding a suffix field or fields to the existing key. In earlier
     versions, once you shard a collection, the selection of the shard
     key is immutable; i.e. you cannot select a different shard key for
     that collection. For details on refining a shard key, see
     :ref:`shard-key-refine`.

     For details on updating the shard key, see :ref:`update-shard-key`.
     
Shard a Populated Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you shard a populated collection using a hashed shard key:

- The sharding operation creates the initial chunk(s) to cover the
  entire range of the shard key values. The number of chunks created
  depends on the :ref:`configured chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>`.

- After the initial chunk creation, the balancer migrates these initial
  chunks across the shards as appropriate as well as manages the chunk
  distribution going forward.

Shard an Empty Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution.rst

Sharding Empty Collection on Single Field Hashed Shard Key
  - With no :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified 
    for the empty or non-existing collection:

    - The sharding operation creates empty chunks to cover the entire
      range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk
      distribution. By default, the operation creates 2 chunks per shard
      and migrates across the cluster. You can use ``numInitialChunks``
      option to specify a different number of initial chunks. This
      initial creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster
      setup of sharding.

    - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
      distribution going forward.

  - With :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified
    for the empty or a non-existing collection (Available starting in 
    MongoDB 4.0.3):

    - The sharding operation creates empty chunks for the defined zone
      ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range
      of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution
      based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and distribution
      of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding.

    - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
      distribution going forward.

Sharding Empty Collection on Compound Hashed Shard Key with Hashed Field Prefix
  If the compound hashed shard key has the hashed field as the prefix
  (i.e. the hashed field is the first field in the shard key):

  - With no :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified 
    for the empty or non-existing collection:

    - The sharding operation creates empty chunks to cover the entire
      range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk
      distribution. The value of all non-hashed fields is ``MinKey`` at
      each split point. By default, the operation creates 2 chunks per
      shard and migrates across the cluster. You can use
      ``numInitialChunks`` option to specify a different number of
      initial chunks. This initial creation and distribution of chunks
      allows for faster setup of sharding.

    - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
      distribution going forward.

  -  With a *single* :doc:`zone </core/zone-sharding>` with a 
     range from ``MinKey`` to ``MaxKey`` specified
     for the empty or a non-existing collection *and* 
     the ``presplitHashedZones`` option specified to
     :method:`sh.shardCollection()`:

     - The sharding operation creates empty chunks for the defined zone
       range as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range
       of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk
       distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and
       distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding.

     - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
       distribution going forward.

Sharding Empty Collection on Compound Hashed Shard Key with Non-Hashed Prefix
  If the compound hashed shard key has one or more non-hashed fields as
  the prefix (i.e. the hashed field is *not* the first field in the
  shard key):

  - With no :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified 
    for the empty or non-existing collection *and*
    :ref:`preSplitHashedZones
    <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` is ``false`` or
    omitted, MongoDB does not perform any initial chunk creation or
    distribution when sharding the collection.

  - With no :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified
    for the empty or non-existing collection *and*
    :ref:`preSplitHashedZones
    <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`,
    :method:`sh.shardCollection()` / :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
    returns an error.

  -  With :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` specified
     for the empty or a non-existing collection *and* the
     :ref:`preSplitHashedZones
     <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` option specified to
     :method:`sh.shardCollection()`:

     - The sharding operation creates empty chunks for the defined zone
       ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range
       of the shard key values. 
       
     - The sharding operation further subdivides the initial chunk for
       each range, such that each shard in the zone is allocated an
       equal number of chunks.

     - This initial creation and distribution of chunks allows for
       faster setup of zoned sharding. After the initial distribution,
       the balancer manages the chunk distribution going forward.

     The defined ranges for each zone *must* meet certain requirements.
     For a description of the requirements and a complete example, see
     :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-hashed-example`.
