|mms| provides a wizard for adding your existing MongoDB deployments to
monitoring and management. The wizard prompts you to install an
{+aagent+} if none exists, and then prompts you to identify the
:term:`cluster <sharded cluster>`, the :term:`replica set`, or the
:term:`standalone` to add. You can choose to add the deployment to
:ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>` or to both
:ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>` and
:ref:`Automation <automation>`.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments must have unique names within the projects.

.. include:: /includes/important-unique-names-deployment-items.rst

MongoDB Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automation does not support all MongoDB options. To review which
options are supported, see
:doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options`.

|tls|
~~~~~

If you enable |tls|, the |fqdn| for the host serving a MongoDB process
must match the :abbr:`SAN (Subject Alternative Name)` for the |tls|
certificate on that host.

.. caution::

   Though you can use one |tls| certificate with many
   :abbr:`SANs (Subject Alternative Names)` or a wildcard |tls|
   certificate on each host, you should not. You should follow
   :rfc:`RFC 2818, section 3.1 <2818#section-3.1>`: keep the scope of
   |tls| certificates as narrow as possible. This prevents
   man-in-the-middle attacks.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a preferred hostname if you:

- Require a specific hostname, |fqdn|, |ipv4| address or |ipv6|
  address to access the MongoDB process, or
- Must specify the hostname to use for hosts with multiple aliases.

To learn more, see the :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` setting
in :ref:`group-settings-page`.

Managing Windows MongoDB Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are adding an existing MongoDB process that runs as a Windows
Service to Automation, Automation:

- Stops and disables the existing service
- Creates and starts a new service

.. _add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth:

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the |mms| project has MongoDB authentication settings enabled
for its deployments, the MongoDB deployment you import must support
the project's authentication mechanism.

If your MongoDB deployment requires authentication, you must
:doc:`provide the necessary credentials </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials/>`
for monitoring when adding the deployment to |mms|.

- If the deployment does not use Automation, but *did* use Backup,
  Monitoring, or both, you can find those credentials where the
  credentials were before updating to the {+mdbagent+}.

- If the deployment does not use Automation, but *will* use Backup,
  Monitoring, or both, you must add the credentials you granted
  those functions to |mms| after you add the MongoDB processes. For
  details, see the following:

  - :ref:`Add Credentials for Monitoring <add-auth-credentials-monitoring>`
  - :ref:`Add Credentials for Backup <add-auth-credentials-backup>`

- If the deployment *uses* Automation, |mms| uses the credentials
  from the legacy Automation Agent. You can delete the credentials
  from the legacy Backup, and Monitoring Agents. The {+mdbagent+}
  uses those credentials for its Automation, Backup, and Monitoring
  functions.

- If the deployment *will* use Automation but did not prior to being
  imported, you need to add the {+mdbagent+) user to the database
  processes you imported and add the user's credentials to |mms|. For
  details, see :ref:`add-auth-credentials-automation`.

Add Authentication Credentials to your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you add existing MongoDB process to |mms|, you might have to add
authentication credentials for the new deployments if authentication is
enabled for the project into which you imported the deployment. See
:ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth` to learn in which situations
you must add Automation, Monitoring, or Backup credentials for your new
deployment.
