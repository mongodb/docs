Overview
--------

On this page, you can learn about the security benefits of {+qe+},
how it works, and how it compares to other security mechanisms supported
by MongoDB. You can also view a fictional scenario that demonstrates the
value of {+qe+} in securing your data.

{+qe+}
--------------------

{+qe+} enables a client application to
encrypt data before transporting it over the network using fully
randomized encryption, while maintaining queryability.
Sensitive data is transparently encrypted and decrypted by the client
and only communicated to and from the server in encrypted form.

Unlike :ref:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption <manual-csfle-feature>`
that can use :ref:`Deterministic Encryption <csfle-deterministic-encryption>`,
{+qe+} uses fast, searchable encryption schemes based on structured encryption.
These schemes produce different encrypted output values even when given
the same cleartext input.

How {+qe+} Works
------------------------------

The diagram below shows the process and architecture of how {+qe+} is
used in a customer environment.

.. image:: /images/QE-how-it-works.png
    :alt: How Queryable Encryption works

In this diagram, the user is able to query on fully randomly encrypted
data such as SSN number.

The process and mechanisms that make this possible within {+qe+} are as follows:

1. When the application submits the query, MongoDB drivers first analyze
   the query.

2. The driver recognizes the query is against an encrypted field and
   requests the encryption keys from the customer-provisioned key
   provider such as:

   - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
   - Google Cloud KMS
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Any {+kmip-kms+}

3. The driver submits the query to the MongoDB server with the encrypted
   fields rendered as ciphertext.

4. Queryable Encryption implements a fast, searchable scheme that allows
   the server to process queries on fully encrypted data, without knowing
   anything about the data. The data and the query itself remain encrypted
   at all times on the server.

5. The MongoDB server returns the encrypted results of the query to the
   driver.

6. The query results are decrypted with the keys held by the driver and
   returned to the client and shown as plaintext.

{+qe+} functions with the help of the following data structures. It is critical
that these are not modified or deleted, or query results will be incorrect.

- {+qe+} adds a ``__safeContent__`` field to documents in any collection where there's a {+qe+}
  encrypted field.
- {+qe+} creates two internal metadata collections in the same database as the collection where there's a
  {+qe+} encrypted field. These are named as follows:

  - ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc``
  - ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc``

.. warning::

    Do not modify these data structures or query results will be incorrect
    and security could be impacted.

{+qe+} keeps encrypted fields secure in the following scenarios:

- Direct access to encrypted fields by a database superuser
- Access to encrypted fields by reading the server's memory
- Capture of encrypted fields over an insecure network
- Access to on-disk encrypted fields by reading database or backup files
- Frequency analysis attacks by identifying patterns in {+in-use-docs+}

While all clients have access to the non-sensitive data fields,
only appropriately-configured {+qe+} clients are able to run
read and write queries using the encrypted data fields.

.. important:: Remote {+kms-long+}

   When you use {+qe+} in production, you must use a remote
   {+kms-long+} (KMS) to store your encryption key.

   To view a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to use a remote KMS with
   {+qe+}, see :ref:`<qe-tutorial-automatic-encryption>`.

   To view a list of all supported KMS providers, see
   :ref:`<qe-fundamentals-kms-providers>`.

   To learn more about why you should use a remote KMS, see
   :ref:`qe-reasons-to-use-remote-kms`.

Other Security Mechanisms
-------------------------

This section describes the following security mechanisms supported by
MongoDB and explains their use cases and limitations:

- :ref:`<qe-features-role-based-access-control>`
- :ref:`<qe-features-encryption-at-rest>`
- :ref:`<qe-features-transport-encryption>`

.. _qe-features-role-based-access-control:

Role-Based Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Role-Based Access Control is a security mechanism that
allows administrators to grant and restrict collection-level permissions
for users. With the appropriate role definition and assignment, this
solution prevents accidental disclosure of data and access.

Role-Based Access control cannot protect against the following scenarios:

- Capture of the data over an insecure network
- Access to on-disk data by reading database or backup files
- Access to data by reading the server's memory
- Direct access to data by a database superuser

To learn more, see
:manual:`Role-Based Access Control </core/authorization/>`.

.. _qe-features-encryption-at-rest:

Encryption at Rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption at Rest is a mechanism that encrypts database files on disk.
This mechanism prevents a person who lacks database credentials, but has
access to the computer hosting your database, from viewing your data.

This mechanism does not protect your data against the following scenarios:

- Capture of the data over an insecure network
- Access to data by reading the server's memory
- Direct access to data by a database superuser

To learn more, see
:manual:`Encryption at Rest </core/security-encryption-at-rest/>`.

.. _qe-features-transport-encryption:

Transport Encryption (TLS/SSL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transport Encryption using TLS/SSL encrypts your data over the network.
TLS/SSL protects your data as it travels over an insecure network, but
cannot protect your data from a privileged user or as it sits on disk.

To learn more, see
:manual:`Transport Encryption using TLS/SSL
</core/security-transport-encryption/>`

Scenario
--------

The following fictional scenario demonstrates the value of {+qe+}
in securing your application's data, and how
{+qe+} interacts with the other security mechanism discussed
in this guide.

In this scenario, we secure sensitive data on a medical care management
system that stores patients' personal information, billing
information, and medical records for a fictional company, *MedcoMD*.
None of the patient data is public, and specific data such as their
social security number (SSN, a US government-issued ID number), patient ID number,
billing information, and medication information are particularly sensitive and
subject to privacy compliance. It is important for the company and the patient
that the data is kept private and secure.

MedcoMD needs this system to satisfy the following use cases:

- Doctors use the system to access patients' medical records, billing
  information, and update medications.

- Receptionists use the system to verify patients' identities
  using their contact information.

- Receptionists can view a patient's billing information, but not
  their patient ID number.

- Receptionists cannot access a patient's medical records.

MedcoMD is also concerned with the disclosure of sensitive data through any
of the following methods:

- Accidental disclosure of data on a receptionist's publicly-viewable
  screen.

- Direct access to the database by a superuser such as a database
  administrator.

- Capture of data over an insecure network.

- Access to data by reading the database server's memory.

- Access to data by reading database or backup files.

What can MedcoMD do to balance the functionality and access restrictions
of their medical care management system?

Solution
~~~~~~~~

MedcoMD uses the following security mechanisms to satisfy their use cases
and protect against the disclosure of sensitive medical data:

- :ref:`Transport Encryption (TLS/SSL) <qe-features-transport-encryption>`
  to secure data as it travels over the network.
- :ref:`Encryption at Rest <qe-features-encryption-at-rest>`
  to protect against disclosure of data by reading database
  or backup files.
- :ref:`Role-Based Access Control <qe-features-role-based-access-control>`
  to limit the access of database users to the collections necessary for them
  to perform their tasks.
- Encrypting sensitive fields with {+qe+} to satisfy the following
  use cases and constraints:

  * Prevent reading data from server memory as the
    {+qe+} encrypted data is never on the database server in
    an unencrypted form.
  * Allow receptionists to verify patients' identities and
    prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data on a receptionist's
    publicly viewable screen by providing receptionists with a client
    that is not {+qe+} enabled.
  * Allow doctors to view sensitive data privately in their offices
    by providing doctors with a {+qe+} enabled client.
