{+atlas-sp+} extends the :manual:`aggregation pipeline 
</aggregation>` with stages for processing continuous data streams.
These stages combine with existing aggregation stages built in 
to the default :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process, enabling you to 
perform many of the same operations on continuous data as you can 
perform on data-at-rest. An {+atlas-sp+} pipeline definition cannot 
exceed 16 MB.

The following table lists the aggregation pipeline stages unique to
{+atlas-sp+} and those which exist in modified form in {+atlas-sp+}.

.. warning::

   The ``stream_meta`` field can only be removed with a :pipeline:`$project` 
   or an :pipeline:`$unset` stage. You can only remove this field with one 
   of the two explicit calls as defined below:

   .. code-block:: json

      {$project : { _stream_meta : 0 }}
   
   .. code-block:: json

      {$unset : ["_stream_meta"]}
   
.. note::

   * - Aggregation Pipeline Stage
     - Purpose 

   * - :pipeline:`$source`
     - Specifies a streaming data source to consume messages from.

   * - :pipeline:`$validate`
     - Validates the documents of a stream against a user-defined 
       schema.

   * - :pipeline:`$https`
     - Supports ``curl``-like calls to arbitrary REST API endpoints
       within your stream processor.

   * - :ref:`$lookup <streams-agg-pipeline-lookup>`
     - Performs a left outer join to a specified collection to filter
       in documents from the "joined" collection for processing.
     
       This version of the existing :pipeline:`$lookup` stage requires
       that you specify a {+service+} collection in the 
       :ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` as the
       value for the ``from`` field.

   * - :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`
     - Assigns documents from a stream to 
       :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` with user-defined
       durations and intervals between start times.

   * - :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow`
     - Assigns documents from a stream to non-overlapping, continuous 
       :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` with user-defined
       durations.

   * - :ref:`$emit <streams-agg-pipeline-emit>`
     - Specifies a stream or time series collection in the connection
       registry to emit messages to.

   * - :ref:`$merge <streams-agg-pipeline-merge>`
     - A version of the existing :ref:`adf-merge-stage` stage where 
       the value of the ``connectionName`` field must always be the 
       name of a remote collection in the
       :ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>`.

.. The following can be uncommented once this stage is supported.
   * - :pipeline:`$validatedSource`
     - Similar to :pipeline:`$validate`, but is bound to a specific
       source, allowing you to define one stage in place of both
       :pipeline:`$source` and :pipeline:`$validate`.

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   $source </atlas-stream-processing/sp-agg-source>
   $validate </atlas-stream-processing/sp-agg-validate>
   $https </atlas-stream-processing/sp-agg-https>
   $lookup </atlas-stream-processing/sp-agg-lookup>
   $hoppingWindow </atlas-stream-processing/sp-agg-hopping>

Supported Aggregation Pipeline Stages
-------------------------------------

{+atlas-sp+} provides a number of extensions to the core MongoDB 
:manual:`Aggregation Pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>` syntax. To learn 
more about these extensions, see
:ref:`Supported Aggregation Pipeline Stages <stream-aggregation>`.

Certain core Aggregation Pipeline stages have limited support, or are 
unsupported as noted in the following table. If a stage is not listed 
in the table, {+atlas-sp+} supports it.

   * - Aggregation Stage
     - Support Status

   * - :pipeline:`$group`
     - Only supported in a :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` or 
       :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`.

   * - :pipeline:`$sort`
     - Only supported in a :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` or 
       :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`.

   * - :pipeline:`$limit`
     - Only supported in a :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` or 
       :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`.

   * - :pipeline:`$count`
     - Only supported in a :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` or 
       :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`.

   * - :ref:`adf-merge-stage`
     - Supported with modified syntax. For more information, see
       :ref:`streams-agg-pipeline-merge`.

   * - :pipeline:`$lookup`
     - Supported with modified syntax. For more information, see
       :ref:`streams-agg-pipeline-lookup`.
