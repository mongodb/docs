Select one or more entities to delete from your Relational or MongoDB 
model. Deleting entities allows you to:

- Customize the size of your diagram.
- Focus on entities you select.
- Visualize your relational database's schema to help determine how to best 
  represent your data in MongoDB. 

About this Task
---------------

- You can revert any deletion. 

- Deleting an entity on the :guilabel:`Relational Model` is the equivalent of removing a 
  table from the project's model. 

  - To revert this change, re-add the table to the :guilabel:`Manage Relational Model` 
    dialog. See :ref:`manage the relational model <rm-manage-relational-model>`.

- Deleting an entity on the :guilabel:`MongoDB Model` is the equivalent of removing all 
  mappings to that collection. 
  
  - To revert this change, re-add a :ref:`new documents mapping rule <rm-new-documents>` from
    the source table.

Steps
-----

#. :ref:`Select the entities<rm-select-entities>`, and press 
   delete on your keyboard. 

   {+rel-mig+} prompts removal commands that include either removing the 
   entity from the model or hiding the entity from the diagram.

   .. note:: 

      You can also right-click the entities and select :guilabel:`Remove Entity` to prompt 
      removal commands.

#. Specify where you want to delete the entity.
   Select :guilabel:`Remove from relational model` or :guilabel:`Remove from MongoDB model`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Remove x tables` or :guilabel:`Remove x collections`.
   The button is modified to reflect what you have selected to delete.
