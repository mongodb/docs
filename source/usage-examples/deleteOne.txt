You can delete a document from a collection by using the synchronous
``DeleteOne()`` method, or the asynchronous ``DeleteOneAsync()`` method. 

.. note::

   The ``DeleteOne()`` method deletes only the first document that matches the filter.
   To delete more than one document, use the ``DeleteMany()`` method.

   To learn more about using ``DeleteMany()``, see :ref:`csharp-delete-many`.

Example
-------

Delete a Document by Using Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses ``Builders`` to delete a document in 
the ``restaurants`` collection with the ``name`` "Ready Penny Inn".

Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the 
corresponding code.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: builders-sync

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/delete-one/DeleteOne.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-one-builders
         :end-before: end-delete-one-builders
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      For a fully runnable example of the ``DeleteOne()`` method, see the
      `Synchronous Delete One Example <{+example+}/delete-one/DeleteOne.cs>`__ 

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: builders-async

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/delete-one/DeleteOneAsync.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-one-builders-async
         :end-before: end-delete-one-builders-async
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      For a fully runnable example of the ``DeleteOne()`` method, see the
      `Asynchronous Delete One Example <{+example+}/delete-one/DeleteOneAsync.cs>`__. 
      
Expected Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running either of the preceding full examples prints the following results:

.. code-block:: none
