Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup
==============================

The tutorials in this section run on a development environment using Docker to
package the dependencies and configurations you need to run the
{+connector-long+}. Make sure you complete the development environment setup
steps before proceeding to the tutorials.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create or sign into your Docker account to download the Docker containers
  you need for this tutorial. To learn how to sign up for an account and
  install Docker Desktop, read the signup and download steps in the
  `Docker Hub Quickstart <https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/>`__.

- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

- Optional. Install **git** to download the setup files. To learn how to
  install git, read the `Git Downloads <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__
  page.

Set Up Your Development Environment with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Download the Tutorial Docker Image

      Start Docker Desktop.

      After it completes startup, download the tutorial Docker image which
      contains helper scripts to simplify the commands you need to run in
      the tutorials.

      Run the following command in your terminal to download the image from
      Docker Hub:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         docker pull robwma/mongokafkatutorial

      When the command successfully completes, you should see the following
      output:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         Status: Downloaded newer image for robwma/mongokafkatutorial:latest
         docker.io/robwma/mongokafkatutorial:latest

      If you already have the Docker image in your local repository, you
      should see the following message:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         Status: Image is up to date for robwma/mongokafkatutorial:latest
         docker.io/robwma/mongokafkatutorial:latest

   .. step:: Clone or Download the Tutorial Repository

      Next, clone the tutorial git repository with the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: true

         git clone https://github.com/mongodb-university/kafka-edu.git

      If you do not have git installed, you can download the
      `zip archive <https://github.com/mongodb-university/kafka-edu/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`__
      instead.

   .. step:: Run the Development Environment

      .. _tutorial-setup-run-environment:

      Select the tab that matches your OS for instructions on how to run the
      commands in this guide:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Linux or Mac OS
            :tabid: shell

            Navigate to the tutorial directory "mongodb-kafka-base" within
            the repository or unzipped archive using bash shell. If you
            cloned the repository with git, your command resembles the
            following:

            .. code-block:: bash
               :copyable: true

               cd kafka-edu/docs-examples/source/mongodb-kafka-base/

            Start the Docker image with the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash
               :copyable: true

                sh run.sh

         .. tab:: Windows
            :tabid: powershell

            Navigate to the tutorial directory "mongodb-kafka-base" within
            the repository or unzipped archive using PowerShell.  If you
            cloned the repository with git, your command resembles the
            following:

            .. code-block:: none
               :copyable: true

               cd kafka-edu\docs-examples\source\mongodb-kafka-base\

            Start the Docker image with the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash
               :copyable: true

               powershell .\run.ps1

      .. note::

         If the script exits with the message "Please terminate the local
         mongod on 27017", you must terminate the process that is listening
         on port 27017 before you can continue. After you terminate the
         process, run the script again.

         If you previously started the image in Docker Desktop and have not
         stopped it, the image automatically starts when you launch Docker
         Desktop. If the image is already running, you can proceed to the
         next step.

      The "mongo-kafka-base" image creates a Docker container that includes
      all the services you need in the tutorial and runs them on a shared
      network called "mongodb-kafka-base_localnet" as shown in the following
      diagram:

      .. figure:: /includes/mongo-kafka-base-container.png
         :alt: Diagram that shows the Docker compose containers in mongo-kafka-base

      When the script completes successfully, it outputs the following
      information:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         The following services are running:

         MongoDB on port 27017
         Kafka Broker on 9092
         Kafka Zookeeper on 2181
         Kafka Connect on 8083

   .. step:: Verify the Successful Setup

      Confirm the development environment started normally by running the
      following command from the "mongodb-kafka-base" directory:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Linux or Mac OS
            :tabid: shell

            .. code-block:: bash

               sh status.sh

         .. tab:: Windows
            :tabid: powershell

            .. code-block:: bash
               :copyable: true

               powershell .\status.ps1

      This command should output the following information if the Docker
      development environment was set up successfully:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         Kafka topics:

         [
           <list of kafka topics>
         ]

         The status of the connectors:

         Currently configured connectors

         []

         Version of MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka installed:

         {"class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector","type":"sink","version":"<version>"}
         {"class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector","type":"source","version":"<version>"}

      Since you have not started the connectors, the status and configured
      list are empty.

      Your development environment setup is complete and you can proceed to
      the next step of the tutorial.
