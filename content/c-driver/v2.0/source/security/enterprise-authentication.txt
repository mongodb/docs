Overview
--------

MongoDB Enterprise Edition includes authentication mechanisms that aren't
available in MongoDB Community Edition. 
In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate to MongoDB by using these
authentication mechanisms. To learn about the other authentication mechanisms available
in MongoDB, see :ref:`<c-auth>`.

.. _c-kerberos:

Kerberos
--------

The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) provides an interface for Kerberos
authentication.

.. note::

   To authenticate with GSSAPI, you must build the MongoDB C driver with SASL support.
   If you are building the driver from source, you can enable SASL support with
   the ``ENABLE_SASL`` ``cmake`` option.

Complete the following steps to authenticate with GSSAPI:

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Obtain a Ticket-Granting Ticket

      On Unix environments, you must first run the ``kinit`` command to obtain and cache
      an initial ticket-granting ticket. If you're running a Windows environment,
      you can skip ahead to the next step.

      The following example uses the
      ``kinit`` command to obtain a ticket-granting ticket for the principal
      ``mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM``. It then uses the ``klist``
      command to display the principal and ticket in the credentials cache.
      
      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false
      
         $ kinit mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM
         mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM's Password:
         $ klist
         Credentials cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
                 Principal: mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM
      
         Issued                Expires               Principal
         Feb  9 13:48:51 2013  Feb  9 23:48:51 2013  krbtgt/mongodbuser@EXAMPLE.COM

   .. step:: Set the Connection Options

      Next, set the following connection options:

      - ``username``: The Kerbos principal to authenticate.
      - ``authMechanism``: Set to ``"GSSAPI"``.
      - ``authMechanismProperties``: Optional. By default, MongoDB uses ``mongodb`` as
        the authentication service name. To specify a different service name, set
        this option to ``"SERVICE_NAME:<authentication service name>"``.

      You can set these options through parameters in your connection URI, as shown in
      the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.c
          :language: c
          :copyable: true
          :start-after: // start-kerberos
          :end-before: // end-kerberos

      .. note::

         You must replace the ``@`` symbol in the principal with ``%40``, as shown
         in the preceding example.

      .. include:: /includes/security/auth-properties-commas.rst

.. _c-plain:

PLAIN SASL
----------

The PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), as defined
by `RFC 4616 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4616>`__, is a username-password
authentication mechanism often used with TLS or another encryption layer. You must
compile the {+driver-short+} with SASL support to use PLAIN SASL authentication.

.. important::

   PLAIN SASL is a clear-text authentication mechanism. We strongly recommend that you
   use TLS/SSL with certificate validation when using PLAIN SASL to authenticate to MongoDB.

To authenticate with SASL, set the ``authMechanism`` connection option to ``PLAIN``.
You can set this option through a parameter in your connection string, as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/enterprise-authentication.c
    :language: c
    :copyable: true
    :start-after: // start-plain
    :end-before: // end-plain
