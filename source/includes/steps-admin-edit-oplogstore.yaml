  In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection` column, update any values that
  need to be changed in the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Field
       - Action

     * - <hostname>:<port>

       - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the Oplog Store
         database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

         .. important::

            If these hosts are changed, the Oplog Store database they
            host must have the same data as the original Oplog Store
            database. Changing the host to a new Oplog Store database
            results in data loss.

         - If the Oplog Store database is a Replica Set or Sharded
           Cluster, type a comma-separated list of |mongod| instances
           (for a Replica Set) or |mongos| instances (for a Sharded
           Cluster).

           .. example::

              ``host1.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27018``

         - If the Oplog Store database is a standalone MongoDB
           instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

     * - MongoDB Auth Username

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-username.rst

     * - MongoDB Auth Password

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-password.rst

         .. include:: /includes/warning-plaintext-password.rst

         .. note::

            |onprem| doesn't display the existing
            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.

     * - Encrypted Credentials

       - Select if the credentials for the database were encrypted
         using the
         :doc:`credentialstool </tutorial/encrypt-user-credentials>`.
         The credentials include the Username, Password, |aws| Access
         Key ID and |aws| Secret Key.

     * - Use TLS/SSL

       - Select if the Oplog Store database only accepts connection
         encrypted using |tls|.

         Beyond this checkbox, to connect this oplog store using
         |tls|, you must enable
         :manual:`TLS on the oplog store database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

     * - Connection Options

       - Type any additional :ref:`connection string options
         <connections-connection-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
         This field supports unescaped values only.

     * - Assignment Labels

       - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
         Oplog Stores to specific projects.

     * - Write Concern

       - Select your preferred
         :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

         .. include:: /includes/list-tables/write-concerns.rst

  Select if you want to enable this Oplog Store after creating it. This
  is selected by default so the Oplog Store can be assigned backup
  jobs. If you clear this checkbox, the Oplog Store is created but you
  cannot assign backups to this Oplog Store.

  If you change any connection string values or the Write Concern,
  restart all the |onprem| instances including those running Backup
  Daemons.

  .. warning::

     Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for
     an existing blockstore requires you to restart all |onprem|
     components, including those only running the Backup Daemon to
     apply those changes. Connection parameters include:

     - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
     - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`
     - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`
     - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
     - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

     If you change to another Oplog Store host, the data on the
     existing Oplog Store is not copied automatically to the other
     Oplog Store.

     :manual:`Connection String URI Format </reference/connection-string>`
     in the MongoDB Manual.
