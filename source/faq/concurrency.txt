MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data.
In order to ensure consistency, it uses locking and other
:term:`concurrency control` measures to prevent multiple clients
from modifying the same piece of data simultaneously.
Together, these mechanisms guarantee that all writes to a single
document occur either in full or not at all and that clients never
see an inconsistent view of the data.

What type of locking does MongoDB use?
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-general.rst

In addition to a shared (S) locking mode for reads and an exclusive
(X) locking mode for write operations, intent shared (IS) and intent
exclusive (IX) modes indicate an intent to read or write a resource
using a finer granularity lock.  When locking at a certain granularity,
all higher levels are locked using an :term:`intent lock`.

For example, when locking a collection for writing (using mode X),
both the corresponding database lock and the global lock must be
locked in intent exclusive (IX) mode. A single database can
simultaneously be locked in IS and IX mode, but an exclusive (X)
lock cannot coexist with any other modes, and a shared (S) lock can
only coexists with intent shared (IS) locks.

Locks are fair, with reads and writes being queued in order. However,
to optimize throughput, when one request is granted, all other
compatible requests will be granted at the same time, potentially
releasing them before a conflicting request.  For example, consider
a case in which an X lock was just released, and in which the
conflict queue contains the following items:

IS |rarr| IS |rarr| X |rarr| X |rarr| S |rarr| IS

In strict first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering, only the first two
IS modes would be granted. Instead MongoDB will actually grant all
IS and S modes, and once they all drain, it will grant X, even if
new IS or S requests have been queued in the meantime. As a grant
will always move all other requests ahead in the queue, no starvation
of any request is possible.

How granular are locks in MongoDB?
----------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

For WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with version 3.0, MongoDB ships with the :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine.

.. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-locks.rst

For MMAPv1
~~~~~~~~~~

The MMAPv1 storage engine uses collection-level locking as of the
3.0 release series, an improvement on earlier versions in which the
database lock was the finest-grain lock. Third-party storage engines
may either use collection-level locking or implement their own
finer-grained concurrency control.

For example, if you have six collections in a database using the
MMAPv1 storage engine and an operation takes a collection-level write lock,
the other five collections are still available for read and write operations.
An exclusive database lock makes all six collections unavailable
for the duration of the operation holding the lock.

How do I see the status of locks on my :program:`mongod` instances?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For reporting on lock utilization information on locks, use any of the
following methods:

- :method:`db.serverStatus()`,
- :method:`db.currentOp()`,
- :doc:`mongotop </reference/program/mongotop>`,
- :doc:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat>`, and/or
- the |mms-home| or
  :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
  </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`

Specifically, the :serverstatus:`locks` document in the :doc:`output of
serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>`, or the :data:`~currentOp.locks` field
in the :doc:`current operation reporting </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
provides insight into the type of locks and amount of lock
contention in your :program:`mongod` instance.

To terminate an operation, use :method:`db.killOp()`.

.. include:: /includes/replacement-mms.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-yielding:

Does a read or write operation ever yield the lock?
---------------------------------------------------

In some situations, read and write operations can yield their locks.

Long running read and write operations, such as queries, updates,
and deletes, yield under many conditions.  MongoDB operations can
also yield locks between individual document modifications in write
operations that affect multiple documents like
:method:`~db.collection.update()` with the ``multi`` parameter.

MongoDB's :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine uses
heuristics based on its access pattern to predict whether data is
likely in physical memory before performing a read. If MongoDB
*predicts* that the data is not in physical memory, an operation
will yield its lock while MongoDB loads the data into memory. Once
data is available in memory, the operation will reacquire the lock
to complete the operation.

For storage engines supporting document level :term:`concurrency
control`, such as :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>`, yielding is not
necessary when accessing storage as the :term:`intent locks <intent
lock>`, held at the global, database and collection level, do not block
other readers and writers.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   MongoDB does not yield locks when scanning an index even if it
   predicts that the index is not in memory.

.. _faq-concurrency-operations-locks:

Which operations lock the database?
-----------------------------------

The following table lists common database operations and the types of
locks they use.

.. todo In the table below (in the include), the issue of blocked
   JavaScript might no longer apply in version 2.4, which will use V8.

.. include:: /includes/table/lock-behavior-per-operation.rst

Which administrative commands lock the database?
------------------------------------------------

Certain administrative commands can exclusively lock the database for
extended periods of time. In some deployments, for large databases,
you may consider taking the :program:`mongod` instance offline so that
clients are not affected. For example, if a :program:`mongod` is part
of a :term:`replica set`, take the :program:`mongod` offline and let
other members of the set service load while maintenance is in progress.

The following administrative operations require an exclusive
lock at the database level for extended periods:

- :method:`db.collection.createIndex()`, when issued
  *without* setting ``background`` to ``true``,
- :dbcommand:`reIndex`,
- :dbcommand:`compact`,
- :method:`db.repairDatabase()`,
- :method:`db.createCollection()`, when creating a very large
  (i.e. many gigabytes) capped collection,
- :method:`db.collection.validate()`, and
- :method:`db.copyDatabase()`. This operation may lock all
  databases. See :ref:`faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs`.

The following administrative commands lock the database but only hold
the lock for a very short time:

- :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()`,
- :method:`db.getLastError()`,
- :method:`db.isMaster()`,
- :method:`rs.status()` (i.e. :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`),
- :method:`db.serverStatus()`,
- :method:`db.auth()`, and
- :method:`db.addUser()`.

.. _faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs:

Does a MongoDB operation ever lock more than one database?
----------------------------------------------------------

The following MongoDB operations lock multiple databases:

- :method:`db.copyDatabase()` must lock the entire :program:`mongod`
  instance at once.

- :method:`db.repairDatabase()` obtains a global write lock and will block
  other operations until it finishes.

- :term:`Journaling <journal>`, which is an internal operation, locks
  all databases for short intervals. All databases share a single
  journal.

- :doc:`User authentication </core/authentication>` requires a read
  lock on the ``admin`` database for deployments using :ref:`2.6 user
  credentials <admin-system-users-collection>`. For deployments using
  the 2.4 schema for user credentials, authentication locks the
  ``admin`` database as well as the database the user is accessing.

- All writes to a replica set's :term:`primary` lock both the database
  receiving the writes and then the ``local`` database for a short
  time. The lock for the ``local`` database allows the
  :program:`mongod` to write to the primary's :term:`oplog` and
  accounts for a small portion of the total time of the operation.

How does sharding affect concurrency?
-------------------------------------

:term:`Sharding <sharding>` improves concurrency by distributing
collections over multiple :program:`mongod` instances, allowing shard
servers (i.e. :program:`mongos` processes) to perform any number of
operations concurrently to the various downstream :program:`mongod`
instances.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-sharding.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-replication:

How does concurrency affect a replica set primary?
--------------------------------------------------

With replica sets, when MongoDB writes to a collection on the
:term:`primary`, MongoDB also writes to the primary's :term:`oplog`,
which is a special collection in the ``local`` database. Therefore,
MongoDB must lock both the collection's database and the ``local``
database. The :program:`mongod` must lock both databases at the same
time to keep the database consistent and ensure that write operations,
even with replication, are "all-or-nothing" operations.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-replica-set-primary.rst

How does concurrency affect secondaries?
----------------------------------------

In :term:`replication`, MongoDB does not apply writes serially to
:term:`secondaries <secondary>`. Secondaries collect oplog entries in
batches and then apply those batches in parallel. Secondaries do not
allow reads while applying the write operations, and apply write
operations in the order that they appear in the oplog.

Does MongoDB support transactions?
----------------------------------

MongoDB does not support multi-document transactions.

However, MongoDB does provide atomic operations on a single
document. Often these document-level atomic operations are sufficient
to solve problems that would require ACID transactions in a relational
database.

For example, in MongoDB, you can embed related data in nested arrays or
nested documents within a single document and update the entire
document in a single atomic operation. Relational databases might
represent the same kind of data with multiple tables and rows, which
would require transaction support to update the data atomically.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/write-operations-atomicity`

What isolation guarantees does MongoDB provide?
-----------------------------------------------

MongoDB provides the following guarantees in the presence of concurrent read and
write operations. These guarantees hold on systems configured with either the
MMAPv1 or WiredTiger storage engines.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-single-document-write.rst

#. Correctness with respect to query predicates, e.g.
   :method:`db.collection.find()` will only return documents that match and
   :method:`db.collection.update()` will only write to matching documents.

#. Correctness with respect to sort. For read operations that request a sort
   order (e.g. :method:`db.collection.find()` or
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`), the sort order will not be violated due
   to concurrent writes.

Although MongoDB provides these strong guarantees for single-document
operations, read and write operations may access an arbitrary number of
documents during execution.  Multi-document operations do *not* occur
transactionally and are not isolated from concurrent writes. This means that the
following behaviors are expected under the normal operation of the system,
for both the MMAPv1 and WiredTiger storage engines:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-multi-document-writes-no-isolation.rst

.. seealso:: :doc:`/core/write-operations-atomicity`

Can reads see changes that have not been committed to disk?
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   MongoDB 3.2 introduced the :ref:`3.2-rel-notes-readConcern` option.
   Clients using :readconcern:`majority` ``readConcern`` cannot see the
   results of writes before they are made :term:`durable`.

Readers using :readconcern:`"local"` ``readConcern`` can see the
results of writes before they are made :term:`durable`, regardless of
write concern level or journaling configuration. As a result,
applications may observe the following behaviors:

#. MongoDB will allow a concurrent reader to see the result of the write
   operation before the write is acknowledged to the client application. For details
   on when writes are acknowledged for different write concern levels, see
   :doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

#. Reads can see data which may subsequently be rolled back in cases such
   as replica set failover or power loss. It does *not* mean that read operations
   can see documents in a partially written or otherwise inconsistent state.

Other systems refer to these semantics as *read uncommitted*.
