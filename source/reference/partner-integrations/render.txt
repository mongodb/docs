You can connect Render-hosted applications to an |service| {+cluster+}.

Use this page to complete the following tasks:

- Create and configure an |service| {+cluster+}.
- Connect to your Render-hosted application.

To learn more, see `the Render documentation <https://docs.render.com/connect-to-mongodb-atlas>`__.

Considerations
--------------

- To connect a Render-hosted application to an |service| {+cluster+}, 
  you must select |aws| as the cloud provider for your |service| 
  {+cluster+}.

Create and Configure an |service| {+Cluster+}
---------------------------------------------

To create and configure a {+cluster+} in the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create an |service| account or sign in to |service|.

      `Create an Atlas account or sign in to an existing account 
      <https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_atlas>`__.

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` dialog.

      Do one of the following steps:
    
      - Click :guilabel:`Build a Cluster`.
      - Click :guilabel:`Create`.

   .. step:: Select a {+cluster+} type.

      To learn more, see :ref:`create-cluster-instance`.

   .. step:: Specify a name for the {+cluster+}.

   .. step:: Select the |aws| provider.

   .. step:: Select a region.

      Select the |aws| region closest to the region where your 
      Render-hosted application is deployed.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 20 40 40
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Render Region
           - AWS Region
           - |service| region

         * - ``Oregon, USA``
           - ``us-west-2``
           - ``US_WEST_2``

         * - ``Ohio, USA``
           - | **Dedicated tier:** ``us-east-2``
             | **Shared tier:**  ``us-east-1``
           - | **Dedicated tier:** ``US_EAST_2``
             | **Shared tier:**  ``US_EAST_2``

         * - ``Virginia, USA``
           - ``us-east-1``
           - ``US_EAST_1``

         * - ``Frankfurt, Germany``
           - ``eu-central-1``
           - ``EU_CENTRAL_1``

         * - ``Singapore``
           - ``ap-southeast-1``
           - ``AP_SOUTHEAST_1``

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Deployment`.
   
   .. step:: Specify how you would like to authenticate the connection to your |service| {+cluster+}.

      In the :guilabel:`How would you like to authenticate your 
      connection?` section of the :guilabel:`Quickstart` page, you can 
      configure one of the following options for your {+cluster+}.

      You can create environment variables for the following values in 
      your Render service that connects to |service|.
      
      .. tabs:: 
      
         .. tab:: Username and Password
            :tabid: pwd
      
            a. Click :guilabel:`Username and Password`. 

            #. Set the new user's :guilabel:`Username` and 
               :guilabel:`Password`.
      
            #. Click :guilabel:`Create User`.
      
         .. tab:: Certificate 
            :tabid: cert
      
            a. Click :guilabel:`Certificate`. MongoDB uses X.509 
               certificates for passwordless authentication.

            #. Specify the Common Name (CN) for the new user.

            #. *Optional*. Toggle the :guilabel:`Download certificate 
               when user is added` to :guilabel:`On` to download the 
               certificate after creating the user. 
      
               If you choose to download the certificate, you must also 
               specify certificate expiration. To specify the duration, 
               choose the duration for the certificate from 
               the dropdown. You can set the certificate expiration to 
               ``3``, ``6``, ``12``, or ``24`` months.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Add User`. 
      
               The new user is granted :authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write` role by default.
      
   .. step:: Specify from where you would like to connect to your |service| {+cluster+}.

      You can enable access for any network that needs to read and write 
      data to your {+cluster+}. To enable access, you can configure access from the Render cloud environment to your {+cluster+}.
      
      a. Choose :guilabel:`Cloud Environment` to configure network 
         access between |service| and your Render environment.

      #. Add your Render service's static outbound IP addresses.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Finish and Close`.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Go to Overview` to view your {+cluster+}.


Connect to Your Render-Hosted Application
-----------------------------------------

You can view a connection string in the {+atlas-ui+} and use it to 
connect to your Render-hosted application.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: View your connection string in the {+atlas-ui+}.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button for your {+cluster+}.

      #. Select the :guilabel:`Standard Connection` type.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Choose a connection method`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Drivers`.

         To learn more, see :driver:`Drivers </>`.

      #. Select the driver, install the driver, and copy the 
         connection string.

      To learn more, see 
      :manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string>`.

   .. step:: Connect to your Render-hosted application.

      a. Return to your Render dashboard.

      #. Create environment variables to authenticate the connection to 
         your |service| {+cluster+}.

         To learn more, see `Environment Variables and Secrets 
         <https://docs.render.com/configure-environment-variables>`__ 
         in the Render documentation.

      #. Add the connection string to your application code.
