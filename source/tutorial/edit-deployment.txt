You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>` or
:term:`replica set` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.

            All Changes are Clusterwide
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Changes cannot be made to individual members of a replica
            set or sharded cluster, only to the whole set or cluster.

            Kubernetes Operator Overrides Some Ops Manager Settings
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Some settings that you configure using |k8s-op-short|
            cannot be overridden in the |application|. If you change
            one of these settings, the |k8s-op-short| reverts the
            settings each time you apply the resource specification.
            Settings that the |k8s-op-short| does not manage are
            accepted.

            The following list of settings are exclusive to |k8s|. This
            list may change at a later date.

            These settings can be found on the :doc:`Automation
            Configuration </reference/api/automation-config>` page.

            - ``processes.args2_6.net.port``
            - ``processes.args2_6.replication.replSetName``
            - ``processes.args2_6.storage.dbPath``
            - ``processes.args2_6.systemLog.path``
            - ``processes.authSchemaVersion``
            - ``processes.cluster`` (mongos processes)
            - ``processes.featureCompatibilityVersion``
            - ``processes.hostname``
            - ``processes.name``
            - ``processes.version``
            - ``replicaSets._id``
            - ``replicaSets.members._id``
            - ``replicaSets.members.host``
            - ``replicaSets.members``
            - ``replicaSets.version``
            - ``sharding.clusterRole`` (config server)
            - ``sharding.configServerReplica``
            - ``sharding.name``
            - ``sharding.shards._id``
            - ``sharding.shards.rs``

            .. example::

               - |k8s-op-short| creates a replica set of 3 members.
               - You changed
                 :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB`
                 to ``40``.
               - You then scale the replica set to 5 members.
               - The :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB` on the new members should be ``40``.

            Changes not available in Kubernetes
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            If a setting is not available for a MongoDB Kubernetes
            resource, then the change must be made in the
            |application|.

      tabs:
        - id: ui
          name: User Interface
          content: |

            Your deployment must be running a version of the
            {+aagent+} that is compatible with |mms|. If
            your deployment is not running a compatible version of the
            agent, |mms| displays a banner prompting you to update your
            agents.

            You must have enough disk space in the parent directory to perform 
            backups before making storage engine changes on standalone processes.
            We recommend using replica sets instead of standalone processes, which 
            apply changes in a rolling fashion.

            To update a MongoDB Kubernetes object, you need
            to meet the prerequisites for, and complete the procedures
            on, the
            :k8s:`Install Kubernetes Operator </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`
            page.

            1. Edit the |k8s| resource specification file.

            2. Modify or add any settings you need added or changed.

            3. Save your specification file.

            4. Invoke the following |k8s| command to update your resource.

               .. code-block:: sh

                  kubectl apply -f <standalone-conf>.yaml
