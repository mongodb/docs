In a default configuration, the Automation Agents and Backup Daemons
access MongoDB binaries over the internet from |company|

If your environment precludes opening all hosts to the internet, you can choose to:

1. Expose only your |onprem| deployment to the internet. This is
   running |onprem| in :guilabel:`Local Mode`.
2. Expose neither your |onprem| deployment nor your MongoDB hosts to 
   the internet. This is running |onprem| in :guilabel:`Hybrid Mode`.

        To manage MongoDB hosts and run |onprem| without internet 
        access, you must run |onprem| in :guilabel:`Local Mode`. 
        Neither the MongoDB hosts with Automation Agents nor |onprem| 
        hosts with Backup Daemons can download and then install or
        upgrade MongoDB deployments until you:

        - Download the MongoDB installer binaries for each edition, 
          version, and platform you need to support from another 
          internet-connected device.
        - Load the MongoDB installer binaries to each |onprem| host.
        - Update the :term:`version manifest`.

        The following tutorial outlines the steps to run in 
        :guilabel:`Local Mode`.

        To manage MongoDB hosts without internet access, you must run 
        |onprem| in :guilabel:`Hybrid Mode`. |onprem| hosts download 
        MongoDB installer binaries from the internet. MongoDB hosts 
        with Automation Agents download these installers from the 
        |onprem| hosts and then install or upgrade MongoDB deployments.

        The following tutorial outlines the steps to run in 
        :guilabel:`Hybrid Mode`.


Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Community for Windows with SSL Incompatibility 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Community Edition for Microsoft Windows with SSL support
is incompatible with :guilabel:`Local Mode`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install Enterprise Dependencies (MongoDB Enterprise Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan on running :term:`MongoDB Enterprise` on Linux servers,
then you must manually install a set of dependencies to each server
**before installing MongoDB**. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. See the link for the
server's platform:

        Required User Role to Change Mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To configure :guilabel:`Local Mode`, you must have 
        :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to |onprem|.

        .. _local-mode-determine-versions:
        
        Determine which Binaries to Store Locally and Download
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Download the binaries associated to each MongoDB version you
        want to support in your |onprem|\-managed deployments:
        
        - To import existing deployments into |onprem|, you need 
          versions of the binaries that correspond to these 
          deployments.
        
        - To create via |onprem| Automation new deployments, you need 
          versions of the binaries that correspond to these 
          deployments.
        
        - To upgrade existing deployment to a new version via 
          |onprem|, you need both the current version, upgrade 
          version, and versions used in intermediary step or steps.
        
          .. example::
        
             If you import an existing deployment of MongoDB 2.6 
             Community and want to upgrade it to MongoDB 3.0 
             Enterprise, you must download and store all archived 
             binaries for:
        
             - MongoDB 2.6 Community Edition
             - MongoDB 3.0 Community Edition
             - MongoDB 3.0 Enterprise Edition
        
        You do not need to download the archived MongoDB binary for
        every platform, only the one(s) in your current and planned
        MongoDB deployments.
