  Add the repository so that you can install MongoDB using ``zypper``.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0

     .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-3.0-linux-package-repo-tutorial.rst

  - heading: For MongoDB 3.6
    pre: |
      Run the command appropriate for your version of SUSE:

      SUSE 12
        .. class:: copyable-code
        .. code-block:: sh

           sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/" mongodb

  - heading: For versions of MongoDB *earlier* than 3.6
    pre: |
      To install MongoDB packages from a previous :ref:`release
      series <release-version-numbers>` such as 3.4, you can
      specify the release series in the repository configuration.

      For example, to restrict your SUSE 12 system to the 3.4 release
      series, use the following command:
    copyable: true
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/ mongodb

title: Install the MongoDB packages.
stepnum: 3
ref: install
# pre: |
#   When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
#   release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper -n install mongodb-org
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
      will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
      command:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock.rst
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
