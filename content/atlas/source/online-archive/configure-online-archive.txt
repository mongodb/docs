Overview
--------

You can configure data in a collection to be archived by specifying an 
archiving rule. The archiving rule for a: 

- Time series collection is a combination of a time that is used to 
  determine when to archive data and a numeric value representing the 
  number of days that the |service| cluster stores the data.
- Standard collection can be one of the following: 

  - A combination of a date that is used to determine when to archive 
    data and a numeric value representing the number of days that the 
    |service| cluster stores the data. 
  - A custom query that is used to select the documents to archive.

To configure your |service| cluster for online archive: 

1. Create an archiving rule by providing the collection namespace and 
   the criteria for selecting data to archive in the collection.

2. (Optional) Specify commonly queried fields to partition archived   
   data.

When you configure an {+Online-Archive+} on your {+cluster+}, |service|
creates 2 {+fdi+}\s on your {+cluster+} for your archive only and for
your {+cluster+} and archive.

.. note::

   Your |service| cluster must be healthy prior to initiating {+Online-Archive+}.
   For example, if one node is down, it will remain in ``PENDING`` status.

Required Access
---------------

To create an {+Online-Archive+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` 
access or higher to the project.

To watch for an archive to be available, you must have :authrole:`Project Read Only` 
access or higher to the project.

.. _config-online-archive-api:

Configure Online Archive Through the API  
----------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/data-size-threshold.rst

To configure an online archive from the API, send a ``POST`` request to 
the :oas-atlas-tag:`onlineArchives </Online-Archive>` endpoint.

.. note::

   If you use the ``DATE`` criteria, you must specify the ``date`` field
   as part of the partition keys.

If the  cluster already has an ``Active`` online archive with the same 
archiving rule for the same database and collection, the operation will 
fail. However, if the existing online archive is in ``Paused`` or 
``Deleted`` state, the new online archive is created and its status is 
set to ``Active``. To learn more about the syntax and options, see 
:oas-atlas-op:`API </createOneOnlineArchive>`.

.. _config-online-archive-limitations:

Limitations 
-----------

You can create up to 50 online archives per cluster and up to 20 can be 
active per cluster. The following limitations apply:

- You can configure multiple online archives in the same namespace, but 
  only one can be active at any given time. 
- You can't create multiple online archives on the same fields in the 
  same collection.
- You can't access your online archive during the following scenarios:

  - A full outage of the primary region of your {+cluster+}.
  - An outage of |aws| |s3| where your archived data is stored.

- You can't use an archiving rule for more than one collection. 

  .. note::
     
     If your goal is to archive data from several collections,
     you must create an archiving rule for each collection.

-  You can't archive data below the size of 5 MiB after 7 days. For 7
   days immediately after |service| creates an archive, |service| 
   archives all data. After 7 days, |service| archives data only when
   your data size reaches 5 MiB. 

- Avoid updating or inserting documents that meet the archival condition when |service| 
  is archiving data. Otherwise, |service| might capture an inconsistent snapshot 
  of the data during the archival run. If updates occur, the version of the document 
  that gets archived is uncertain.
