  You will be prompted to enter the password you specified when you
  created your MongoDB user in |service|.

  You should now be connected to your |service| cluster within the
  Mongo shell. Your terminal should display something similar to
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none
     :copyable: false

  .. admonition:: Connection Troubleshooting
     :class: important

     If you are having trouble connecting to your cluster, double
     check that you have added your IP address to your
     :ref:`IP whitelist <gswa-whitelist>` and that you are specifying
     the correct :ref:`MongoDB user credentials <gswa-user>`. If you
     have forgotten your MongoDB user credentials, you can always
     :ref:`create a new MongoDB user <mongodb-users>`.
