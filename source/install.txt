Install the MMS Agent
---------------------

.. _mms-requirements:

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines MMS's prerequisite requirements and provides
basic instructions for fulfilling them. If you are installing the MMS
agent on a Windows host, skip to the :ref:`window instructions
<windows-installation>` section.

1. Your MongoDB instances (i.e. ``mongod`` and ``mongos``) must be
   version 1.6 or newer.

.. index:: requirements; Python

2. You must have Python 2.4 or greater.

   .. note::

      The MMS Agent does not provide support the PyPy implementation
      of Python.

      The MMS Agent does not support the Python 3.x series of Python.

.. index:: requirements; setuptools
   single: setuptools

3. You'll need Python's `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.

   Most operating systems (i.e. distributions) package setuptools. For
   example, Debian and Ubuntu users can use the following command to
   install the package: ::

        sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

   For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) CentOS, or Fedora users, the
   the following command will install the package: ::

        sudo yum install python-setuptools

.. index:: hmac
   single: requirements; Python 2.4 Installation

4. If your system is running Python 2.4, you will need to install the
   following Python modules:

   - ``hmac``
   - ``hashlib``

   Issue the following command: ::

        sudo easy_install hmac hashlib

   .. index:: simplejson
      single: requirements; For Python 2.5

   .. note::

      The latest version of the agent includes no other Python module
      dependencies. If you're installing version 1.4 of the agent
      (legacy) you will also need to install the ``simplejson``
      module.

      For users of Python 2.4, you will need to install ``simplejson``
      version 2.1.0. Install this module with the following command: ::

          sudo easy_install simplejson==2.1.0

      For users of Python 2.5, you will need to install the simplejson
      with the following command: ::

          sudo easy_install simplejson

   Do not use ``pip`` to install modules when using Python 2.4 or 2.5,
   as there are some compatibility issues. Some users have reported
   problems installing ``hmac``, if ``easy_install`` produces an error
   or you suspect a problem with these libraries see
   :ref:`instructions for installing hmac manually
   <troubleshooting-hmac>`.

.. index:: requirements; PyMongo Installation

5. All users must install `PyMongo  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_,
   the Python driver for MongoDB. While the C extensions are
   not required, they significantly improve performance. To install
   these extensions, make sure you have a C compiler (e.g. ``gcc``)
   and Python header files installed on your system. Debian and Ubuntu
   users should issue the following command: ::

        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

   Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora Users should issue the following
   command: ::

        sudo yum install gcc python-devel

   Use the latest possible version of PyMongo for the best possible
   speed and stability. The agent is not compatible with versions of
   PyMongo before 1.9. If you have not installed ``pymongo`` issue the
   following command to install the latest version: ::

        sudo easy_install pymongo

   To upgrade to the latest version of the driver, use the following
   command: ::

        sudo easy_install -U pymongo

   For more information concerning PyMongo installation, see the `the
   PyMongo documentation <http://api.mongodb.org/python/2.0.1/installation.html>`_.

.. index:: troubleshooting; proxies

6. If your datacenter requires that you proxy outbound connections
   through a gateway, you must use a version of Python greater than
   2.6.1. Additionally, you will need export the "``https_proxy``"
   environment variable (or "``HTTPS_PROXY``" on Windows.)

Consider the ``README`` file distributed with the agent for more
information. When all dependencies are successfully installed, you may
proceed to installing the agent.

.. index:: installation; UNIX/Linux

Install Agent Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not downloaded the MMS agent already, click the "download
agent" link immediately after you sign into MMS
(e.g. <http://mms.10gen.com> to download an agent specifically
configured for your account. See the ":doc:`deployment`" document for
more information regarding the agent itself.

You can run the agent on any system that can connect to the MongoDB
instances you want to monitor. As long as it can connect to each
instance, you can use a single agent to do all the monitoring. Do be
sure that the agent can make outgoing connections via HTTPS on port
443.

Unzip the archive and run the agent with the following command: ::

     python agent.py

This starts two processes: a parent to monitor the agent daemon and
perform automatic upgrades and a child process to collect data.

.. warning:: If your MongoDB instance has thousands of databases or
   collections, you will want to disable database statistics
   collection. See ":ref:`Database and Collection statistics
   <db-stats-warning>`" for more information.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Automated Installation <automated-agent-installation>`"
   to see how you can download a copy of the agent without the
   automatic configuration and then install and manually configure the
   MMS agent.

Running the MMS Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above command is sufficient for testing the MMS agent. For production
deployments, you will want to daemonize the process and ensure
that it restarts following a system restart. Your operating system
likely has a preferred method for managing daemon processes.

As a temporary measure, the following command will start the agent
process detached from the current terminal session: ::

     nohup python agent.py > /[LOG-DIRECTORY]/agent.log 2>&1 &

Replace "``[LOG-DIRECTORY]`` with the path to your MongoDB logs.

This command allows the agent survive the current terminal session and
writes all messages to the ``agent.log`` file. You may include this
command in your MongoDB control script or use your system's
``/etc/rc.local`` equivalent; however, avoid running the agent as
root.

See the ":doc:`deployment`" document for more information on
strategies for deploying the agent and your monitoring
architecture. If your datacenter requires that you route outbound
https connections via a proxy, export the "``https_proxy``"
environment variable (or "``HTTPS_PROXY``" on Windows.) Issue the
following command before running the agent: ::

     export https_proxy='http://proxyserver.example.net:port"

Replace "``http://proxyserver.example.net``" with the name or IP
address of the proxy server and "``port`` with the TCP port that the
proxy service runs on. You may choose to export this variable inside
of your control script.

Once the agent is running, you can return to the web interface to
begin configuring MMS for your deployment.

.. _windows-installation:

.. index:: installation; Windows

Installing MMS on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MMS agent distribution includes a ``WINDOWS.txt`` file with
instructions for using the agent on Windows platforms. Consider the
following special requirements:

- If you do not have a 2.x-series Python installation on your system,
  install the latest version of Python 2.7.x. If your system supports
  64-bit executable, use the 64-bit version.

- Use the Windows installer to install `PyMongo from PyPi
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_. Ensure that you install
  the correct PyMongo build for your Python installation both in terms
  of version number (e.g .2.6, 2.7, etc.) and system architecture
  (e.g. 32 or 64-bit.)

  See the `Python Download Page <http://www.python.org/download/>`_ for
  the most up to date Python distribution downloads, or use the direct
  link for the `Python 2.7 64-bit Windows
  Installer <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.amd64.msi>`_.

- If you do not have Windows PowerShell version 2.0 to install,
  install it now. PowerShell is available as part of the `Windows
  Management Framework <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929>`_.

  Check your installed version of PowerShell by starting a PowerShell
  command window and issuing the following command: ::

       Get-Host

  Install the correct version if your version number is lower than
  2.0.

- Enable script execution in PowerShell. After installing the correct
  version, right click the PowerShell icon in the "Start Menu," and
  run PowerShell as administrator. Issue the following command: ::

       Get-ExecutionPolicy

  This returns the current execution policy. Save this value for
  future use. If the policy is "``Unrestricted``" you can proceed to
  the next step. If the policy is not "``Unrestricted``" issue the
  following command: ::

       Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

  Confirm the policy change when prompted.

- Start an administrator command window. Change to the folder
  containing the MMS agent files. Run ``mongommsinstall.bat``. If this
  succeeds, the MMS agent will be running and will start on system
  boot.

Now you can start and stop the Windows service to control the MMS
agent. Consult the ``WINDOWS.txt`` file for more information.

If you have changed the execution policy, after the installation has
completed successfully set it back to its original value using the
following command: ::

     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy <original value>

Replace "``<original value>``" with the value that you recorded above.

.. index:: installation; PyMongo C Extensions

Installing PyMongo C Extensions
-------------------------------

.. note::

   The C extensions for PyMongo are *strongly* recommended for
   use with the MMS agent because they provide the agent with greater
   performance and reduced resource requirements.

If you installed PyMongo *with* the C extensions (i.e. on a
system with a C compiler, or using the Windows installer) then you can
disregard this section. Otherwise use the following procedure to
reinstall your agent with C extensions.

1. Install ``gcc``, a C compiler, and the necessary development
   packages:

   Debian and Ubuntu users should issue the following command: ::

        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

   Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora Users should issue the following
   command: ::

        sudo yum install gcc python-devel

2. Install the ``pip`` utility so that you can uninstall the existing
   instance of PyMongo, by issuing the following command: ::

        sudo easy_install pip

3. Remove the existing copy of PyMongo with the following command: ::

        sudo pip uninstall pymongo

4. Now re-install PyMongo with the following command: ::

        sudo pip install pymongo

After upgrading PyMongo, you will need to restart your MMS agent to
receive the full effect of the improvement.

.. note::

   When you restart your agent there is a 5 minute timeout before the
   agent will begin sending data to MMS again.

.. index:: agent; updating

.. only:: saas

   Updating the MMS Agent
   ----------------------

   The agent automatically updates itself following release of versions
   of the agent.

   Auto-updating requires that agent run as a user which is capable of
   writing files to the directory that contains the agent. To manually
   update the agent, stop both agent processes, download the latest agent
   from the "Settings" page of the MMS console, and start the agent
   again.

Working with MMS
----------------

Monitoring Hosts with MMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MMS agent automatically discovers MongoDB processes based on
existing cluster configuration. You'll have to manually "seed" at
least one of these hosts from the MMS console.

.. index:: adding hosts
   single: hosts; adding

To add a host to MMS, click the "plus" (``+``) button next to the word
"Hosts," at the top-center of the Hosts page. This raises a query
element for the hostname, port, and optionally an admin DB username and
password. Provide the necessary information and select "Add."

.. index:: host discovery
   single: hosts; discovery

Once it has a seed host, the agent will discover any other nodes
from associated clusters. These clusters, and their respective seed
hosts, include:

- Master databases, after adding slave databases.

- Shard clusters, after adding ``mongos`` instances.

- Replica sets, after adding any member of the set.

Once you add these seed nodes, the MMS agent will fetch this
information *from* the MMS servers. Thus, when configuring the
monitoring environment, you may need to wait for several update cycles
(e.g. 5-10 minutes) to complete the auto-discovery process and host
identification. During this period, you may see duplicate hosts in the
MMS web console. This is normal.

The agent fetches configuration and reports to MMS every minute, so,
again, there may be a delay of several minutes before data and host
information propagate to the MMS console.

You can find immediate evidence of a working installation in the agent
output or logs. For more information, check the MMS console's "Hosts,"
section in the "Agent Log" and "Pings" tabs. Once MMS has data, you
can view and begin using the statistics.

.. index:: agent timeout
   single: agent; timeout
   single: timeout

If the agent cannot collect information about a host for 24 hours, the
MMS system deactivates the instance in the MMS agent and
console. Deactivated hosts must be manually reactivated from the MMS
console if you wish to collect data from these hosts.

.. index:: munin
   single: hardware monitoring
.. _mms-munin:

Hardware Monitoring with Munin-Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MMS provides support for collecting and charting hardware statistics
collected with `Munin <http://munin-monitoring.org/>`_. You must
install the ``munin-node`` package on each the host system that you
wish to monitor.

.. note::

   ``munin-node``, and hardware monitoring is only available for
   MongoDB instances running on Linux hosts.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, use the "``sudo apt-get install
munin-node``" command. Red Hat, CentOS and Fedora users should issue
the "``sudo yum install munin-node``" command. Ensure that
``munin-node``:

- is running. Use the command, "``ps -ef | grep "munin"``" to confirm. If
  the process is not running, issue the command
  "``/etc/init.d/munin-node start``".

- will start following the next system reboot. This is the default
  behavior on most Debian-based systems. Red Hat and related
  distributions should use the "``chkconfig``" command, to configure
  this behavior (i.e. "``chkconfig munin-node on``")

- is accessible from the system running the agent. ``munin-node`` uses
  port 4949, which needs to be open on the monitored system, so the
  agent can access this data source. Use the following procedure to
  test access: ::

       telnet [HOSTNAME] 4949
       fetch iostat
       fetch iostat_ios
       fetch cpu

  Replace ``[HOSTNAME]`` with the hostname of the monitored
  system. Run these commands from the system where the MMS Agent is
  running. If these "``fetch``" commands return data, then
  ``munin-node`` is running and accessible by MMS agent.

If ``munin-node`` is running but inaccessible, make sure that you have
access granted for the system running the MMS agent and that no
firewalls block the port between ``munin-node`` and the agent. You may
find the ``munin-node`` configuration at
"``/etc/munin-node/munin-node.conf``" or "``/etc/munin-node.conf``",
depending on your distribution.

Additional considerations:

- If you have numbered disk devices (e.g. ``/dev/sda1`` and
  ``/dev/sda2``) then you will need to configure support for numbered
  disk in the munin iostat plugin. Find the configuration file at
  ``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node`` or a similar path, and add
  the following value: ::

       [iostat]
           env.SHOW_NUMBERED 1

- If you have Munin enabled and do not have ``iostat ios`` data in
  your Munin charts, your ``munin-node`` may not have write access to
  required state files in its ``munin/plugin-state/`` directory. See
  the ``munin-node`` plugin log (i.e. ``/var/log/munin/munin-node.log``
  or similar depending on your distribution) for more information.

  The full path of this state directory directory depends on the
  system, but is typically ``/var/lib/munin/plugin-state/``. Run the
  following command sequence to correct this issue: ::

       touch /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/iostat-ios.state
       chown -R [username]:[group] /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/
       chmod -R 660 /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/

  Replace ``[username]`` and ``[group]`` with the username and group
  that the ``munin-node`` process runs with.

If you encounter any other problems, check the log files for
``munin-node`` to ensure that there are no errors with
Munin. ``munin-node`` writes logs files in the ``/var/log/`` directory
on the monitored system.

.. _ssl:

Using SSL with MMS
------------------

MMS can monitor MongoDB instances running with SSL. To use SSL with
``mongod`` and ``mongos``, you must enable it at compile time, or use
one of the `subscriber builds <http://www.10gen.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download>`_.
MongoDB added SSL support in version 2.0.

To monitor a host with SSL enabled, you can either:

1. Edit the ``settings.py`` file in your agent installation, so that
   the ``useSslForAllConnections`` value is ``True``, as follows: ::

        useSslForAllConnections = True

   Then restart the agent. After restarting the agent you may observe
   a five minute delay before MMS receives data from the agent.

2. Enable support on a per-host basis in the MMS console, by clicking
   on the edit (i.e. "Pencil") button on the right hand-side of the
   "Hosts" page. In the dialogue that pops up, click the check-box on
   the SSL tab.

   If you enable SSL support globally you **will not** be able to
   override this setting on a per-host basis.

.. _troubleshooting:

.. index:: troubleshooting
   single: agent; troubleshooting

Basic Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following issues if you encounter difficulty installing
the MMS agent.

- Make sure that the system running the agent has ``pymongo``
  installed. If your system runs a 2.4.x series Python, verify the
  installation of other :ref:`requirements <mms-requirements>`.

- Ensure that the system running the agent can resolve and connect to the
  MongoDB instances. To confirm, log into the system where the agent
  is running and issue a command in the following form: ::

       mongo [hostname]:[port]

  Replace ``[hostname]`` with the hostname and ``[port]`` with the
  port that the database is listening on.

- Verify that the agent can connect on TCP port 443 (outbound) to the MMS
  server (i.e. "``mms.10gen.com``".)

- Allow the agent to run for 5-10 minutes to allow host discovery
  and initial data collection.

- If your MongoDB instances run with authentication enabled, ensure
  that MMS has these credentials. Supply these credentials on the "Add
  Host Interface," for every host that has authentication enabled, when
  adding a host. You may also click on the "Edit" host button (i.e. the
  pencil) on the Hosts page in the MMS console to provide credentials.

- If you continue to encounter problems, check the agent's output or
  logs for errors.

Next Steps with MMS
