The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed in |k8s| from outside of the |k8s| cluster. 

Prerequisite
------------

Compatible MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For your databases to be accessed outside of |k8s|, they must run
MongoDB 4.2.3 or later.

Procedure
---------

The following procedure walks you through the process of configuring external 
connectivity for your deployment by using the built-in configuration options in 
the |k8s-op-short|.

How you connect to a MongoDB resource that the |k8s-op-short| deployed
from outside of the |k8s| cluster depends on the resource.

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB 
      standalone resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-standalone.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: repl

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Kubernetes
            :tabid: kubernetes

               This procedure explains the least complicated way to 
               enable external connectivity. Other utilities can be 
               used in production.

            To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB replica 
            set resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

            .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-split-horizon.rst
         
         .. tab:: OpenShift
            :tabid: openshift

            To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB replica 
            set resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster with OpenShift:

            .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-split-horizon-openshift.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB sharded
      cluster resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-sharded.rst
