   Exercise care when specifying read preferences: Modes other than
   :readmode:`primary` may return stale data because with
   :ref:`asynchronous replication <asynchronous-replication>`, data in
   the secondary may not reflect the most recent write operations.
   [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_

.. note:: The read preference does not affect the visibility of data;
   i.e. clients can see the results of writes before they are acknowledged
   or have propagated to a majority of replica set members:

Use Cases
---------

Indications
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are common use cases for using non-:readmode:`primary`
read preference modes:

- Running systems operations that do not affect the front-end
  application.

  .. note::

     Read preferences aren't relevant to direct connections to
     a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. However, in order to perform
     read operations on a direct connection to a secondary member of a
     replica set, you must set a read preference, such as
     :term:`secondary`.

- Providing local reads for geographically distributed applications.

  If you have application servers in multiple data centers, you may
  consider having a :ref:`geographically distributed replica set
  <replica-set-geographical-distribution>` and using a non primary or 
  :readmode:`nearest` read preference. This allows the client to read
  from the lowest-latency members, rather than always reading from the
  primary.

- Maintaining availability during a failover.

  Use :readmode:`primaryPreferred` if you want an application to
  read from the primary under normal circumstances, but to
  allow stale reads from secondaries when the primary is unavailable. This provides a
  "read-only mode" for your application during a failover.

Counter-Indications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, do *not* use :readmode:`secondary` and
:readmode:`secondaryPreferred` to provide extra capacity for
reads, because:

- All members of a replica have roughly equivalent write traffic; as a
  result, secondaries will service reads at roughly the same rate as
  the primary.

- Replication is asynchronous and there is some amount of
  delay between a successful write operation and its replication to
  secondaries. Reading from a secondary can return out-of-date data;
  reading from different secondaries may result in non-monotonic reads.

- Distributing read operations to secondaries can compromise availability
  if *any* members of the set become unavailable because the remaining
  members of the set will need to be able to handle all application
  requests.

- For queries of sharded collections, for clusters with the
  :ref:`balancer <sharding-internals-balancing>` active, secondaries
  may return stale
  results with missing or duplicated data because of incomplete or
  terminated chunk migrations.

:doc:`Sharding </sharding>` increases read and write capacity by
distributing read and write operations across a group of machines,
and is often a better strategy for adding capacity.

See :doc:`/core/read-preference-mechanics` for more information
about the internal application of read preferences.

Read Preference Modes
---------------------

.. important::

   All read preference modes except :readmode:`primary` may return
   stale data because :term:`secondaries <secondary>` replicate
   operations from the primary with some delay.
   [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ Ensure that your application can tolerate
   stale data if you choose to use a non-:readmode:`primary` mode.

MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>` support five
read preference modes.

.. include:: /includes/read-preference-modes-table.rst

The syntax for specifying
the read preference mode is :api:`specific to the driver and to the
idioms of the host language <>`.

Read preference modes are also available to clients connecting to a
:term:`sharded cluster` through a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. The
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance obeys specified read preferences when
connecting to the :term:`replica set` that provides each :term:`shard`
in the cluster.

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :method:`~cursor.readPref()` cursor
method provides access to read preferences.

For more information, see :ref:`read preference background
<replica-set-read-preference-background>` and :ref:`read preference
behavior <replica-set-read-preference-behavior>`. See also the
:api:`documentation for your driver <>`.

.. index:: tag sets
.. index:: read preference; tag sets
.. _replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets:

Tag Sets
--------

Tag sets allow you to target read operations to specific members of a
replica set.

Custom read preferences and write concerns evaluate tag sets in
different ways. Read preferences consider the value of a tag when
selecting a member to read from. Write concerns ignore the value
of a tag when selecting a member, *except* to consider whether or not
the value is unique.

You can specify tag sets with the following read preference modes:

- :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
- :readmode:`secondary`
- :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
- :readmode:`nearest`

Tags are not compatible with mode :readmode:`primary` and, in general, only
apply when :ref:`selecting <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection>`
a :term:`secondary` member of a set for a read operation. However, the
:readmode:`nearest` read mode, when combined with a tag set, selects
the matching member with the lowest network latency. This member may be a
primary or secondary.

All interfaces use the same :ref:`member selection logic
<replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection>` to choose the
member to which to direct read operations, basing the choice on read
preference mode and tag sets.

For information on configuring tag sets, see the
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets` tutorial.

For more information on how read preference :ref:`modes
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>` interact with tag sets, see the
:doc:`documentation for each read preference mode </reference/read-preference>`.
