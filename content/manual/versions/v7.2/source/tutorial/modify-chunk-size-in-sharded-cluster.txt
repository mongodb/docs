The default range size for a sharded cluster is 128 megabytes. This
default range size works well for most deployments; however, if you
notice that automatic migrations use more I/O than your hardware can
handle, you may want to reduce the range size. A small range size leads 
to more rapid and frequent migrations. The allowed size is between 1 and 
1024 megabytes, inclusive.

To modify the range size, use the following procedure:

#. Connect to any :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the cluster using
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

#. Issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Issue the following command to store the global range size
   configuration value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.updateOne(
         { _id: "chunksize" },
         { $set: { _id: "chunksize", value: <sizeInMB> } },  
         { upsert: true }
      )

The allowed range size is between 1 and 1024 megabytes, inclusive.

To set the chunk size for a specific collection, see
:dbcommand:`configureCollectionBalancing`.
