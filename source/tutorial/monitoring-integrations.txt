You can use a third-party application to view and analyze the 
performance metrics that |mms| collects about your deployment. 

At this time, |mms| integrates with custom API-based tools and 
`New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`__.

Develop Monitoring Tools with |mms| API
---------------------------------------

You can build a monitoring using the |mms| 
:doc:`API monitoring and alerts endpoints </reference/api/nav/measurements-and-alerts/>`

Integrate with New Relic
------------------------

You can configure |mms| to send metric data about your deployment to 
`New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`__ for viewing through the 
`New Relic MongoDB plugin <https://newrelic.com/plugins/mongodb/481>`__.

Performance Metrics Available to New Relic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use :guilabel:`Insights for New Relic` to 
run analytics on the collected |mms| performance metrics:

- Opcounters
- Queues
- Cursors
- Connections
- Replication Lag (secondaries only)
- Memory
- Page Faults
- Asserts
- Journaling Stats (MMAPv1 only)
- Network
- WiredTiger Cache Activity
- WiredTiger Cache Usage
- WiredTiger Tickets

**MongoDB 2.6 and earlier**

- Record Stats
- Index Stats
- Lock Percentage


Integrate with New Relic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |mms| with New Relic, you must have a New Relic account. 
If you do not have an existing New Relic account, you can 
`sign up at New Relic <https://newrelic.com/signup>`__.

To enable New Relic to receive metric data about your MongoDB 
deployment, retrieve the following information from your New Relic 
account settings. You may need to create new Insights API keys.

- Account ID
- License Key
- Insights API Insert Key
- Insights API Query Key

You enter this information when configuring the integration. If any of 
the keys later become invalid, |mms| sends an email to the project 
owner and eventually removes the invalid credentials.

`New Relic <https://newrelic.com/signup>`__:
