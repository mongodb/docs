|Multi-clusters| enable different levels of resilience, depending on the
needs of your enterprise application:

- **Single Region, Multi AZ**. One or more |k8s| clusters where you deploy
  each cluster's nodes in different zones in the same region. Such deployments
  protect MongoDB instances backing your enterprise applications against
  zone and |k8s| cluster failures and offer increased availability,
  disaster recovery, and data distribution within one cloud region.

- **Multi Region**. One or more |k8s| clusters where you deploy each cluster
  in a different region, and within each region, deploy cluster nodes in
  different availability zones. This gives your database resilience against
  the loss of a |k8s| cluster, a zone, or an entire cloud region.

|Multi-clusters| allow you to add MongoDB instances in global clusters
that span multiple geographic regions for increased availability and
global distribution of data.

Central and Member Clusters
----------------------------

Identify one |k8s| cluster that should act as a **central cluster** in your |multi-cluster|.

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a |multi-cluster|
across regions and availability zones.

.. note::

   This deployment uses a service mesh. This simplifies configuring |multi-clusters|.
   A service mesh enables inter-cluster communication between the replica set
   members deployed in different |k8s| clusters. MongoDB development has
   tested these deployments with |istio|, but any service mesh that provides |fqdn|
   hostname resolution between Pods across clusters should work. To learn more,
   see :ref:`Plan for External Connectivity <mc_plan_external_connectivity>`.
