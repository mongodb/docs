  ``$search`` has several :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` for 
  constructing different types of queries. This code example uses the 
  :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator to combine several operators 
  into a single query. It has the following search criteria:

  - The ``plot`` field must contain either ``Hawaii`` or ``Alaska``.
  - The ``plot`` field must contain a four-digit number, such as a year.
  - The ``genres`` field must not contain either ``Comedy`` or 
    ``Romance``.
  - The ``title`` field must not contain ``Beach`` or ``Snow``.

  In the static index that you created earlier in this tutorial, you 
  specified that the ``title`` field should be able to use either the 
  :ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer or the :ref:`keyword 
  <ref-keyword-analyzer>` analyzer for queries. The following query 
  uses the alternate analyzer, named ``keywordAnalyzer``, to search for 
  exact matches on the string ``The Count of Monte Cristo``.
