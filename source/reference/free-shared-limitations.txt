   * - Custom Roles
     - Changes to :doc:`custom roles </security-add-mongodb-roles>`
       might take up to 30 seconds to deploy in ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and

       differently in an ``M0`` {+free-cluster+}. To learn more, see
       :doc:`Command Limitations in {+Free-Clusters+} </unsupported-commands>`.

       Please contact |service| support for any questions or comments
       related to restricted commands.

   * - Database Logs
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} do not provide
       downloadable logs.

   * - Data Recovery
     - .. include:: //includes/fact-backup-shared-tier-limitations.rst

   * - Data Transfer Limits

     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} limit
       the total data transferred into or out of the cluster in a
       rolling seven-day period. The rate limits vary by cluster tier as
       follows:

       - ``M0``: 10 GB in and 10 GB out per period

       - ``M2``: 20 GB in and 20 GB out per period

       - ``M5``: 50 GB in and 50 GB out per period

       |service| handles clusters that exceed the rate limit as follows:

       - |service| throttles the network speed of the cluster.
       - |service| triggers a one second cooldown period before resuming
         the cluster's operations on a given connection. If the queue is
         greater than the operations per second limit, operations might
         wait for more than a second in the queue.
       - If the amount of transferred data drops below the rate limit
         threshold, |service| resumes processing of the queued data
         transfers on each connection before processing any new data
         transfers on that connection.

   * - JavaScript
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} do not support
       server-side JavaScript.

       .. example::

          :manual:`$where </reference/operator/query/where>` and
          :manual:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` are not supported.

   * - Namespaces and Database Names
     - ``M0`` {+free-cluster+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-cluster+} namespaces are
       limited to 95 bytes. Database names are limited to 38 bytes.

   * - Number of {+Free-Clusters+}
     - You can deploy at most *one* ``M0`` {+free-cluster+} per
       |service| project.

   * - Performance Advisor
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} do not provide
       access to the :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor>`.
  
   * - Query Utilization
     - The percentage of time that a query is running over any five
       minute period must remain under 100% on ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and
       ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+}.

   * - Real-Time Performance Panel
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+} do not provide
       access to the :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel </real-time-performance-panel>`.

   * - Sort in Memory
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+shared-clusters+}
       sort in memory limit is 32 MB.

   * - Throughput
     - ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} allow up to 100 operations per second.

       |service| handles clusters that exceed the operations per second
       rate limit as follows:

       - |service| throttles the network speed of the cluster.
       - |service| triggers a one second cooldown period before resuming
         the cluster's operations on a given connection. If the queue is
         greater than the operations per second limit, operations might
         wait for more than a second in the queue.
       - If the number of operations per second drops below the rate limit
         threshold, |service| resumes processing of the queued operations
         on each connection before processing any new operations on that
         connection.

   * - Automatic Pause of Idle Clusters
     - |service| automatically pauses ``M0`` {+free-clusters+} after
       60 days of inactivity where there are zero connections to the
       cluster. You can :ref:`resume <resume-cluster>` the cluster at
       any time.
