Adding Servers to |mms|
-----------------------

You can add servers to |mms| in the following ways:

.. only:: cloud

   - Provision them on Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the |mms|
     interface. |mms| provides integration with AWS and lets you deploy
     new EC2 instances directly from |mms| To use EC2 instances for your
     deployments, you must:

     - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`

     - :doc:`/tutorial/provision-aws-servers`

- Provision existing systems and infrastructure. |mms| can deploy and
  manage MongoDB on your existing servers. To use your existing hardware,
  you must deploy the Automation Agent to each server on which |mms| will
  deploy MongoDB. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-hardware`.

- Use your local system for testing. |mms| can deploy MongoDB to your
  laptop or desktop system. Do not use local systems for production
  deployments. To use your local system, you must deploy the Automation
  Agent.

Server Requirements
-------------------

The following are the minimum hardware and networking requirements for the
servers that will host your MongoDB deployments:

Hardware:

- At least 10 GB of free disk space plus whatever space is necessary to
  hold your MongoDB data.

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, we recommend at
  least an ``m3.medium`` instance.

Networking:

- For each server that hosts a MongoDB process managed by MMS, the output
  of ``hostname -f`` must generate a hostname that is resolvable from all
  other servers in the MongoDB deployment.
