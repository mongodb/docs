For the |k8s-op-short| to create or update |k8s-objs| in your |com|
Project, you need to store your :ref:`Programmatic API Key 
<create-org-app-api-key>` in your :ref:`secret storage tool <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>`. 

Multiple secrets can exist in the same namespace. Each user should
have their own secret.

You can follow the :ref:`create-k8s-secret-procedure` below to 
manually store the :ref:`Programmatic API Key 
<create-org-app-api-key>` as a |k8s| |k8s-secret|. Alternatively, you can: 

- Use the |cloud| :cloudmgr:`UI </tutorial/nav/k8s-config-for-mdb-resource/>` or the 
  |onprem| :opsmgr:`UI </tutorial/nav/k8s-config-for-mdb-resource/>` to 
  automatically generate the Kubernetes secret YAML file, which you can 
  then apply to your Kubernetes environment.
- Store the :ref:`Programmatic API Key <create-org-app-api-key>` as a
  |vault-short| secret using the procedure to :ref:`Create a Vault Secret <create-vault-secret>`. 
  To use |vault-short|, you must also :ref:`configure the secret storage <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To create credentials for the |k8s-op-short|, you must:

1. Have or create an |onprem|
   :opsmgr:`Organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>`.

#. Have or generate a
   :ref:`Programmatic API Key <create-org-app-api-key>`.

#. Grant this new |svc-api-key|:

   - The :opsmgr:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles/#Organization Owner>` or :authrole:`Global Owner`
     role, if you want the |k8s-op-short| to create projects and manage
     them. 

   - The :opsmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#Project Owner>` role, if you want the |k8s-op-short|
     to only manage projects.

   .. note:: 

      You must grant the |svc-api-key| the 
      :opsmgr:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles/#Organization Owner>` or :authrole:`Global Owner` role.
      If you want to grant the |svc-api-key| only the :opsmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#Project Owner>` role, you must first create the project and then the
      |svc-api-key| for the project with the :opsmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#Project Owner>`
      role. The |k8s-op-short| can't create projects if the
      |svc-api-key| has only the :opsmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#Project Owner>` role. 

#. Add the |ipaddr| or |cidr| block of any hosts that serve the
   |k8s-op-short| to the
   :opsmgr:`API Access List </tutorial/configure-public-api-access/>`.
