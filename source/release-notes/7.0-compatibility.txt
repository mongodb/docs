This page describes changes introduced in MongoDB 7.0 that can affect
compatibility with older versions of MongoDB.

MongoDB 7.0 is a |lts| Release, which means that it is supported for
both MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments. MongoDB 7.0 includes
changes introduced in MongoDB Rapid Releases 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. This
page describes compatibility changes introduced in those Rapid Releases
and MongoDB 7.0.

To learn more about the differences between |lts| and Rapid Releases,
see :ref:`release-version-numbers`.

For detail on downgrading from MongoDB 7.0, see :ref:`7.0-downgrade`.

Free Monitoring Decommissioned
------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, :ref:`free monitoring
<free-monitoring-mongodb>` is decommissioned. The following aren't
available:

- ``cloud.monitoring.free`` configuration option
- ``--enableFreeMonitoring`` server parameter
- ``db.enableFreeMonitoring()`` command
- ``db.disableFreeMonitoring()`` command
- ``setFreeMonitoring`` command

Queryable Encryption General Availability
-----------------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, {+qe-equality-ga+} is generally
available (GA). Improvements in the GA make it
incompatible with the {+qe-preview+}, which should not be used now that
the feature is GA.

Server and Drivers Compatibility Between Public Preview and GA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use {+qe-equality-ga+}, MongoDB server must be version 7.0 or
later and drivers must be 7.0 compatible. If you are still using the
{+qe-preview+} included with MongoDB 6.x, the server must remain on
version 6.x and the drivers must be 6.x compatible. You cannot use
MongoDB 6.x compatible drivers with a 7.0 server, or 7.0 compatible
drivers with a 6.x server. Attempting to do so results in an error.

To make upgrading easier, MongoDB 7.0 drivers can decrypt data
created with MongoDB 6.x drivers. For upgrade options, see the following sections.

Start Fresh (Preferred)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

If possible, create new collections rather than migrating those produced
with the {+qe-preview+} in MongoDB 6.x:

#. Upgrade MongoDB server and drivers to 7.0.
#. Configure a new encrypted collection with a different name from the
   previous collection.
#. Insert new data, or an unencrypted version of the existing data if
   you have a local copy.
#. Drop the previous version 6.x collection.

Migration
+++++++++

If you cannot use new data or do not have an unencrypted version of the
existing data:

#. Upgrade MongoDB server and drivers to 7.0
#. Using a 7.0 compatible driver, query the encrypted collection to decrypt it.
#. Save the output locally.
#. Configure a new encrypted collection and ingest the data.


.. warning::
   * The :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and :binary:`~bin.mongodump` 
     operations do not decrypt the collection. You must query the 
     collection from a driver to output the decrypted data. 
   * MongoDB 7.0 compatible drivers can't query encrypted fields on 
     data encrypted with MongoDB 6.x compatible drivers. To decrypt 
     data, either query an unencrypted field or query the entire collection.

.. _7.0-downgrade-incompatible:

Backward-Incompatible Features
------------------------------

The following 7.0 features are not compatible with earlier versions of
MongoDB. To downgrade from MongoDB 7.0 to an earlier version, you must
remove data that uses any of the following features:

- Collections with ``encryptedFields`` with :ref:`range indexes
  <sharding-ranged>`

- Compound wildcard indexes require FCV 7.0 or greater. A pre-7.0
  :binary:`mongod` does not start if you are using one or more compound
  wildcard indexes.

- Config servers that have collections with
  ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages`` enabled

- Secondary :ref:`TTL indexes <index-feature-ttl>` with :ref:`partial
  filters <index-type-partial>` on :ref:`time series collections
  <manual-timeseries-collection>`

- Time series collections with custom bucketing parameters


Intra-Node Authentication
-------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, you can configure servers to authenticate 
X.509 certificates as cluster members identified by attributes or extension
values.  You can also override this configuration to accept alternate 
certificates during a rolling upgrade.

To downgrade to MongoDB 6.0, perform the certificate rotation procedure to unset
the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509` setting and rotate the cluster
membership certificates to ones with matching DC, O, and OU attributes.

Once this is complete, you can downgrade the cluster.  

Time-Series
-----------

- Remove partial TTL indexes from time series collections.

- Remove or modify collections using new index parameters.  In some cases, you
  may use :dbcommand:`collMod` to switch to legacy granularity settings, if not
  you need to drop the collection before downgrading.

Cluster Configuration
---------------------

Active :dbcommand:`setClusterParameter` parameter operations prevent
feature Compatibility Version (FCV) from successful completion.


Encrypted Multi-Map (EMM)
--------------------------

Remove collections that use the ``encryptedFields`` collection option 
before downgrading.

Wildcard Indexes
----------------

Compound wildcard indexes require FCV 7.0 or greater. A pre-7.0
:binary:`mongod` does not start if you are using one or more compound
wildcard indexes.
