.. _ako_250:

|ak8so| 2.5.0
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds support for local credentials for custom resources,
  allowing specific custom resources to be managed using specific Atlas Admin API credentials.
- ``AtlasDeployment`` and ``AtlasDatabaseUser`` can now be used as :ref:`independent resources <ak8so-independent-crd>`,
  meaning you can manage |service| deployments without also managing the project using the |ak8so|.
- Adds new "basic deployment" and "advanced deployment"
  :ref:`Helm templates <ak8so-quick-start-helm-ref>` that allow provisioning of
  |service| projects, deployments, and database users.
- Fixes the case when changing the Instance Size was ignored for a shared cluster.
- Resolves Operator panic when changing a deployment to or from serverless instances.
- Adds cleanup of orphan connection strings after a database user was deleted.
- Fixes the case when an ``AtlasTeam`` resource that is not managed by the |ak8so| (not assigned to any ``AtlasProject`` resource) was wrongly deleted.
- Removes custom ``ResourceWatcher`` in favor of controller-runtime field indexers.
  The legacy internal custom ``ResourceWatcher`` had bugs and its usage was error prone which could lead to
  lost data and data integrity issues with resources managed by |ak8so|.
- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.28 through 1.30.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.16.

.. _ako_241:

|ak8so| 2.4.1
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where |ak8so| sometimes skips periodic reconciliation if
  there were no changes to :ref:`custom resources <custom-resources>`.
- Updates :ref:`deletion protection <deletion-protection>` to delete
  a team from the |ak8so|, but keeps it in |service| when there are no
  projects associated to it.
- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.28 through 1.30.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.15.

.. _ako_240:

|ak8so| 2.4.0
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Supports :ref:`{+bcp+} <ak8so-bcp>`.
- Supports :ref:`short names <custom-resources>` for |ak8so| custom
  resources. 
- Introduces ``kubectl`` :ref:`command for listing <custom-resources>`
  all |ak8so| resources in your cluster.
- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.28 through 1.30.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.15.

.. _ako_231:

|ak8so| 2.3.1
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improves validation of the :setting:`spec.x509Type` field
  in the :ref:`AtlasDatabaseUser <atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource>`
  custom resource. The valid values continue to be ``NONE``, ``CUSTOMER``, ``MANAGED``.

- Prevents redundant updates by improving sorting of ``regionConfigs``
  in the :ref:`AtlasDeployment <atlasdeployment-custom-resource>` custom resource.

- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.27 through 1.29.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.14.

.. _ako_23:

|ak8so| 2.3.0
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds support for :ref:`Atlas Stream Processing <ak8so-stream-processing>`.
- Adds support for :setting:`Atlas Search Indexes <spec.deploymentSpec.searchIndexes>`.
- Adds support for :setting:`Atlas Search Dedicated Nodes <spec.deploymentSpec.searchNodes>`.
- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.27 through 1.29.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.14.

.. _ako_222:

|ak8so| 2.2.2
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.27 through 1.29.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.14.

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixes a concurrency issue that could have resulted in the
  |ak8so| missing changes made to custom resource definitions.

.. _ak8so_221:

|ak8so| 2.2.1
-------------

New Features, Improvements and Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All MongoDB images are now signed.
- Removes CPU limits and increases memory limits to 1Gi and
  memory requests to 256Mi.
- Improves reconciliation of :ref:`Serverless Private Endpoints 
  <ak8so-private-endpoint-serverless>`. |ak8so| no longer gets stuck in 
  a reconcile loop that recreates serverless private endpoints when 
  they fail to synchronize with |service|.
- Ensures :ref:`Atlas Teams <ak8so-team>` are always cleaned up. This 
  improvement prevents Atlas Team resources from being orphaned and left in a cluster with no associated projects.
- Supports Kubernetes versions 1.27 through 1.29.
- Supports OpenShift version 4.14.

Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This release deprecates the following fields and setting them has no 
  effect in serverless deployments:

  - ``DiskIOPS``
  - ``DiskTypeName``
  - ``EncryptEBSVolume``
  - ``InstanceSizeName``
  - ``VolumeType``
  - ``AutoScaling``

.. _ak8so_22:

|ak8so| 2.2.0
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixes :ref:`Federated Authentication <ak8so-federated-auth>` role 
  mapping assignment handling.

New
~~~

- Adds support for ``AP1`` and ``US1-Fed`` Datadog regions. To learn 
  more, see :ref:`ak8so-integrate-third-party`.

- Adds support for yearly backup frequencies for :ref:`Cloud Backups 
  <ak8so-backup>`.

.. _ak8so_21:

|ak8so| 2.1.0
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

- Disables the ``--subobject-deletion-protection`` flag due to a bug that prevents users from 
  modifying existing resources when :ref:`deletion protection <deletion-protection>` is enabled. 
  You can still use the 
  :ref:`--object-deletion-protection <revert-deletion-protection>` flag to control deletion protection on a per-custom-resource basis.

New
~~~

- Adds the ``terminationProtectionEnabled`` property to the ``deploymentSpec`` 
  fields in the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` to achieve feature parity with 
  :ref:`serverless instances <ak8so-serverless-instance>` deployed with the :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource`.

- Adds |oidc| and |aws| IAM authentication fields to the 
  :ref:`atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource`. To learn more, see :setting:`spec.oidcAuthType`.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Deprecates ``cloudProviderAccess*`` fields in favor of ``cloudProviderIntegration*`` 
  fields in the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`.

.. _ak8so_201:

|ak8so| 2.0.1
-------------

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Custom resources you delete in |k8s| won't get deleted in 
  |service|. Instead, |ak8so| stops managing those resources.  
  For example, if you delete an :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`
  in |k8s|, |ak8so| no longer automatically deletes the corresponding project
  from |service|, preventing accidental or unexpected deletions. To learn more, 
  including how to :ref:`revert this behavior <revert-deletion-protection>` to 
  the default prior to |ak8so| 2.0.1, see :ref:`deletion-protection`.

- ``deploymentSpec`` replaces ``advancedDeploymentSpec`` in 
  the ``AtlasDeployment`` custom resource. You must update your ``AtlasDeployment`` 
  custom resource as follows:

  - If you use ``advancedDeploymentSpec``, rename to ``deploymentSpec``. 
    You don't need to change any formatting.

  - If you used ``deploymentSpec`` prior to |ak8so| 2.0.1, rewrite your 
    ``AtlasDeployment`` custom resource to match the formatting used in 
    :ref:`the examples <atlasdeployment-examples>`.

- Improves snapshot distribution management by removing ``replicationSpecId`` from
  the :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource` so it can be reused by multiple 
  deployments managed by |ak8so|. The ``replicationSpecId`` is now automatically 
  set for every deployment that references it. As a result of this change, you 
  can no longer configure ``replicationSpecId`` and should remove it from your 
  ``AtlasBackupSchedule`` custom resource.

- Forces the use of ``secretRef`` fields for ``encryptionAtRest`` and ``alertConfigurations`` 
  features to promote security best practices. You should now store API 
  secrets and credentials as |k8s-secrets| and reference 
  them from the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` using the following fields:

  For :setting:`spec.alertConfigurations.notifications`:

  -  Use ``APITokenRef`` instead of ``APIToken``
  -  Use ``DatadogAPIKeyRef`` instead of ``DatadogAPIKey``
  -  Use ``FlowdockTokenAPIRef`` instead of ``FlowdockTokenAPI``
  -  Use ``OpsGenieAPIKeyRef`` instead of ``OpsGenieAPIKey``
  -  Use ``VictorOpsSecretRef`` instead of ``VictorOpsAPIKey`` and ``VictorOpsRoutingKey``


  To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-tp-ac-example`. 

  For :setting:`spec.encryptionAtRest`:

  - **AWS** Use ``secretRef`` instead of ``AccessKeyID``, ``SecretAccessKey``, 
    ``CustomerMasterKeyID``, and ``RoleID``. 

  - **Azure** Use ``secretRef`` instead of ``SubscriptionID``, ``KeyVaultName``, 
    ``KeyIdentifier``, and ``Secret``.

  - **GCP** Use ``secretRef`` instead of ``ServiceAccountKey`` or ``KeyVersionResourceID``.

  To learn more, see :ref:`<ak8so-ear>`.

.. _ak8so_200:

|ak8so| 2.0.0
-------------

.. warning::

   This release contains an issue that prevents |ak8so| from reconciling the 
   :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource` when :ref:`deletion protection <deletion-protection>` is enabled.
   Don't use this version (2.0.0), and instead use |ak8so| 2.0.1.

.. _ak8so_193:

|ak8so| 1.9.3
-------------

- Fixes an issue that caused reconciliation to fail when you updated a 
  deployment with autoscaling enabled.

.. _ak8so_191:

|ak8so| 1.9.1
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixes missing permissions for the :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource`.

.. _ak8so_190:

|ak8so| 1.9.0
-------------

Attention
~~~~~~~~~

- Validation now rejects duplicate alert configurations.

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixes a bug that duplicated projects listed in a team's status.
- Refactors the ``IPAccessList`` reconciliation flow to avoid unneeded
  recreation.
- Fixes backup schedule repeatedly updating.

New
~~~

- Adds the :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource`
  to configure :ref:`federated authentication
  <atlas-federated-authentication>` for Identity Providers that you
  already registered in |service|.
- Supports :atlas:`Atlas for Government </government>` deployments. You
  must configure the Gov endpoint accordingly. |ak8so| supports only 
  |aws| as a cloud provider for |service| for Government.
- Supports {+database-deployment+} resource tagging. To learn more, see
  the following settings:

  - :setting:`spec.deploymentSpec.tags`
  - :setting:`spec.serverlessSpec.tags`
- Adds new arguments to serverless for continuous backups and
  termination protection.
- Improves validation and handling of autoscaling reporting.
- Provides guidance on using third-party secret management tools with
  |ak8so| to support external key management systems. To learn how to
  configure external secret storage for |ak8so|, see
  :ref:`ak8so-secret-storage`.
- Uses UBI micro base image instead of minimal. The micro base image is
  a smaller base image with fewer dependencies.

.. _ak8so-080:

|ak8so| 0.8.0
-------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Upgrades the Controller Runtime to v0.11.0.
- Upgrades Go to 1.17.
- When you :ref:`install a cluster using Helm Charts 
  <ak8so-quick-start-helm-ref>`, Helm doesn't exit until the cluster is 
  ready if you set ``postInstallHook.enabled`` to true.
- |ak8so| :ref:`watches secrets <ak8so-secrets>` only with the label 
  ``atlas.mongodb.com/type=credentials`` to avoid watching unnecessary 
  |k8s-secrets|.
- Supports the
  ``mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy=skip`` annotation for 
  configuring |ak8so| to skip reconciliations on
  :ref:`specific resources <custom-resources>`.
- Supports :ref:`X.509 authentication <ak8so-x509>`.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes an issue that logged errors for resource deletion.

``AtlasProject`` Custom Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes
+++++++

- |ak8so| no longer marks the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` as 
  ready until the :ref:`project IP access is successfully created 
  <ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref>`.

``AtlasCluster`` Custom Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes
+++++++

- Adds the ``spec.advancedClusterSpec`` parameter to the 
  :ref:`AtlasCluster <atlasdeployment-custom-resource>` custom 
  resource. The ``AtlasCluster`` custom 
  resource now has two main configuration options. You must specify 
  either ``spec.clusterSpec`` or ``spec.advancedClusterSpec``. 
  The ``spec.clusterSpec`` parameter uses the
  :oas-atlas-tag:`Atlas Cluster API Resource </Clusters>`. The 
  ``spec.advancedClusterSpec`` parameter uses the
  :oas-atlas-tag:`Atlas Advanced Cluster API Resource </Clusters>`.

  .. note::
   
     To migrate an existing resource to use the ``spec.clusterSpec`` 
     structure, you must move all fields currently under ``spec.*`` to 
     ``spec.clusterSpec.*`` with the exception of ``spec.projectRef``.
