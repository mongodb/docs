In Stage 2 of the :ref:`Live Migration workflow <lm-workflow>`,
you must connect from |mms| to |service-short|.

To connect an organization in |mms| to |service-short|, enter
the :term:`link-token` that you generated in |service-short|
into the :guilabel:`Settings` page of your |mms| organization.

Use one link-token per |mms| organization. If you have
other organizations in |mms| that contain deployments you want to
migrate, create a link-token in |service-short| for each organization
and then specify it in the corresponding organization's settings.
You can run Live Migration processes in parallel for each
|mms| organization connected to |service-short|.
For each organization, you can use the same link-token to live
migrate that organization's deployments from |mms| to |service-short|,
one at a time.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you connect to |service-short|:

- Review the :ref:`workflow for Live Migration to Atlas <lm-workflow>`.
- Complete Stage 1: Generate a link-token in |service-short|.
- If you are migrating from |onprem|, verify that you specified an
  external IP address of the |mms| instance to |service-short|.
