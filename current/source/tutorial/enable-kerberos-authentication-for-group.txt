Overview
--------

.. next two paragraphs stolenish from the MongoDB Manual

`MongoDB Enterprise
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`_
supports authentication using a Kerberos service. Kerberos is an
industry standard authentication protocol for large client/server
systems.

.. important::
   
   Setting up and configuring a Kerberos deployment is beyond the scope
   of this document. This tutorial assumes you have configured a
   Kerberos principal for each Agent and you have a valid
   keytab file for each Agent.

To authenticate MongoDB with Kerberos, you must:

1. Have a properly configured Kerberos deployment,
2. Configure *Kerberos service principals* for MongoDB, and
3. Add the *Kerberos user principals* for the Agents.

The :manual:`Kerberos Authentication </core/kerberos>` section of the
MongoDB Manual provides more detail about using MongoDB with Kerberos.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-kerberos.rst

This tutorial describes how to enable Kerberos for one of your |mms|
projects and how to configure your |mms| Agents to connect to your
Kerberos-enabled deployment.

.. include:: /includes/note-reset-auth.rst

Procedures
----------

These procedures describe how to configure and enable Kerberos
authentication when using Automation. If |mms| does *not* manage your
Monitoring or {+bagent+}s, you must manually configure them to
authenticate using Kerberos.

See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-kerberos` for instructions.

Configure an Existing Linux Deployment for Kerberos-based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |mms| to manage existing deployments on Linux in your project, all
MongoDB deployments in the project must be configured for Kerberos
authentication before you can enable Kerberos authentication for your
project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-existing-deployment-for-kerberos.rst

When you have configured the Kerberos options for each deployment,
you can proceed to enable Kerberos for your |mms| project.
