An |ipaddr| is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. In |service|, you can only connect to a cluster from a trusted
IP address. Within |service|, you can create a list of trusted IP
addresses, referred to as a IP access list, that can be used to connect
to your cluster and access your data.

Procedure
---------

You must add your IP address to the IP access list before you can connect to your cluster. To add your IP address to the IP access list:

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-access-list.rst

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/security/ip-access-list/`

Next Steps
----------

Now that you added your connection IP address to the IP access list,
proceed to
:doc:`Create a Database User for Your Cluster </tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster>`.
