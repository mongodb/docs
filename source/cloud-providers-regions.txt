The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
options for the available cluster tiers, network latency for clients
accessing your cluster, and the
:doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`. The region
refers to the physical location of your MongoDB cluster.

|service| supports deploying ``M0`` Free Tier and
``M2/M5`` shared-tier clusters on all cloud providers but only a
subset of each cloud provider's regions. For a list of regions that
support ``M0`` or ``M2/M5`` clusters, see:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

Regions marked as |star| are
:guilabel:`Recommended` regions that provide higher availability
compared to other regions. For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`
