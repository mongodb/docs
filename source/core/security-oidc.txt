Behavior
--------

- To authenticate using OpenID Connect, enable the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` :ref:`authentication 
  mechanism <authentication>`. 

- OpenID Connect uses access tokens to provide identity information. The access 
  tokens are encoded as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). They contain information about 
  user identities and authorization rights. 

- MongoDB currently supports the use of Microsoft Azure AD and Okta as third-party 
  identity providers.

Get Started
-----------

- :ref:`Configure MongoDB with OpenID Connect <configure-oidc>`

Details
-------

The OpenID Connect authentication process with MongoDB is summarized below: 

1. Configure your MongoDB server with OpenID Connect. The configuration 
   includes information from your identity provider, such as client ID, 
   authorization endpoints, and token endpoints. For more details, see
   :ref:`Configure MongoDB with OpenID Connect <configure-oidc>`.

#. The client application (for example :binary:`~bin.mongosh` or |compass|) 
   contacts the identity provider's authorization endpoint. You are redirected 
   to your identity provider's login screen. Provide your credentials to complete 
   authentication.

#. The client application receives an access token from the identity provider.

#. The MongoDB server uses the access token provided from the client application to 
   finalize authentication. The access token contains information such as user 
   identity and authorization rights.
