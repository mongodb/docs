===================================
Activate |backup| for a Replica Set
===================================

.. start-content

.. note::
   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later.

To backup a replica set,

#. Go to :guilabel:`Backup`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Replica Set Status` tab to see the list of your
   replica sets and their backup details.

#. For the replica set to you want to enable, select :guilabel:`Start` in the
   :guilabel:`Action` column.
   
#. Specify which instances to use for the initial sync. To minimize the impact
   on the primaries, sync off of the secondaries.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-excluded-namespace.rst

#. Click the gear icon to the far right of the replica set name to edit
   snapshot schedule, excluded namespaces, and credentials.

   - Edit snapshot schedule for backups. Take snapshots every 6, 8, 12, or 24
     hours and save for 1-5 days. Daily snapshots can be stored up to 365 days.
     Weekly snapshots can be stored for 52 weeks. Monthly snapshots can be
     stored up to 36 months. By default, snapshots are taken every 6 hours with
     each snapshot saved for 2 days.
     
     Changes to the snapshot schedule will affect your snapshot storage costs.
     The longer your snapshot window, the longer it will take to build a point
     in time restore.

   - Edit excluded namespaces. Excluded namespaces are databases or collections
     that will not be backed up. This can be useful for namespaces containing
     log files or caches, for instance.

   - Edit or add authentication credentials used for backup, including whether
     or not to use SSL.

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified
instance for this replica set.
