The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence allows you to query a 
MongoDB database using SQL commands to aid in data analysis. It 
translates SQL queries from data analysis tools to MongoDB aggregation 
pipelines on MongoDB database.

.. note::
   
   The |bic-short| only allows 
   `read-only operations <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/supported-operations/>`_ 
   on data served in MongoDB databases. To create, update, or delete 
   data you must use {+mongosh+} or any appropriate driver.

.. seealso::

   For specifics on the |bic-short-no-link|, see the 
   `BI Connector manual <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/>`_.

Use the following procedure to deploy a new MongoDB |bic-short-no-link|
for |mms| to manage.
