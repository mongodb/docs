title: Create your first MongoDB deployment.
stepnum: 4
ref: deployment-type
pre: |
  MMS provides several options for where to deploy MongoDB. The choice you
  make for your first deployment does not limit your choices for future
  deployments. For your first deployment, select from the following options:
action:
  - heading: Local
    content: |
      Installs MongoDB directly to your local machine. This is useful for
      learning about MongoDB and testing applications.
  - heading: AWS
    content: |
      Installs MongoDB on an existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
      You can use existing EC2 servers on the account or provision new
      ones through this setup process by providing your EC2 API keys when
      prompted. Running MongoDB on AWS is useful for both development and
      production and allows you to quickly and easily add servers as
      needed.
  - heading: Other Remote
    content: |
      Installs MongoDB to an existing deployment of systems.
---
title: Connect to your MongoDB deployment.
stepnum: 5
ref: connect-to-mongodb
pre: |
  To connect, you retrieve the hostname and port of your MongoDB
  deployment, and you then connect through the :program:`mongo` shell or
  through a MongoDB :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>`.
action:
  - heading: Retrieve the hostname and port of your MongoDB deployment.
    action: |
      pre: |
        In MMS, select the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab, then the
        :guilabel:`Deployment` page, and then the :guilabel:`view mode`.
        Click the hostname of the MongoDB deployment. For a :term:`replica
        set`, click the deployment listed as ``PRIMARY``. For a
        :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>`, click the deployment listed as
        ``MONGOS``. The name of your deployment is listed at the top of
        the page and uses the following form:
      language: sh
      code: |
        <server-prefix>.mongodbdns.com:<port>
  - heading: Connect through the :program:`mongo` shell.
    action: |
      pre: |
        On a system shell, run :program:`mongo` and specify the host and
        port of the deployment. Issue a command in the following form:
      language: sh
      code: |
        mongo --username <user> --password <pass> --host <host> --port <port>
  - heading: Connect through a driver.
    action: |
      pre: |
        Use your :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>` to create a
        :manual:`/reference/connection-string` that specifies the hostname
        and port of the deployment.
