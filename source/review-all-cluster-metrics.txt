.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      You can view select project metrics using the {+atlas-cli+}.

      View Disk Metrics
      -----------------

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-metrics-disks-describe-and-list.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
       
      The :guilabel:`Clusters` view displays all 
      {+database-deployments+} in an |service| 
      :ref:`project <projects>` and features core metrics per 
      {+database-deployment+}. You can also view a 
      {+database-deployment+}\'s core metrics by clicking on 
      it's name, which then displays the :guilabel:`Overview` 
      tab. You can quickly view metrics in the available 
      charts at a glance to assess {+database-deployment+} 
      health. You can then click into other views and metrics 
      to identify specific issues. To learn more about the 
      :guilabel:`Clusters` view, see 
      :ref:`<view-all-database-deployments>`.

Available Charts
----------------

|service| displays up to four
of the following charts for each {+database-deployment+} in the project:

   * - Chart
        
     - Data

     - Use Case  
   
   * - :guilabel:`Connections`

     - The total number of active connections to the 
       {+database-deployment+}
       
       For a replica set, the chart shows the number of active 
       connections to the primary. 
       
       For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of all active 
       connections to each primary in the cluster.
    
     - .. include:: /includes/fact-connections.rst   
  
   * - :guilabel:`Data Size`
  
       *{+Serverless-Instances+} Only*

     - Displays the amount of storage space in bytes that your stored 
       data uses.

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-db-storage.rst
  
   * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`

       ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*

     - The sum of read and write input/output operations per second
       (IOPS) for the cluster. 

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-disk-iops.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Disk Latency` :sup:`1`

     - The latency, in milliseconds, of the disk partition used
       by MongoDB.

     - Monitor :guilabel:`Disk Latency` to determine the average amount 
       of time to read from or write to disk.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Disk Usage`
              
       *{+Serverless-Instances+} and* ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*
        
     - The total bytes of used disk space for the 
       {+database-deployment+}.
        
       For a replica set, the chart shows the disk usage of the
       primary host machine.
        
       For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of disk usage
       on each primary host in the cluster. 

       The line graph is green for less than 75% disk
       usage, yellow for 75%-89% disk usage, and red for 90% or more 
       disk usage.

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-disk-usage.rst
  
   * - :guilabel:`Logical Size`
              
       ``M0/M2/M5`` *Clusters Only*
      
     - Displays the sum of total bytes of the documents and index data
       across all databases in the {+database-deployment+}.

       Logical size in the {+atlas-ui+} for time-series collections 
       represents the compressed data size after columnar compression. 
     
       The line graph is green for less than 75% of the max storage 
       size, yellow for 75%-89% of the max storage size, and red for 
       90% or more of the max storage size.

     - Monitor the size of the documents and index data on the 
       {+database-deployment+}.

   * - :guilabel:`Network`
  
       *{+Serverless-Instances+} and* ``M0/M2/M5`` *Clusters Only*

     - Displays the average rate of physical bytes or requests sent 
       to/from this database server per second over the selected sample 
       period.

     - Monitor network metrics to track network performance.
 
   * - :guilabel:`Operations`
      
     - Displays the aggregated read (:guilabel:`R`) and write 
       (:guilabel:`W`) operations on the {+database-deployment+}. 
      
       For a replica set, the chart shows operations for the
       :term:`primary`. 
      
       For a :term:`sharded cluster`, the chart shows
       the sum of the operations on each primary in the cluster.
   
     - Monitor performance issues related to high workloads.

:sup:`1` Clusters which use :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>` for 
storage display ``Disk Latency`` charts using the maximum value across 
the physical drives that make up the
:abbr:`RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)`. The following
:ref:`cluster tiers <create-cluster-instance>` display RAID-based
metrics if they use :ref:`NVMe <nvme-storage>`:
 
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M400``
