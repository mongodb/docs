   This change affects your username for all `MongoDB Cloud products <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud/>`__.

Beginning on October 18, 2021, your primary email address will become 
your new username. Your password will remain the same. If you have 
multiple accounts, please assign a unique email address to each account 
to ensure access.

.. note::

   You must provide a unique email address by October 18, 2021 to avoid 
   a locked account.

To change your primary email address:

1. Sign in at 
   `account.mongodb.com <https://account.mongodb.com/account/login>`__.

#. Click your name in the top right corner to open the drop down menu.

#. Click :guilabel:`Manage your MongoDB Account`.

#. In the left sidebar, click :guilabel:`Personal Info`.

#. Change your primary email address.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

If you no longer need an extra account, you can 
:ref:`delete <delete-atlas-account>` 
it instead of assigning it a unique email address.
