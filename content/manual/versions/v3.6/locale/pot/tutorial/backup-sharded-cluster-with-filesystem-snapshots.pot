This procedure uses file system snapshots to capture a copy of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create binary database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the alternate procedure."
