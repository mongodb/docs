Getting Started with MMS Automation using MMS Provisioning on AWS
=================================================================

Overview
--------

MMS Automation provides an interface for provisioning machines,
configuring MongoDB nodes and clusters, and upgrading your MongoDB
deployment. This tutorial describes how to configure |automation| using
MMS Provisioning, which integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to
deploy EC2 instances that come with Automation Agents pre-installed.

.. todo: We need to define MMS Provisioning on /core/system-overview. See DOCS-3844.

Prerequisites
-------------

To set up MongoDB Automation with Provisioning, you must have the following:

- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

- Access to the AWS account's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. To
  access the keys, click your username in the top right corner of AWS and
  select Security Credentials.

- Access to the AWS account's SSH public key, if it exists. If it does
  not yet exist, you can create the public key when configuring automation
  settings in MMS.

- An existing Security Group on that account with MongoDB ports open to all
  instances within the Security Group and SSH access from all IPs.

Considerations
--------------

In general, provision one machine per MongoDB instance. Make sure the
machines are large enough to support your deployment. Give your root
volume at least 25 GB.

MMS does not allow selection of AWS instances smaller than the "m1.large"
instance. MMS currently allows selection of the AWS Linux or Ubuntu
operating systems for an instance.
