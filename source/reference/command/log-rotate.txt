.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` is an admin only command that allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too
   much disk space. Use the following syntax: ::

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   The rotated files will have a timestamp appended to the filename.

   .. note::

     The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is not available to mongod instances
     running on windows systems.
