.. note::

   Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your ``{PROJECT-ID}`` is the
   same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id
   remains the same. This page uses the more familiar term group when
   referring to descriptions. The endpoint remains as stated in the
   document.
