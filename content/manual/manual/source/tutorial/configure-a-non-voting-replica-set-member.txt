   :description: Configure a non-voting replica set member by setting its votes and priority to zero using `replSetReconfig` or `rs.reconfig()`.

Non-voting members allow you to add additional members for read
distribution beyond the maximum seven voting members.

To configure a member as non-voting, use the
:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command *or* its
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` helper method :method:`rs.reconfig()` to set its
:rsconf:`members[n].votes` and :rsconf:`members[n].priority` values to
``0``. Non-voting replica set members *must* have a 
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of ``0``.

.. note::

   Replica reconfiguration can add or remove no more than *one* voting replica 
   set member at a time. To modify the votes of multiple members, issue a series 
   of :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` or :method:`rs.reconfig()` operations to
   modify one member at a time. See
   :ref:`replSetReconfig-cmd-single-node` for more information.

Procedure
---------

The following procedure converts configures a single :term:`secondary`
replica set member to be non-voting. To convert the :term:`primary`
member to be non-voting, you must first successfully step the primary
down using :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` or its shell helper
:method:`rs.stepDown()` before performing this procedure.

\1) Connect to the Replica Set Primary
   Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the replica set :term:`primary`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongosh --host "<hostname>:<port>"

   Replace the ``<hostname>`` and ``<port>`` with the hostname and 
   port of the replica set primary. Include any other parameters 
   required for your deployment. 

\2) Retrieve the Replica Configuration
   Issue the :method:`rs.conf()` method in the shell and assign the 
   result to a variable ``cfg``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf();

   The returned :ref:`document <replSetGetConfig-output>` contains a 
   :rsconf:`members` array, where each element in the array contains 
   the configuration for a single replica set member.

\3) Configure the Member to be Non-Voting
   For the replica member to change to be non-voting, 
   set its :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` and
   :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` to ``0``.

   .. code-block:: javascript 

      cfg.members[n].votes = 0;
      cfg.members[n].priority = 0;

   Replace ``n`` with the array index position of the member 
   to modify. The :rsconf:`members` array is *zero-indexed*, 
   where the first element in the array has an index position of 
   ``0``. 

   The array index position of a member in the 
   :rsconf:`members` array is *distinct* from the 
   :rsconf:`members[n]._id` of a specific member. Do *not* 
   use the :rsconf:`~members[n]._id` to reference the array 
   index position of any any member in :rsconf:`members`.

\4) Reconfigure the Replica Set with the New Configuration
   Use :method:`rs.reconfig()` method to reconfigure the replica set
   with the updated replica set configuration document.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(cfg);

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst
