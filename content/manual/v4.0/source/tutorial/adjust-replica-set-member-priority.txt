Overview
--------

The ``priority`` settings of replica set members affect both the timing
and the outcome of :doc:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>` for
primary. Higher-priority members are more likely to call elections, and
are more likely to win. Use this setting to ensure that some members are
more likely to become primary and that others can never become primary.

The value of the member's
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` setting determines the
member's :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` in elections. The higher the number,
the higher the priority.

Considerations
--------------

To modify priorities, you update the :rsconf:`members`
array in the replica configuration object. The array index begins with
``0``. Do **not** confuse this index value with the value of the replica
set member's :rsconf:`members[n]._id` field in the
array.

The value of :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` can be any
floating point (i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``. The
default value for the ``priority`` field is ``1``.

To block a member from seeking election as primary, assign it a priority
of ``0``. :ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>` and
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>` have
``priority`` set to ``0``.

Adjust priority settings during a scheduled maintenance window.
Reconfiguring priority can force the current primary to step down,
leading to an election. Before an election, the primary closes all open
:term:`client` connections.
