Solution Overview
------------------
Today's payment industry is changing fast. Businesses are working to offer instant,
secure, and easy-to-use payment solutions. This need is driven by several factors,
including new regulations, customer expectations, and competition. MongoDB gives financial
services organizations a powerful tool for modernizing their payment systems efficiently.

Key Drivers for Modernizing Payment Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several factors are pushing the modernization of payment systems:

- **Real-time payments:** Customers and businesses now expect payments to be processed
  immediately, a trend seen worldwide.
- **Regulatory changes:** New laws and regulations, like PSD2 in Europe, are encouraging more
  open and flexible payment systems.
- **Customer expectations:** People want payment processes to be smooth and integrated
  seamlessly across different platforms.

  adaptability.

In this example solution, we'll delve into modernization approaches and how MongoDB plays
a pivotal role in this transformation.

Approaches to Modernization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To navigate the complexities of updating their systems, businesses are embracing
innovative strategies:

- **Domain-driven design:** This approach zeroes in on the core operations of a business to
  develop systems that are both scalable and easier to manage. By aligning system
  development with business needs, domain-driven design ensures technology serves
  strategic business goals.
- **Microservices architecture:** Transitioning from a monolithic to a microservices
  architecture provides significant advantages. It introduces more flexibility and allows
  for quicker updates, facilitating agile responses to changing business requirements.

How MongoDB Supports Modernization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MongoDB is at the forefront of supporting modernization efforts, especially in the context
of payment systems, through its comprehensive features:

- **Operational data layer:** MongoDB introduces a unified data layer that dramatically
  simplifies access to data across various services. This streamlining is crucial for
  building coherent, integrated payment solutions.
- **Flexible document model:** The platform's document model is perfectly suited to manage the
  intricate data typically found in payment systems. Its adaptability allows for the
  seamless incorporation of new payment types and data structures, ensuring the system can
  evolve with the market.
- **Support for best practices:** With MongoDB, implementing essential payment processing
  features becomes more straightforward. From securing transactions to facilitating
  `real-time analytics <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/real-time-analytics-examples>`__,
  MongoDB equips businesses with the tools needed to adhere to industry best practices
  efficiently.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------
This payments modernization solution accelerator will showcase how you can build an
`operational data layer (ODL)
<https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/implementing-an-operational-data-layer>`__ utilizing
MongoDB to unlock the value of previously siloed payment data and power applications that
can’t be served by existing systems. An ODL deployed in front of legacy systems can enable
new business initiatives and meet new requirements that the existing architecture can’t
handle – without the difficulty and risk of a full rip and replace of legacy systems.
Below we show the architecture that can be built to achieve this.

- **Without {+service+}:** Self-hosted MongoDB/other DBMS deployment with manual scaling and
  management.
- **With {+service+}:** Fully managed MongoDB service, ensuring scalability, high availability, and
  security.

Below, you will find the architecture used to build this payment solution. To learn more
about how it works with MongoDB, visit our `Real-Time Payments page

Data Model Approach
-------------------
The following approach focuses on entities like User Accounts, Transactions, Bank
Accounts, and Payment Methods, and their relationships. It includes data attributes for
each entity ensuring comprehensive and detailed information covering each entity.

Microservices Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `microservice architecture <https://www.mongodb.com/databases/what-are-microservices>`__
helps to break large monolithic applications into smaller pieces and provides you with the
following benefits: faster time to market, modularity, flexibility and scalability,
resiliency, organizational alignment, and reduction in costs. This is broken into the
following:

User Management (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/user>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Facilitates the main operations around user/account interaction. In the diagram below, you
can see the main flow for creating accounts.

- **Data entities:** User Account, Payment Method, Bank Account
- **Permissions:** Read/Write on User Account, Payment Method, Bank Account
- **Inputs:** User details, Payment method details, Bank account details
- **Outputs:** User account creation confirmation, Payment method addition confirmation,
  Bank account addition confirmation

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/account-creation-flow.png
  :alt: Account Creation Flow

  Figure 2. Account creation flow

Transaction Processing (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/transaction>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Manages transaction-related operations like initiating/completing or refunding a
transaction. In the diagram below, you can see the transaction initiation process.

- **Data entities:** Transaction, Bank Account
- **Permissions:** Read/Write on Transaction, Read on Bank Account
- **Inputs:** Transaction details (amount, sender, receiver)
- **Outputs:** Transaction status update (pending, completed, failed)

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/transaction-flow.png
  :alt: Transaction Flow

  Figure 3. Transaction flow

One additional functionality that this microservice is responsible for is the management
of external provider transactions. For example, a demo shown in the solution is a mock
operation for a user to get a PayPal-based payment. This is feasible since MongoDB's
flexible schema can have varying documents under the object representing a transaction.

This process as shown below causes a similar payment verification process for this
external transaction validation and processing/notification.

Transaction History (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/transaction>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operate transaction logging and archival.

- **Data Entities:** Transaction History, User Account
- **Permissions:** Read on Transaction History, Read on User Account
- **Inputs:** User account number
- **Outputs:** Transaction history data

Account Reconciliation (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/payment>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Verifying the account details are up to date.

- **Data entities:** Bank Account, Transaction
- **Permissions:** Read/Write on Bank Account, Read on Transaction
- **Inputs:** Transaction details, Bank account details
- **Outputs:** Reconciliation status, Adjusted account balances

Payment Verification (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/payment>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This process reacts to a transaction initiation, processing the required steps. The
diagram below shows the payment processing steps from the moment the service reacts to a
payment until the user notification, including approving or rejecting payments.

- **Data entities:** Transaction, User Account, Bank Account
- **Permissions:** Read on Transaction, Read on User Account, Read on Bank Account
- **Inputs:** Transaction details, User account number, Bank account details
- **Outputs:** Verification status (success, failure)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__, you can create a
materialized view of your payment data.

- **Data entities:** Transaction History, User Account
- **Permissions:** Read on Transaction History, Read on User Account
- **Inputs:** User account number, Report criteria (date range, transaction type)
- **Outputs:** Generated financial reports

Notification Service (`Github repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/FSIDemo-Payments/tree/main/api/notification>`__)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This microservice utilizes Change Streams together with Web Sockets to notify the user UI
of any changes.

- **Data entities:** User Account, Transaction
- **Permissions:** Read on User Account, Read on Transaction
- **Inputs:** User account details, Transaction details
- **Outputs:** Notifications and alerts to users
