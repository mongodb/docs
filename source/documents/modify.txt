   Modifying documents is not permitted in
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Compass Readonly Edition`.

You can edit existing documents in your collection. When you edit
a document, |compass-short| performs a
:manual:`findAndModify </reference/method/db.collection.findAndModify/>`
operation to update the document.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are viewing your
documents in List, JSON, or Table view:

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To modify a document, hover over the document and click the pencil
      icon:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc.png
        :figwidth: 696px

      After you click the pencil icon, the document enters edit mode:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc2.png
        :figwidth: 696px

      You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
      of values.

      Once selected, the field is marked for removal and appears
      highlighted in red:

      Add New Fields
      --------------

      To add a new field in the document, hover over the row number in
      the dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the

      the field.

      You can also add a new field at the end of the document by
      pressing the tab key when your text cursor is in the value of the
      last document field.

      Modify an Existing Field
      ------------------------

      You can modify documents by clicking on existing field names or
      values and making changes. In this example, the flight status was
