   By default, the :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates`
   setting is ``true``, and a valid trusted certificate is required to
   connect to MongoDB instances using SSL.

   When {+mdbagent+} manages {+magent+}, this setting cannot be set to
   ``false``.  You can set ``sslRequireValidServerCertificates`` to
   ``false`` if you install and configure the {+magent+} manually. When
   :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` is ``false``, you
   don't set the ``sslTrustedServerCertificates`` because |mms| won't
   verify the certificates.
