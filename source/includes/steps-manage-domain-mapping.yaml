  .. note::

     You can choose the verification method once. It cannot be
     modified. To select a different verification method, delete and
     recreate the domain mapping.

  Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are verifying your
  domain by uploading an |html| file or creating a |dns| TXT record:

  .. tabs::

    .. tab:: Upload HTML File
        :tabid: upload-html

        Upload an |html| file containing a verification key to verify
        that you own your domain.

        a. Click :guilabel:`HTML File Upload`.

        #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

        #. Download the ``mongodb-site-verification.html`` file
           that |service| provides.

        #. Upload the |html| file to a web site on your domain. You
           must be able to access the file at
           ``<https://host.domain>/mongodb-site-verification.html``.

        #. Click :guilabel:`Finish`.

    .. tab:: Create DNS Record
        :tabid: create-dns

        Create a |dns| TXT record with your domain provider to verify
        that you own your domain. Each |dns| record associates a
        specific |service| organization with a specific domain.

        a. Click :guilabel:`DNS Record`.

        #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

        #. Copy the provided TXT record. The TXT record has the
           following form:

           .. code-block:: ini
              :copyable: false

              mongodb-site-verification=<32-character string>

        #. Log in to your domain name provider (such as GoDaddy.com or
           networksolutions.com).

        #. Add the TXT record that |service| provides to your domain.

        #. Return to |service| and click :guilabel:`Finish`.
