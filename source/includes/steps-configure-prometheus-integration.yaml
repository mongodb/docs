  Prometheus authentication credentials are specifically designed for
  use with the Prometheus integration in |mms|. |mms| uses these
  credentials to only access the Prometheus discovery endpoint and
  scrape Prometheus metrics from |mms| nodes. They are strictly limited
  to these functions and do not have any additional permissions or
  capabilities beyond accessing and collecting monitoring data. 

  .. important::

     Copy your username and password in a secure location. You can't
     access the password after you leave this screen.

       -  ``PEM`` file path that contains certificate and key required
          to spin up a ``https`` Prometheus scraping endpoint. 

          .. note::

             You are responsible for the following:
             
             - TLS Certificate Key File issuance and renewal.
             - Checking if the endpoint started correctly in the automation agent logs.

     * - TLS Certificate Key File Password
       - Required if the certificate key file is encrypted.

     * - Discovery Method
       - Description

     * - `HTTP SD <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/>`__
       - This method requires Prometheus v2.28 and later. It
         generates the `scrape_config <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config>`__
         part of your `configuration file <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file>`__
         to discover targets over an HTTP endpoint.

     * - `File Service Discovery <https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets>`__
       - This method allows Prometheus to read |yaml| or |json|
         documents to configure the targets to scrape from.
