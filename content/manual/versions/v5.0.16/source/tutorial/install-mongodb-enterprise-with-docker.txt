Install MongoDB Enterprise with Docker
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. _`MongoDB Download Center`: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server


.. important::

   The recommended solutions for using containers with MongoDB are:

   - For development and testing use the
     `MongoDB Community Docker container <https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/>`__.
     This image is supported by MongoDB. The image contains the
     Community Edition of MongoDB.
   
   - For MongoDB Enterprise production installations, use
     :opsmgr:`MongoDB Ops Manager </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>` to
     configure Docker containers and Kubernetes.

To manually configure :products:`MongoDB Enterprise
</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>` with Docker, follow the
instructions on this page.

Considerations
--------------

A full description of `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/>`__ is beyond
the scope of this documentation. This page assumes prior knowledge of
Docker.

This documentation only describes installing MongoDB Enterprise with
Docker, and does not replace other resources on Docker. We encourage
you to thoroughly familiarize yourself with Docker and its related
subject matter before installing MongoDB Enterprise with Docker.

.. important::

   This procedure uses the official `mongo image
   <https://github.com/docker-library/mongo>`__. The image is supported
   by MongoDB.
   
   The MongoDB community may contribute additional container images.
   For a listing of all available images, see the `repositiory
   <https://github.com/docker-library/mongo>`__.

Create a Docker Image with MongoDB Enterprise
---------------------------------------------

Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__ and set up a
`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`__ account before creating a
MongoDB Enterprise Docker image.

Push the Image to Docker Hub
----------------------------

Optionally, you can push your Docker image to a remote repository, like Docker
Hub, to use the image on other host machines. If you push the image to Docker
Hub, you can then run ``docker pull`` for each host machine on
which you want to install MongoDB Enterprise via Docker. For complete guidance
on using ``docker pull``, reference its documentation
`here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#examples>`__.
