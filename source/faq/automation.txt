Frequently Asked Questions: Automation

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS Automation manages MongoDB deployments and simplifies
administration operations for sharded clusters, replica sets, and
standalone MongoDB deployments.

What cloud providers are available for MongoDB Automation with MMS?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, MongoDB Automation via MMS is available for Amazon Web
Services only. Amazon AWS includes all the SSD instance types, tuned
parameters (read-ahead, limits, etc.)

How much does it cost to use MMS Automation?
--------------------------------------------

There is no cost for MMS Automation.

Can I pay my AWS Bill through MMS?
----------------------------------

No. You must manage billing for your AWS account using Amazon's
interface.

What deployments can I configure with automation?
-------------------------------------------------

You can configure sharded clusters, arbiters, hidden secondaries,
delayed secondaries, replica sets, and standalones.

Be sure when you use Automation to create a MongoDB deployment that
you’ve provisioned enough servers with adequate storage and memory to
support the deployment.

Is any MongoDB data transferred by the automation agent?
--------------------------------------------------------

Agents do *not* transmit any data from a MongoDB deployment. The
agents only communicate cluster configuration information.

What version of MongoDB does automation require?
------------------------------------------------

Automation supports all versions of MongoDB after 2.4.

How many automation agents do I need?
-------------------------------------

To use Automation, you must have an agent running on every host where
a managed MongoDB instance runs.

How does automation work?
-------------------------

After you install the automation agent in the environment of the
MongoDB deployment, each agent periodically communicates with MMS and
performs all the work.

Agents constantly reassess their environment to adapt their work as
necessary. If an agent encounters an issue, such as
network connectivity problems, MMS failure, or server failure, the agents adjust
their work to compensate and safely arrive at their goal state.

Agents create plans to move from their current state to a goal state. Plans
execute in steps, where each step is autonomous and independent of
other steps.

For example, for an installation, the plan involves downloading
MongoDB, starting the process with the appropriate command line
options, initializing the replica set, waiting for a healthy
majority. The configuration reaches goal state when the replica set is
active and has a healthy majority.

What operation can MMS Automation perform?
------------------------------------------

Automation can deploy and maintain replica sets, sharded clusters, and
standalone. MMS Automation can also upgrade and downgrade to different
MongoDB versions.

What are the “steps” displayed for each process during installation and upgrade operations?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agents create plans to move from their current state to the goal
state. Plans execute in steps, where each step is autonomous and
independent of other steps.

Each part
of the plan corresponds to a step, and the MMS interface indicates the
current step as the process progresses.

Will MMS handle failures during an upgrade, such as MMS going down or a network partition?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, yes. The design of MMS Automation does not account
for *all* possible failures; however the architecture of the system
can work around many types of failures.

Can I import an existing deployment to MMS Automation?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can add existing MongoDB deployments to a new Automation
deployment. MMS Automation will be able to manage these deployments
like a new MongoDB deployment and can upgrade an existing deployment
to a new version of MongoDB.
