About |service| |data-lake|
---------------------------

Using |service| |data-lake| to ingest your S3 data into |service| clusters allows you to quickly
query data stored in your |aws| |s3| buckets using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell,
:doc:`MongoDB Compass </compass-connection>`, and any MongoDB driver.

When you create a |data-lake|, you will grant |service| read only access to |s3| buckets in your |aws| account and create a data
configuration file that maps data from your |s3| buckets to your MongoDB databases and collections.
|service| supports using any M10+ cluster, including Global Clusters, to connect to |data-lakes| in the same project. 

.. note::

   If you update your custom |aws| role |arn|, you must update the |aws|
   trust policy associated with the role. See the :guilabel:`Configure a New Data Lake` modal for instructions.

A MongoDB user must have one of the following roles to query an |service| 
|data-lake|:

- :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`

- :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`

- A :doc:`custom role </security-add-mongodb-roles/>` with the  
  :manual:`find </reference/privilege-actions/>` privilege
  
To view, create, or modify any existing 
|data-lakes| in an |service| project, click :guilabel:`Data Lake` on 
the left hand navigation.

Prerequisites
-------------

Verify that you meet the following prerequisites before you create a |data-lake|:

* One or more |aws| |s3| buckets in the same |aws| account.

* An |aws| CLI configured to access your |aws| account. Alternatively, you must have access to the |aws| Management Console
  with permission to create `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html>`_.

  .. note:

   To prevent excessive charges on your bill, create your |service|
   |data-lake| in the same |aws| region as your |s3| data source.
