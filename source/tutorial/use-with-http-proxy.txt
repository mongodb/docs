Configure |onprem| to Use an HTTP Proxy for Outgoing Traffic
============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In restricted network environments, you can configure |onprem| to use a
proxy to make outbound network requests. You would use a proxy to fetch
files from MongoDB, including Agents, MongoDB server binaries and the
|onprem| :term:`version manifest` or to contact any third-party
integrated services you have enabled.

Add Whitelist of Sites for Version Manifest Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem|, the :term:`Backup Daemon`, and MongoDB Agents need direct
outbound access to certain MongoDB, Inc.-hosted |url|\s over |https| to
download the MongoDB Agent and MongoDB versions.

If you want |onprem|, the Backup Daemon, and the MongoDB Agents to
use a proxy to limit internet access, you need to configure your
proxy to allow access to MongoDB |url|\s.

Which |url|\s you add to the whitelist depends upon what you have set
as your :setting:`Installer Download Source`. This setting has two
subsettings: :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:` and
:guilabel:`Agents get the installers from:`. The Agents' installer
source is also the Backup Daemon's source.
