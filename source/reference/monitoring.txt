====================
Monitoring Reference
====================

This document contains references of the different types of hosts,
databases, and other statuses that may occur in |monitoring|.

.. _host-types:

Host Types
----------

The possible values for the "Type" column in the Hosts page are:

- primary
- secondary
- standalone
- master
- slave
- unknown
- recovering

The "Host Type" selector on the advanced dashboard creator also
includes:

- conf
- mongos

.. note::

   The host type column may also have the value "no data," which means
   that |monitoring| has not received any data from the Monitoring
   Agent for this host. Possible causes for this state:

   - If the Monitoring Agent can't connect to the server because of
     networking restrictions or issues (i.e. firewalls, proxies,
     routing.)

   - If your database is running with SSL. You must enable SSL either
     globally or on a per-host basis. See :ref:`configure-ssl-monitoring` for more
     information.

   - If your database is running with authentication. You must supply
     |monitoring| with the authentication credentials either when
     you're adding a host *or* by clicking on the edit (i.e. "Pencil"
     button) on the right of the entry on the "Hosts" page.

Host Process Types
------------------

|monitoring| can monitor the process types:

- ``mongod`` database processes
- ``mongod`` arbiter processes
- ``mongos``
- Monitoring Agents

.. index:: alerts; events

- A *red bar* indicates a server restart.

- A *purple bar* indicates the server is now a primary.

- A *yellow bar* indicates the server is now a secondary.

   a drop-down menu next to the tile that lists available databases,
   including "global" to represent the global lock for this
   host. Select a database to see its lock utilization. See `the
   documentation of lock reporting in serverStatus
