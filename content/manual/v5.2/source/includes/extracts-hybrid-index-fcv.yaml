ref: 4.2-index-background
content: |

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.0"``,
    specifying ``background: true`` directs MongoDB to build the 
    index in the background. Background builds do
    *not* block operations on the collection. The default value is 
    ``false``.

  - .. versionchanged:: 4.2

    For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``,
    all index builds use an optimized 
    :ref:`build process <index-operations>` that holds the exclusive 
    lock only at the beginning and end of the build process. The rest of
    the build process yields to interleaving read and write operations. 
    MongoDB ignores the ``background`` option if specified.

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``,
    MongoDB waits for any in-progress
    :ref:`index builds <index-operations>` to finish before starting a 
    rollback.

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.0"``,
    MongoDB waits for any in-progress background

  .. versionchanged:: 4.2

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``, 
    MongoDB uses an optimized build process that only holds the 
    exclusive lock at the beginning and end of the index build. The rest 
    of the build process yields to interleaving read and write 
    operations.

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.0"``,
    the default foreground index build process holds the exclusive lock
    for the entire index build. ``background`` index builds do *not* 
    take an exclusive lock during the build process.

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``,
    the index build memory limit applies to all index builds.

    the index build memory limit only applies to foreground
    index builds.
