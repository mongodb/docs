   If you run |onprem| with
   :doc:`high availability </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability/>`,
   you must repeat the previous step on each |onprem| host.

           .. code-block:: sh

  For the selected versions, ensure that you have downloaded and placed
  the archived binaries in the :setting:`Versions Directory` for every
