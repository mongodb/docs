Definition
----------

.. query:: $where

   Use the :query:`$where` operator to pass either a string
   containing a JavaScript expression or a full JavaScript function to
   the query system. The :query:`$where` provides greater
   flexibility, but requires that the database processes the
   JavaScript expression or function for *each* document in the
   collection. Reference the document in the JavaScript expression or
   function using either ``this`` or ``obj`` .

.. important::
   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      The :query:`$expr` operator allows the
      use of :ref:`aggregation expressions <aggregation-framework>`
      within the query language. :query:`$expr` is faster than
      :query:`$where` because it does not execute JavaScript and should
      be preferred where possible.

``elemMatch``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only apply the :query:`$where` query operator to top-level
documents. The :query:`$where` query operator will not work inside a
nested document, for instance, in an :query:`$elemMatch` query.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Do not use global variables.

- :query:`$where` evaluates JavaScript and cannot take
  advantage of indexes. Therefore, query performance improves
  when you express your query using the standard MongoDB
  operators (e.g., :query:`$gt`, :query:`$in`).

- In general, you should use :query:`$where` only when you
  can't express your query using another operator. If you must
  use :query:`$where`, try to include at least one other
  standard query operator to filter the result set. Using
  :query:`$where` alone requires a collection scan.

Using normal non\-:query:`$where` query statements provides the
following performance advantages:

- MongoDB will evaluate non\-:query:`$where` components of query
  before :query:`$where` statements. If the
  non\-:query:`$where` statements match no documents, MongoDB
  will not perform any query evaluation using :query:`$where`.

- The non\-:query:`$where` query statements may use an
  :term:`index`.

Example
-------

Consider the following documents in the ``players`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {  
      _id: 12378,
      name: "Steve", 
      username: "steveisawesome",
      first_login: "2017-01-01"
   }
   {
      _id: 2,
      name: "Anya",
      username: "anya",
      first_login: "2001-02-02"
   }

The following example uses :query:`$where` and the ``hex_md5()``
JavaScript function to compare the value of the ``name`` field to an
MD5 hash and returns any matching document.

.. code-block:: sh

   db.players.find( { $where: function() { 
      return (hex_md5(this.name) == "9b53e667f30cd329dca1ec9e6a83e994") 
   } } );

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: sh

   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "name" : "Anya",
      "username" : "anya",
      "first_login" : "2001-02-02"
   }
