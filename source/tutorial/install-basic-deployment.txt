=================================
Install Basic Production |onprem|
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The basic deployment provides full functionality for monitoring and
automating your MongoDB deployments and optionally provides functionality
to back up your deployments.

The basic deployment uses three servers. The :ref:`mms-application-database`
runs on the first server, and the :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` runs on
the second. The two backing databases, the :ref:`mms-application-database`
and optional :ref:`Backup Blockstore database
<mms-backup-blockstore-database>`, run as a three-member :term:`replica
sets <replica set>`, each with two data-bearing members and an arbiter
spread across the three servers.

The replica sets provide durability in case of failure by storing
redundant copies of your application data and snapshots. However, the
basic deployment does not provide high availability and cannot continue to
accept writes if a backing database loses a replica set member. To provide high
availability, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/high-availability`.

This tutorial installs the basic deployment to servers that run either
**RHEL 6+** or **Amazon Linux**. The tutorial prepares the deployment's
servers, installs the backing
databases, and then installs the |application| and Backup Daemon. To
install |onprem| using a different configuration or operating system, see
:doc:`/core/deployments`.

The following diagram shows the basic deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

Required System Configurations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All servers that host MongoDB instances must meet the system
configurations in the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes
</administration/production-notes>`. This includes the server hosting the
Backup Daemon.

.. warning::

   Failure to configure servers according to the :manual:`MongoDB
   Production Notes </administration/production-notes>` can lead to
   production failure.

.. _basic-deploy-hardware-requirements:

Hardware Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++

Your |onprem| and MongoDB servers must meet the :ref:`hardware-requirements`
described on the :doc:`/core/requirements` page.
When a server hosts multiple components, you must sum the requirements for
each component to determine the requirements for the server.

A basic deployment that can monitor up to 400 hosts has the following requirements:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Server**
     - **RAM**
     - **Storage Capacity**

   * - **Server 1**, which runs the |application|, the Primary for the |application|
       database, and the Arbiter for the Backup Blockstore.
     - 23 GB
     - 200 GB
   * - 
     - 
     - 
   * - **Server 2**, which runs the Backup Daemon, the Primary for the Backup Blockstore, and
       the Arbiter for the |application| database.
     - 15 GB for the Backup Daemon **plus** 8 GB for every 1 TB of the Backup Blockstore database.
     - *Contact your MongoDB account manager.*
   * - 
     - 
     - 
   * - **Server 3**, which runs the secondaries for the |application| and Backup Blockstore databases.
     - 8 GB for the |application| database **plus** 8 GB for every 1 TB of the Backup Blockstore
       database.
     - 200 GB for the |application| database. *Contact your MongoDB account manager for requirements
       for the Backup Blockstore database.*

Permissions and Networking Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must have root access on the machines you are provisioning.

.. include:: /includes/requirements-aws-security.rst

Procedures
----------

.. _basic-deployment-prepare-servers:

Prepare Each Server
+++++++++++++++++++

Set up servers that meet the :ref:`hardware requirements <hardware-requirements>` for deployments that
monitor up to 400 hosts. If your deployment will monitor more than 400 hosts,
use the requirements on the :doc:`/core/requirements` page instead.

.. include:: /includes/steps/prepare-servers-basic-install.rst

Deploy the |application| Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install the :ref:`mms-application-database` as a three-member
:term:`replica set`, as shown in the deployment diagram.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-basic-application-database.rst

Deploy the Backup Blockstore Database (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you intend to use |mms| Backup, deploy the :ref:`Backup Blockstore
database <mms-backup-blockstore-database>` as a three-member replica set,
as shown in the deployment diagram.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-basic-backup-database.rst

Install the |application|
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install the :ref:`mms-application-package` on **server 1**.
The |application| and |application| database together provide full
monitoring and automation functionality.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-basic-application.rst

Install the Backup Daemon (Optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you will use |mms| Backup, install the :ref:`Backup Daemon
<backup-daemon>` on **server 2**.

For production, the Backup Daemon should always reside on a separate physical
server from the |application| and from any databases being monitored and/or
backed up.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-basic-backup-daemon.rst

Next Steps
----------

To set up a replica set for a test environment, see
:doc:`/tutorial/test-new-deployment`. The tutorial populates the replica set
with test data, registers a user, and installs the Monitoring and Backup
Agents on a client machine in order to monitor the test replica set.
