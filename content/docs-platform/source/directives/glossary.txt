   agent
      A lightweight program that provides an interface between your MongoDB processes and mms.


   agent API key
      A unique identifier that authenticates a project's
      :term:`MongoDB Agents <MongoDB Agent>` to |mms|. A project can have multiple agent |api| keys.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/manage-agent-api-key`

   authentication mechanism
      A method to enable access to a MongoDB database. This is separate
      from authorization, which grants you permission to use certain
      actions on a MongoDB database.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`

   automation
      The assisted management of MongoDB processes through the |mms|
      interface. The :term:`MongoDB Agents <MongoDB Agent>` installed on
      your MongoDB hosts allow you to deploy, configure, and update
      MongoDB processes directly from |mms|.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`automation`

   Automation Agent
      The lightweight component that had automated common management
      tasks. The Automation Agent runs on every server that ran a
      :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`.

      .. note::

         This has been replaced with the :term:`MongoDB Agent`.

   Backup Agent
      The lightweight component that had run within your data center and
      backed up MongoDB processes via the MongoDB wire protocol. No direct
      file system access was needed.

      .. note::

         This has been replaced with the :term:`MongoDB Agent`.

   batch
      The collection of jobs needed to restore a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`:
      one job for each shard and one job for the :manual:`config server </reference/glossary/#std-term-config-server>`.

      Replica set restore jobs do not use batches.

   checkpoint
      A point in time between snapshots to which you can restore a sharded
      cluster. |mms| must stop the :term:`balancer` each time it creates a
      checkpoint. |mms| doesn't require checkpoints and disables
      checkpoints by default.

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/important/checkpoints-fcv-4-0-only.rst

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`checkpoint`


   cluster
      In |mms|, *cluster* can refer to either a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` or
      :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.


   custom snapshot
      A backup of the state of your MongoDB deployment at a point in time
      between :manual:`stored snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`. |mms| builds a custom
      snapshot by applying oplog data to a stored snapshot.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview`

   deduplication
      A process that eliminates redundant data. This data can be additional
      copies of database or file system documents or redundant data within
      those documents at the block level when written to a storage medium
      like spinning or solid state disks. Only unique documents or blocks
      are written to a storage medium. This process usually applies to
      backups or data archiving.

      .. example::

         Each recipient in an email system may have their own copy of an
         email sent to the whole company. With deduplication, all copies of
         this except one are replaced with pointers to a single stored copy
         before backing up the email system. This effectively reduces the
         amount of storage capacity needed to back up this one email by 99
         percent.


   deployment
      Usually refers to all the MongoDB processes that run within |a-mms|
      :cloudmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`. *Deployment* can also refer to a specific set of
      MongoDB processes, such as a specific :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` or
      :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.


   dirty bytes
      Data that has been updated in the WiredTiger cache but not flushed to
      disk.


   excluded namespace
      A database or collection that |mms| will not back up, as designated
      by its :term:`namespace`.

      .. seealso::

         :ref:`namespaces-filter`

   group
      A distinct set of MongoDB processes and |mms| users. Synonymous with
      :cloudmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`.

      .. seealso::

         :doc:`/tutorial/manage-projects`

   host
      A physical machine, virtual machine, or container that serves one or
      more MongoDB processes.

   initial sync
      The MongoDB operation that replicates data from an existing
      :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` member to a new member. |mms| uses initial
      sync when :doc:`starting a new backup </tutorial/enable-backup>`.
  
      .. seealso::

         :manual:`Replica Set Data Synchronization
         </core/replica-set-sync>` in the MongoDB manual

   link-token
      A string that contains the information necessary to connect from
      |mms| to |service-short| during a Live Migration from an |mms| deployment
      to a deployment in |service-short|.
