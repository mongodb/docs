MongoDB provides a number of features that allow application
developers and database administrators to customize the behavior of a
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set` deployment so that
MongoDB may be *more* "data center aware," or allow operational
and location-based separation.

MongoDB also supports workload isolation based on functional parameters, to ensure
that certain :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances are only used for reporting workloads
or that certain high-frequency portions of a sharded collection only exist on
specific shards.

The following documents, *found either in this section or other sections
of this manual*, provide information on customizing a deployment for
operation- and location-based separation:

:doc:`/core/workload-isolation`
   MongoDB lets you specify that certain application operations use
   certain :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

:doc:`/core/zone-sharding`
   A zone represents one or more ranges of shard key values for a
   sharded collection. MongoDB routes reads and writes for sharded
   data covered by a zone only to shards inside that zone. For use in
   managing data distribution and deployment patterns.

   Administrative tasks related to configuring zones in sharded
   clusters
