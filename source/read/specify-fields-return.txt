Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to specify which fields to 
return from a read operation. You can select these fields by using a
**projection**, a document that specifies which fields MongoDB returns from a query.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>` guide.

Projection Types
----------------

You can use a projection to specify which fields to include and exclude in retrieved
documents. By default, including certain fields excludes all other fields, so you cannot
combine inclusion and exclusion statements in a single projection,
unless you are excluding the ``_id`` field from results.

Specify Fields to Include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following syntax to specify the fields to include in the result of a
read operation:

.. code-block:: java

   projection(fields(include("<field name>")))

To use a projection, pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method. Then, chain
the ``projection()`` method to the ``find()`` method call. 

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to retrieve documents in which
the ``name`` field value is ``"Emerald Pub"``. It then uses a projection to
include only the ``name``, ``cuisine``, and ``borough`` fields from the returned documents.

.. io-code-block::
    
   .. input:: /includes/project.java
      :start-after: start-project-include
      :end-before: end-project-include
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      {'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'borough': 'Manhattan', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub'}
      {'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'borough': 'Queens', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub'}

When you use a projection to specify fields to include in the return
document, the ``_id`` field is also included by default. All other fields are
implicitly excluded. You must :ref:`explicitly exclude the _id field <java-rs-project-remove-id>`
to omit it from the returned documents.

.. _java-rs-project-remove-id:

Exclude the _id Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can exclude the ``_id`` field from returned documents by using the ``excludeId()`` method.

The following example performs the same query as in the preceding example, but also
excludes the ``_id`` field in the returned documents:

.. io-code-block::
    
   .. input:: /includes/project.java
      :start-after: start-project-include-without-id
      :end-before: end-project-include-without-id
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      {'borough': 'Manhattan', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub'}
      {'borough': 'Queens', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub'}

Specify Fields to Exclude
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following syntax to specify the fields to exclude from the result of a
read operation:

.. code-block:: java

   projection(fields(exclude("<field name>")))

To use a projection, pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method. Then,
chain the ``projection()`` method to the ``find()`` method call.  

The following Example uses the ``find()`` method to find all restaurants in which
the ``name`` field value is ``"Emerald Pub"``. It then uses a projection to
exclude the ``grades`` and ``address`` fields from the returned documents.

.. io-code-block::
    
   .. input:: /includes/project.java
      :start-after: start-project-exclude
      :end-before: end-project-exclude
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 

      {'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'borough': 'Manhattan', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub', 'restaurant_id': '40367329'}
      {'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'borough': 'Queens', 'cuisine': 'American', 'name': 'Emerald Pub', 'restaurant_id': '40668598'}

When you use a projection to specify which fields to exclude,
any unspecified fields are implicitly included in the return document.

Projection Errors
-----------------

The following section describes an error you might encounter when using projections.

Inclusion and Exclusion Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver returns the following if you attempt to
include and exclude fields in a single projection:

.. code-block:: none

   OperationFailure: ... Cannot Do Exclusion on Field <field> in Inclusion Projection

To resolve this error, ensure that your projection specifies only fields to include or only fields to exclude.
