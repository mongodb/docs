We are extending support for faceting on numeric and date fields using  
:ref:`bson-data-types-number` and :ref:`bson-data-types-date` type from 
August to September 2022. You must migrate to the 
:ref:`bson-data-types-number-facet` and 
:ref:`bson-data-types-date-facet` types in all index definitions for 
faceting on numeric and date fields, respectively.
