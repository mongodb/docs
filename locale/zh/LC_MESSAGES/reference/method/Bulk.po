"Bulk operations builder used to construct a list of write operations to "

"either the :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()` or the "
":method:`db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()` method."

"With an *ordered* operations list, MongoDB executes the write operations "

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-ordered-list.rst:1
msgid ""
"When executing an :method:`ordered "
"<db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()>` list of operations, MongoDB "
"groups the operations by the :data:`operation type <batchType>` and "
"contiguity; i.e. *contiguous* operations of the same type are grouped "
"together. For example, if an ordered list has two insert operations "
"followed by an update operation followed by another insert operation, "
"MongoDB groups the operations into three separate groups: first group "
"contains the two insert operations, second group contains the update "
"operation, and the third group contains the last insert operation. This "
"behavior is subject to change in future versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-batches.rst:1
msgid ""
"Each group of operations can have at most :limit:`1000 operations <Write "
"Command Operation Limit Size>`. If a group exceeds this :limit:`limit "
"<Write Command Operation Limit Size>`, MongoDB will divide the group into"
" smaller groups of 1000 or less. For example, if the bulk operations list"
" consists of 2000 insert operations, MongoDB creates 2 groups, each with "
"1000 operations."
