Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management system
that reduces the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups
on machines with large amounts of memory by using larger memory pages.

However, database workloads often perform poorly with THP enabled,
because they tend to have sparse rather than contiguous memory access
patterns. When running MongoDB on Linux, THP should be disabled for
best performance.

To ensure that THP is disabled before :binary:`~bin.mongod` starts,
you should create a service file for your platform's initialization
system that disables THP at boot. Instructions are provided below for
both the **systemd** and the **System V init** initialization systems.

Additionally, for :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` / CentOS
systems that make use of ``ktune`` and ``tuned`` performance profiles,
you must create a custom ``tuned`` profile as well.

Create a Service File
---------------------

To create a service file that disables THP, you will use the
built-in initialization system for your platform. Recent versions
of Linux tend to use **systemd** (which uses the ``systemctl`` command),
while older versions of Linux tend to use **System V init** (which uses
the ``service`` command). Refer to the documentation for your operating
system for more information.

Use the initialization system appropriate for your platform:

   .. tab:: systemd (systemctl)
      :tabid: systemd-systemctl

   .. tab:: System V Init (service)
      :tabid: initd-service

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disable-thp-in-initd.rst


.. _configure-thp-tuned:

Using ``tuned`` and ``ktune``
-----------------------------

.. important::

   If using ``tuned`` or ``ktune``, you must also perform the steps in
   this section after creating the service file above.

``tuned`` and ``ktune`` are dynamic kernel tuning tools that can affect
the transparent huge pages setting on your system. If you are using
``tuned`` / ``ktune`` on your :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`
/ CentOS system while running ``mongod``, you must create a custom
``tuned`` profile to ensure that THP remains disabled.
