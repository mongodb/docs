If your source replica set runs a MongoDB version {+c2c-version+} or earlier
and is monitored by |com|, you can use the procedures linked from this section
to live migrate data into |service| using the legacy live migration service
through the {+atlas-ui+}.

Restrictions
------------

The following statements describe restrictions for various aspects
of legacy live migration. Legacy live migration is a type of live migration
that you run in the {+atlas-ui+} and that is backed by |mongomirror|.

- **Legacy live migration (push) is not supported for deployments managed or monitored by Ops Manager**

  - For source deployments running MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+,
    where the deployments are managed or monitored by |onprem|, legacy live migration (push)
    is not supported.
  - For source deployments running a MongoDB version {+c2c-version+} or earlier,
    where the deployments are managed or monitored by |onprem|, live migration (push)
    is deprecated.

    Use the following alternative ways to migrate your source deployments
    that are managed or monitored by |onprem| into |service|:

    - :cloudmgr:`Add your deployment to monitoring in Cloud Manager </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
      and use live migrate (push). See :ref:`<c2c-push-live-migration>`
      for MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+ , or the procedures
      in this section for MongoDB before {+c2c-version+}.
    - Use live migration (pull). For MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+,
      see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`. For MongoDB before {+c2c-version+},
      see :ref:`live-migration-pre60`.
    - Use standalone |mongosync|.

- **Legacy live migration (push) is not supported for sharded clusters**

     - |com| **pushes** data from the source replica set running a MongoDB version {+c2c-version+}
       or earlier to a destination replica set in |service|.

   * - Live migrate a sharded {+cluster+} monitored in |onprem| or |mms| to |service|

   * - Live migrate a standalone MongoDB node running MongoDB before {+c2c-version+}

     - :opsmgr:`Convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
       the standalone MongoDB node in |onprem|, or
       :cloudmgr:`convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
       the standalone MongoDB node in |mms| to a single-node
       replica set and then :doc:`live migrate (push) <import/migrate-from-com-rs>`
       it to |service|.
