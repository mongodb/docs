This guide shows you how to configure federated authentication 
using |idp-provider| as your |idp|.

After integrating |idp-provider| and |service|, you can use your 
company's credentials to log in to |service| and other MongoDB cloud 
services.

Limitations
-----------

|service| doesn't support single sign-on integration for database
users. To configure |service| to authenticate and authorize database
users from |idp-provider| using |ldap|, see |idp-ldap-link|.

Required Access
---------------

To manage federated authentication, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` access to one or more organizations that are
delegating federation settings to the instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use |idp-provider| as an |idp| for |service|, you must have:

- An |azure| subscription. To obtain a subscription, visit the 
  `Microsoft Azure portal <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/>`__.
- An |idp-provider| tenant associated with your subscription. For 
  information about setting up an |idp-provider| tenant, see the 
  :azure:`Microsoft Entra ID Documentation </active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant>`.
- ``Global Administrator`` privileges in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.
- A custom, routable domain name.

Procedures
----------

Add Domain users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't already, use the |azure| console to add your custom
domain name to |idp-provider| and create users:

.. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-users.rst

.. _atlas-configure-azuread-idp:

Configure |idp-provider| as an Identity Provider  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the |azure| console to configure |idp-provider| as a |saml| |idp|.
You can either add the MongoDB Cloud app from the Gallery or configure
an application manually.

   .. tab:: Configure an App Manually
      :tabid: manual

      .. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-as-idp-manual.rst

Add |idp-provider| as an Identity Provider in |service|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` and the |azure|
console to add |idp-provider| as an |idp|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-to-fmc.rst

.. include:: /includes/map-domain.rst

.. _azure-ad-idp-map-org:

.. include:: /includes/associate-domain-map-org.rst

.. _azure-ad-map-org:

(Optional) Map an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` to assign your
domain's users access to specific |service| organizations:

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-organization-mapping.rst

(Optional) Configure Advanced Federated Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following advanced options for federated
authentication for greater control over your federated users and
authentication flow:

- :ref:`bypass-saml`

.. note::

   The following advanced options for federated authentication require
   you to :ref:`map an organization <azure-ad-map-org>`.

- :ref:`advanced-option-default-role`
- :ref:`restrict-org-access-by-domain`
- :ref:`restrict-fed-user-membership`

Sign in to |service| Using Your Login URL
-----------------------------------------

All users you assigned to the |azure| application can log in to 
|service| using their |idp-provider| credentials on the 
:guilabel:`Login URL`. Users have access to the organizations you 
mapped to your |idp|.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/use-alternate-idp-multiple-mapped-domains.rst

If you selected a default organization role, new users who log in to
|service| using the :guilabel:`Login URL` have the role you specified.
