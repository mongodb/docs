Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform searches on your documents
by using the {+search+} feature. {+odm-long+} provides an API to
perform {+search+} queries directly with your models. This guide
describes how to create {+search+} indexes and provides examples of
how to use the {+odm-short+} to perform searches.

.. note:: Deployment Compatibility

   You can use the {+search+} feature only when
   you connect to MongoDB Atlas clusters. This feature is not
   available for self-managed deployments.

To learn more about {+search+}, see the :atlas:`Overview
</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/>` in the 
Atlas documentation. The {+search+} API internally uses the
``$search`` aggregation operator to perform queries. To learn more about
this operator, see the :atlas:`$search
</atlas-search/aggregation-stages/search/>` reference in the Atlas
documentation.

.. note::
   
   You might not be able to use the methods described in
   this guide for every type of {+search+} query.
   For more complex use cases, create an aggregation pipeline by using
   the :ref:`laravel-aggregation-builder`.
   
   To perform searches on vector embeddings in MongoDB, you can use the
   {+odm-long+} {+vector-search+} API. To learn about this feature, see
   the :ref:`laravel-vector-search` guide.

.. _laravel-as-index:

Create a {+search+} Index
-------------------------------

You can create a {+search+} index in either of the following ways:

- Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade and pass the
  ``searchIndex()`` helper method with index creation details. To learn
  more about this strategy, see the
  :ref:`laravel-schema-builder-atlas-idx` section of the Schema Builder guide.
  
- Access a collection, then call the
  :phpmethod:`createSearchIndex() <phpmethod.MongoDB\\Collection::createSearchIndex()>`
  method from the {+php-library+}, as shown in the following code:
  
  .. code-block:: php
     
     $collection = DB::connection('mongodb')->getCollection('movies');
     
     $collection->createSearchIndex(
         ['mappings' => ['dynamic' => true]], 
         ['name' => 'search_index']
     );

.. important:: Asynchronous Search Index Operations

   The operations that create and remove {+search+} indexes run asynchronously.
   As a result, you cannot create a new {+search+} index while an index with the same name
   in the same namespace is being dropped. Ensure that you wait until MongoDB drops
   the conflicting index before calling the ``createSearchIndex()`` method.

   Additionally, you must wait until the index is queryable before using it.
   To see if your index is queryable, run the :phpmethod:`Collection::listSearchIndexes() <phpmethod.MongoDB\\Collection::listSearchIndexes()>`
   method, find the document describing the new index in the method output, and
   verify the ``queryable`` field value. Documents added after index creation are not
   available immediately in the query results.

Perform Queries
---------------

In this section, you can learn how to use the {+search+} API in the
{+odm-short+}.

General Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+odm-short+} provides the ``search()`` method as a query
builder method and as an Eloquent model method. You can use the
``search()`` method to run {+search+} queries on documents in your
collections.

You must pass an ``operator`` parameter to the ``search()`` method that
is an instance of ``SearchOperatorInterface`` or an array that contains
the operator type, field name, and query value. You can
create an instance of ``SearchOperatorInterface`` by calling the
``Search::text()`` method and passing the field you are
querying and your search term or phrase.

You must include the following import statement in your application to
create a ``SearchOperatorInterface`` instance:

.. code-block:: php

   use MongoDB\Builder\Search;

The following code performs a {+search+} query on the ``Movie``
model's ``title`` field for the term ``'dream'``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/as-avs/AtlasSearchTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-search-query
      :end-before: end-search-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
         { "title": "Dreaming of Jakarta",
           "year": 1990
         },
         { "title": "See You in My Dreams",
           "year": 1996
         }
      ]

You can use the ``search()`` method to perform many types of 
{+search+} queries. Depending on your desired query, you can pass the
following optional parameters to ``search()``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``index``
     - ``string``
     - Provides the name of the {+search+} index to use

   * - ``highlight``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies highlighting options for displaying search terms in their
       original context

   * - ``concurrent``
     - ``bool``
     - Parallelizes search query across segments on dedicated search nodes

   * - ``count``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies the count options for retrieving a count of the results

   * - ``searchAfter``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies a reference point for returning documents starting
       immediately following that point
   
   * - ``searchBefore``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies a reference point for returning documents starting
       immediately preceding that point

   * - ``scoreDetails``
     - ``bool``
     - Specifies whether to retrieve a detailed breakdown of the score
       for results
   
   * - ``sort``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies the fields on which to sort the results
   
   * - ``returnStoredSource``
     - ``bool``
     - Specifies whether to perform a full document lookup on the
       back end database or return only stored source fields directly
       from {+search+}
   
   * - ``tracking``
     - ``array``
     - Specifies the tracking option to retrieve analytics information
       on the search terms

To learn more about these parameters, see the :atlas:`Fields
</atlas-search/aggregation-stages/search/#fields>` section of the
``$search`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.

Autocomplete Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+odm-short+} provides the ``autocomplete()`` method as a query
builder method and as an Eloquent model method. You can use the
``autocomplete()`` method to run autocomplete searches on documents in your
collections. This method returns only the values of the field you
specify as the query path.

To learn more about this type of {+search+} query, see the
:atlas:`autocomplete </atlas-search/autocomplete/>` reference in the
Atlas documentation.

.. note::

   You must create a {+search+} index with an autocomplete configuration
   on your collection before you can perform autocomplete searches. See the
   :ref:`laravel-as-index` section of this guide to learn more about
   creating Search indexes.

The following code performs a {+search+} autocomplete query for the
string ``"jak"`` on the ``title`` field:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/as-avs/AtlasSearchTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-auto-query
      :end-before: end-auto-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
         "Dreaming of Jakarta",
         "Jakob the Liar",
         "Emily Calling Jake"
      ]

You can also pass the following optional parameters to the ``autocomplete()``
method to customize the query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``fuzzy``
     - ``bool`` or ``array``
     - Enables fuzzy search and fuzzy search options
     - ``false``

   * - ``tokenOrder``
     - ``string``
     - Specifies order in which to search for tokens
     - ``'any'``

To learn more about these parameters, see the :atlas:`Options
</atlas-search/autocomplete/#options>` section of the
``autocomplete`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.
