|service| lets you restore data from an
:ref:`M2 or M5 cluster snapshot <m2-m5-snapshots>`. You can restore
``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots to a cluster tier ``M2`` or greater.

Restore Restrictions
--------------------

- |service| can only restore ``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots to a
  :term:`replica set` that does *not* use
  :doc:`Encryption at Rest </security-aws-kms>`.

- The target cluster must run the same major release version of
  MongoDB as the snapshot MongoDB version. For example, you can only
  restore a snapshot using MongoDB 4.0 to a target cluster running
  MongoDB 4.0.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. .. include:: /includes/fact-stop-ops-during-restore.rst

2. To :ref:`download your snapshot via HTTPS <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>`, 
   you must add the |ipaddr| or |cidr| addresses of the client
   downloading the snapshot to your |service|
   :ref:`project whitelist <access-list>`.

Procedure
---------

1. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

#. Find the desired cluster snapshot to restore.

#. For the desired cluster, click :guilabel:`Restore` or
   :guilabel:`Download`.

#. Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

   - :ref:`Download your snapshot via HTTPS <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>`

   - :ref:`Restore your snapshot to an Atlas cluster <m2-m5-restore-project>`

You can restore to any |service| cluster in a project for which you
have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

1. In the :guilabel:`Snapshots` tab, locate the snapshot you wish to
   restore in the :guilabel:`All Daily Snapshots` table.

#. In the :guilabel:`Actions` column of the table, click
   :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target cluster to
   which you want to restore.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target cluster.
