           After the ``MSI`` downloads, you can run an unattended
           install. You run an unattended install from the command line
           in either the command interpreter or PowerShell. To learn
           more about unattended installs, see Microsoft's
           documentation on `Standard Installer Command-Line Options
           <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/msi/standard-installer-command-line-options>`__

           To run the ``MSI`` installer unattended from the command
           line, you invoke ``msiexec.exe`` with the ``/q`` and ``/i``
           flags and a combination of required and optional
           parameters:

           .. example::

              To install the Automation Agent unattended, you would invoke ``msiexec.exe`` with the following options:

              .. code-block:: powershell

                 msiexec.exe /q /i "C:\PATH\TO\mongodb-mms-automation-agent-<VERSION>.windows_x86_64.msi" MMSGROUPID=<GROUP.ID> MMSAPIKEY=<AGENT.API.ID> MMSBASEURL="<http://opsmanager.example.com:8080>" LOGFILE="C:\MMSData\Server\Log\automation-agent.log" MMSCONFIGBACKUP="C:\MMSData\Automation\mms-cluster-config-backup.json"

   By default, the MongoDB binaries and |mms|
   configuration backup file are located in
   ``%SystemDrive%\MMSAutomation\versions``.

   .. note::
      Windows sets the ``%SystemDrive%`` environment variable to the
      drive on which you installed Windows. By default, you would be
      directed to install Windows on the ``C:`` drive. To find your
      ``%SystemDrive%``, issue with following command from `PowerShell
      <https://msdn.microsoft.com /en-us/powershell/>`__:

      .. code-block:: ps1

         get-childitem env:SystemDrive

   If you want to store these files in a different directory, follow
   these procedures:

action:
  - heading: "To change the location of the Automation Agent Binaries:"
    pre: |

      a. Click :guilabel:`Deployment`; :guilabel:`Agents`; and then
         :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings`.

      #. Below the :guilabel:`Download Directory` heading, click the
         pencil icon to the right of the path shown in
         :guilabel:`Download Directory (Windows)`.

      #. Change the path to the new path you want.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      #. Create the new directory you specified on each host that runs
         an Automation Agent. Use Windows Explorer to move the file or
         issue the following command from a Command Prompt or
         `PowerShell <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/>`__:

         .. code-block:: ps1

              md \<newPath>

         .. important::

            Make sure the system user that runs the Automation Agent
            can write to this new directory. This is usually the
            ``SYSTEM`` user, which requires no additional configuration
            unless you changed the user.

  - heading: "To change the location of the Automation Agent configuration backup:"
    pre: |

      a. Open the :ref:`Automation Agent configuration file
         <automation-agent-config-file-location>` in your preferred text
         editor.

      #. Change the :asetting:`mmsConfigBackup` setting to the new path
         for the configuration backup file. Replace ``X`` with the drive
         letter on which your backup is stored.

         .. code-block:: ini
            :class: copyable-code

            mmsConfigBackup=X:\<newPath>\mms-cluster-config-backup.json

      #. Save the Automation Agent configuration file.

      #. Move the configuration backup file to the new directory. Use
         Windows Explorer to move the file or issue the following
         command from a Command Prompt or `PowerShell <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/>`__:

         .. code-block:: ps1
            :class: copyable-code
