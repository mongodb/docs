========================================
Adjust Maximum Time for Query Operations
========================================

.. meta::
   :description: Adjust the MAX TIME MS setting in Compass to set a time limit for query operations, ensuring they don't exceed a specified duration.

The :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` query bar option sets the cumulative time
limit in milliseconds to process query bar operations. If the time
limit is reached before the operation completes, |compass-short|
interrupts the operation.

The default :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` value is 60000, or 60 seconds.
Consider raising this value if you meet one of the following conditions:

- You have a :manual:`large collection </reference/limits/#data>`.
- Your operations frequently time out.
- You query data archived from the Atlas cluster using Online Archive. 

You can also
consider creating :ref:`indexes <compass-indexes>` to improve query
performance.
