For |mms| to monitor, deploy, or back up a MongoDB deployment that uses
|tls|, you must enable |tls| for the |mms| project.

.. include:: /includes/note-reset-auth.rst

Prerequisite
------------

Get and Install the TLS Certificate on Each MongoDB Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquire a |tls| certificate for each host serving a MongoDB process.
This certificate must include the |fqdn| for the hostname of this
MongoDB host. The |fqdn| must be the Subject Alternative Name of this 
host. You must install this |tls| certificate on the MongoDB host.

      .. important::
         
         You must complete:

         1. :ref:`Set Existing Deployments to Use TLS <set-existing-ssl>`,
            then
         2. :ref:`Enable TLS for the Project <set-project-ssl>`

         before you click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.

      .. _set-existing-ssl:

      Set Existing Deployments to Use |tls|
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      If you wish to enable |tls| for existing MongoDB deployments in your
      |mms| project:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-ssl-for-existing-deployment.rst

      .. _set-project-ssl:

      Enable |tls| for the Project
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-ssl-for-group.rst

      - If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that used
        Automation, the {+mdbagent+} manages the |tls| settings.

      - If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that did not
        use Automation but you had Backup Agents, Monitoring Agents, or
        both, you *can* set your *Backup Agent and Monitoring
        Agent-specific* settings during the Agent update or through the
        following procedure:

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-agents.rst

         .. step:: Edit the configuration.

            a. Click :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings`, 
               :guilabel:`Custom Configurations`, and then 
               :guilabel:`Edit Custom Configuration`.

            #. Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt`.

         .. step::  Complete the :guilabel:`Backup Configurations` section.

            a. Type the desired
               :ref:`setting <mongodb-agent-backup-settings>`
               in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and its corresponding 
               value in the :guilabel:`Value` box.

            #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
               :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

            #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

         .. step:: Complete the :guilabel:`Monitoring Configurations` section.

            a. Type the desired
               :ref:`setting <mongodb-agent-monitoring-settings>`
               in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and the corresponding 
               value in the :guilabel:`Value` box.

            #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
               :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

            #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

      You can click the :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` to remove any settings
      that you have added.
   
   .. tab:: Monitored Deployment
      :tabid: monitored

      If you are using Cloud Manager's monitoring only 
      feature with a TLS-enabled cluster, you must complete the following steps
      to allow the MongoDB monitoring agent to connect to the TLS-enabled 
      monitored cluster.
