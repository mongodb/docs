msgid "Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. SCRAM is based on the IETF `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that defines best practices for implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords."

#: ../source/core/security-scram.txt:25
msgid "Using SCRAM, MongoDB verifies the supplied user credentials against the user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password <admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database <admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database where the user was created, and together with the user's name, serves to identify the user."
