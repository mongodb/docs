   * - | ``allowed_request_origins``
       | Document
     - An array of URLs that incoming requests may originate from. If you define

       .. tip::
          
          Request origins are URLs with the following form:
          
          .. code-block:: text
             
             <scheme>://<host>[:port]

       Valid options:
       
       - ``"GLOBAL"`` for :ref:`Global Deployment <global-deployment>`
       - ``"LOCAL"`` for :ref:`Local Deployment <local-deployment>`
   
   * - | ``location``
       | String
     - The name of the :ref:`cloud region <deployment-regions>` that the application
       is deployed in.
       
       - :ref:`Global applications <global-deployment>` process
         all database writes in this region, but serve other application
         requests in the nearest deployment region.
       
       - :ref:`Local applications <local-deployment>` process all
         application requests and database writes in this region.
