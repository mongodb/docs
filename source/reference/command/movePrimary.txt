.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`sharded cluster`, :dbcommand:`movePrimary` reassigns the
   :term:`primary shard` which holds all un-sharded collections in
   the database.  :dbcommand:`movePrimary` first changes the primary shard in
   the cluster metadata, and then migrates all un-sharded collections to the
   specified :term:`shard`. Use the command with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { movePrimary: <databaseName>, to: <newPrimaryShard> } )

   For example, the following command moves the primary shard from ``test`` to
   ``shard0001``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { movePrimary : "test", to : "shard0001" } )

   When the command returns, the database's primary shard location
   has switched to the specified shard. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command that is only
   available for :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

   .. warning::

      After starting :dbcommand:`movePrimary`, do **not** perform any
      read or write operations against any unsharded collection in that
      database until the command completes. Read or write operations
      issued against those collections during the migration can result
      in unexpected behavior, including potential failure of the
      migration operation or loss of data.

Considerations

.. _movePrimary-maintenance-window:

Issue ``movePrimary`` During A Maintenance Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` may require a significant time to complete
depending on the size of the database and factors such as network health
or machine resources. Read or write operations issued against the
database during the migration can result in unexpected behavior,
including potential failure of the migration operation or loss of data.

Consider scheduling a maintenance window during which applications stop
all reads and writes to the cluster. Issuing :dbcommand:`movePrimary`
during planned downtime mitigates the risk of encountering undefined
behavior due to interleaving reads or writes to the unsharded
collections in the database. 

Namespace Conflicts Prevent Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`movePrimary` fails if the destination shard contains a
conflicting collection namespace. For example:

1. An administrator issues ``movePrimary`` to change the
   primary shard for the ``hr`` database.

#. A user or application issues a write operation against an unsharded
   collection in ``hr`` while ``movePrimary`` is moving that collection.
   The write operation creates the collection in the original primary
   shard.
  
#. An administrator later issues ``movePrimary`` to restore
   the original primary shard for the ``hr`` database.

#. ``movePrimary`` fails due to the conflicting namespace
   left behind from the interleaving write operation.

Destination Shard Must Rebuild Indexes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the ``movePrimary`` operation, the destination shard must
rebuild indexes on the migrated collections after becoming the primary
shard. This may require a significant amount of time depending on
the number of indexes per collection and the amount of data to index.

See :doc:`/core/index-creation` for more information on the index
build process.
