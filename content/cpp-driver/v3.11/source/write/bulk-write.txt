Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform multiple write operations
in a single database call by using **bulk write operations**.

Consider a scenario in which you want to insert a document into a collection,
update multiple other documents, then delete a document. If you use
individual methods, each operation requires its own database call. Instead,
you can use a bulk operation to reduce the number of calls to the database.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _cpp-bulk-start-operation:

Create a Bulk Write Instance
----------------------------

Before running a bulk write operation, call the ``create_bulk_write()`` method on
a collection. This method returns an instance of the ``mongocxx::bulk_write``
class that you can use to store instructions about which types of bulk writes to
perform.

The following example calls the ``create_bulk_write()`` method on the ``restaurants``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
    :start-after: start-create-bulk-write
    :end-before: end-create-bulk-write
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

You can then append write models to your ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance to define
the bulk operation. For more information, see the following :ref:`cpp-bulk-define-write-models`
section.

.. _cpp-bulk-define-write-models:

Define the Write Operations
---------------------------

For each write operation you want to perform, create an instance of one of
the following model classes:

- ``mongocxx::model::insert_one``
- ``mongocxx::model::update_one``
- ``mongocxx::model::update_many``
- ``mongocxx::model::replace_one``
- ``mongocxx::model::delete_one``
- ``mongocxx::model::delete_many``

Then, append each write model to the ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance returned
by the ``create_bulk_write()`` method.

The following sections show how to create and use instances of the preceding
write model classes.

.. _cpp-bulk-insert-model:

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an instance of the ``mongocxx::model::insert_one``
class and specify the document you want to insert. Then, append the model instance
to an instance of the ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` class.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::insert_one`` and appends
it to a ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance called ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-insert-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-insert-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To insert multiple documents, create an instance of ``mongocxx::model::insert_one``
for each document.

.. _cpp-bulk-update-model:

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a document, create an instance of ``mongocxx::model::update_one``. This model
instructs the driver to update *the first* document that matches your query filter. Then,
append the model instance to an instance of the ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` class. 

Pass the following arguments to the ``mongocxx::model::update_one`` model:

- **Query filter** document, which specifies the criteria used to match documents
  in your collection.
- **Update** document, which specifies the kind of update to perform. For more information
  about update operations, see the :manual:`Field Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update-field/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::update_one`` and appends
it to a ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance called ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To update multiple documents, create an instance of ``mongocxx::model::update_many``
and pass in the same arguments. This model instructs the driver to update *all* documents
that match your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::update_many`` and appends
it to ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-update-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-update-many
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

.. _cpp-bulk-replace-model:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replace operation removes all fields and values of a specified document and
replaces them with new ones. To perform a replace operation, create an instance
of the ``mongocxx::model::replace_one`` class and pass it a query filter and
the fields and values you want to store in the matching document. Then, append
the model instance to an instance of the ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` class.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::replace_one`` and appends
it to a ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance called ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-replace-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-replace-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To replace multiple documents, you must create a new instance of ``mongocxx::model::replace_one``
for each document.

.. _cpp-bulk-delete-model:

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a document, create an instance of the ``mongocxx::model::delete_one`` class and
pass in a query filter specifying the document you want to delete. This model instructs
the driver to delete only *the first* document that matches your query filter. Then, append
the model instance to an instance of the ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` class.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::delete_one`` and appends
it to a ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance called ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-one
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To delete multiple documents, create an instance of the ``mongocxx::model::delete_many``
class and pass in a query filter specifying the document you want to delete. This model
instructs the driver to delete *all* documents that match your query filter.

The following example creates an instance of ``mongocxx::model::delete_many`` and appends
it to ``bulk``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-delete-many
   :end-before: end-bulk-delete-many
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

Run the Bulk Operation
----------------------

To run a bulk operation, call the ``execute()`` method on an instance of the 
``mongocxx::bulk_write`` class that contains your write models. By default, the
``execute()`` method runs the operations in the order they're appended to the
``mongocxx::bulk_write`` instance.

The following example performs the :ref:`insert <cpp-bulk-insert-model>`,
:ref:`update <cpp-bulk-update-model>`, :ref:`replace <cpp-bulk-replace-model>`,
and :ref:`delete <cpp-bulk-delete-model>` operations specified in the preceding
sections of this guide by appending each corresponding write model to an instance
of ``mongocxx::bulk_write`` and calling the ``execute()`` method. Then, it prints
the number of modified documents:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
      :start-after: start-bulk-run
      :end-before: end-bulk-run
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:
      :emphasize-lines: 30

   .. output::
      
      Modified documents: 2

If any of the write operations fail, the {+driver-short+} raises a
``mongocxx::bulk_write_exception`` and does not perform any further operations.

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``modified_count()`` function, see the :ref:`cpp-bulk-return-value`
   section of this guide.

Customize Bulk Write Operations
-------------------------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``create_bulk_write()`` method by passing
an instance of the ``mongocxx::options::bulk_write`` class as a parameter. The following
table describes the fields you can set in a ``mongocxx::options::bulk_write``
instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``ordered``
     - | If ``true``, the driver performs the write operations in the order
         provided. If an error occurs, the remaining operations are not
         attempted. 
       |
       | If ``false``, the driver performs the operations in an
         arbitrary order and attempts to perform all operations.
       | Defaults to ``true``.

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | Specifies whether the operation bypasses document-level validation. For more
         information, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | Specifies the write concern for the bulk operation. For more information, see
         :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment``
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`delete command
         fields </reference/command/delete/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let``
     - | Specifies a document with a list of values to improve operation readability. Values
         must be constant or closed expressions that don't reference document fields. For more
         information, see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/delete/#std-label-delete-let-syntax>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following example calls the ``create_bulk_write()`` method from the
:ref:`cpp-bulk-start-operation` example on this page, but sets the ``ordered`` field
of a ``mongocxx::options::bulk_write`` instance to ``false``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/bulk-write.cpp
   :start-after: start-bulk-write-unordered
   :end-before: end-bulk-write-unordered
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

If any of the write operations in an unordered bulk write fail, the {+driver-short+}
reports the errors only after attempting all operations.

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution. The order can
   differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.

.. _cpp-bulk-return-value:

Return Value
------------

The ``execute()`` method returns an instance of the ``mongocxx::result::bulk_write`` class.
The ``mongocxx::result::bulk_write`` class contains the following member functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
         
   * - ``deleted_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents deleted, if any.

   * - ``inserted_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``matched_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents matched for an update, if applicable.

   * - ``modified_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents modified, if any.

   * - ``upserted_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents upserted, if any.

   * - ``upserted_ids()``
     - | Returns a map of the operation's index to the ``_id`` of the upserted documents, if
         applicable.
