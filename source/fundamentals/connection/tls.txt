Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with the 
:wikipedia:`TLS/SSL <Transport_Layer_Security>`
security protocol using the underlying TLS/SSL support in the {+framework+}. To
configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable the TLS/SSL settings in either
the :ref:`connection string <csharp-connection-uri>` or 
:ref:`MongoClientSettings <csharp-mongo-client-settings>`.

.. important:: TLS 1.2

   The {+driver-short+} supports only TLS 1.2 or higher.

.. _csharp-tls-enable:

Enable TLS
----------

By default, TLS is disabled when connecting to MongoDB instances. You can enable TLS
for the connection to your MongoDB instance in two different ways: using a property
on a ``MongoClientSettings`` object or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. note::

   If you connect by using the DNS seedlist protocol, the driver enables
   TLS/SSL by default. To disable it, set the ``tls`` or ``ssl`` parameter value to
   ``false`` in your connection string or ``MongoClientSettings`` instance.

   To learn more about connection behavior when you use a DNS seedlist,
   see the :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   section in the Server manual.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To enable TLS with a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, set the ``UseTls`` property
      to ``true``:

      .. code-block:: csharp

         var settings = new MongoClientSettings { UseTls = true };
         var client = new MongoClient(settings);

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable TLS with a connection string, assign the 
      parameter ``tls`` a value of ``true`` in the connection string passed to the
      ``MongoClient`` constructor:

      .. code-block:: csharp

         var mongoClient = new MongoClient("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>?tls=true");

Configure a Client Certificate
------------------------------

You can configure your X.509 certificate using ``MongoClientSettings``. The following
code sample creates a new X.509 certificate object using the certificate file named 
``client.p12``, which is protected by the password ``mySuperSecretPassword``. The code
then adds this certificate to the ``SslSettings.ClientCertificates`` array in 
``MongoClientSettings``.

.. code-block:: csharp

   var cert = new X509Certificate2("client.p12", "mySuperSecretPassword");

   var settings = new MongoClientSettings
   {
      SslSettings = new SslSettings
      {
         ClientCertificates = new[] { cert }
      },
      UseTls = true
   };

.. important:: 

   When loading a certificate with a password, the certificate object must contain a private 
   key. If it doesn't, your certificate will not be passed to the server.

Allow Insecure TLS
------------------

When TLS is enabled, the {+driver-short+} automatically verifies the certificate that
the server presents. When testing your code, you can disable certificate verification.
This is known as *insecure TLS.* 

When using insecure TLS, the only requirement is that the server present an X.509 
certificate. The driver will accept a certificate even if any of the following are true: 

- The hostname of the server and the subject name (or subject alternative name) 
  on the certificate don't match.
- The certificate is expired or not yet valid. 
- The certificate doesn't have a trusted root certificate in the chain. 
- The certificate purpose isn't valid for server identification.

You can allow insecure TLS in two different ways: using a property on a 
``MongoClientSettings`` object or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To allow insecure TLS with a ``MongoClientSettings`` 
      object, set the ``AllowInsecureTls`` property to ``true``:

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         var settings = new MongoClientSettings 
         { 
            UseTls = true,
            AllowInsecureTls = true 
         };
         var client = new MongoClient(settings);
      
   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To allow insecure TLS using a connection string, 
      assign the connection string parameter ``tlsInsecure`` a value of ``true``:

      .. code-block:: csharp

         var mongoClient = new MongoClient("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>?tls=true&tlsInsecure=true");
      
.. warning::

   Always set this option to ``false`` in production. For security reasons, it's 
   important that the server certificate is properly validated.

.. _tls_configure-certificates:

Check Certificate Revocation
----------------------------

When an X.509 certificate should no longer be trusted--for example, if its private key
has been compromised--the certificate authority will revoke the certificate. 

By default, the {+driver-short+} doesn't check whether a server's certificate has been
revoked before it connects. You can enable revocation checking using either 
``MongoClientSettings`` or the connection string.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To enable revocation checking using ``MongoClientSettings``, set 
      ``SslSettings.CheckCertificateRevocation`` to ``true``:

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         var settings = new MongoClientSettings
         {
            SslSettings = new SslSettings
            {
               CheckCertificateRevocation = true
            },
            UseTls = true
         };

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable revocation checking using a connection string, 
      assign the connection string parameter ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`` 
      a value of ``false``:

      .. code-block:: csharp

         var mongoClient = new MongoClient("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>?tls=true&tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck=false");

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} doesn't check revocation by default because this is the default
   behavior of the ``SslStream`` class in both the 
   `{+framework+} <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.authenticateasclient?view=netframework-{+framework-version+}#System_Net_Security_SslStream_AuthenticateAsClient_System_String_>`__ 
   and the `.NET standard. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.authenticateasclient?view=netstandard-{+standard-version+}#System_Net_Security_SslStream_AuthenticateAsClient_System_String_>`__

Revocation Checking by Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} supports the following revocation-checking mechanisms differently on 
Windows, macOS, and Linux:

- :wikipedia:`Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) <Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol>`,
  a common mechanism for checking revocation 
- :wikipedia:`OCSP stapling <OCSP_stapling>`, a mechanism in which the server 
  includes a time-stamped OCSP response to the client along with the certificate
- :wikipedia:`Certificate revocation lists (CRLs), <Certificate_revocation_list>`,
  an alternative to OCSP

Windows
```````

On Windows, the {+driver-short+} supports OCSP, OCSP stapling, and CRLs without OCSP,
in both the .NET Framework and .NET Core. 

.. warning:: 
   
   On Windows, the {+driver-short+} will report a "hard fail" and cancel the TLS 
   handshake if the OCSP responder is unavailable. Other operating systems and drivers 
   will report a "soft fail" and continue connecting.

macOS
`````

On macOS, the {+driver-short+} supports OCSP and OCSP stapling. 

Beginning with .NET Core 2.0, the driver does **not** support CRLs without OCSP.

Linux
`````

On Linux, the {+driver-short+} supports OCSP, OCSP stapling, and CRLs without OCSP.
