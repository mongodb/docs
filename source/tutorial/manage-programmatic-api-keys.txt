To grant programmatic access to an organization or project using only
the :doc:`API </reference/api>`, you can create an |api| key. |api|
keys:

- Have two parts: a Public Key and a Private Key. These serve the same
  function as a username and Personal |api| Key when making |api|
  requests to |mms|.

- Cannot be used to log into |mms| through the user interface.

- Must be granted roles as you would Users to make sure the |api| keys
  can call |api| endpoints without errors.

- Can belong to one organization, but may be granted access to
  any number of projects in that organization.
