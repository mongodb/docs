Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+provider-long+}.

You can add the {+provider-short+} to your {+language-dotnet+} application as an
object-relational mapper (ORM) to work with data in MongoDB. You can use the
provider to access and manipulate data from your application without explicitly
running database commands. The {+provider-short+} tracks any queries or data
changes you make, and automatically runs them on the database by using the
MongoDB Query API.

Use the {+provider-short+} if you want to build a {+language-dotnet+} application
that uses {+framework-core+} with MongoDB.

Download the provider by using `NuGet <https://www.nuget.org/packages/{+package+}>`__,
or set up a runnable project by following our :ref:`Quick Start guide
<entity-framework-quickstart>`.
