This tutorial describes how to add a collection that configures words as synonyms,
create an index that defines synonym mappings on the  ``sample_mflix.movies``
collection, and run |fts| queries against the ``title`` field using words
that are configured as synonyms.
  
The tutorial takes you through the following steps: 

1. Load one or more sample synonyms source collections in the 
   ``sample_mflix`` database.
#. Create an |fts| index with one or more synonym mappings for the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
#. Run |fts| queries against the ``title`` field in the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for words configured as synonyms 
   in the synonyms source collection.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| cluster meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`. 

.. note:: 

   To create multiple synonym mappings and run the advanced sample 
   query in this tutorial, you will need an ``M10`` or higher {+cluster+}.

Load the Sample Synonyms Source Collection 
------------------------------------------

Each document in the synonyms source collection describe how one or more
words map to one or more synonyms of those words. To learn more about the
fields and word mapping types in the synonyms source collection documents,
see :ref:`synonyms-coll-format`. 

To begin, you create the synonyms source collection and then add the
collection to the database where you intend to use the synonyms source
collection. In this section, you create one or two sample synonyms source
collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database, and then use the synonyms
source collections with an index of the ``movies`` collection in the same
database.

Create the |fts| Index With Synonym Mapping Definition 
------------------------------------------------------

The synonym mapping in a collection's :ref:`index <synonyms-ref>` 
specifies the synonyms source collection and the analyzer to use 
with the collection. 

In this section, you create an |fts| index that defines one or many synonym
mappings for the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The mapping definition
in the index references the synonyms source collection that you created
in the ``sample_mflix`` database. 

.. |search-type| replace:: :guilabel:`Atlas Search`
.. |index-name| replace:: ``synonyms-tutorial``
.. |database-name| replace:: ``sample_mflix`` database
.. |collection-name| replace:: ``movies`` collection
   
.. include:: /includes/steps-fts-synonyms-tutorial-create-index.rst

Synonyms can be used only in queries that use the :ref:`text-ref` 
operator. In this section, you connect to your |service| cluster and then
run the sample queries using the ``text`` operator against the ``title``
field in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The sample queries use
words that are configured as synonyms of different mapping types in the
synonyms source collection. The source collection is referenced in the
synonyms mapping that the queries use.
