A :manual:`sharded cluster </sharding>` is the set of nodes 
comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment. To view the metrics for a 
specific |service| cluster in a :ref:`project <projects>`, click the 
:guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for that cluster. Alternatively, click on 
the name of the cluster to open the cluster overview, then click the 
:guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

The :guilabel:`Metrics` tab for sharded clusters provides a side-by-side
comparision of shards in one view. The :guilabel:`Display` drop-down 
contains many available metrics.

The :guilabel:`Metrics` view has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls
--------------
 
|service| provides the following controls for the 
:guilabel:`Metric` view:
 
.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1
 
   * - Control
     - Function
   
   * - :guilabel:`Granularity`

     - Modifies the granularity of metrics displayed for each chart.
       Select a granularity, usually between 1 minute and 1 day (24 
       hours). Select ``Auto`` to automatically adjust the granularity 
       based on the selected :guilabel:`Zoom` or 
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date controls.
             
       ``Auto`` granularity selects the highest fidelity
       granularity available within the selected time range and sharded
       cluster metric rendering limits.
                                    
       In the Sharded Cluster metrics view, |service| renders a 
       maximum of:
               
       - 100,000 total data points and
       - 3,000 data points for a single series.
               
       As a result, when rendering metrics for large deployments 
       over a long period of time, |service| may display metrics at 
       a lower granularity than expected. To learn more about the 
       granularity at which |service| stores metric data, see
       :ref:`monitoring-storage-granularity`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-10-second-granularity.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Zoom`
     - Modifies the date range of metrics displayed for each chart. 
       Select a zoom range between 1 hour and 5 years. Adjusting
       the :guilabel:`Zoom` automatically adjusts the
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date range. 
           
   * - :guilabel:`Current Display`
     - Modifies the start and end date-time range of metrics displayed 
       for each chart. Modifying the start and end date sets the 
       value of :guilabel:`Zoom` to ``custom`` and overrides the
       previously selected zoom level.

   * - :guilabel:`Display`
     - Selects which metric to chart. You can display no more than
       one chart at a time.

   * - :guilabel:`Collection`

     - Filters by the selected namespace. This drop-down appears only 
       for sharded cluster metrics on the collection-level such as 
       :guilabel:`chunks`, :guilabel:`shard data size`, and 
       :guilabel:`shard document size`. This drop-down contains all 
       the namespaces that existed in the selected time period. You can 
       explore historical metrics for namespaces that have been 
       deleted, but that existed in the selected time period.

   * - :guilabel:`Display Data`
     - Directs |service| to display data based on the selected option
             
       - ``Individually`` - displays the selected metrics for each 
         shard as an individual line.
             
       - ``Sum`` - displays the sum of the selected metrics 
         across all shards in the cluster.
             
       - ``Averaged`` - displays the average of the selected metrics 
         across all shards in the cluster.

   * - :guilabel:`View`
     - Selects which sharded cluster components to display
              
       - ``SHARDS`` - displays metrics for each shard in the sharded 
         cluster.
              
       - ``MONGOS`` - displays metrics for each :binary:`bin.mongos` in 
         the sharded cluster.
              
       - ``CONFIGS`` - displays metrics for the config server in the 
         sharded cluster config server replica set.

Chart Display
-------------

When viewing charts, you can do the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Task

     - Action

   * - Zoom in on a period of time.
     - Click and drag the mouse pointer over a portion of the chart.
       To reset to the originally selected range (zoom out), double-click the chart.
                          
       When you zoom in on one period of time, the
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date range in the chart control
       section automatically updates to reflect the selected period.

   * - View statistics at a particular time.
     - Hover the mouse pointer over a point on the chart.

Data Sources
------------

|service| displays each data source that contributes to the 
metric chart in a table below the chart. The table consists of 
the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Shard Name`
     - When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``, displays the name
       of each shard in the sharded cluster.
             
       When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``MONGOS`` or ``CONFIGS``,
       displays the name of each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` or
       config server :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process in the
       cluster.

       Click on a listed component to open the
       :guilabel:`Metrics` view for that component.

   * - :guilabel:`Alerts`
     - Indicates if there are any open alerts for the listed 
       shard or process. Click on the alert icon to open the
       :guilabel:`Alerts` view for that shard or process. For
       more information on responding to open alerts, see
       :doc:`/alert-resolutions`.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Size`
     - Only visible if :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``.

       Indicates the logical size of all documents and indexes 
       on the shard.

   * - :guilabel:`Show`
     - Only visible if :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``

       Indicates which replica set members to show on the selected
       chart. Select ``Primaries``, ``Secondaries`` or ``All``. 

   * - :guilabel:`Read`, :guilabel:`Write`, and :guilabel:`Queued`
     - Metric data related to the displayed chart. Hover over
       the corresponding column for a pop up with detailed
       information on the metrics shown.
