Filter Documents in the Visualization
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To display a subset of results in your data that match a given
criteria, use the :guilabel:`Filters` input bar above the chart
display. The filters used here employ the same syntax used in the
:manual:`db.collection.find() </tutorial/query-documents/>`
command. After entering a filter document, click :guilabel:`Apply` to
see the filter reflected in your visualization.

.. note::

   Filters on large collections may have performance issues if there
   are not appropriate :manual:`indexes <indexes>` on the collection.

Example
-------

The following chart shows the average runtime of movies by genre.
The filter of ``{runtime: {$gte: 120 }}`` means that we are only
taking into account movies which have a runtime greater than or
equal to 120 minutes.
