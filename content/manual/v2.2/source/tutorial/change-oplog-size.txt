The :term:`oplog` exists internally as a :term:`capped collection`, so
you cannot modify its size in the course of normal operations. In most
cases the :ref:`default oplog size <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` is an
acceptable size; however, in some situations you may need a larger or
smaller oplog. For example, you might need to change the oplog size
if your applications perform large numbers of multi-updates or
deletes in short periods of time.

This tutorial describes how to resize the oplog. For a detailed
explanation of oplog sizing, see the :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`
topic in the :doc:`/core/replication` document. For details on the how
oplog size affects :term:`delayed members <delayed member>` and affects
:term:`replication lag`, see the :ref:`replica-set-delayed-members`
topic and the :ref:`replica-set-replication-lag` topic in
:doc:`/administration/replica-sets`.

Overview
--------

The following is an overview of the procedure for changing the size of
the oplog:

.. include:: /includes/procedure-change-oplog-size.rst

Procedure
---------

The examples in this procedure use the following configuration:

- The active :term:`replica set` is ``rs0``.

- The replica set is running on port ``27017``.

- The replica set is running with a :setting:`data directory <dbpath>`
  of ``/srv/mongodb``.

To change the size of the oplog for a replica set, use the following
procedure for every member of the set that may become primary.

1. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and restart it in
   "standalone" mode running on a different port.

   .. note::

      Shutting down the :term:`primary` member of the set will trigger
      a failover situation and another member in the replica set will
      become primary. In most cases, it is least disruptive to modify
      the oplogs of all the secondaries before modifying the primary.

   To shut down the current primary instance, use a command that
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb --shutdown

   To restart the instance on a different port and in "standalone"
   mode (i.e. without :setting:`replSet` or
   :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`), use a command that
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --port 37017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb

#. Backup the existing oplog on the standalone instance. Use the
   following sequence of commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongodump --db local --collection 'oplog.rs' --port 37017

   .. note::

      You can restore the backup using the :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
      utility.

   Connect to the instance using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --port 37017

#. Save the last entry from the old (current) oplog.

   a. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, enter the following command to use the
      ``local`` database to interact with the oplog:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use local

   #. Ensure that the temporary collection ``temp`` is empty by
      dropping the collection:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.temp.drop()

   #. Use the :method:`db.collection.save()` operation to save the last
      entry in the oplog to a temporary collection:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.temp.save( db.oplog.rs.find( { }, { ts: 1, h: 1 } ).sort( {$natural : -1} ).limit(1).next() )

      You can see this oplog entry in the ``temp`` collection by issuing
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.temp.find()

#. Drop the old ``oplog.rs`` collection in the ``local`` database. Use
   the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.oplog.rs.drop()

   This will return ``true`` on the shell.

#. Use the :dbcommand:`create` command to create a new oplog of a
   different size. Specify the ``size`` argument in bytes. A value of
   ``2147483648`` will create a new oplog that's 2 gigabytes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { create : "oplog.rs", capped : true, size : 2147483648 } )

   Upon success, this command returns the following status:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "ok" : 1 }

#. Insert the previously saved last entry from the old oplog into the
   new oplog:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.oplog.rs.save( db.temp.findOne() )

   To confirm the entry is in the new oplog, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.oplog.rs.find()

#. Restart the server as a member of the replica set on its usual
   port:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb --shutdown
      mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /srv/mongodb

   The replica member will recover and "catch up" and then will be
   eligible for election to :term:`primary`. To step down the
   "temporary" primary that took over when you initially shut down the
   server, use the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method. This will force an
   election for primary. If the server's :ref:`priority
   <replica-set-node-priority>` is higher than all other members in the
   set *and* if it has successfully "caught up," then it will likely
   become primary.

#. Repeat this procedure for all other members of the replica set that
   are or could become primary.
