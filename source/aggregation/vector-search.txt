Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform searches on your documents
by using the Atlas Vector Search feature. The {+library-short+} allows you to
perform Atlas Vector Search queries by using the :ref:`Aggregation Builder API
<TODO DOCSP-43919>`.

.. note:: Deployment Compatibility

     You can use the Atlas Search feature only when
     you connect to MongoDB Atlas clusters. This feature is not
     available for self-managed deployments.

To learn more about Atlas Vector Search, see the :atlas:`Atlas Vector
Search Overview </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`. The
Atlas Vector Search implementation for the {+library-short+} internally
uses the ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation operator to perform queries. To
learn more about this operator, see the :atlas:`$vectorSearch
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#syntax>` reference in the
Atlas documentation.

.. note:: Atlas Search

   To perform advanced full-text search on your documents, you can use the
   Atlas Search API. To learn about this feature, see the
   :ref:`php-atlas-search` guide.

Atlas Vector Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can perform Atlas Vector Search queries, you must create an
Atlas Vector Search index on your collection. To learn more about
creating this index type, see the :ref:`php-atlas-search-index` guide.

Vector Search Aggregation Stage
-------------------------------

Import the following classes into your application to perform Atlas
Search queries by using the Aggregation Builder:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/vector-search.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-imports
   :end-before: end-imports

To create a ``$vectorSearch`` stage in your aggregation pipeline, perform the
following actions:

1. Create an array to store the pipeline stages

#. Call the ``Stage::vectorSearch()`` method to create the Atlas Vector
   Search stage

#. Within the body of the ``vectorSearch()`` method, specify the
   criteria for your vector query

The following code demonstrates the template for constructing basic Atlas Search
queries:

.. code-block:: php

   $pipeline = [
       Stage::vectorSearch(
           /* Atlas Vector Search query specifications
           index: '<index name>',
           path: '<path to embeddings>', ...*/
       ),
   ];

You must pass the following parameters to the ``vectorSearch()`` method:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``index``
     - ``string``
     - Name of the vector search index

   * - ``path``
     - ``array`` or ``string``
     - Field that stores vector embeddings

   * - ``queryVector``
     - ``array``
     - Vector representation of your query

   * - ``limit``
     - ``int``
     - Number of results to return

Atlas Search Query Examples
---------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to perform Atlas Vector
Search queries by using the Aggregation Builder. The examples in this
section use sample data from the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
collection.

.. note:: Query Vector Length
    
   For demonstrative purposes, the examples in this section use
   sample query vectors that contain very few elements, compared to 
   the query vector you might use in a runnable application. To view an
   example that contains the full-length query vector, see the
   :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search Quick Start </atlas-vector-search/tutorials/vector-search-quick-start/>`
   and select :guilabel:`PHP` from the :guilabel:`Select your language` dropdown in the upper-right
   corner of the page.

Basic Vector Search Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code performs an Atlas Vector Search query on the
``plot_embedding`` vector field:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/vector-search.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-basic-query
      :end-before: end-basic-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {"title":"Thrill Seekers"}
      {"title":"About Time"}
      {"title":"Timecop"}
      // Results truncated

Vector Search Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code performs the same query as in the preceding example,
but outputs only the ``title`` field and ``vectorSearchScore`` meta
field, which describes how well the document matches the query vector:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/vector-search.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-score-query
      :end-before: end-score-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {"title":"Thrill Seekers","score":0.927734375}
      {"title":"About Time","score":0.925750732421875}
      {"title":"Timecop","score":0.9241180419921875}
      // Results truncated

Vector Search Options
---------------------

You can use the ``vectorSearch()`` method to perform many types of Atlas
Vector Search queries. Depending on your desired query, you can pass the
following optional parameters to ``vectorSearch()``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``exact``
     - ``bool``
     - Specifies whether to run an Exact Nearest Neighbor (``true``) or
       Approximate Nearest Neighbor (``false``) search
     - ``false``

   * - ``filter``
     - ``QueryInterface`` or ``array``
     - Specifies a pre-filter for documents to search on
     - no filtering

   * - ``numCandidates``
     - ``int`` or ``null``
     - Specifies the number of nearest neighbors to use during the
       search
     - ``null``

To learn more about these parameters, see the :atlas:`Fields
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#fields>` section of the
``$vectorSearch`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.
