  The :binary:`~bin.mongo` client-side field level encryption methods
  require a database connection with client-side field level encryption
  enabled. If the current database connection was not initiated with
  client-side field level encryption enabled, either:
    
  - Use the :method:`Mongo()` constructor from the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
    shell to establish a connection with the required client-side field
    level encryption options. The :method:`Mongo()` method supports both
    Amazon Web Services and Local Key Management Service (KMS) providers
    for Customer Master Key (CMK) management.

    *or*

  - Use the ``mongo`` shell :ref:`command line options
    <mongo-client-side-field-level-encryption-options>` to establish a
    connection with the required options. The command line options only
    support the AWS KMS provider for CMK management.

ref: csfle-keyvault-unique-index
content: |

  The :method:`getKeyVault()` method automatically creates a
  :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`  on the ``keyAltNames`` field
  with a :ref:`partial index <index-type-partial>` filter for only
  documents where ``keyAltNames`` exists. :method:`getKeyVault()`
  creates this index in the key vault collection. This prevents any two
  data encryption keys in the same key vault from having the same key
  alternative name and therefore avoids ambiguity around which data
  encryption key is appropriate for encryption/decryption.

  .. warning::

     Do not drop the unique index created by :method:`getKeyVault()`.
     Client-side field level encryption operations depend on
     server-enforced uniqueness of ``keyAltNames``. Removing the index
     may lead to unexpected or unpredictable behavior.

  To mitigate the risk of the AWS Access Key or AWS Secret Key leaking
  into logs, consider specifying an environment variable containing the
  required values as part of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` startup. For
  example, the following operation loads the ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and
  ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` environment variables into local variables
  in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongo --eval "
         var AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = '$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
         var AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
       " \
       --shell
       --nodb

  Use the created ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` 
  variables in the shell to reference the AWS credentials.

  Configuring client-side field level encryption for a locally
  managed key requires specifying a base64-encoded 96-byte
  string with no line breaks. The following operation generates
  a key that meets the stated requirements and loads it into
  the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :emphasize-lines: 1

     TEST_LOCAL_KEY=$(echo "$(head -c 96 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -d '\n')")
     
     mongo --nodb --shell --eval "var TEST_LOCAL_KEY='$TEST_LOCAL_KEY'"

  Create the client-side field level encryption object using the
  generated local key string:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :emphasize-lines: 5

     var ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions = {
       "keyVaultNamespace" : "encryption.__dataKeys",
       "kmsProviders" : {
         "local" : {
           "key" : BinData(0, TEST_LOCAL_KEY)
         }
       }
     }

  Use the :binary:`Mongo()` constructor to create a database connection
  with the client-side field level encryption options. Replace the
  ``mongodb://myMongo.example.net`` URI with the :ref:`connection string
  URI <mongodb-uri>` of the target cluster.

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :emphasize-lines: 2
       
     encryptedClient = Mongo( 
       "mongodb://myMongo.example.net:27017/?replSetName=myMongo", 
       ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions
     )

  .. note:: Enterprise Feature

     The automatic feature of field level encryption is only available
     in MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise and MongoDB Atlas 4.2 clusters.

  .. important::
     
     For AWS KMS support, use the 4.2.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. The
     4.2.0 and 4.2.1 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not support the AWS
     KMS service due to an unexpected change in the KMS response object.
     See :issue:`SERVER-44721` for more information on the issue.
