For indexing, |fts| counts each document as a single index object when
it isn't nested inside another document. For embedded documents, |fts|
counts each embedded document as additional index objects depending on
the number of levels of nesting. |fts| stops replicating changes for
indexes larger than 2,100,000,000 index objects. 

If you deployed |fts| on separate search nodes, you can increase the
number of |fts| index objects by partitioning your index. By
default, |fts| supports one partition per shard. Each partition supports
up to 2 billion index objects. You can create an index with up to four
(``4``) partitions by using the ``numPartitions`` option. These
partitions represent a single index with support for up to 8B documents
per cluster or shard. 

When you configure partitions for your index, |fts| automatically
distributes the index objects between the partitions in an optimal way.
When you run queries against a collection with index partitions, |fts|
scatters the queries to all the partitions and gathers the search
results and metadata to sort, merge, and return the results. 

We recommend partitioning your index when:

- Your index objects reach 50% of the total limit.
- The number of documents in your collection reaches two billion.
- Your index will contain up to eight billion documents.
- Your index is in the ``STALE`` state because |fts| stopped
  replication. 

.. note::

   MongoDB proactively monitors document counts across all search 
   indexes. When a search index nears the upper limit of index objects,
   MongoDB might adjust the number of index partitions to avoid
   exceeding this limit. This prevents interruption of steady-state
   replication, which would result in stale data, but might increase
   query latency. 

When you configure partitions or modify the number of partitions,
|fts| triggers a rebuild of your index.

If you have more than one partition in your {+cluster+}, you can't
remove all the search nodes and migrate to a deployment model where both
the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes run on the same node.

Syntax 
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: true
   :linenos: 

   { 
     "numPartitions": <integer>
   }

Supported Values 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |fts| ``numPartitions`` option takes the following values: 

- ``1`` - to create a single index, with no additional partitions. This
  is the default value.
- ``2`` - to create up to two partitions for up to four billion documents. 
- ``4`` - to create up to four partitions for up to eight billion documents. 

Example 
~~~~~~~

The following index example uses the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
to demonstrate how to configure up to ``4`` partitions for the data in
the collection. You can use the Visual Editor or the |json| Editor in
the {+atlas-ui+} and :ref:`other supported clients
<fts-manage-indexes>` to create the index.
