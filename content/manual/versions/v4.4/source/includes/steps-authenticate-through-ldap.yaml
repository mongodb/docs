title: Authenticate the user in the ``mongo`` shell.
stepnum: 1

  To perform the authentication in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the
  :method:`db.auth()` method in the ``$external`` database.
action:
  pre: |
    For the :method:`db.auth()` method,
    specify the value ``"PLAIN"`` in the ``mechanism`` field, the user and
    password in the ``user`` and ``pwd`` fields respectively, and the
    value ``false`` in the ``digestPassword`` field. You **must** specify
    ``false`` for ``digestPassword`` since the server must receive an
    undigested password to forward on to ``saslauthd``, as in the
    following example:

    .. tip::

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.getSiblingDB("$external").auth(
       {
         mechanism: "PLAIN",
         user: <username>,
         pwd: passwordPrompt(),  // or cleartext password
         digestPassword: false
       }
    )
post:
  Enter the password when prompted.

  The server forwards the password in plain text. In general, use only on
  a trusted channel (VPN, TLS/SSL, trusted wired network).
