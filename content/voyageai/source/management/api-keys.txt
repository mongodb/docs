Model API keys serve as the authentication and authorization
mechanism for the {+voyage-api+} and enable you to
access {+voyageai+} models through the API. This page describes 
how to create and manage your API keys in the {+atlas-ui+}.

Create and Manage Model API Keys
--------------------------------

.. |navoption| replace:: :guilabel:`Model API Keys`

You can create and manage {+model-api-keys+} from the

project the key is linked to. Rate limits apply to each key
in the project.
