Definition

.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Flushes all pending writes from the storage layer to disk and locks the
   server to prevent any additional writes until the lock is released.

      :method:`db.fsyncUnlock` methods

   :method:`db.fsyncLock()`  has the syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncLock()

   The operation returns a document with the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - ``info``
        - Information on the status of the operation.
      * - ``lockCount``
        - Number of locks currently on the instance.
      * - ``seeAlso``
        - Link to the :dbcommand:`fsync` command documentation.
      * - ``ok``
        - The status code.

   :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an administrative command. Use this method to
   lock a server or cluster before :ref:`backup operations <backup-methods>`.

Behavior
--------

Fsync Locks after Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fsync locks execute on the primary in a replica set or sharded cluster.


If the primary goes down or becomes unreachable due to network issues, the
cluster :ref:`elects <replica-set-elections>` a new primary from the available
secondaries. If a primary with an fsync lock goes down, the new primary does
**not** retain the fsync lock and can handle write operations. When elections
occur during backup operations, the resulting backup may be inconsistent or
unusable.

To recover from the primary going down:


#. Run the :method:`db.fsyncUnlock` method until the lock count reaches zero
   to release the lock on all nodes.

#. Issue the :method:`db.fsyncLock` command to reestablish the fsync lock on the
   cluster.

#. Restart the backup.


Additionally, fsync locks are persistent. When the old primary comes online
again, you need to run the :method:`db.fsyncUnlock` command to release the
lock on the node.


Example
-------

The following operation runs :method:`db.fsyncLock()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fsyncLock()

The operation returns the following status document that includes the
``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(1),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

If you run :method:`db.fsyncLock()` again, the operation increments the
``lockCount``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "info" : "now locked against writes, use db.fsyncUnlock() to unlock",
      "lockCount" : NumberLong(2),
      "seeAlso" : "http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/fsynccommand",
      "ok" : 1
   }

To unlock the instance for writes, you must run
:method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` twice to reduce the ``lockCount`` to 0.
