Overview
--------

If you use :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`
but can't use general :atlas:`Atlas Live Migration </migration-live-atlas-managed/>` 
due to network restrictions, you can migrate your MongoDB deployments to 
|service-short| via |cloud-short|. To live migrate data from your MongoDB 
deployments to clusters in |service-short| using |cloud-short|:

1. Add your deployments to |cloud-short|.
#. Add credentials for Monitoring.
#. Follow the live migration process to |service-short|.

For detailed steps, see :ref:`cc-to-atlas-procedure`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the live migration process from MongoDB Community 
to |service-short|, you must:

- Have an existing deployment in 
  :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`.

- :doc:`Start a free trial of Cloud Manager </tutorial/getting-started>`.

Considerations
--------------

When you add your MongoDB Community deployment to |cloud-short|,
you need to add credentials for Monitoring only, not for Automation 
or Backup. Adding your deployment for Monitoring imports your 
deployment's metadata into |cloud-short| to help with the Live 
Migration process. It doesn't import your deployment's actual data.

To learn more about authentication credentials, see
:ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

Procedure
---------
