ref: collation-description
content: |
   :ref:`Collation <collation>` allows users to specify
   language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for
   lettercase and accent marks.

---
ref: collation-collection-level
content: |
   If you specify a collation at the collection level:

   - Indexes on that collection will be created with that collation unless
     the index creation operation explicitly specify a different collation.

   - Operations on that collection use the collection's default
     collation unless they explicitly specify a different collation.

     .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-single-per-operation.rst
---
ref: collation-unspecified
content: |
   If no collation is specified for the collection or for the
   operations, MongoDB uses the simple binary comparison used in prior
   versions for string comparisons.
---
ref: collation-single-per-operation
content: |

   You cannot specify multiple collations for an operation. For
   example, you cannot specify different collations per field, or if
   performing a find with a sort, you cannot use one collation for the
   find and another for the sort.

---
ref: collation-option-specification
content: |

   The collation option has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

      collation: {
         locale: <string>,
         caseLevel: <boolean>,
         caseFirst: <string>,
         strength: <int>,
         numericOrdering: <boolean>,
         alternate: <string>,
         maxVariable: <string>,
         backwards: <boolean>
      }

   When specifying collation, the ``locale`` field is mandatory; all
   other collation fields are optional. For descriptions of the fields,
   see :ref:`collation-document-fields`.
---
ref: collation-document
content: |
   .. code-block:: none

      {
         locale: <string>,
         caseLevel: <boolean>,
         caseFirst: <string>,
         strength: <int>,
         numericOrdering: <boolean>,
         alternate: <string>,
         maxVariable: <string>,
         backwards: <boolean>
      }

---
ref: collation-index-options
content: |
   You can create multiple indexes on the same key(s) with different 
   collations. To create indexes with the same key pattern but different
   collations, you must supply unique index names.
---
ref: collation-index-collection
content: |-
   If you have specified a collation at the collection level, then:

   - If you do not specify a collation when creating the index, MongoDB
     creates the index with the collection's default collation.

   - If you do specify a collation when creating the index, MongoDB
     creates the index with the specified collation.
---
ref: collation-index-tip
content: |-

   .. tip::

      By specifying a collation ``strength`` of ``1`` or ``2``, you can
      create a case-insensitive index. Index with a collation ``strength``
      of ``1`` is both diacritic- and case-insensitive.
---
ref: collation-index-use
content: |-
   To use an index for string comparisons, an operation must also
   specify the same collation. That is, an index with a collation
   cannot support an operation that performs string comparisons on the
   indexed fields if the operation specifies a different collation.

   .. warning::

      Because indexes that are configured with collation use ICU
      collation keys to achieve sort order, collation-aware index keys
      may be larger than index keys for indexes without collation. 

   For example, the collection ``myColl`` has an index on a string
   field ``category`` with the collation locale ``"fr"``.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.createIndex( { category: 1 }, { collation: { locale: "fr" } } )

   The following query operation, which specifies the same collation as
   the index, can use the index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.find( { category: "cafe" } ).collation( { locale: "fr" } )

   However, the following query operation, which by default uses the
   "simple" binary collator, cannot use the index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.find( { category: "cafe" } )

   For a compound index where the index prefix keys are not strings,
   arrays, and embedded documents, an operation that specifies a
   different collation can still use the index to support comparisons
   on the index prefix keys.

   For example, the collection ``myColl`` has a compound index on the
   numeric fields ``score`` and ``price`` and the string field
   ``category``; the index is created with the  collation locale
   ``"fr"`` for string comparisons:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.createIndex(
         { score: 1, price: 1, category: 1 },
         { collation: { locale: "fr" } } )

   The following operations, which use ``"simple"`` binary collation
   for string comparisons, can use the index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.find( { score: 5 } ).sort( { price: 1 } )
      db.myColl.find( { score: 5, price: { $gt: NumberDecimal( "10" ) } } ).sort( { price: 1 } )

   The following operation, which uses ``"simple"`` binary collation
   for string comparisons on the indexed ``category`` field, can use
   the index to fulfill only the ``score: 5`` portion of the query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.myColl.find( { score: 5, category: "cafe" } )

---
ref: collation-index-type-restrictions-addendum
content: |

   .. tip::

      To create a ``text`` or ``2d`` index on a collection that has a
      non-simple collation, you must explicitly specify ``{collation:
      {locale: "simple"} }`` when creating the index.

   If the collation is unspecified but the collection has a
   default collation (see :method:`db.createCollection()`), the
   operation uses the collation specified for the collection.
