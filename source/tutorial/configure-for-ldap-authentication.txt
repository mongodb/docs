Overview
--------

You can use a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service to
manage |mms| user authentication and authorization. Users log in
through |mms|, then |mms| searches the LDAP directory for the user and
synchronizes the user's name and email addresses in the |mms| user
records with the values in the LDAP user records.

To configure |mms| to use LDAP, go to: :guilabel:`Admin` >
:guilabel:`General` > :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config` > :guilabel:`User
Authentication`.

.. note::

   This tutorial describes authenticating users of the |mms| web
   interface.

   If your MongoDB deployments **also** use |ldap|, you must separately
   create MongoDB users for the {+mdbagent+}s, as described in
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap`.

This tutorial describes how to:

* Configure LDAP authentication for |mms|

* Map LDAP groups to both |mms| :ref:`organization-roles` and
  :ref:`project-roles`
  

User Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user attempts to log in, |mms| searches for a matching user and
the user's groups using an LDAP query.

- |mms| logs into LDAP as the ``search`` user, using the credentials
  specified in the :guilabel:`LDAP Bind Dn` and :guilabel:`LDAP Bind
  Password` fields.

- |mms| searches under the base distinguished name specified in
  the :guilabel:`LDAP User Base Dn` field and matches the user
  according to the LDAP attribute specified in the :guilabel:`LDAP User
  Search Attribute` field.

- |mms| searches under the base distinguished name specified in the
  :guilabel:`LDAP Group Base Dn` field and matches the user's groups
  according to the LDAP attribute specified in the :guilabel:`LDAP Group
  Member Attribute` field. If no value is provided for the :guilabel:`LDAP
  Group Base Dn`, |mms| uses the value of :guilabel:`LDAP User Base Dn`
  to search for LDAP group memberships.

- If a matching user is found, |mms| authenticates the supplied
  password against the LDAP password for the provided user.

Authorization/Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LDAP groups let you control access to |mms|. You associate LDAP groups
with organization and project |mms| roles and assign the LDAP groups
to the users who should have those roles.

LDAP entries map to |mms| records as follows: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - LDAP
     - |mms|

   * - User
     - User

   * - Group
     - Organization/Project Role

To use LDAP groups effectively, 
:doc:`create additional projects </tutorial/manage-projects>`
within |mms| to control access to specific deployments in your
organization, such as creating separate |mms| projects for development
and production environments. You can then map an LDAP group to a role
in the |mms| project to provide access to a deployment.

.. note::

   - Changes made to LDAP groups can take up to an hour to take effect 
     in |mms|. Changes take effect immediately for users in affected 
     groups when they log out and log back in to |mms|.

   - If an LDAP user does not belong to any LDAP group, |mms| does not
     assign any roles, organization or project, to the user.

   - If an LDAP user is assigned a project role but no organization role,
     |mms| automatically assigns the user the :ref:`Organization Member
     Role<organization-member-role>`.

If you have multiple departments with their own billing needs, alert settings,
and project members, create a new :doc:`organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>`
for each department.


.. _ldap-over-ssl:

LDAP Over SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use LDAP over an SSL connection (LDAPS), complete these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Needed Value

   * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL CA File`
     - The path to a PEM key file for a trusted certificate authority.

   * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL PEM Key File`
     - The path to a PEM key file containing a client certificate and
       private key.

   * - :guilabel:`LDAP SSL PEM Key File Password`
     - The password to decrypt it if the
       :guilabel:`LDAP SSL PEM Key File` is encrypted.

.. _ldap-new-vs-convert:

Prerequisites
-------------

The LDAP server must:

- Be installed, configured and accessible to |mms|.

- Embed each user's group memberships as an attribute of each user's
  LDAP Entry.

  .. important::

     Use the ``member`` LDAP user attribute if you want to include
     nested LDAP groups in |mms| group memberships. 

     .. example::
        LDAP user ``jsmith`` belongs to LDAP group ``B``. LDAP Group ``B`` belongs
        to LDAP group ``A``. Ops Manager recognizes ``jsmith`` as a member of groups
        ``A`` and ``B``.

- Include a user that can search the base |dn| that includes |mms| users
  and groups.

- Include a group for :authrole:`Global Owners <Global Owner>`.

  - You **must** enter this group into the :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role
    Owner` field when you :ref:`configure LDAP <config-ldap-auth>` in
    |mms|.

    .. example:: 
       If LDAP has an ``admin`` group for use by |mms| administrators,
       enter ``admin`` in the :guilabel:`LDAP Global Role Owner` field.

  - After you enable LDAP authentication, you **must** first log in to
    |mms| as a user who belongs to this group to create the initial
    |mms| project (if applicable) and map LDAP groups to
    project and organization roles.

    .. important:: 

       Once |mms| is converted to LDAP Authentication, only the user with
       the Global Owner role who changes the authentication method remains
       logged in. All other users are logged out and need to log
       back in to |mms| using their LDAP username and password. Users
       without an LDAP username and password can no longer log in to |mms|.

.. _config-ldap-auth:

Procedure
---------

To configure LDAP authentication:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-ldap-authentication.rst

Troubleshooting
---------------

|mms| enables endpoint detection by default in the |jdk|. You must use
trusted server certificates for your |mms| hosts.

If you can't use trusted certificates:

1. Disable endpoint identification. Add the
   ``-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.object.disableEndpointIdentification=true`` to
   the ``JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS`` property in the ``mms.conf``.
2. Restart all |mms| services after this change.

.. warning::

   Disabling this functionality impacts |mms| security. You should
   configure a valid and trusted certificate instead.
