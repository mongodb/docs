   Specifies the default :ref:`collation <collation>` for the view.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst

   If the underlying ``source`` is a collection, the view does not
   inherit the collection's collation settings. 

   If no collation is specified, the view's default collation is the
   "simple" binary comparison collator.

   If the underlying ``source`` is another view, the view must specify
   the same collation settings.
