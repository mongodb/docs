   :class: note

   This feature is not available for:

   - ``M0`` (Free Tier), ``M2``, and ``M5`` clusters. To learn more
     about which features are unavailable, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

   - Sharded clusters running MongoDB 4.2. These clusters must use
     :doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`.

|service| continuous backups take incremental backups of data in your
cluster, ensuring your backups are typically just a few seconds behind
the operational system. |service| continuous backups allow you to
:doc:`restore </restore-cluster>` from stored snapshots or from a
selected point in time within the last 24 hours. You can also
:doc:`query a continuous backup snapshot </query-backup>`.

For sharded clusters, the backup service temporarily stops the balancer
via the :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` in order to insert a marker token
into all shards and config servers in the cluster. |service| takes a
snapshot when the marker tokens appear in the backup data.

.. include:: /includes/fact-continuous-backup-collection-limit.rst

Enable Backup
-------------

You can enable continuous backups when you:

- :doc:`create a cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` or
- :doc:`modify an existing cluster </scale-cluster>`.

If you switch to continuous backups from cloud provider snapshots,
|service| immediately terminates existing backups on your behalf. If
you need to retain any of your cloud provider snapshots, download
them before switching backup methods. To learn how to
download a cloud provider snapshot, see the
:doc:`Restore a Cluster from a Cloud Provider Snapshot
</restore/restore-cluster-cloud-provider-snapshot>` page.

From the cluster configuration modal, toggle ``Do you want to enable
backup?`` to ``Yes``. For clusters deployed to
:ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>`, select the :guilabel:`Continuous`
card.

Enable Point-In-Time Restore for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharded clusters require enabling cluster checkpoints to support
point-in-time restoration from a continuous backup snapshot. Without
cluster checkpoints, |service| can only restore from a snapshot and not from
a point-in-time between snapshots. After enabling continuous backups on the
cluster, do the following to enable cluster checkpoints:

1. From the context menu, select the desired organization.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` section of the |service|
   UI by clicking :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` in the :guilabel:`Project`
   section of the left side navigation.

#. Click the ellipsis (``...``) next to your cluster's name and select
   :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule`.

#. Enable the checkbox marked :guilabel:`Create cluster checkpoint every:`
   and select an interval from the dropdown menu.

#. Click :guilabel:`Submit` to save your changes.

.. note:: 

   The :manual:`sharded cluster balancer </core/sharding-balancer-administration>`
   must pause whenever a cluster checkpoint is created.

.. _continuous-snapshot-storage-location:

Snapshot Storage Location
-------------------------

Each project has *one* backup data center location dictated by the
*first* backup-enabled cluster created in that project.

For single-region |service| clusters created after June 21st, 2017,
|service| stores backup data for an |service| cluster in a data center
specific to the cluster's geographic region.

For multi-region |service| clusters, |service| stores backup data for
the cluster in a data center specific to the geographical location of
the cluster's Preferred Region.

.. important::

   All additional backup-enabled clusters created in the project use
   the backup data center selected during deployment of the project's
   *first* backup-enabled cluster regardless of the geographical
   location of the cluster region or regions.

   To change the data center location of a cluster, you must disable
   backups for *all* clusters in the project. You can then enable
   backups for a cluster whose geographic region corresponds to the
   data center location of your choice.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Cluster Location

|service| retains these snapshots based on the :ref:`retention policy
<retention-policy>`.

Snapshot Schedule
-----------------

|service| has the following snapshot schedule, which determines the
frequency and the retention of the snapshots:

.. note::

   If you disable backup for a cluster or terminate a cluster,
   |service| immediately deletes the backup snapshots for the cluster.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 30 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Snapshot Schedule
     - Default Retention Policy
     - Maximum Retention Setting

   * - Base snapshot every <x> hours
     - 2 days
     - | 5 days
       | (30 days if snapshot taken every 24 hours)
   * - Daily snapshot
     - 7 days
     - 360 days
   * - Weekly snapshot
     - 4 weeks
     - 52 weeks
   * - Monthly snapshot
     - 13 months
     - 84 months

By default, |service| takes base snapshots every 6 hours.

To change a deployment's snapshot schedule, including the retention
policy, go to :guilabel:`Backup`. For the cluster whose snapshot
schedule you wish to modify, click the ellipsis and select
:guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule` menu option.

.. seealso:: To modify the schedule using the API, see
   :doc:`/reference/api/snapshot-schedule`.
