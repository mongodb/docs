.. _nlc-error-messages:

What should I do if the chart generated looks incorrect, or |charts-short| doesn't generate a chart from the prompt?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are improving :guilabel:`Natural Language` mode to reduce the
occurrence of incorrect responses. In the meantime, we provide a message
that helps you understand how to improve the response.

The following table lists the possible messages you can receive and the 
underlying cause of each.

   * - Message
     - Further Explanation

   * - Some chart types are currently not supported in the Natural
       Language mode. Grouped Bar chart has been selected. Switch to the
       Classic mode to change this.
     - We currently do not supoort the chart type you requested in the
       prompt. When you write a prompt, leave the chart type selection to
       |charts-short|, or specify another :ref:`supported chart type
       <nlc-supported-charts>`.

   * - Customization options are currently not supported in the Natural
       Language mode. Switch to the Classic mode to continue.
     - We currently do not support customization options in the
       :guilabel:`Customize` section of the :guilabel:`Classic` mode for
       chart generation.

   * - The prompt is not specific enough. Edit the prompt and try again.
     - There is not enough information in the prompt to generate a
       chart.

   * - Couldn't find 'field_name' in the data source. Edit the prompt
       and try again. 
     - You entered a field that doesn't exist in the data schema. To see
       the exisiting fields you can tag from the data source, press the
       ``@`` key when writing the prompt.

In the bottom-left corner of your generated chart, please give us
feedback to help improve the response.

<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__
hosted by Microsoft. This is subject to change in the future.

FAQ: Charts Navigation Improvements
-----------------------------------

We're currently rolling out a new and improved navigation 
experience. If the steps in the documentation don't match your view in 
the Charts UI, see :dochub:`the preview documentation 
<charts-nav-preview>`.

Why are we making this change?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We redesigned the navigation to provide a more composable and scalable 
structure so that our developer data platform can grow over time. We 
redesigned the navigation to improve the self-discovery of the wide 
array of services we offer and to provide clear navigation across 
services and resources. Ultimately, these changes set a foundation to 
support the growth of our products and services over time.

What's changing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We simplified the left sidebar navigation for |service|. We organized 
  the sidebar navigation into the following categories:

  - :guilabel:`Database`
  - :guilabel:`Data`
  - :guilabel:`Services`
  - :guilabel:`Security`

  These categories provide distinct yet flexible containers that 
  display the breadth of our platform services and a clear delineation 
  between the main tasks.

- We clarified the resource context. The top navigation persists and 
  indicates the current resource (organization, project, 
  collection, and so on). You can easily switch between resources to 
  improve workflow continuity.

- We unified utilities. A centralized utility hub in the top-right 
  corner of the UI provides quick and easy access to essential tools 
  like alerts, the activity feed, support, and user management. You can 
  also find links to MongoDB University, Documentation, and 
  Community Forums here.

- We removed the distinct product tabs. We now present all primary 
  services in the appropriate category beneath one consolidated sidebar 
  navigation, which makes these capabilities easier to find. We removed 
  the top navigation tabs for :guilabel:`Data Services` and 
  :guilabel:`Charts`. We changed the label for :guilabel:`Charts` to 
  :guilabel:`Visualizations`.

in an organization simultaneously) over a 6 to 8-week period starting 
the week of April 7, 2025.

When will I see the new navigation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might see the new navigation starting the week of April 7th. The 
rollout will take approximately 6 to 8 weeks, and we will email you 
during the rollout period.

Can I turn off the new navigation experience?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, you cannot toggle off the new navigation experience.

What will I see when I first log in?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will see a modal that announces the change. After you click 
:guilabel:`See what's new`, a short guided tour shows the key changes. 
You can dismiss the tour at any time.

Where can I learn more?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There will be a series of announcements across our social channels and 
blogs.

If I have multiple organizations, will they change at the same time?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, we cannot guarantee that organizations under the same account will 
receive the navigation changes simultaneously. 

Is the documentation updated to reflect these changes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation updates that align with the new navigation appear in the 
:dochub:`the preview documentation 
<charts-nav-review>`.

After the navigation is live to everyone, we will update all pages to 
reflect the new navigation.

What products are impacted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service|, :atlas:`Atlas for Government </government>`, |charts-short|, 
and Cloud Manager are impacted.
