.. note::

   While MongoDB Enterprise does support Kerberos authentication,
   Kerberos is not supported in HTTP status interface in any version of
   MongoDB.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   Neither the HTTP status interface nor the REST API support the
   :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>` challenge-response
   user authentication mechanism introduced in version 3.0.
