To remove a member of a :term:`replica set` use either of the
following procedures.

Remove a Member Using ``rs.remove()``
-------------------------------------

1. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for the member you wish to
   remove. To shut down the instance, connect using
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()`
   method.

#. Connect to the replica set's current :term:`primary`. To determine
   the current primary, use :method:`db.hello()` while connected to
   any member of the replica set.

#. Use :method:`rs.remove()` in either of the following forms to
   remove the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.remove("mongod3.example.net:27017")
      rs.remove("mongod3.example.net")

   MongoDB may disconnect the shell briefly if the replica set needs to elect a
   new primary. The shell then automatically reconnects in such cases. The
   shell may display a ``DBClientCursor::init call() failed`` error even
   though the command succeeds.

.. _remove-member-using-reconfig:

Remove a Member Using ``rs.reconfig()``
---------------------------------------

You can remove a member by reconfiguring the replica set 
using a :doc:`replica configuration
document </reference/replica-configuration>` where that member 
is removed from the :rsconf:`members` array.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :method:`rs.reconfig()` allows adding or
removing no more than ``1`` :rsconf:`voting <members[n].votes>` member
at a time. To remove multiple voting members from the replica set, issue
a series of :method:`rs.reconfig()` operations to remove one member
at a time. See :ref:`replSetReconfig-cmd-single-node` for more
information.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for the member you wish to
   remove. To shut down the instance, connect using
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()`
   method.

#. Connect to the replica set's current :term:`primary`. To determine
   the current primary, use :method:`db.hello()` while connected to
   any member of the replica set.

#. Issue the :method:`rs.conf()` method to view the current
   configuration document and determine the position in the
   ``members`` array of the member to remove:

   .. example::

      ``mongod_C.example.net`` is in position ``2`` of the
      following configuration file:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
             "_id" : "rs",
             "version" : 7,
             "members" : [
                 {
                     "_id" : 0,
                     "host" : "mongod_A.example.net:27017"
                 },
                 {
                     "_id" : 1,
                     "host" : "mongod_B.example.net:27017"
                 },
                 {
                     "_id" : 2,
                     "host" : "mongod_C.example.net:27017"
                 }
             ]
         }

#. Assign the current configuration document to the variable ``cfg``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()

#. Modify the ``cfg`` object to remove the member.

   .. example::

      To remove ``mongod_C.example.net:27017`` use the following
      JavaScript operation:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         cfg.members.splice(2,1)

#. Overwrite the replica set configuration document with the new
   configuration by issuing the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(cfg)

#. To confirm the new configuration, issue :method:`rs.conf()`.

   For the example above the output would be:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          "_id" : "rs",
          "version" : 8,
          "members" : [
              {
                  "_id" : 0,
                  "host" : "mongod_A.example.net:27017"
              },
              {
                  "_id" : 1,
                  "host" : "mongod_B.example.net:27017"
              }
          ]
      }
