|service| can faciliate a live migration where |com| pushes a source
sharded {+cluster+} to a sharded |service| {+cluster+}. |service| keeps
the target {+cluster+} in sync with the source {+cluster+} until you cut
your applications over to the target {+cluster+} in |service|.

Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure, stop writes
to the source {+cluster+}: stop your application instances, point them
to the |service| {+cluster+}, and restart them.

Restrictions
------------

.. include:: /includes/live-migration-from-com-restrictions.rst

- You can't use a :doc:`Global Cluster </global-clusters>` as the
  target for live migration.

To live migrate a replica set {+cluster+} from |com| to |service|, see
:doc:`/import/migrate-from-com-rs`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the live migration from |com| to |service|:

Live Migration Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow. For detailed steps,
see the :ref:`procedure for migrating a sharded cluster from
Ops Manager or Cloud Manager to Atlas <lm-com-procedure-sharded>`.

.. include:: /includes/live-migration-from-com-workflow.rst

.. _lm-com-upgrade-path-sharded:

Migration Path and Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/live-migration-from-com-platforms.rst

|service| live migration (push) supports the following migration paths:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/push-live-migration-upgrade-path-sharded.rst

.. note::

   For sharded {+clusters+}, the major MongoDB versions on the source and
   target {+clusters+} must be exactly the same. The major MongoDB version
   in the full **4.4.x** version is **4.4**.

.. include:: /includes/import/network-access-lm-from-com.rst

.. _lm-com-migration-validation-sharded:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the live migration procedure, |service| runs validation
checks on the source and target {+clusters+}.

- The source {+cluster+} is a sharded {+cluster+}.

- The target |service| {+cluster+} is a sharded {+cluster+} with the same
  number of :term:`shards <shard>` as the source sharded {+cluster+}.

- The target |service| {+cluster+} doesn't have |bic| enabled.

Index Key Limits

Database Users and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/import/security-lm-from-com.rst

Target {+Cluster+} Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure the target {+cluster+}, consider the following:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-perf-target-cluster.rst

- The target |service| {+cluster+} must be a sharded {+cluster+}.

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  {+cluster+} as the target for live migration.

- Do **not** change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Dropping Data in the Target {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your target sharded {+cluster+} contains existing data, the live
migration process detects this and warns you that it drops data and
collections from the target sharded {+cluster+} before live migrating
data into it.

Avoid Workloads on the Target {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongomirror-no-workloads-target-cluster.rst

Avoid Cloud Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-avoid-backups.rst

Avoid Namespace Changes

Migrating from MongoDB Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are :opsmgr:`migrating </tutorial/migrate-community-to-atlas>`
to |service| from MongoDB Community using |onprem|, you must accept
the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Migration Agreement
</reference/legal/live-migration-atlas-licensing>` as the first step
in the :ref:`live migration procedure <lm-com-procedure-sharded>`.

Migrate Your {+Cluster+}
------------------------

.. important::

   Avoid making changes to the source {+cluster+} configuration while the
   live migration procedure runs, such as removing sharded {+cluster+}
   members or modifying :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` runtime settings,
   such as ``featureCompatibilityVersion``.
