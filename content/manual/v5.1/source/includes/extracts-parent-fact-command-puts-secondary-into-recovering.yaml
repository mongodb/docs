  - On secondaries, the {{cmdName}} command forces the secondary to
    enter :replstate:`RECOVERING` state. Read operations issued to an
    instance in the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state will fail.  This
    prevents clients from reading during the operation. When the
    operation completes, the secondary returns
    to :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.

    See :doc:`/reference/replica-states/` for more information about
    replica set member states.

  See :doc:`/tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members` for an
  example replica set maintenance procedure to maximize availability
  during maintenance operations.
