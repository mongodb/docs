  To run the simple example query only, use the index definition in 
  the **Single Synonym Mapping** tab below. If you have an ``M10`` or 
  higher {+cluster+} and if you loaded both the example synonyms source 
  collections, you can run both the simple and advanced example queries 
  using the index definition that specifies multiple synonym mappings 
  in the **Multiple Synonym Mappings** tab below.

        The following index definition specifies: 

        - The :ref:`language analyzer <ref-language-analyzers>` 
          ``lucene.english`` as the default analyzer for both indexing 
          and querying the ``title`` field.
        - The name ``transportSynonyms`` as the name for this synonym 
          mapping.
        - The ``transport_synonyms`` collection as the source synonyms 
          collection to look for synonyms for queries using 
          ``transportSynonyms`` mapping. ``transportSynonyms`` can be 
          used in text queries over any field indexed with the 
          ``lucene.english`` analyzer (including the ``title`` field, 
          in this example).

        The following index definition specifies: 

        - The :ref:`language analyzer <ref-language-analyzers>` 
          ``lucene.standard`` as the default analyzer for both indexing 
          and querying the ``title`` field.
        - The name ``transportSynonyms`` and ``attireSynonyms`` as the 
          names for the synonym mappings.
        - The ``transport_synonyms`` collection as the source synonyms 
          collection to look for synonyms for queries using 
          ``transportSynonyms`` mapping. ``transportSynonyms`` can be 
          used in text queries over any field indexed with the 
          ``lucene.standard`` analyzer (including the ``title`` field, 
          in this sample query in this tutorial).
        - The ``attire_synonyms`` collection as the source synonyms 
          collection to look for synonyms for queries using 
          ``attireSynonyms`` mapping. ``attireSynonyms`` can be 
          used in text queries over any field indexed with the
