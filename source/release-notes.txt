|charts| SaaS v1.2.0
--------------------

*Released Apr 16, 2019*

Improvements in this release:

- Ability to :ref:`embed charts <embedding-charts>` in external
  applications.

- Warning now appears if |service| renders with incomplete data.

Bug fixes in this release:

- Fixed bad rendering in some
  :ref:`stacked area charts <line-area-chart-ref>`.

- Fixed some cases where :ref:`binned data <charts-bin-data>` could
  appear in the wrong order.

- Automatic :ref:`dashboard refresh <refresh-dashboard>` should work
  more reliably after resuming from sleep.

|charts| SaaS v1.1.1
--------------------

*Released Feb 14, 2019*

Improvements in this release:

- New Chart Types:

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Bar <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`

  - :ref:`100% Stacked Area <line-area-chart-ref>`

- New default :ref:`sort behavior <charts-sort-data>` in charts.

- New :ref:`filter bar <charts-filter-documents>` in the chart builder,
  with increased performance and usability.

Bug fixes in this release:

- Changes to :ref:`filter parsing <date-filter>` to better align with
  MongoDB Shell syntax and Javascript in general. Specifically, filters
  using ``Date()`` to represent the current date or
  ``Date("2019-01-01")`` to represent a specific date will need to be
  changed to ``new Date()`` or ``ISODate()`` and
  ``new Date("2019-01-01")`` or ``ISODate("2019-01-01")``, since the
  Date() function now correctly  returns the date as a string
  representation.

- Fixed rendering issues in certain browser versions relating to the
  :ref:`continuous color picker <color-customization>`.

- Miscellaneous performance, reliability and security improvements.
