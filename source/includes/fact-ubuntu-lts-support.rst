MongoDB only provides packages for 64-bit LTS (long-term support) Ubuntu releases.
For example, 14.04 LTS (trusty), 16.04 LTS (xenial), and so on.
These packages may work with other Ubuntu releases, however, they are not supported.

MongoDB 3.4.15  is no longer supported on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (precise).
