Overview
--------


To live migrate data from the |mms|-managed deployments to
clusters in |service-short|, you:

1. Prepare a cluster in |service|.
#. Provision a migration host in |mms| and connect |mms| to |service-short|.
#. Start the Live Migration process in |service-short|.

You begin the process in |service-short|, by running the Live Migration wizard.
Depending on the stage in the process, you perform the Live Migration steps either
in |service-short| or in |mms|. See :ref:`lm-workflow`. 

To live migrate your MongoDB Community deployments to 
|service-short| using |mms|, see :ref:`migrate-community-to-atlas`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the Live Migration process, follow these prerequisites.

- :ref:`lm-external-ip`
- :ref:`lm-create-atlas-cluster`

.. _lm-external-ip:

Request an External IP Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request an external IP address for |mms| from your network administrator.
When you are ready to live migrate data, |service-short|
uses this address for a :term:`link-token` it generates.
When you run Live Migration, you push the data from a live deployment
in |mms| to a provisioned cluster in |service-short| using the
link-token. You generate this link-token in
|service-short| in Stage 1 of the Live Migration process.

.. _lm-create-atlas-cluster:

Create a Cluster in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform these tasks in |service-short|:

- :atlas:`Create an Atlas account </tutorial/create-atlas-account>`.
- :atlas:`Create an Atlas organization </tutorial/manage-organizations/#std-label-create-organization>`.
- :atlas:`Create a project </tutorial/manage-projects/#std-label-create-project>` in this organization.
- :atlas:`Create a new cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` in your project.

Workflow for Live Migration
---------------------------

The following diagram describes the stages in the Live Migration workflow.

   :width: 700px
   :align: center

The stages in the Live Migration workflow are:

- **Stage 1: Link with Atlas**. Perform this step in |service-short|,
  after :ref:`provisioning a cluster <lm-create-atlas-cluster>`.


  a. In the left-side panel of your organization's page, click 
     :guilabel:`Live Migration`.
  #. Select :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` and start
     the Live Migration wizard.
  #. If you are migrating from MongoDB Community using |onprem|, read and
     accept the |onprem| Migration Agreement.
  #. In the :guilabel:`Generate Link-Token` step of the wizard, specify
     the :ref:`external IP address <lm-external-ip>` for |mms| that you
     obtained from your service administrator.
     To learn more, see :atlas:`Live Migrate Your Data from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager </migration-from-com>`.

- **Stage 2: Provision Migration Host**.
  
  - In |mms|, :doc:`provision a Migration Host </tutorial/provision-migration-host>`.
    A migration host is a dedicated {+mdbagent+} that orchestrates the
    live migration process from |mms| to |service-short|.

  - In the :guilabel:`Live Migration: Connect to Atlas` section of your
    |mms| organization's :guilabel:`Settings` page, select
    :ref:`Connect to Atlas <connect-to-atlas-lm>` and enter the
    the link-token that you created in |service-short|.

- **Stage 3: Start the Migration**. In |service-short|, follow the
  steps in the wizard to :atlas:`start the live migration </migration-from-com>`.

Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Live Migration to |service-short| is supported for all platforms on
which you can provision a migration host. Provisioning of the migration
host :ref:`is supported <live-migration-host-supported-platforms>` on
all platforms except for Windows or MacOS. You can still live migrate
your data from a Windows- or macOS-based deployment to |service-short|
if you provision your migration host on one of its supported platforms.
