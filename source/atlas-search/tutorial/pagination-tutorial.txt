   The procedures in this tutorial might not be sufficient to optimize
   search query performance for all use cases. To provide feedback on

|fts| queries might return many results. To make navigating results 
easier, you can either use pagination to divide results into discrete
pages or use cursor iteration to view all the results for your query.  

The following tutorials take you through the steps for paginating your
query results:

- The :ref:`pagination-skip-limit-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates 
  how to create an |fts| index and paginate the query results using
  :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit` stages after the
  :pipeline:`$search` stage to divide the results into discrete pages.
  The tutorial also demonstrates how to use
  :ref:`fts-facet-aggregation-variable` to return the total number of
  search results for a query.
- The :ref:`iterate-cursor-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  create an index and iterate the cursor until it is exhausted to return
  all results for a query.
