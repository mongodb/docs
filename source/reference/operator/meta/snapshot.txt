      The :operator:`$snapshot` operator is deprecated. 
      Use :method:`cursor.snapshot()` instead.

   The :operator:`$snapshot` operator prevents the cursor from
   returning a document more than once because an intervening write
   operation results in a move of the document.

   Even in snapshot mode, objects inserted or deleted during the
   lifetime of the cursor may or may not be returned.

   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the :method:`cursor.snapshot()`
   method.
