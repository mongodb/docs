This document provides a collection of hard and soft limitations of
the MongoDB system.

BSON Documents
--------------

.. _limit-bson-document-size:
.. limit:: BSON Document Size

   .. include:: /includes/fact-document-max-size.rst

.. _limit-nested-depth:
.. limit:: Nested Depth for BSON Documents

   MongoDB supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for :term:`BSON
   documents <document>`.

Naming Restrictions
-------------------

.. limit:: Database Name Case Sensitivity

   Since database names are case *insensitive* in MongoDB, database
   names cannot differ only by the case of the characters.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Windows

   For MongoDB deployments running on Windows, database names cannot
   contain any of the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      /\. "$*<>:|?

   Also database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Unix and Linux Systems

   For MongoDB deployments running on Unix and Linux systems, database
   names cannot contain any of the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      /\. "$

   Also database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Length of Database Names

   Database names cannot be empty and must have fewer than 64 characters.

.. limit:: Restriction on Collection Names

   Collection names should begin with an underscore or a letter
   character, and *cannot*:

   - contain the ``$``.

   - be an empty string (e.g. ``""``).

   - contain the null character.

   - begin with the ``system.`` prefix. (Reserved for internal use.)

   If your collection name includes special characters, such as the
   underscore character, or begins with numbers, then to access the
   collection use the :method:`db.getCollection()` method in the
   :program:`mongo` shell or a :api:`similar method for your driver <>`.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

.. _limit-restrictions-on-field-names:

.. limit:: Restrictions on Field Names

   Field names cannot contain dots (i.e. ``.``) or null characters, and they
   must not start with a dollar sign (i.e. ``$``). See
   :ref:`faq-dollar-sign-escaping` for an alternate approach.

.. _faq-dev-namespace:

Namespaces
----------

.. _limit-namespace-length:
.. limit:: Namespace Length

   .. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

   .. seealso:: :ref:`faq-restrictions-on-collection-names`

.. _limit-number-of-namespaces:
.. limit:: Number of Namespaces

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 the number of namespaces is limited to the size of
   the namespace file divided by 628.

   A 16 megabyte namespace file can support approximately 24,000
   namespaces. Each collection and index is a namespace.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. _limit-size-of-namespace-file:
.. limit:: Size of Namespace File

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 storage engine, namespace files can be no larger
   than 2047 megabytes.

   By default namespace files are 16 megabytes. You can configure the
   size using the :setting:`~storage.mmapv1.nsSize` option.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. seealso:: :ref:`faq-restrictions-on-collection-names`

.. _index-limitations:

Indexes
-------

.. _limit-index-size:
.. limit:: Index Key Limit

   The *total size* of an index entry, which can include structural
   overhead depending on the BSON type, must be *less than* 1024 bytes.

   .. COMMENT refer to src/mongo/db/structure/btree/key.cpp (KeyV1Owned::KeyV1Owned)

   .. |limit| replace:: :limit:`index key limit <Index Key Limit>`

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6

      .. include:: /includes/list-index-field-limit-behaviors.rst

.. _limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection:
.. limit:: Number of Indexes per Collection

   A single collection can have *no more* than 64 indexes.

.. _limit-index-name-length:
.. limit:: Index Name Length

   Fully qualified index names, which includes the namespace and the dot
   separators (i.e. ``<database name>.<collection name>.$<index name>``),
   cannot be longer than 128 characters.

   By default, ``<index name>`` is the concatenation of the field names
   and index type. You can explicitly specify the ``<index name>`` to the
   :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` method to ensure that the fully
   qualified index name does not exceed the limit.

.. limit:: Number of Indexed Fields in a Compound Index

   There can be no more than 31 fields in a compound index.

.. limit:: Queries cannot use both text and Geospatial Indexes

   .. |operation| replace:: :query:`$text` query

   .. include:: /includes/fact-special-indexes-and-text.rst

   .. TODO remove in the 2.6 version of the manual

.. limit:: Fields with 2dsphere Indexes can only hold Geometries

   .. include:: /includes/geo-data-limit-for-2dsphere.rst

.. seealso:: The unique indexes limit in :ref:`limits-sharding-operations`.

.. limit:: NaN values returned from Covered Queries by the WiredTiger Storage Engine are always of type double

   If the value of a field returned from a query that is :ref:`covered
   by an index <covered-queries>` is ``NaN``, the type of that ``NaN``
   value is *always* ``double``.

.. limit:: Multikey Index

   .. include:: /includes/fact-multikey-index-covered-query.rst

Data
----

.. limit:: Maximum Number of Documents in a Capped Collection

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4

   If you specify a maximum number of documents for a capped
   collection using the ``max`` parameter to
   :dbcommand:`create`, the limit must be less than 2\ :sup:`32`
   documents. If you do not specify a maximum number of documents when
   creating a capped collection, there is no limit on the number of
   documents.

.. _limit-database-size:
.. limit:: Database Size

   The MMAPv1 storage engine limits each database to no more than 16000 data
   files. This means that a single MMAPv1 database has a maximum size of 32TB.
   Setting the :setting:`storage.mmapv1.smallFiles` option reduces this limit to 8TB.

.. _limit-data-size:
.. limit:: Data Size

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   Using the MMAPv1 storage engine, a single :program:`mongod`
   instance cannot manage a data set that exceeds maximum virtual
   memory address space provided by the underlying operating system.

   .. list-table:: Virtual Memory Limitations
      :widths: 15 10 10
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Operating System
        - Journaled
        - Not Journaled
      * - Linux
        - 64 terabytes
        - 128 terabytes
      * - Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1
        - 64 terabytes
        - 128 terabytes
      * - Windows (otherwise)
        - 4 terabytes
        - 8 terabytes

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. limit:: Number of Collections in a Database

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 storage engine, the maximum number of collections in
   a database is a function of the size of the namespace file and the
   number of indexes of collections in the database.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

   See :limit:`Number of Namespaces` for more information.

Replica Sets
------------

.. limit:: Number of Members of a Replica Set

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   Replica sets can have up to 50 members. See
   :ref:`3.0-replica-sets-max-members` for more information about
   specific driver compatibility with large replica sets.

.. limit:: Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set

   Replica sets can have up to 7 voting members. For replica sets with
   more than 7 total members, see :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members`.

.. limit:: Maximum Size of Auto-Created Oplog

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6

   If you do not explicitly specify an oplog size (i.e. with
   :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` or :option:`--oplogSize
   <mongod --oplogSize>`) MongoDB will create an oplog that is no
   larger than 50 gigabytes.
