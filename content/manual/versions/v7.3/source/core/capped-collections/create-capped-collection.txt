To create a :ref:`capped collection <manual-capped-collection>`, specify
the ``capped`` option to either the :method:`db.createCollection()`
method or the :dbcommand:`create` command.

You must create capped collections explicitly. You cannot create a
capped collection implicitly by inserting data into a non-existing
collection.

When you create a capped collection you must specify the maximum size of
the collection. MongoDB pre-allocates the specified storage for the
collection. The size of the capped collection includes a small amount of
space for internal overhead.

You can optionally specify a maximum number of documents for the
collection. MongoDB removes older documents if the collection reaches
the maximum size limit before it reaches the maximum document count.

.. _create-capped-collection-max-size:

Create a Capped Collection with a Maximum Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a capped collection called ``log`` that has a maximum size of
100,000 bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection( "log", { capped: true, size: 100000 } )

.. note:: 
   
   The value that you provide for the ``size`` field 
   must be greater than ``0`` and less than or equal to
   ``1024^5`` (1 {+pb+}). MongoDB rounds the ``size`` of all capped 
   collections up to the nearest integer multiple of 256, in bytes.

.. _create-capped-collection-max-docs:

Create a Capped Collection with a Maximum Number of Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a capped collection called ``log2`` that has a maximum size of
5,242,880 bytes and can store a maximum of 5,000 documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
      "log2",
      { 
         capped: true,
         size: 5242880,
         max: 5000
      }
   )

.. important:: 
   
   The ``size`` field is always required, even when you specify the
   ``max`` number of documents.
