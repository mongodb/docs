       - Purpose

     * - ``allCollectorStats``
       - document
       - Required
       - Statistics of all collectors of the query. Statistics reported represent either
         the maximum value across all collectors used in the query or
         a sum of the statistic across all the sub-collectors. The timing statistics are
         summed to reflect the total time spent across all collectors
         for the entire query. To learn more, see
