=======================
Provision Azure Servers
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Microsoft Azure so that you can provision servers
directly from the |mms| interface. When you provision servers, |mms|
automatically installs the Automation Agent on each, making them available
to host MongoDB deployments.

In general, provision one server per :program:`mongod` process. For
MongoDB deployment architectures, see :manual:`Replica Set Architectures
</core/replica-set-architectures>` and :manual:`Sharded Cluster
Architectures </core/sharded-cluster-architectures>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Prerequisites
-------------

You or an administrator must :doc:`configure integration with Azure
</tutorial/configure-azure-integration>`.

You must have at least one public key stored in your |mms|
:ref:`Provisioning Settings <provisioning-settings-page>`. You will use
the key when logging in to the provisioned servers.
