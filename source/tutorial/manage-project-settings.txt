View/Modify Project Settings
----------------------------

Project settings apply to all the users in the project
[#user-settings]_. The :guilabel:`Project ID` displayed at the top of
the page is used by the Atlas |api|.

You can set the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Project`

     - Sets your project's name.

       .. note::

          Only a user with ``Owner`` role for the project or the
          ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's organization
          can edit the project name.

   * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

     - Sets your project's time zone. This does not affect the
       timezones set for individual user accounts. [#user-settings]_

   * - :guilabel:`Using Custom DNS on AWS with VPC peering`

     - Allows you to expose a second connection string for your
       dedicated Atlas clusters on AWS that resolves to private IPs.

       Enable this setting if you use custom DNS that cannot take
       advantage of AWS built-in split-horizon DNS across a VPC peering
       connection.

       .. note::

          |service| displays this setting only when you
          :doc:`enable network peering on AWS </security-vpc-peering>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Connect via Peering Only (GCP and Azure)`

     - Allows you to enable or disable connections between MongoDB
       Atlas dedicated clusters and public |ipaddr| addresses outside
       of the peered |vpc|/VNet. You can only enable or disable this
       setting when there are no active dedicated GCP or Azure clusters
       in your Project.

       .. admonition:: Feature Deprecated
          :class: important

          This feature has been deprecated. Existing clusters can
          continue to use this feature. Use both Standard and Private
          IP for Peering connection strings to connect to your project.
          These connection strings allow you to connect using both
          |vpc|/VNet Peering and whitelisted public IP addresses. To
          learn more about support for multiple connection strings, see
          :dochub:`this FAQ <atlas-horizon-faq>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.


   * - :guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time`

     - Set which hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
       maintenance on your cluster.

       If you toggle to :guilabel:`On`, click :icon:`pencil-alt` to set
       the :guilabel:`Maintenance Start Time`. |service| displays this
       time in the time zone you set in your :guilabel:`Profile`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-urgent-maintenance.rst

       When maintenance is required, |service|:

       - Displays a banner in your cluster list showing the date and
         time when the maintenance is scheduled.

       - Sends a notification email to all users in the project 72 hours
         before the scheduled maintenance.

         .. note::

            To configure how you receive scheduled maintenance window
            notifications, see :ref:`configure-mw-alert`.

       With this information, you can choose one of three options:

       1. Do nothing. The maintenance occurs during your scheduled
          maintenance window.
       2. :guilabel:`Begin Maintenance Now`. The scheduled maintenance
          starts immediately. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it in a 
          separate modal.
       3. :guilabel:`Defer Maintenance for One Week`. The scheduled
          maintenance starts during your preferred maintenance window
          one week after the given scheduled maintenance date and
          time. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it
          in a separate modal.

   * - :guilabel:`Real Time Performance Panel`

     - Allows you to see real time metrics from your MongoDB database.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Explorer`

     - Allows you to query your database with an easy to use interface.

   * - :guilabel:`Performance Advisor`

     - Allows you to analyze database logs to recommend performance improvements.

   * - :guilabel:`Delete Charts`

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-delete-charts-warning.rst

       Allows :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` to delete the
       |charts| instance associated with your project. This setting is
       only visible if you have
       :charts:`created a Charts instance </launch-charts>` for your
       project.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-recreate-charts-instance.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Delete Project`
