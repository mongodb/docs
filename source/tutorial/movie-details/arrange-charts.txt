Now that you have two charts on your dashboard, you can arrange them
for maximum legibility. These two charts are horizontally oriented,
so you may wish to make them wider and stack them one above the other.
You can change the shape of each chart by clicking and dragging on the
lower right corner of the chart, and you can move them around the page
by clicking and dragging on the upper left corner of the chart.

Your finished dashboard should look similar to this:

Wrapping Up
-----------

You now have a dashboard which provides easily accessible insight into
award winning directors and award nominated films. Try adding additional
charts to the dashboard and see what other interesting insights you can
discover.
