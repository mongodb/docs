  - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
  - Establishes a connection to your Atlas cluster.
  - Uses the :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stage to query the collection. The query 
    uses the following :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator clauses:
    
    .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-isnull-stages

  - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the query.

    - ``must`` clause to find only documents that have the ``password`` 
      field.
    - ``mustNot`` clause with the :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-ref>` operator to exclude all 
      documents that have any value in the ``password`` field.

ref: fts-notnull-stages

  - :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stage to query the collection. The query uses the 
    :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator ``should`` clause to do the following:
    
    - Find all documents that don't have a ``null`` value in the 
      ``password`` field using the :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-ref>` operator.
    
    - Find documents that don't have the ``password`` field using the 
      :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator ``mustNot`` clause and replace their ``score`` 
      with ``2`` using the :ref:`scoring-constant` option.

      .. note:: 

         |fts| returns documents in order from highest score 
         to lowest. In this example, you alter the score for documents with a missing 
         ``password`` field so that they return first. Otherwise, these documents
         have a score of ``0`` and return last. To learn more, see :ref:`Scoring 
         <scoring-ref>`.

  - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``5`` results.

  - :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

    - Exclude all fields except ``name`` and ``password``.
    - Add a ``score`` field.
