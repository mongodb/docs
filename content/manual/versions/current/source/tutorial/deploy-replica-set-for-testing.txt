This procedure describes deploying a replica set in a development or
test environment. For a production deployment, refer to the
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` tutorial.

.. include:: /includes/introduction-deploy-replica-set.rst

Requirements
------------

For test and development systems, you can run your :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances on a local system, or within a virtual instance.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.

Each member must be able to connect to every other member. For
instructions on how to check your connection, see
:ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection`.

Considerations

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~

In this test deployment, the three members run on the same machine.

Replica Set Naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: These instructions should only be used for test or
   development deployments.

The examples in this procedure create a new replica set named ``rs0``.

.. include:: /includes/fact-unique-replica-set-names.rst

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/important-hostnames.rst

1. Create the necessary data directories for each member by issuing a
   command similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir -p /srv/mongodb/rs0-0  /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 /srv/mongodb/rs0-2

   This will create directories called "rs0-0", "rs0-1", and "rs0-2", which
   will contain the instances' database files.

#. Start your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in their own shell windows by issuing the following
   commands:

   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   First member:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --replSet rs0 --port 27017 --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-0  --oplogSize 128

   Second member:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --replSet rs0 --port 27018 --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-1  --oplogSize 128

   Third member:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --replSet rs0 --port 27019 --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)> --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-2 --oplogSize 128

   This starts each instance as a member of a replica set named
   ``rs0``, each running on a distinct port, and specifies the path to
   your data directory with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` setting.
   If you are already using the suggested ports, select different ports.

   The instances bind to both the localhost and the ip address
   of the host.

   The :option:`--oplogSize <mongod --oplogSize>` setting reduces the
   disk space that each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance uses. [#oplog]_
   This is ideal for testing and development deployments as it prevents
   overloading your machine. For more information on this and other
   configuration options, see :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

#. Connect to one of your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances through
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`. You will need to indicate which instance by
   specifying its port number. For the sake of simplicity and clarity,
   you may want to choose the first one, as in the following command;

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongosh --port 27017

#. In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use :method:`rs.initiate()` to
   initiate the replica set. You can create a replica set
   configuration object in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` environment, as
   in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rsconf = {
        _id: "rs0",
        members: [
          {
           _id: 0,
           host: "<hostname>:27017"
          },
          {
           _id: 1,
           host: "<hostname>:27018"
          },
          {
           _id: 2,
           host: "<hostname>:27019"
          }
         ]
      }

   replacing ``<hostname>`` with your system's hostname,
   and then pass the ``rsconf`` file to :method:`rs.initiate()` as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate( rsconf )

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`
   by issuing the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

   The replica set configuration object resembles the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
   
      {
         "_id" : "rs0",
         "version" : 1,
         "protocolVersion" : NumberLong(1),
         "members" : [
            {
               "_id" : 0,
               "host" : "<hostname>:27017",
               "arbiterOnly" : false,
               "buildIndexes" : true,
               "hidden" : false,
               "priority" : 1,
               "tags" : {
            
               },
               "secondaryDelaySecs" : NumberLong(0),
               "votes" : 1
            },
            {
               "_id" : 1,
               "host" : "<hostname>:27018",
               "arbiterOnly" : false,
               "buildIndexes" : true,
               "hidden" : false,
               "priority" : 1,
               "tags" : {
            
               },
               "secondaryDelaySecs" : NumberLong(0),
               "votes" : 1
            },
            {
               "_id" : 2,
               "host" : "<hostname>:27019",
               "arbiterOnly" : false,
               "buildIndexes" : true,
               "hidden" : false,
               "priority" : 1,
               "tags" : {
            
               },
               "secondaryDelaySecs" : NumberLong(0),
               "votes" : 1
            }
         ],
         "settings" : {
            "chainingAllowed" : true,
            "heartbeatIntervalMillis" : 2000,
            "heartbeatTimeoutSecs" : 10,
            "electionTimeoutMillis" : 10000,
            "catchUpTimeoutMillis" : -1,
            "getLastErrorModes" : {
         
            },
            "getLastErrorDefaults" : {
               "w" : 1,
               "wtimeout" : 0
            },
            "replicaSetId" : ObjectId("598f630adc9053c6ee6d5f38")
         }
      }

Check the status of your replica set at any time with the
:method:`rs.status()` operation.

   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`

   You may also consider the `simple setup script
   <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-snippets/blob/master/replication/simple-setup.py>`_
   as an example of a basic automatically-configured replica set.
