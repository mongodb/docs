Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the BSON data format, how MongoDB
uses it, and how to install the BSON library independently of the
MongoDB Java driver. 

BSON Data Format
----------------

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, different size integers, ObjectIds, and
binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` server manual page.

The binary format is not human-readable, but you can use the
:ref:`Java BSON library <install-bson-library>` to convert it to a JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in our article on :website:`JSON and BSON </json-and-bson>`.

MongoDB and BSON
----------------

The MongoDB Java Driver, which uses the BSON library, allows you to work
with BSON data by using one of the object types that implements the
`BSON interface <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>`__,
including:

- `Document <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `BsonDocument <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/BsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `RawBsonDocument <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/RawBsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `JsonObject <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/json/JsonObject.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `BasicDBObject <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/BasicDBObject.html>`__ (Java Driver package)

For more information about using these object types, see our
:ref:`Documents guide <fundamentals-documents>`.

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

These instructions show you how to add the BSON library as a dependency to
your project. If you added the MongoDB Java driver as a dependency to your
project, you can skip this step since the BSON library is already included
as a required dependency of the driver. For instructions on how to add the
MongoDB Java driver as a dependency to your project, see the
:ref:`driver installation <java-get-started-download-and-install>` section of our Quick Start
guide.

We recommend that you use the `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ build automation tool to manage your project's
dependencies. Select from the following tabs to see the dependency declaration
for that tool:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Maven
      :tabid: maven-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` section of your ``pom.xml`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-maven-versioned.rst

   .. tab:: Gradle
      :tabid: gradle-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` object in your ``build.gradle`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/bson-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are not using one of the preceding tools, you can include it in
your project by downloading the JAR file directly from the
`sonatype repository <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/bson/>`__.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This section answers questions that may arise when using the BSON data format.

How do I prevent the "IllegalArgumentException: Invalid BSON field name" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might throw this exception if you pass an incorrectly formatted
document to an operation and you are using {+driver-short+} v4.7 or earlier.

.. note::

   In driver versions v4.8 and later, this error message was replaced by one
   that includes more specific details on what was incorrectly formatted.

For example, the driver throws this error when you call an update operation
and incorrectly omit the update operator as shown in the following code
example:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :copyable: false

   // incorrectly formatted update document
   collection.updateOne(
       new Document().append("name", "fizz"),
       new Document().append("name", "buzz")
   );

To avoid this error, use the builder class for the appropriate operation.
The driver offers builder classes to create syntactically correct BSON for
MongoDB operations. The preceding example can be correctly expressed using
the builder classes, as shown in the following code example:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 7
   :copyable: false

   // Builder class imports
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Updates.*;

   // ...

   collection.updateOne(eq("name", "fizz"), set("name", "buzz"));

To learn more about the available builders classes, see the :ref:`<java-builders>` guide.
