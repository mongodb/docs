You can connect to your cluster in a variety of ways. This tutorial 
describes how to connect to your cluster using the 
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`,
and the :driver:`PyMongo driver </python/>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| account with an active cluster.
- An IP address added to your IP access list.
- A :ref:`MongoDB user <gswa-user>` on your cluster.

See :ref:`Parts 1 - 4 <atlas-getting-started>` of this tutorial for
help with the prerequisites.

.. note::

   You must have a database user set up on your cluster to access your 
   deployment. For security purposes, |service| requires clients to 
   authenticate as database users to access clusters.

Download and Install Utility
----------------------------

The following steps show you how to download and install the 
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`,
and the :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver. 
Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to connect to 
your cluster:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: driver
       name: Drivers
       content: |

                  Tools Required
                  --------------
         
                  To use the Node.js driver, you must have:
         
                  - A terminal
                  - A text editor
                  - `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__
                  - `Node.js <https://www.nodejs.org/>`__
                  - The MongoDB :driver:`Node.js driver </node>`
         
                  Install the Node.js Driver
                  --------------------------

                  To install the MongoDB Node.js driver, run the following command
                  at a terminal prompt:
         
                  .. code-block:: shell
         
                     npm install mongodb --save
         
              - id: python

                  To complete this tutorial you must have:
         
                  - A terminal.
         
                  - `Python <https://www.python.org>`__.
         
                  - The `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package
                    installer. This comes prepackaged with the Python
                    download.
         
                  - The :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver.
         
                  - A text editor.
         
                  Install the PyMongo Driver
                  --------------------------
         
                  MongoDB drivers allow you to communicate with your MongoDB
                  database programatically.
                  
                  For this tutorial, we will walk through setting up and using
                  the Python MongoDB driver, called :guilabel:`PyMongo`. If you
                  are interested in working with a different driver, refer to
                  the :driver:`MongoDB Driver documentation </>`.
         
                  .. admonition:: Prerequisites
                     :class: note
         
                     - To install :guilabel:`PyMongo`, you must have Python
                       installed. Visit the
                       `Python Downloads Page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
                       and download the latest version of Python for your
                       operating system.
         
                     - You will also need the
                       `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package
                       installer. Python 2 ``>=2.7.9`` and Python 3
                       ``>=3.4`` downloaded from https://python.org come with
                       ``pip`` already installed. If you need to install ``pip``
                       manually, refer to the `pip installation page
                       <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__ for
                       instructions.
         
                  Once you have Python and ``pip`` installed:
                  
                  .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-pymongo-test.rst

       name: Mongo Shell

         Tools Required
         --------------

         To complete this tutorial you must have:

         - A terminal

         - The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell

         Download and Install the Shell
         ------------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

         The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is an interactive
         command line interface to MongoDB. You can use the ``mongo``
         shell to insert and interact with data on your |service|
         cluster.

         |service| provides an easy way to download and install the
         ``mongo`` shell. To download and install the ``mongo`` shell:

Connect to Your Atlas Cluster
-----------------------------

The following steps show you how to connect to your cluster using the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` Shell, the Node.js driver and the PyMongo driver.
Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to connect to
your cluster:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: driver
       name: Drivers
       content: |

         .. tabs-pillstrip:: languages

         .. tabs-drivers::
         
            tabs:
         
              - id: python
                content: |

                  *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*
         
                  You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from
                  |service| to connect to the cluster using the PyMongo driver.
         
                  .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-connect.rst

              - id: nodejs
                content: |

                  *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*
         
                  You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from
                  |service| to connect to the cluster using the Node.js driver.

                  .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-connect-node.rst

     - id: shell
       name: Mongo Shell
       content: |

         *Estimated completion time: 3 minutes* 

         Now that you have installed the ``mongo`` shell, you
         can use the shell to connect to your |service| cluster.
