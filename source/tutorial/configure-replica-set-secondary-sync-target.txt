To override the default sync target selection logic, you may manually
configure a :term:`secondary` member's sync target for pulling
:term:`oplog` entries temporarily. The following operations provide
access to this functionality:

- :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` command, or

- :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell

Only modify the default sync logic as needed, and always exercise
caution.  :method:`rs.syncFrom()` will not affect an in-progress
initial sync operation. To affect the sync target for the initial sync, run
:method:`rs.syncFrom()` operation *before* initial sync.

If you run :method:`rs.syncFrom()` during initial sync, MongoDB
produces no error messages, but the sync target will not change until
after the initial sync operation.
