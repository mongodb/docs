Remove Data

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method to remove
documents from a collection. The method takes a conditions document
that determines the documents to remove.

To specify a remove condition, use the same structure and syntax as the
query conditions. See :doc:`/query` for an introduction to query
conditions.

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section use the ``inventory`` collection in the
``test`` database. Populate the collection with
:doc:`/tutorial/prerequisite`.

Additional Information
----------------------

In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
document. If a single remove operation removes multiple documents from
a collection, the operation can interleave with other write operations
on that collection. See :method:`~db.collection.remove()` for more
information regarding the method behavior.
