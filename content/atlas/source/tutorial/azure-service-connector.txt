|azure| Service Connector enables you to connect |azure| compute services to your 
|service| clusters. Once you've configured your application to use the |service| 
connection string, |azure| Service Connector securely stores your connection string 
and manages the connection between your application and |service|.

This tutorial demonstrates how to connect an |azure| compute service 
(such as Azure App Service) to your |service| cluster using the |azure| Service 
Connector within the |azure| Portal.

Limitations
-----------

|azure| Service Connector for |service| has the following limitations:

- |azure| Service Connector for |service| doesn't validate the connection string
  beyond checking for empty strings. Ensure your 
  :ref:`connection string is valid <atlas-connect-to-deployment>` to avoid 
  runtime connection errors.

- |azure| Service Connector doesn't support all |azure| regions. To learn more, 
  see `Service Connector region support <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/concept-region-support>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |azure| account with an active subscription.
- An |azure| compute service to connect to |service|. To learn what |azure| services 
  the |azure| Service Connector supports, see the |azure| 
  `documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview#what-services-are-supported-by-service-connector>`__.
- An existing |service| cluster.
- A database user with the necessary permissions to access your |service| cluster. 
  
  .. important::
  
     |azure| Service Connector for |service| 
     currently only supports :ref:`SCRAM <authentication-scram>` authentication.
     To learn more, see :ref:`add-mongodb-users`. 

- Your |service| cluster's connection string. 


Procedure
---------

Follow these steps to connect your |azure| compute service (such as App Service) 
to |service| using the |azure| portal.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to your |azure| compute service. 
    
      In the |azure| portal, select the App Service, Function App, 
      or other compute resource you want to connect to |service|.

   .. step:: Open the Service Connector. 
    
      In the service's left-hand menu, scroll to the :guilabel:`Settings` section 
      and select :guilabel:`Service Connector`.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`+ Create` button.

   .. step:: Configure the connection.

      Configure the following fields: 

      a. :guilabel:`Service type`: Search for and select :guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas Cluster (preview)`.
      #. :guilabel:`Connection name`: Assign a descriptive name for this connection, 
         for example, "atlas_connection", or accept the auto-generated name. This 
         name is for |azure| management purposes.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Next: Authentication`

   .. step:: Configure authentication.
      
      The :guilabel:`Connection string` option is pre-selected as it's the only 
      supported method for |service|.
      
      a. Enter your |service| connection string. To find your connection string, see :ref:`gswa-connect`.

      #. (Optional) Edit the variable name that Azure Service Connector uses for 
         your connection string. Click :guilabel:`Advanced` and click the pencil icon.
         Edit the variable name, then click :guilabel:`Done`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Next: Networking`.

         Skip this step since you manage network access controls from your |service|
         project settings, not through Service Connector's network configuration options.

         To learn about managing network access controls in |service|, see :ref:`setup-cluster-security`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Next: Review + Create`.

         Review the summary of the connection details. Verify the target service 
         (|service|), compute service, authentication method, and the environment 
         variables that are created.
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

         It might take a minute or two for |azure| to provision the connection.  
         Service Connector configures the necessary settings on your |azure| compute 
         service (primarily environment variables). 
         
         After you create or modify an |azure| Service Connector connection, the 
         corresponding environment variables might not be immediately updated or 
         reflected in your application's environment.

         Confirm the connection was created successfully by returning to the Service 
         Connector page for your compute service. The new |service| connection should
         be listed.

Using the Connection in Your Application
----------------------------------------

After you create the connection, Service Connector uses the connection details in
your |azure| compute service's environment. Your application code accesses these 
environment variables to connect to |service| using a standard MongoDB driver or 
library appropriate for your chosen language or framework.
