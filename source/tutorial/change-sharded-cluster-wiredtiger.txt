====================================
Change Sharded Cluster to WiredTiger
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available. Also, sharded clusters
   may have individual shards with different storage engine
   configurations.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engines of a
component of a :term:`sharded cluster` to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

This procedure may involve downtime, especially if one or more of your
shards is a :term:`standalone`. If you change the host or port of any
:term:`shard`, you must update the shard configuration as well.

Change Shards to WiredTiger
---------------------------

.. note::

   A sharded cluster **can** have mixed storage engines for its
   individual :term:`shards <shard>`.

To change the storage engine for the :term:`shards <shard>` to
WiredTiger, refer to the appropriate procedure for each shard:

- If the shard is a :term:`standalone`, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`.

- If the shard is a :term:`replica set`, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`.

Change Config Servers to WiredTiger
-----------------------------------

To change the storage engines of the :term:`config servers <config
server>` of a sharded cluster, see
:doc:`/tutorial/change-config-server-wiredtiger`.
