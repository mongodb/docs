more, see :ref:`<supported-products>`.

This documentation provides tutorials for common 
MongoDB Cloud tasks, reference material for features unique to 
|govcloud-short|, and high-level comparisons between |govcloud-short| 
products and their commercial equivalents.

The focus of this documentation is on |service|, MongoDB's fully 
managed cloud database, in |govcloud|.

|service| in |govcloud|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many procedures and reference materials are identical across 
|govcloud-short| and commercial |service|. In those cases, this 
documentation provides links to the relevant |service| documentation 
pages.
**We recommend opening Atlas links in a new browser tab to save your place in the MongoDB CloudGov documentation.**

Links to |service| documentation pages are presented as either:

- Sections titled **See the Atlas Documentation** for important 
  procedures and information, or
- :guilabel:`Tips` for optional, further reading on a topic.
