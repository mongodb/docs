MongoDB Drivers and Client Libraries
====================================

An application communicates with MongoDB by way of a client library,
called a :ecosystem:`driver </drivers>`, that handles all interaction with the
database in a language appropriate to the application.

Driver Version Numbers
----------------------

Driver version numbers use `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_
or "**major.minor.patch**" versioning system. The first number is the
major version, the second the minor version, and the third indicates a
patch.

.. example:: Driver version numbers.

   If your driver has a version number of ``2.9.1``, ``2`` is the major
   version, ``9`` is minor, and ``1`` is the patch.

The numbering scheme for drivers differs from the scheme for the
MongoDB server. For more information on server versioning, see
:ref:`release-version-numbers`.
