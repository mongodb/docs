Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use MongoDB databases and
collections with {+driver-short+}.

MongoDB organizes data into a hierarchy of the following levels:

- **Databases**: The top level of data organization in a MongoDB instance.
- **Collections**: MongoDB stores documents in collections. They are analogous to tables in relational databases.
- **Documents**: Contain literal data such as string, numbers, dates, and other embedded documents.

For more information about document field types and structure, see the
:manual:`Documents </core/document/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Access a Database
-----------------

Access a database by using dictionary-style access on your ``MongoClient`` instance.

The following example accesses a database named ``test_database``:

.. code-block:: python

   database = client["test_database"]

Access a Collection
-------------------

Access a collection by using dictionary-style access on an instance of your database.

The following example accesses a collection named ``test_collection``:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   database = client["test_database"]
   collection = database["test_collection"]

.. tip::

   If the provided collection name does not already exist in the database,
   MongoDB implicitly creates the collection when you first insert data
   into it.

Create a Collection
-------------------

Use the ``create_collection()`` method to explicitly create a collection in a
MongoDB database.

The following example creates a collection called ``example_collection``:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   database = client["test_database"]
   database.create_collection("example_collection")

You can specify collection options, such as maximum size and document
validation rules, by passing them in as keyword arguments. For a full list of
optional parameters, see the `create_collection() API documentation
<{+api-root+}pymongo/database.html#pymongo.database.Database.create_collection>`__.

Time Series Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over a period of time.
The following example creates a time series collection called ``example_ts_collection``
in which the documents' time field is called ``timestamp``:

.. code-block:: python

   database = client["test_database"]
   database.create_collection("example_ts_collection", timeseries={"timeField": "timestamp"})

For more information about using time series data with {+driver-short+}, see the
:ref:`pymongo-time-series` guide.

Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a capped collection that cannot grow beyond a specified memory size or
document count. The following example creates a capped collection called
``example_capped_collection`` that has a maximum size of 1000 bytes:

.. code-block:: python

   database = client["test_database"]
   database.create_collection("example_capped_collection", capped=True, size=1000)

To learn more about capped collections, see :manual:`Capped Collections </core/capped-collections/>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Get a List of Collections
-------------------------

You can query for a list of collections in a database by calling the
``list_collections()`` method. The method returns a cursor containing all
collections in the database and their associated metadata.

The following example calls the ``list_collections()`` method and iterates over
the cursor to print the results:

.. code-block:: python

   collection_list = database.list_collections()

   for c in collection_list:
       print(c)

To query for only the names of the collections in the database, call the
``list_collection_name()`` method as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   collection_list = database.list_collection_names()

   for c in collection_list:
       print(c)

For more information about iterating over a cursor, see :ref:`pymongo-cursors`. 

Delete a Collection
-------------------

You can delete a collection from the database by using the ``drop_collection()``
method.

The following example deletes the ``test_collection`` collection:

.. code-block:: python

   collection = database["test_collection"];
   collection.drop();

.. warning:: Dropping a Collection Deletes All Data in the Collection

   Dropping a collection from your database permanently deletes all
   documents and all indexes within that collection.

   Drop a collection only if the data in it is no longer needed.

.. _pymongo-config-read-write:

Configure Read and Write Operations
-----------------------------------

You can control how the driver routes read operations by setting a **read preference**.
You can also control options for how the driver waits for acknowledgment of
read and write operations on a replica set by setting a **read concern** and a
**write concern**.

By default, databases inherit these settings from the ``MongoClient`` instance,
and collections inherit them from the database. However, you can change these
settings on your database or collection by using one of the following methods:

- ``get_database()``: Gets the database and applies the client's read
  preference, read concern, and write preference.
- ``database.with_options()``: Gets the database and applies its current read
  preference, read concern, and write preference.
- ``get_collection()``: Gets the collection and applies its current read preference, read concern, and write preference.
- ``collection.with_options()``: Gets the collection and applies the database's read
  preference, read concern, and write preference.

To change read or write settings with the preceding methods, call the method and
pass in the collection or database name, and the new read preference, read
concern, or write preference.

The following example shows how to change the read preference, read concern and
write preference of a database called ``test-database`` with the ``get_database()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   client.get_database("test-database", 
                       read_preference=ReadPreference.SECONDARY,
                       read_concern="local",
                       write_concern="majority")

The following example shows how to change read and write settings of a
collection called ``test-collection`` with the ``get_collection()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   database.get_collection("test-collection", 
                       read_preference=ReadPreference.SECONDARY,
                       read_concern="local",
                       write_concern="majority")

The following example shows how to change read and write settings of a
collection called ``test-collection`` with the ``with_options()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   collection.with_options(read_preference=ReadPreference.SECONDARY,
                           read_concern="local",
                           write_concern="majority")

.. tip::

   To see the types of read preferences available in the ``ReadPreference`` enum, see the
   `API documentation <{+api-root+}pymongo/read_preferences.html#pymongo.read_preferences.ReadPreference>`__. 

To learn more about the read and write settings, see the following guides in the
MongoDB Server manual:

- :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`
- :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>`
- :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`

Tag Sets
~~~~~~~~

In {+mdb-server+}, you can apply key-value :manual:`tags
</core/read-preference-tags/>` to replica-set
members according to any criteria you choose. You can then use
those tags to target one or more members for a read operation.

By default, {+driver-short+} ignores tags
when choosing a member to read from. To instruct {+driver-short+}
to prefer certain tags, pass them as a parameter to your
`read preference class <{+api-root+}pymongo/read_preferences.html#pymongo.read_preferences.Primary>`__ 
constructor. 

In the following code example, the tag set passed to the ``read_preference`` parameter
instructs {+driver-short+} to prefer reads from the
New York data center (``'dc': 'ny'``) and to fall back to the San Francisco data
center (``'dc': 'sf'``):

.. code-block:: python

   db = client.get_database(
        'test', read_preference=Secondary([{'dc': 'ny'}, {'dc': 'sf'}]))

Local Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple replica-set members match the read preference and tag sets you specify,
{+driver-short+} reads from the nearest replica-set members, chosen according to
their ping time.

By default, the driver uses only those members whose ping times are within 15 milliseconds
of the nearest member for queries. To distribute reads between members with
higher latencies, pass the ``localThresholdMS`` option to the ``MongoClient()`` constructor.

The following example specifies a local threshold of 35 milliseconds:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   client = MongoClient(replicaSet='repl0',
                        readPreference=ReadPreference.SECONDARY_PREFERRED,
                        localThresholdMS=35)

In the preceding example, {+driver-short+} distributes reads between matching members
within 35 milliseconds of the closest member's ping time.

.. note::
  
   {+driver-short+} ignores the value of ``localThresholdMS`` when communicating with a
   replica set through a ``mongos`` instance. In this case, use the
   :manual:`localThreshold </reference/program/mongos/#std-option-mongos.--localThreshold>`
   command-line option.

Retryable Reads and Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+driver-short+} automatically retries certain read and write operations a single time
if they fail due to a network or server error.

You can explicitly disable retryable reads or retryable writes by setting the ``retryReads`` or
``retryWrites`` option to ``False`` in the ``MongoClient()`` constructor. The following
example disables retryable reads and writes for a client:

.. code-block:: python

   client = MongoClient("<connection string>",
                        retryReads=False, retryWrites=False)

To learn more about supported retryable read operations, see :manual:`Retryable Reads </core/retryable-reads/>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual. To learn more about supported retryable write
operations, see :manual:`Retryable Writes </core/retryable-writes/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Type Hints
----------

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/intro.rst

.. note:: TypedDict in Python 3.7 and Earlier
   
   .. include:: /includes/type-hints/typeddict-availability.rst

Database
~~~~~~~~

If all documents in a database match a well-defined schema, you can specify a type hint
that uses a Python class to represent the documents' structure. By including this class
in the type hint for your ``Database`` object, you can ensure that all documents you
store or retrieve have the required structure. This provides more accurate type
checking and code completion than the default ``Dict[str, Any]`` type.

First, define a class to represent a document from the database. The class must inherit
from the ``TypedDict`` class and must contain the same fields as the documents in the
database. After you define your class, include its name as the generic type for the
``Database`` type hint.

The following example defines a ``Movie`` class and uses it as the
generic type for a ``Database`` type hint:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7, 10

   from typing import TypedDict
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.database import Database

   class Movie(TypedDict):
       name: str
       year: int
   
   client: MongoClient = MongoClient()
   database: Database[Movie] = client["test_database"]

Collection
~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a generic type to a ``Collection`` type hint is similar to adding a generic type
to a ``Database`` type hint. First, define a class that inherits from the ``TypedDict`` class
and represents the structure of the
documents in the collection. Then, include the class name as the generic type for the
``Collection`` type hint, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7,11

   from typing import TypedDict
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.collection import Collection
   
   class Movie(TypedDict):
       name: str
       year: int
   
   client: MongoClient = MongoClient()
   database = client["test_database"]
   collection: Collection[Movie] = database["test_collection"]
