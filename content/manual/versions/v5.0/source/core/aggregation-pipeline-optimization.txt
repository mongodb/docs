Aggregation pipeline operations have an optimization phase which
attempts to reshape the pipeline for improved performance.

To see how the optimizer transforms a particular aggregation pipeline,
include the :method:`explain <db.collection.aggregate()>` option in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method.

.. include:: /includes/fact-optimizations-subject-to-change.rst

In addition to learning about the aggregation pipeline optimizations
performed during the optimization phase, you will also see how to
improve aggregation pipeline performance using indexes and document
filters. See
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters`.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-projection-optimization:

Projection Optimization
-----------------------

The aggregation pipeline can determine if it requires only a subset of
the fields in the documents to obtain the results. If so, the pipeline
will only use those required fields, reducing the amount of data
passing through the pipeline.

``$project`` Stage Placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |$project| replace:: :pipeline:`$project`

.. include:: /includes/aggregation/fact-project-stage-placement.rst

.. _aggregation-pipeline-sequence-optimization:

Pipeline Sequence Optimization
------------------------------

.. _agg-project-addFields-match-optimization:

(``$project`` or ``$unset`` or ``$addFields`` or ``$set``) + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an aggregation pipeline that contains a projection stage
(:pipeline:`$addFields`, :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$set`, or
:pipeline:`$unset`) followed by a :pipeline:`$match` stage, MongoDB
moves any filters in the ``$match`` stage that do not require values
computed in the projection stage to a new ``$match`` stage before the
projection.

If an aggregation pipeline contains multiple projection or ``$match``
stages, MongoDB performs this optimization for each ``$match`` stage,
moving each ``$match`` filter before all projection stages that the
filter does not depend on.

Consider a pipeline with the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 18-23

   {
      $addFields: {
         maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
         minTime: { $min: "$times" }
      }
   },
   {
      $project: {
         _id: 1,
         name: 1,
         times: 1,
         maxTime: 1,
         minTime: 1,
         avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
      }
   },
   {
      $match: {
         name: "Joe Schmoe",
         maxTime: { $lt: 20 },
         minTime: { $gt: 5 },
         avgTime: { $gt: 7 }
      }
   }

The optimizer breaks up the ``$match`` stage into four individual
filters, one for each key in the ``$match`` query document. The
optimizer then moves each filter before as many projection stages as
possible, creating new ``$match`` stages as needed.

Given this example, the optimizer automatically produces the following
*optimized* pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 6, 11
   :copyable: false

   { $match: { name: "Joe Schmoe" } },
   { $addFields: {
       maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
       minTime: { $min: "$times" }
   } },
   { $match: { maxTime: { $lt: 20 }, minTime: { $gt: 5 } } },
   { $project: {
       _id: 1, name: 1, times: 1, maxTime: 1, minTime: 1,
       avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
   } },
   { $match: { avgTime: { $gt: 7 } } }

.. note::

   The optimized pipeline is not intended to be run manually. The
   original and optimized pipelines return the same results.

   You can see the optimized pipeline in the :ref:`explain plan
   <example-aggregate-method-explain-option>`.

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ avgTime: { $gt: 7 } }`` depends on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage to compute the ``avgTime`` field. The
:pipeline:`$project` stage is the last projection stage in this
pipeline, so the :pipeline:`$match` filter on ``avgTime`` could not be
moved.

The ``maxTime`` and ``minTime`` fields are computed in the
:pipeline:`$addFields` stage but have no dependency on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage. The optimizer created a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage for the filters on these fields and placed it
before the :pipeline:`$project` stage.

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` does not
use any values computed in either the :pipeline:`$project` or
:pipeline:`$addFields` stages so it was moved to a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage before both of the projection stages.

After optimization, the filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` is in a
:pipeline:`$match` stage at the beginning of the pipeline. This has the
added benefit of allowing the aggregation to use an index on the
``name`` field when initially querying the collection.

.. _agg-sort-match-optimization:

``$sort`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$match`, the :pipeline:`$match` moves before the
:pipeline:`$sort` to minimize the number of objects to sort. For
example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $match: { status: 'A' } }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { status: 'A' } },
   { $sort: { age : -1 } }

``$redact`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, when the pipeline has the :pipeline:`$redact` stage
immediately followed by the :pipeline:`$match` stage, the aggregation
can sometimes add a portion of the :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage. If the added :pipeline:`$match` stage is at
the start of a pipeline, the aggregation can use an index as well as
query the collection to limit the number of documents that enter the
pipeline. See
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters` for more
information.

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

The optimizer can add the same :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

.. _agg-project-skip-optimization:

``$project``/``$unset`` + ``$skip`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$project` or :pipeline:`$unset` followed by 
:pipeline:`$skip`, the :pipeline:`$skip` 
moves before :pipeline:`$project`. For example, if
the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } },
   { $skip: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 5 },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } }

.. _aggregation-pipeline-coalescence-optimization:

Pipeline Coalescence Optimization
---------------------------------

When possible, the optimization phase coalesces a pipeline stage into
its predecessor. Generally, coalescence occurs *after* any sequence
reordering optimization.

.. _agg-sort-limit-coalescence:

``$sort`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$sort` precedes a :pipeline:`$limit`, the optimizer
can coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` if no
intervening stages modify the number of documents 
(e.g. :pipeline:`$unwind`, :pipeline:`$group`).
MongoDB will not coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the
:pipeline:`$sort` if there are pipeline stages that change the number of
documents between the :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$limit` stages..

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort : { age : -1 } },
   { $project : { age : 1, status : 1, name : 1 } },
   { $limit: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer coalesces the sequence
to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "$sort" : {
          "sortKey" : {
             "age" : -1
          },
          "limit" : NumberLong(5)
       }
   },
   { "$project" : { 
            "age" : 1, 
            "status" : 1, 
            "name" : 1 
     } 
   }

This allows the sort operation to only maintain the
top ``n`` results as it progresses, where ``n`` is the specified limit,
and MongoDB only needs to store ``n`` items in memory
[#coalescence-allowDiskUse]_. See :ref:`sort-and-memory` for more
information.

.. note:: Sequence Optimization with $skip

   If there is a :pipeline:`$skip` stage between the :pipeline:`$sort`
   and :pipeline:`$limit` stages, MongoDB will coalesce the
   :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` stage and increase the
   :pipeline:`$limit` value by the :pipeline:`$skip` amount. See
   :ref:`agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence` for an example.

.. [#coalescence-allowDiskUse] The optimization will still apply when
   ``allowDiskUse`` is ``true`` and the ``n`` items exceed the
   :ref:`aggregation memory limit <agg-memory-restrictions>`.

.. _agg-limit-limit-coalescence:

``$limit`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$limit` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$limit`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$limit` where the limit amount is the *smaller* of the two
initial limit amounts. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 100 },
   { $limit: 10 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$limit` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$limit` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$limit`
stage where the limit amount ``10`` is the minimum of the two initial
limits ``100`` and ``10``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 10 }

.. _agg-skip-skip-coalescence:

``$skip`` + ``$skip`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$skip` immediately follows another :pipeline:`$skip`,
the two stages can coalesce into a single :pipeline:`$skip` where the
skip amount is the *sum* of the two initial skip amounts. For example, a
pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 5 },
   { $skip: 2 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$skip` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$skip` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$skip`
stage where the skip amount ``7`` is the sum of the two initial
limits ``5`` and ``2``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 7 }

.. _agg-match-match-coalescence:

``$match`` + ``$match`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$match` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$match`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$match` combining the conditions with an
:expression:`$and`. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $match: { status: "A" } }

Then the second :pipeline:`$match` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$match` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$match`
stage 

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { $and: [ { "year" : 2014 }, { "status" : "A" } ] } }

.. _agg-lookup-unwind-coalescence:

``$lookup`` + ``$unwind`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

When a :pipeline:`$unwind` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$lookup`, and the :pipeline:`$unwind` operates on the ``as``
field of the :pipeline:`$lookup`, the optimizer can coalesce the
:pipeline:`$unwind` into the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. This avoids
creating large intermediate documents.

For example, a pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "otherCollection",
       as: "resultingArray",
       localField: "x",
       foreignField: "y"
     }
   },
   { $unwind: "$resultingArray"}

The optimizer can coalesce the :pipeline:`$unwind` stage into the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage. If you run the aggregation with ``explain``
option, the ``explain`` output shows the coalesced stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "otherCollection",
       as: "resultingArray",
       localField: "x",
       foreignField: "y",
       unwinding: { preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: false }
     }
   }

The ``unwinding`` field shown in the previous ``explain`` output
differs from the ``$unwind`` stage. The ``unwinding`` field shows how
the pipeline is internally optimized. The ``$unwind`` stage deconstructs
an array field from the input documents and outputs a document for each
element.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-optimization-indexes-and-filters:

Improve Performance with Indexes and Document Filters
-----------------------------------------------------

The following sections show how you can improve aggregation performance
using indexes and document filters.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

An aggregation pipeline can use :ref:`indexes <indexes>` from the input 
collection to improve performance. Using an index limits the amount of 
documents a stage processes. Ideally, an index can :ref:`cover 
<read-operations-covered-query>` the stage query. A covered query has 
especiallly high performance, since the index returns all matching 
documents.

For example, a pipeline that consists of :pipeline:`$match`, 
:pipeline:`$sort`, :pipeline:`$group` can benefit from indexes at 
every stage:

- An index on the :pipeline:`$match` query field can efficiently 
  identify the relevant data

- An index on the sorting field can return data in sorted order for the 
  :pipeline:`$sort` stage

- An index on the grouping field that matches the :pipeline:`$sort` 
  order can return all of the field values needed to execute the 
  :pipeline:`$group` stage (a covered query)

To determine whether a pipeline uses indexes, review the query plan and 
look for ``IXSCAN`` or ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` plans.

.. note::
   In some cases, the query planner uses a ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` index plan 
   that returns one document per index key value. ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` 
   executes faster than ``IXSCAN`` if there are multiple documents per 
   key value. However, index scan parameters might affect the time 
   comparison of ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` and ``IXSCAN``.

For early stages in your aggregation pipeline, consider indexing the 
query fields. Stages that can benefit from indexes are:

``$match`` stage
  :pipeline:`$match` can use an index to filter documents if it is the 
  first stage in the pipeline, after any optimizations from the 
  :ref:`query planner <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

``$sort`` stage
   :pipeline:`$sort` can benefit from an index as long as it is not 
   preceded by a :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$unwind`, or 
   :pipeline:`$group` stage.

``$group`` stage
  :pipeline:`$group` can use an index to find the first document in 
  each group if it meets all of the following conditions:
  
  - a :pipeline:`$sort` stage sorts the grouping field before 
    :pipeline:`$group`

  - an index exists that matches the sort order on the grouped field

  - :group:`$first` is the only accumulator in the :pipeline:`$group` 
    stage

  See :ref:`$group Performance Optimizations <group-pipeline-optimization>` 
  for an example.

``$geoNear`` stage 
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` always uses an index, since it must be the first 
  stage in a pipeline and requires a :ref:`geospatial index <index-feature-geospatial>`.

Additionally, stages later in the pipeline that retrieve data from 
other, unmodified collections can use indexes on those collections 
for optimization. These stages include:

- :pipeline:`$lookup`
- :pipeline:`$graphLookup`
- :pipeline:`$unionWith`

Document Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the documents in
a collection, filter the documents first:

- Use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and :pipeline:`$skip`
  stages to restrict the documents that enter the pipeline.
  
- When possible, put :pipeline:`$match` at the beginning of the pipeline
  to use indexes that scan the matching documents in a collection.

- :pipeline:`$match` followed by :pipeline:`$sort` at the start of the
  pipeline is equivalent to a single query with a sort, and can use an
  index.

Example
-------
.. _agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence:

``$sort`` + ``$skip`` + ``$limit`` Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pipeline contains a sequence of :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$skip` followed by a :pipeline:`$limit`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 10 },
   { $limit: 5 }

The optimizer performs :ref:`agg-sort-limit-coalescence` to
transforms the sequence to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "$sort" : {
         "sortKey" : {
            "age" : -1
         },
         "limit" : NumberLong(15)
      }
   },
   {
      "$skip" : NumberLong(10)
   }

MongoDB increases the :pipeline:`$limit` amount with the reordering.
