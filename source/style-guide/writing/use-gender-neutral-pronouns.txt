Use Gender-Neutral Pronouns
===========================

Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person you're referring
to is actually that gender. Follow the general rule that only when the
singular noun does not specify an individual it can be replaced with a
plural pronoun.

   * - *They*, *their*, *theirs*, *them*, or *themselves* as a singular
       pronoun.
     - *he*, *him*, *his*, *she*, or *her* as gender-neutral pronouns
       and *he/she* or *(s)he* or other such punctuational approaches.

Following are some examples:

- Tell the next caller they need to forward the status.
- Every account manager should thank their customer.
- Who left their laptop opened and unsecured?

In these sentences, we’re talking about one person, but we don’t know
how that person self identifies. In the past, people might have
written "Tell the next caller he needs to forward the status" or "Tell
the next caller he or she need to forward the status. But recently,
acceptance of the pronoun *they* or *their* in sentences similar to
these is moving forward. (Singular *they* is actually an old pattern in
English.)

You can also rewrite the sentence avoiding singular nouns. Using
plurals can often help, as shown in the following example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use

   * - Programmers should save their code frequently.
     - The programmer should be careful to save their code frequently.
