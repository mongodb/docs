|service| |global-write-clusters| use a highly curated implementation 
of sharded cluster :manual:`zones </core/zone-sharding>` to support 
location-aware read and write operations for globally distributed 
application instances and clients. |global-write-clusters| support 
deployment patterns such as:

- Low-latency read and write operations for globally distributed
  clients.

- Uptime protection during partial or full regional outages.

- Location-aware data storage in specific geographic regions.

- Workload isolation based on cluster member types.

For instructions on creating a Global Cluster, see
:ref:`create-new-global-write-cluster`.

You can enable |global-write| in |service| when deploying an ``M30`` or
greater sharded cluster. For replica sets,
:doc:`scale </scale-cluster>` the cluster to at least an ``M30``
tier and enable |global-write|. All shard nodes deploy with the 
selected cluster.

.. important::

   You cannot disable |global-write| for a cluster once it is deployed.

Additional Global Cluster Reference
-----------------------------------

|service| |global-write-clusters| require that you define single or
multi-region :guilabel:`Zones`, where each zone supports write and read
operations from geographically local shards. You can also configure zones
that support global low-latency secondary reads. To learn more, see
:ref:`Global Writes Zones <global-writes-zones>`.

|service| does not auto-configure or auto-shard collections. You can
:ref:`shard global collections for global writes <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>`.
To use |global-write|, sharded collections must meet specific compatibility
requirements. To learn more, see :ref:`Global Cluster Sharding Reference <global-writes-collections>`.
