.. note::
   If you specify a callback method, ``findOne()`` returns nothing. If you do
   not specify one, this method returns a ``Promise`` that resolves to the
   result object when it completes. See our guide on :doc:`Promises and
   Callbacks </fundamentals/promises>` for more information, or the
   `API documentation <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#~resultcallback>`__ for
   information on the result object.

You can query for a single document in a collection with the
``collection.findOne()`` method. The ``findOne()`` method uses a query
document that you provide to match only the subset of the documents in the
collection that match the query. If you don't provide a query document or if
you provide an empty document, MongoDB matches all documents in the
collection. The ``findOne()`` operation only returns the first matched
document. For more information on querying MongoDB, see our
:doc:`documentation on query documents </fundamentals/crud/query-document>`.

You can also define additional query options such as
:doc:`sort </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>`
and :doc:`projection </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/project>`
to configure the returned document. You can specify the additional options
in the ``options`` object passed as the second parameter of the
``findOne`` method. For detailed reference documentation, see
`collection.findOne() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#findOne>`__.

Example
-------

The following snippet finds a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses the following parameters:

- A **query document** that configures the query to return only
  movies with the title of exactly the text ``'The Room'``.

- A **sort** that organizes matched documents in descending order by
  rating, so if our query matches multiple documents the returned
  document will be the document with the highest rating.

- A **projection** that explicitly excludes the ``_id`` field from
  returned documents and explicitly includes only the ``title`` and
  ``imdb`` object (and its embedded fields).
