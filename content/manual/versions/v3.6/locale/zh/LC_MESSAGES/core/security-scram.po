"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the default"
" authentication mechanism for MongoDB. SCRAM is based on the IETF `RFC "
"5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that defines best "
"practices for implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for "
"authenticating users with passwords."

"Using SCRAM, MongoDB verifies the supplied user credentials against the "
"user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password "
"<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database "
"<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database "
"where the user was created, and together with the user's name, serves to "
