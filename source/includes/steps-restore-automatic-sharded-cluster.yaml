  a. Choose the point from which you want to restore your backup.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 40 40
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Restore Type

          - Description

          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

          - Allows you to choose one
            :term:`stored snapshot <snapshot>`.

          - Select an existing :term:`snapshot` to restore.

        * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

          - Allows you to choose a date and time as your restore time
            objective for your snapshot. By default, the
            Oplog Store stores 24 hours of data.

            .. example::

               If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the
               restore is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

            .. important::

               - If you are restoring a sharded cluster that runs
                 |fcv-link| of 4.0 or earlier, you must :ref:`enable
                 cluster checkpoints <enable-cluster-checkpoints>` to
                 perform a |pit| restore on a sharded cluster.

                 If no checkpoints that include your date and time are
                 available, |mms| asks you to
                 :guilabel:`choose another point in time`.

               - You cannot perform a |pit| restore that covers any
                 time prior to the latest backup resync. For the
                 conditions that cause a resync, see
                 :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

          - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  c. If you are restoring a sharded cluster that runs |fcv-link| of 4.0
     or earlier and you chose :guilabel:`Point In Time`:

     i.  A list of :guilabel:`Checkpoints` closest to the time you
         selected appears.

     ii. To start your point in time restore, you may:

         - Choose one of the listed checkpoints, or
         - Click :guilabel:`Choose another point in time` to remove the
           list of checkpoints and select another date and time from
           the menus.

        :header-rows: 1

        * - Field
          - Action

          - Select a :term:`project` to which you want to restore the
            :term:`snapshot`.

        * - :guilabel:`Cluster to Restore to`
          - Select a :term:`cluster` to which you want to restore the
            snapshot.

            |mms| *must* manage the target sharded cluster.

            .. warning::
               Automation removes all existing data from the cluster.
               All backup data and snapshots for the existing cluster
               are preserved.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

     |mms| notes how much storage space the restore requires in its
     console.
