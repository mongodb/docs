================
Create a Cluster
================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

To get started, create a new group by entering the project name and
select "Fully Managed".

Sentence about only |service| clusters in |service| group. Probably
something about unique group name across |service| and self-managed
cloudmgr (if that is indeed the case?).

? Perhaps if there are any ramifications if you are already an
existing cloud mgr user, maybe a sentence about that. But I'm guessing not?


Explanation of stuff you select.  

Probably blurb that state that you have the ability to change xyz after
you have created the cluster and a blurb about what you cannot change. 
Add links to :doc:`/scale-cluster`.

.. important:: stuff about password

Payment
-------

Continue to payment. Whatever the relationship is to the billing info
in the :ref:`getting started <gs-configure-billing>` section.

Enter payment and Confirm deploy.


Next Steps
----------

While deploying, you can set up ip whitelist. Can only connect from
whitelisted ips.

For information on:

- setting up ip whitelist, see :doc:`/setup-cluster-security`.

- connecting to the cluster, see :doc:`/connect-to-cluster`.
