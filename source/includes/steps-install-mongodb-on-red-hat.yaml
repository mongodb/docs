title: Configure the package management system (``yum``).
stepnum: 2
ref: config-yum
pre: |
  Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.2.repo`` file so that
  you can install MongoDB directly, using ``yum``.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0

     .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-3.0-linux-package-repo-tutorial.rst

action:
  - heading: For the *latest* stable release of MongoDB
    pre: |
      Use the following repository file:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-org-3.2]
      name=MongoDB Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/{{distro_name}}/{{distro_release}}/mongodb-org/3.2/x86_64/
      gpgcheck=1
      enabled=1
  - heading: For versions of MongoDB *earlier* than 3.0
    pre: |
      To install the packages from an earlier :ref:`release series
      <release-version-numbers>`, such as 2.4 or 2.6, you can specify
      the release series in the repository configuration. For example,
      to restrict your system to the 2.6 release series, create a
      ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-2.6.repo`` file to hold the
      following configuration information for the MongoDB 2.6
      repository:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-org-2.6]
      name=MongoDB 2.6 Repository
      baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/
      gpgcheck=0
      enabled=1
post: |
  You can find ``.repo`` files for each release {{distro_link}}.
  Remember that odd-numbered minor release versions (e.g. 2.5) are development versions and are unsuitable
  for production use.
replacement:
  distro_name: "redhat"
  distro_link: "`in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/>`_"
  distro_release: "$releasever"

title: Install the MongoDB packages and associated tools.
stepnum: 3
ref: install
pre: |
  When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
  release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-to-version-yum.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``yum``
      will upgrade the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a package, add
      the following ``exclude`` directive to your ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools
...
