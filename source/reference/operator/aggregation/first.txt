====================
$first (aggregation)
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. group:: $first

   Returns the first value it encounters for its group.

   .. note::

      Only use :group:`$first` when the :pipeline:`$group` follows
      a :pipeline:`$sort` operation. Otherwise, the result of this
      operation is unpredictable.
