MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data. To
ensure consistency, MongoDB uses locking and :term:`concurrency control`
to prevent clients from modifying the same data simultaneously. Writes
to a single document occur either in full or not at all, and clients
always see consistent data.

What type of locking does MongoDB use?
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-general.rst

In addition to a shared (S) locking mode for reads and an exclusive
(X) locking mode for write operations, intent shared (IS) and intent
exclusive (IX) modes indicate an intent to read or write a resource
using a finer granularity lock. When locking at a certain granularity,
all higher levels are locked using an :term:`intent lock`.

For example, when locking a collection for writing (using mode X),
both the corresponding database lock and the global lock must be
locked in intent exclusive (IX) mode. A single database can
simultaneously be locked in IS and IX mode, but an exclusive (X)
lock cannot coexist with any other modes, and a shared (S) lock can
only coexist with intent shared (IS) locks.

Locks are fair, with lock requests for reads and writes queued in order.
However, to optimize throughput, when one lock request is granted, all
other compatible lock requests are granted at the same time, potentially
releasing the locks before a conflicting lock request is performed. For
example, consider a situation where an X lock was just released and the
conflict queue contains these locks:

IS |rarr| IS |rarr| X |rarr| X |rarr| S |rarr| IS

In strict first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering, only the first two
IS modes would be granted. Instead MongoDB will actually grant all
IS and S modes, and once they all drain, it will grant X, even if
new IS or S requests have been queued in the meantime. As a grant
will always move all other requests ahead in the queue, no starvation
of any request is possible.

In :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :method:`db.currentOp()` output, the
lock modes are represented as follows:

How granular are locks in MongoDB?
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-locks.rst

How do I see the status of locks on my :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For reporting on lock utilization information on locks, use any of these
methods:

- :method:`db.serverStatus()`,
- :method:`db.currentOp()`,
- :binary:`~bin.mongotop`,
- :binary:`~bin.mongostat`, and/or
- the |mms-home| or
  :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premises solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
  </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`

Specifically, the :serverstatus:`locks` document in the :ref:`output of
serverStatus <server-status-output>`, or the :data:`~currentOp.locks` 
field in the :method:`current operation reporting <db.currentOp>`
provides insight into the type of locks and amount of lock
contention in your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

In :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :method:`db.currentOp()` output, the
lock modes are represented as follows:

.. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

To terminate an operation, use :method:`db.killOp()`.

.. include:: /includes/replacement-mms.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-yielding:

Does a read or write operation ever yield the lock?
---------------------------------------------------

In some situations, read and write operations can yield their locks.

Long running read and write operations, such as queries, updates,
and deletes, yield locks under many conditions. MongoDB operations can
also yield locks between individual document modifications in write
operations that affect multiple documents.

For storage engines supporting document level :term:`concurrency
control`, such as :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, yielding is not
necessary when accessing storage as the :term:`intent locks <intent
lock>`, held at the global, database and collection level, do not block
other readers and writers. However, operations will periodically yield,
such as:

- to avoid long-lived storage transactions because these can
  potentially require holding a large amount of data in memory;

- to serve as interruption points so that you can kill long running
  operations;

- to allow operations that require exclusive access to a collection
  such as index/collection drops and creations.

.. _faq-concurrency-operations-locks:

What locks are taken by some common client operations?
------------------------------------------------------

The following table lists some operations and the types of locks they
use for document level locking storage engines:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operation

     - Database

     - Collection

   * - Issue a query

     - ``r`` (Intent Shared)

     - ``r`` (Intent Shared)

   * - Insert data

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

   * - Remove data

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

   * - Update data

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive)

   * - Perform Aggregation

     - ``r`` (Intent Shared)

     - ``r`` (Intent Shared)

   * - Create an index

     - 

     - ``W`` (Exclusive)

   * - List collections

     - ``r`` (Intent Shared)

     - 

   * - Map-reduce

     - ``W`` (Exclusive) and ``R`` (Shared)

     - ``w`` (Intent Exclusive) and ``r`` (Intent Shared)

.. note::
   Creating an index requires an exclusive (W) lock on a collection. 
   However, the lock is not retained for the full duration of the index 
   build process.

   For more information, see :ref:`<index-operations>`.

.. _faq-concurrency-database-lock:

Which administrative commands lock a database?
----------------------------------------------

Some administrative commands can exclusively lock a database for
extended time periods. For large clusters, consider
taking the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance offline so that clients are
not affected. For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongod` is part of a
:term:`replica set`, take the :binary:`~bin.mongod` offline and let
other members of the replica set process requests while maintenance is
performed.

Administrative Commands Taking Extended Locks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These administrative operations require an exclusive lock at the
database level for extended periods:

- :dbcommand:`cloneCollectionAsCapped` command
- :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command

In addition, the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command and corresponding
:method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` shell method take the
following locks:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command

     - Lock behavior


   * - :dbcommand:`renameCollection` database command

     - If renaming a collection within the same database, the
       :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command takes an exclusive (W) lock
       on the source and target collections.

       If the target namespace is in a different database as the source
       collection, The :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command takes an
       exclusive (W) lock on the target database when renaming a
       collection across databases and blocks other operations on that
       database until it finishes.

   * - :method:`~db.collection.renameCollection()` shell helper method

     - The :method:`~db.collection.renameCollection()` method takes an
       exclusive (W) lock on the source and target collections, and 
       cannot move a collection between databases.

.. _faq-concurrency-collection-lock:

Which administrative commands lock a collection?
------------------------------------------------

These administrative operations require an exclusive lock at the
collection level:

- The :dbcommand:`create` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.createCollection()` and :method:`db.createView()` shell
  methods.

- The :dbcommand:`createIndexes` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` and
  :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` shell methods. The build process 
  only holds an exclusive lock on the collection at the beginning and end of 
  the index build.

- The :dbcommand:`drop` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.collection.drop()` shell methods.

- The :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` and
  :method:`db.collection.dropIndexes()` shell methods.

- The :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` shell method take the
  following locks, depending on version:
  
  - For :dbcommand:`renameCollection` and
    :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()`: If renaming a
    collection within the same database, the operation takes an
    exclusive (W) lock on the source and target collections.

  - For :dbcommand:`renameCollection` *only*: If the target namespace
    is in a different database as the source collection, the operation takes an 
    exclusive (W) lock on the target database when renaming a collection
    across databases and blocks other operations on that database
    until it finishes.

- The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command and corresponding
  :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` shell method obtain an exclusive
  (W) lock on the collection and block other operations on the collection until 
  finished.

- The :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command takes an exclusive 
  (W) lock on the :data:`oplog <local.oplog.rs>` collection and 
  blocks other operations on the collection until it finishes.

.. _faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs:

Does a MongoDB operation ever lock more than one database?
----------------------------------------------------------

These MongoDB operations may obtain and hold a lock on more than one
database:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operation
     - Behavior

   * - | :dbcommand:`reIndex`
       | :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` 
     - These operations only obtain an exclusive (W) collection lock instead of 
       a global exclusive lock.

   * - :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
     - This operation obtains an exclusive (W) lock on the target database, 
       an intent shared (r) lock on the source database, and a shared (S) lock 
       on the source collection when renaming a collection across databases. 
       
       When renaming a collection in the same database, the operation only 
       requires exclusive (W) locks on the source and target collections.

   * - | :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`
     - This operation only obtains an exclusive (W) lock on the 
       :data:`oplog <local.oplog.rs>` collection instead of a global exclusive 
       lock.

How does sharding affect concurrency?
-------------------------------------

:term:`Sharding <sharding>` improves concurrency by distributing
collections over multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, allowing
shard servers (specifically, :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes) to run
concurrently with the downstream :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-sharding.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-replication:

How does concurrency affect a replica set primary?
--------------------------------------------------

With replica sets, when MongoDB writes to a collection on the
:term:`primary`, MongoDB also writes to the primary's :term:`oplog`,
which is a special collection in the ``local`` database. Therefore,
MongoDB must lock both the collection's database and the ``local``
database. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` must lock both databases at the same
time to keep the database consistent and ensure that write operations,
even with replication, are all or nothing operations.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-replica-set-primary.rst

How does concurrency affect secondaries?
----------------------------------------

In :term:`replication`, MongoDB does not apply writes serially to
:term:`secondaries <secondary>`. Secondaries collect oplog entries in
batches and then apply those batches in parallel. Writes are applied
in the order that they appear in the oplog.

Reads that :ref:`target secondaries <replica-set-read-preference>` read from
a :ref:`WiredTiger<storage-wiredtiger>` snapshot of the data if the
secondary is undergoing replication. This allows the read to occur
simultaneously with replication, while still guaranteeing a
consistent view of the data.

Does MongoDB support transactions?
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-faq.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst

What isolation guarantees does MongoDB provide?
-----------------------------------------------

Depending on the read concern, clients can see the results of writes
before the writes are :term:`durable`. To control whether the data read
may be rolled back or not, clients can use the ``readConcern`` option.

.. _faq-concurrency-lock-free-read-operations:

What are lock-free read operations?
-----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

A lock-free read operation runs immediately: it is not blocked when
another operation has an exclusive (X) write lock on the collection.

.. include:: /includes/lock-free-commands.rst
