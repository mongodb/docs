     |mms| can manage |tls-ssl| for you if you using Automation for
     the deployment. With Automation, |mms| prompts you for the
     certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you enable
     |tls-ssl| and then configures the agents appropriately.To learn
     how to configure |tls-ssl|, see

  must configure the Monitoring Agent to trust |onprem|.
