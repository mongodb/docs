Indexes on time series collections generally behave like indexes on
regular collections, but with several additional considerations and
limitations. 

.. include:: /includes/time-series-secondary-indexes-downgrade-FCV.rst

Starting in version 6.0, you can add a secondary index to any field in a
time series collection. MongoDB indexes time series collections by
:ref:`buckets <timeseries-bucketing>` of documents as opposed to individual
documents. Time series buckets contain documents with shared metaField values,
ordered by timeField values that are close together. MongoDB indexes the
minimum and maximum values of all fields, except the metaField. Indexing
buckets instead of individual documents reduces index size and improves query
efficiency.

.. tip::

   To improve query performance, you can manually :ref:`add secondary
   indexes <timeseries-add-secondary-index>` to any field in your time
   series collection.

Clustered Collection
--------------------

By default, MongoDB clusters time series collections based on bucket
time. 

Compound Indexes
----------------

.. versionadded:: 6.3

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, MongoDB creates a default  :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on both the metaField and timeField of a time
series collection. MongoDB uses this index to improve query performance
and speed. 

You can add a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on the
``timeField``, ``metaField``, or measurement fields.

Partial Indexes
---------------

.. versionadded:: 6.0

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use the :query:`$or`, :query:`$in`, and
:query:`$geoWithin` operators with :ref:`partial indexes
<index-type-partial>` on a time series collection.

You cannot create :ref:`partial indexes <index-type-partial>` on the
metaField and timeField. 


TTL Indexes
-----------

.. versionadded:: 7.0

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, you can create a :ref:`TTL <index-feature-ttl>`
index with a ``partialFilterExpression`` that relies only on the
metaField. In versions prior to 6.3, you can only create TTL indexes
based on the ``expireAfterSeconds`` parameter. 

If your time series collection doesn't use the ``expireAfterSeconds``
option to expire documents, creating a partial TTL index sets an
expiration time for matching documents only. If the collection uses
``expireAfterSeconds`` for all documents, you can use a partial TTL
index to expire matching documents sooner.

.. _timeseries--prohibited-index:

Prohibited Indexes
------------------

MongoDB does not allow the following index types on time series
collections:

- :ref:`Text indexes <index-type-text>`
- :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>`
- :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>`

You cannot create sparse indexes on the metaField.
