=========================
Delete Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. note::
   If you specify a callback method, ``deleteMany()`` returns nothing. If you 
   not specify one, this method returns a ``Promise`` that resolves to the
   result object when it completes. See our guide on :doc:`Promises and
   Callbacks </fundamentals/promises>` for more information, or the
   :node-api:`API documentation <Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpResult>` for
   information on the result object.

You can delete several documents in a collection at once using the
:node-api:`collection.deleteMany() <Collection.html#deleteMany>` method.
Pass a query document to the ``deleteMany()`` method to specify a subset
of documents in the collection to delete. If you do not provide a query
document (or if you provide an empty document), MongoDB matches all documents
in the collection and deletes them. While you can use ``deleteMany()``
to delete all documents in a collection, consider using
:node-api:`drop() <Collection.html#drop>` instead for better performance
and clearer code.

You can specify additional options in the ``options`` object passed in
the second parameter of the ``deleteMany()`` method. You can also pass a
callback method as the optional third parameter. For more detailed 
information, see the 
:node-api:`deleteMany() API documentation <Collection.html#deleteMany>`.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes multiple documents from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query to
match and delete movies with the title "Santa Claus".
