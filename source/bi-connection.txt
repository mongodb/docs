Multi-Cloud Cluster Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a :ref:`multi-cloud cluster <create-cluster-multi-region>`,
your |bic-short-no-link| connection string may include the cloud provider
type (``.gcp`` or ``.azure``). In the event of a failover in which nodes
on one cloud provider fail and requests are routed to nodes in another cloud
provider, your |bic-short-no-link| connection string may change.

To mitigate this hazard, add :ref:`analytics nodes <deploy-analytics-nodes>`
to clusters deployed only in one cloud provider and set the |bic-short-no-link|
:ref:`read preference <bic-read-preferences>` to :guilabel:`Analytics`.
This ensures that your connection string remains constant.
