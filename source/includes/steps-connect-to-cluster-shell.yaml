content: |

  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`group's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the group whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` modal under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of your client on the list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address. 
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
    
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| group being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.

title: "Select :guilabel:`Connect with the Mongo Shell`."
level: 4
ref: connect-details
content: |

  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays operating system-specific
  instructions for downloading the appropriate version of the :program:`mongo
  <bin.mongo>` shell for the |service| cluster, as well as the full command
  for connecting to the |service| cluster with the :program:`mongo
  <bin.mongo>` shell. 
  
  Follow the instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog to download and
  install the shell before continuing.
  
  Once you confirm you have the correct version of the :program:`mongo
  <bin.mongo>` shell, copy and paste the connection string into a terminal
  or command line interface. Do not execute the command yet.
  
  The connection string uses a MongoDB user set up for the group as the user
  to authenticate as. Update the ``<PASSWORD>`` placeholder with the password
  for this user. Once you have updated the ``PASSWORD``, you can execute the
  command to connect to the |service| cluster.
     
  To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the ``--username`` and
  ``--password`` parameters with the username and password of a different
  MongoDB user.
