  .. important::
   
     If you cancel a Developer or self-serve Pro support plan and
     later reactivate paid support, billing
     charges apply retroactively from the
     date that a non-Basic support plan was last active (up to 90
     days in the past) unless:

     - You cancel Developer support and activate self-serve Pro.
     - You cancel self-serve Pro support and activate Pro support that
       is tied to a subscription.

  To subscribe to the Enterprise support plan, to pay with an 
  alternative payment method, or for additional information about 
  support plans, :contact:`contact MongoDB </atlas?jmp=app-cta>`.
