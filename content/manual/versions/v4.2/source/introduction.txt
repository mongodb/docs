Document Database
-----------------

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed
of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON
objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,
and arrays of documents.

.. include:: /images/crud-annotated-document.rst

The advantages of using documents are:

- Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in
  many programming languages.

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

- Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

Collections/Views/On-Demand Materialized Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB stores documents in :ref:`collections <collections>`.
Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

In addition to collections, MongoDB supports:

- Read-only :doc:`/core/views` (Starting in MongoDB 3.4)

- :doc:`/core/materialized-views` (Starting in MongoDB 4.2).

Key Features
------------

High Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

- Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database
  system.

- Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded
  documents and arrays.

Rich Query Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports a rich query language to support :doc:`read and write
operations (CRUD) </crud>` as well as:

- :doc:`Data Aggregation </core/aggregation-pipeline>`

- :doc:`Text Search </text-search>` and :doc:`Geospatial Queries
  </tutorial/geospatial-tutorial>`.

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's replication facility, called :doc:`replica set
</replication>`, provides:

- *automatic* failover

- data redundancy.

A :doc:`replica set </replication>` is a group of
MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy
and increasing data availability.

Horizontal Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its *core*
functionality:

- :ref:`Sharding <sharding-introduction>` distributes data across a
  cluster of machines.

- Starting in 3.4, MongoDB supports creating :ref:`zones
  <zone-sharding>` of data based on the :term:`shard key`. In a
  balanced cluster, MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone
  only to those shards inside the zone. See the :ref:`zone-sharding`
  manual page for more information.


Support for Multiple Storage Engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports :doc:`multiple storage engines
</core/storage-engines>`:

- :doc:`/core/wiredtiger` (including support for
  :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest`)

- :doc:`/core/inmemory`.

In addition, MongoDB provides pluggable storage engine API that allows
third parties to develop storage engines for MongoDB.
