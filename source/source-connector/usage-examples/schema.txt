   :description: Configure your MongoDB Kafka source connector to apply a custom schema for consistent data structure in Kafka topics, ensuring reliable data formatting.

This usage example demonstrates how you can configure your {+source-connector+}
to apply a custom **schema** to your data. A schema is a
definition that specifies the structure and type information about data in an
{+kafka+} topic. Use a schema when you must ensure the data on the topic populated
by your source connector has a consistent structure.

To learn more about using schemas with the connector, see the 
:ref:`Apply Schemas <kafka-source-apply-schemas>` guide.

Example
-------

Suppose your application keeps track of customer data in a MongoDB
collection, and you want to publish this data to a Kafka topic. You want
the subscribers of the customer data to receive consistently formatted data.
You choose to apply a schema to your data.

Your requirements and your solutions are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Requirement
     - Solution

   * - Receive customer data from a MongoDB collection
     - | Configure a MongoDB source connector to receive updates to data 
         from a specific database and collection.
       | See :ref:`<usage-example-schema-read-collection>`.

   * - Provide the customer data schema
     - | Specify a schema that corresponds to the structure and data types of
         the customer data.
       | See :ref:`<usage-example-schema-custom-schema>`.

   * - Omit Kafka metadata from the customer data
     - | Include only the data from the ``fullDocument`` field.
       | See :ref:`<usage-example-schema-omit-metadata>`.

For the full configuration file that meets the requirements above, see
:ref:`<usage-example-schema-config>`.

.. _usage-example-schema-read-collection:

Receive Data from a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure your source connector to receive data from a MongoDB collection,
specify the database and collection name. For this example, you can
configure the connector to read from the ``purchases`` collection in the
``customers`` database as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

   database=customers
   collection=purchases

.. _usage-example-schema-custom-schema:

Create a Custom Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample customer data document from your collection contains the following
information:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/source-connector/usage-examples/customer.json
   :language: json

From the sample document, you decide your schema should present the fields
using the following data types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 30 45

   * - Field name
     - Data types
     - Description

   * - **name**
     - `string <https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#schema_primitive>`__
     - | Name of the customer

   * - **visits**
     - `array <https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Arrays>`__
       of `timestamps <https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Timestamp+%28millisecond+precision%29>`__
     - Dates the customer visited

   * - **goods_purchased**
     - `map <https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Maps>`__
       of string (the assumed type) to
       `integer <https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#schema_primitive>`__
       values
     - Names of goods and quantity of each item the customer purchased

You can describe your data using the {+avro-long+} schema format as shown in
the example schema below:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/source-connector/usage-examples/customers.avro
   :language: json

.. include:: /includes/schema-converter-important.rst

.. _usage-example-schema-omit-metadata:

Omit Metadata from Published Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The connector publishes the customer data documents and metadata
that describes the document to a Kafka topic. You can set the connector to
include only the document data contained in the ``fullDocument`` field of the
record using the following setting:

.. code-block:: ini

   publish.full.document.only=true

For more information on the ``fullDocument`` field, see the 
:ref:`Change Streams <source-connector-fundamentals-change-event>` guide.

.. _usage-example-schema-config:

Specify the Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your custom schema connector configuration should resemble the following:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/source-connector/usage-examples/schema.properties
   :language: properties
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6,7

.. note:: Embedded Schema

   In the preceding configuration, the {+json-schema-converter+} embeds the custom
   schema in your messages. To learn more about the JSON Schema converter, see the
   :ref:`Converters <json-schema-converter-sample-properties>` guide.

For more information on specifying schemas, see the :ref:`Apply
Schemas <kafka-source-apply-schemas>` guide.
