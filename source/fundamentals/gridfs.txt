Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB by using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification that describes how
to split files into chunks during storage and reassemble them during retrieval.
The {+driver-short+} implementation of GridFS manages the operations and
organization of the file storage.

Use GridFS if the size of your file exceeds the BSON document size limit of
16 MB. GridFS also helps you access files without loading the entire file into
memory. For more detailed information about whether GridFS is suitable for your
use case, see the :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` page in the Server manual.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, which is a group of MongoDB collections
containing file chunks and descriptive information. Buckets contain the
following collections, named according to the convention defined in the GridFS
specification:

- ``chunks``, which stores the binary file chunks
- ``files``, which stores the file metadata

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the {+driver-short+} performs the following
actions:

- Creates the ``chunks`` and ``files`` collections, prefixed with the default bucket
  name ``fs``, unless you specify a different name

- Creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient retrieval of files and related
  metadata

You can create a reference to a GridFS bucket by following the steps in the :ref:`rust-gridfs-create`
section of this page. However, the driver does not create a new GridFS bucket and its
indexes until the first write operation. For more information on GridFS indexes, see the
:manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>` page in the Server manual.

When storing a file in a GridFS bucket, the {+driver-short+} creates the following documents:

- One document in the ``files`` collection that stores a unique file ID, file name, and other
  file metadata
  
- One or more documents in the ``chunks`` collection that store the content of the file, which
  the driver splits into smaller pieces
	 
The following diagram describes how GridFS splits files when uploading to a bucket:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files`` collection in the
specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct the file from documents in the
``chunks`` collection. You can read the file into memory or output it to a stream.

.. _rust-gridfs-create:

Reference a GridFS Bucket
-------------------------

Before storing files in a GridFS bucket, create a bucket reference or get a reference to
an existing bucket. 

The following example calls the ``gridfs_bucket()`` method on a database instance, which
creates a reference to either a new or existing GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-create
   :end-before: end-create
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

You can specify a custom bucket name by setting the ``bucket_name`` field of the
``GridFsBucketOptions`` struct.

.. note:: Instantiating Structs
   
   The {+driver-short+} implements the Builder design pattern for the
   creation of some struct types, including ``GridFsBucketOptions``. You can
   use the ``builder()`` method to construct an instance of each type
   by chaining option builder methods.

The following table describes the methods that you can use to set ``GridFsBucketOptions``
fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 2
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Possible Values 
     - Description

   * - | ``bucket_name()``
     - | Any ``String`` value
     - | Specifies a bucket name, which is set to ``fs`` by default
       
   * - ``chunk_size_bytes()``
     - Any ``u32`` value
     - Specifies the chunk size used to break the file into chunks, which is 255 KB by default

   * - | ``write_concern()``
     - | ``WriteConcern::w``,
       | ``WriteConcern::w_timeout``,
       | ``WriteConcern::journal``
     - | Specifies the bucket's write concern, which is set to the database's write concern by default

   * - ``read_concern()``
     - ``ReadConcernLevel::Local``,
       ``ReadConcernLevel::Majority``,
       ``ReadConcernLevel::Linearizable``,
       ``ReadConcernLevel::Available``,
       ``ReadConcernLevel::Snapshot``
     - Specifies the bucket's read concern, which is set to the database's read concern by default

   * - | ``selection_criteria()``
     - | ``SelectionCriteria::ReadPreference``,
       | ``SelectionCriteria::Predicate``
     - | Specifies which servers are suitable for a bucket operation, which is set to the database's selection
       | criteria by default

The following example specifies options in a ``GridFsBucketOptions`` instance to configure
a custom bucket name and a five-second time limit for write operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-create-opts
   :end-before: end-create-opts
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-gridfs-upload:

Upload Files
------------

You can upload a file to a GridFS bucket by opening an upload stream and 
writing your file to the stream. Call the ``open_upload_stream()`` method on
your bucket instance to open the stream. This method returns an instance of
``GridFsUploadStream`` to which you can write the file contents. To upload
the file contents to the ``GridFsUploadStream``, call the ``write_all()`` method
and pass your file bytes as a parameter.

.. tip:: Import the Required Module
   
   The ``GridFsUploadStream`` struct implements the ``futures_io::AsyncWrite`` trait.
   To use the ``AsyncWrite`` write methods, such as ``write_all()``, import the 
   ``AsyncWriteExt`` module into your application file with the following use
   declaration:

   .. code-block:: rust

      use futures_util::io::AsyncWriteExt;

The following example uses an upload stream to upload a file called ``"example.txt"``
to a GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-upload
   :end-before: end-upload
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-gridfs-download:

Download Files
--------------

You can download a file from a GridFS bucket by opening a download stream and
reading from the stream. Call the ``open_download_stream()`` method on
your bucket instance, specifying the desired file's ``_id`` value as a parameter.
This method returns an instance ``GridFsDownloadStream`` from which you can access
the file. To read the file from the ``GridFsDownloadStream``, call the ``read_to_end()``
method and pass a vector as a parameter.

.. tip:: Import the Required Module
   
   The ``GridFsDownloadStream`` struct implements the ``futures_io::AsyncRead`` trait.
   To use the ``AsyncRead`` read methods, such as ``read_to_end()``, import the 
   ``AsyncReadExt`` module into your application file with the following use
   declaration:

   .. code-block:: rust

      use futures_util::io::AsyncReadExt;

The following example uses a download stream to download a file with an ``_id`` value
of  ``3289`` from a GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-download
   :end-before: end-download
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. note::

   The GridFS streaming API cannot load partial chunks. When a download
   stream needs to pull a chunk from MongoDB, it pulls the entire chunk
   into memory. The 255 KB default chunk size is usually sufficient, but
   you can reduce the chunk size to reduce memory overhead.

.. _rust-gridfs-retrieve:

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

You can retrieve information about the files stored in the ``files`` collection of
the GridFS bucket. Each file is stored as an instance of the ``FilesCollectionDocument``
type, which includes the following fields that represent file information:

- ``_id``: the file ID
- ``length``: the file size
- ``chunk_size_bytes``: the size of the file's chunks
- ``upload_date``: the file's upload date and time
- ``filename``: the name of the file
- ``metadata``: a document that stores user-specified metadata

Call the ``find()`` method on a GridFS bucket instance to retrieve
files from the bucket. The method returns a cursor instance
from which you can access the results.

The following example retrieves and prints the length of each file in a GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-retrieve
   :end-before: end-retrieve
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``find()`` method, see the :ref:`rust-retrieve-guide`
   guide. To learn more about retrieving data from a cursor, see the :ref:`rust-cursor-guide`
   guide.

.. _rust-gridfs-rename:

Rename Files
------------

You can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by calling the ``rename()`` method
on a bucket instance. Pass the target file's ``_id`` value and the new file name as
parameters to the ``rename()`` method.

.. note::
   The ``rename()`` method only supports updating the name of one file at
   a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the
   file name from the bucket, extract the ``_id`` field from the files you
   want to rename, and pass each value in separate calls to the ``rename()``
   method.

The following example updates the ``filename`` field of the file containing an ``_id`` value
of ``3289`` to ``"new_file_name"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-rename
   :end-before: end-rename
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-gridfs-delete:

Delete Files
------------

You can use the ``delete()`` method to remove a file from your bucket. To remove a
file, call ``delete()`` on your bucket instance and pass the file's ``_id`` value
as a parameter.

.. note::

   The ``delete()`` method only supports deleting one file at a time. To
   delete multiple files, retrieve the files from the bucket, extract
   the ``_id`` field from the files you want to delete, and pass each ``_id``
   value in separate calls to the ``delete()`` method.

The following example deletes the file in which the value of the ``_id`` field is
``3289``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-delete-file
   :end-before: end-delete-file
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-gridfs-drop:

Delete a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

You can use the ``drop()`` method to delete a bucket, which removes a bucket's
``files`` and ``chunks`` collections. To delete the bucket, call ``drop()`` on
your bucket instance.

The following example deletes a GridFS bucket:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.rs
   :start-after: start-delete-bucket
   :end-before: end-delete-bucket
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:
