Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a sharded cluster. This procedure
uses :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to create dumps of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance. An alternate procedure uses file system snapshots to capture
the backup data, and may be more efficient in some situations if your
system configuration allows file system backups. See
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots`.

See :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups` for a full higher level overview
of backing up a sharded cluster as well as links to other tutorials that
provide alternate procedures.

Procedure
---------

In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup
up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each
shard in the cluster using :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to capture the backup
data. If you need an exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will
need to stop all application writes before taking the filesystem
snapshots; otherwise the snapshot will only approximate a moment of
time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can improve the quality
of the backup while minimizing impact on the cluster by taking the
backup from a secondary member of the replica set that provides each
shard.

1. Disable the :term:`balancer` process that equalizes the
   distribution of data among the :term:`shards <shard>`. To disable
   the balancer, use the :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` method in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, and see the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

   .. warning::

      It is essential that you stop the balancer before creating
      backups. If the balancer remains active, your resulting backups
      could have duplicate data or miss some data, as :term:`chunks
      <chunk>` migrate while recording backups.

#. Lock one member of each replica set in each shard so that your
   backups reflect the state of your database at the nearest possible
   approximation of a single moment in time. Lock these
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in as short of an interval as possible.

   To lock or freeze a sharded cluster, you must:

   - Shutdown one member of each replica set.

     Ensure that the :term:`oplog` has sufficient capacity to allow
     these secondaries to catch up to the state of the primaries after
     finishing the backup procedure. See
     :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` for more information.

   - Shutdown one of the :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`, to
     prevent all metadata changes during the backup process.

#. Use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to backup one of the :ref:`config servers
   <sharding-config-server>`. This backs up the cluster's
   metadata. You only need to back up one config server, as they all
   hold the same data.

   Issue this command against one of the config :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances or via the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongodump --journal --db config

#. Back up the replica set members of the shards that shut down using
   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and specifying the :option:`--dbpath <mongodump --dbpath>`
   option. You may back up the shards in parallel. Consider the
   following invocation:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongodump --journal --dbpath /data/db/ --out /data/backup/

   You must run this command on the system where the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   ran. This operation will use journaling and create a dump of the
   entire :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with data files stored in
   ``/data/db/``. :binary:`~bin.mongodump` will write the output of this
   dump to the ``/data/backup/`` directory.

#. Restart all stopped replica set members of each shard as normal and
   allow them to catch up with the state of the primary.

#. Re-enable the balancer with the :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`
   method.

   Use the following command sequence when connected to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(true)
