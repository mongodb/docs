   When starting *each* :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specify the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` settings either via a configuration file or the
   command line.

  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: Configuration File
        :tabid: config-file

        If using a configuration file, set:

        .. code-block:: yaml

           sharding:
             clusterRole: configsvr
           replication:
             replSetName: <replica set name>
           net:
             bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

        - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` to ``configsvr``, 

        - :setting:`replication.replSetName` to the desired name of the
          config server replica set,

        - :setting:`net.bindIp` option to the hostname/ip address or
          comma-delimited list of hostnames or ip addresses that remote
          clients (including the other members of the config server
          replica set as well as other members of the sharded cluster)
          can use to connect to the instance.

          .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

        - Additional settings as appropriate to your deployment, such as
          :setting:`storage.dbPath` and :setting:`net.port`. For more
          information on the configuration file, see :doc:`configuration
          options</reference/configuration-options>`.

        Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``--config`` option
        set to the configuration file path.

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --config <path-to-config-file>

     .. tab:: Command Line
        :tabid: command-line

        If using the command line options, start the
        :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``--configsvr``, ``--replSet``,
        ``--bind_ip``, and other options as appropriate to your
        deployment. For example:

        .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

        .. code-block:: bash

           mongod --configsvr --replSet <replica set name> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

        For more information on startup parameters, see the
        :binary:`~bin.mongod` reference page.

  Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to one of the config server 
  members.

title: Initiate the replica set.
level: 4
ref: csrs-initiate
pre: |

  From :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, run the :method:`rs.initiate()` method.

  :method:`rs.initiate()` can take an optional :doc:`replica set
  configuration document </reference/replica-configuration>`. In the
  :doc:`replica set configuration document
  </reference/replica-configuration>`, include:

  - The :rsconf:`_id` set to the replica set name specified in either
    the :setting:`replication.replSetName` or the ``--replSet`` option.

  - The :rsconf:`configsvr` field  set to ``true`` for the config server replica set.

  - The :rsconf:`members` array with a document per each member of the replica set.

   See :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` for more information on 
   replica set configuration documents.

   .. note::

      The :method:`rs.initiate` command may take a few seconds to complete.
      To use the config server replica set (CSRS) in this procedure, you must wait
      until it completes its initialization.  If the CSRS has not initialized, you 
      will see ``NotYetInitialized`` errors when you try to perform operations on a
      CSRS member.
