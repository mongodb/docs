object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: background
type: Boolean
position: 1
description: |
  Builds the index in the background so that building an index does
  *not* block other database activities. Specify ``true`` to build in
  the background. The default value is ``false``.

object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: unique
type: Boolean
position: 2
description: |
  Creates a unique index so that the collection will not accept
  insertion of documents where the index key or keys match an existing
  value in the index. Specify ``true`` to create a unique index. The
  default value is ``false``. This option applies only to ascending/descending
  indexes.

object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: name
type: string
position: 3
description: |
  The name of the index. If unspecified, MongoDB generates an index name
  by concatenating the names of the indexed fields and the sort order.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: dropDups
type: Boolean
position: 4
description: |
  Creates a unique index on a field that *may* have duplicates. MongoDB
  indexes only the first occurrence of a key and **removes** all
  documents from the collection that contain subsequent occurrences of
  that key. Specify ``true`` to create unique index. The default value
  is ``false``. This option applies only to scalar indexes.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: sparse
type: Boolean
position: 5
description: |
  If ``true``, the index only references documents with the specified
  field. These indexes use less space but behave differently in some
  situations (particularly sorts). The default value is ``false``. This
  applies only to ascending/descending indexes.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: expireAfterSeconds
type: integer
position: 6
description: |
  Specifies a value, in seconds, as a :term:`TTL` to control how long
  MongoDB retains documents in this collection. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` for more information on this
  functionality. This applies only to :term:`TTL` indexes.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: v
type: index version
position: 7
description: |
  The index version number. The default index version depends on the
  version of :program:`mongod` running when creating the index. Before
  version 2.0, the this value was 0; versions 2.0 and later use version
  1, which provides a smaller and faster index format. Specify a
  different index version *only* in unusual situations.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: weights
type: document
position: 8
description: |
  For ``text`` indexes, the significance of the field relative to the
  other indexed fields. The document contains field and weight pairs.
  The weight is a number ranging from 1 to 99,999 and denotes the
  significance of the field relative to the other indexed fields in
  terms of the score. You can specify weights for some or all the
  indexed fields. See :doc:`/tutorial/control-results-of-text-search` to
  adjust the scores. The default value is ``1``. This applies to
  ``text`` indexes only.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: default_language
type: string
position: 9
description: |
  For a ``text`` index, the language that determines the list of stop
  words and the rules for the stemmer and tokenizer. See
  :ref:`text-search-languages` for the available languages and
  :doc:`/tutorial/specify-language-for-text-index` for more information
  and examples. The default value is ``english``. This applies to
  ``text`` indexes only.
---
object:
  name: db.collection.ensureIndex()
  type: method
field:
  optional: true
  type: param
name: language_override
type: string
position: 10
description: |
  For a ``text`` index, specify the name of the field in the document
  that contains, for that document, the language to override the default
  language. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/create-text-index-on-multi-language-collection`. The
  default value is ``language``.
