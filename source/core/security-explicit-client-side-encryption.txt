Overview
--------

MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, and the MongoDB
4.2 or later legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell support explicitly
encrypting or decrypting fields with a specific data encryption key and
encryption algorithm.

Applications must modify any code associated with constructing read and
write operations to include encryption/decryption logic via the driver
encryption library. Applications are responsible for selecting the
appropriate data encryption key for encryption/decryption on a
per-operation basis.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the following methods for 
performing explicit encryption and decryption:

- :method:`getClientEncryption()`
- :method:`ClientEncryption.encrypt()`
- :method:`ClientEncryption.decrypt()`

MongoDB 4.2+ compatible drivers have specific syntax for performing
explicit client-side field level encryption. See
:ref:`field-level-encryption-drivers` for a complete list of
4.2+ compatible drivers with support for client-side field
level encryption. Defer to the documentation for your preferred
driver for specific instructions on performing client-side field
level encryption.

The following operation issued from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
explicitly encrypts the ``taxid`` field as part of a write operation.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   clientEncryption = encryptedClient.getClientEncryption()

   db.getSiblingDB("hr").getCollection("employees").insertOne({
     "name" : "J. Doe",
     "taxid" : clientEncryption.encrypt(
         UUID("64e2d87d-f168-493c-bbdf-a394535a2cb9"),
         "123-45-6789",
         "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
      )
   })

The following operation issued from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
explicitly encrypts the ``taxid`` field as part of a read operation:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   encrypt = encryptedClient.getClientEncryption()

   db.getSiblingDB("hr").getCollection("employees").findOne({
     "taxid" : clientEncryption.encrypt(
        UUID("64e2d87d-f168-493c-bbdf-a394535a2cb9"),
        "123-45-6789",
        "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
      )
   })

These operations assumes that the database connection
:ref:`configuration <mongo-connection-client-side-encryption-enabled>`
specified a key vault and key management service with access to the
specified data encryption key *and* its associated customer master key.

For read operations that returns encrypted fields, the driver/shell
:ref:`automatically decrypts
<field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption>` the encrypted values
*only if* the driver/shell was configured with access to the keys used
to protect those values.

Enabling Explicit Client-Side Field Level Encryption
----------------------------------------------------

Each official MongoDB 4.2+ compatible driver introduces new
functionality for supporting client-side field level encryption and data
encryption key management. Defer to your preferred
:ref:`driver's documentation <field-level-encryption-drivers>` for
language-specific instructions on implementing explicit client-side
field level encryption.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` adds an additional
option to the :method:`Mongo()` method for instantiating a database
connection with explicit client-side field level encryption. 
For a complete example, see 
:ref:`mongo-connection-client-side-encryption-enabled`.

Applications must specify the following components when instantiating
the database connection to enable explicit client-side field level
encryption:

- A :ref:`key vault <field-level-encryption-keyvault>` of data
  encryption keys. The key vault can reside on either a remote MongoDB
  cluster *or* the MongoDB cluster storing client-side encrypted data.  

- A supported :ref:`Key Management Service (KMS) 
  <field-level-encryption-kms>` provider used to manage Customer Master
  Keys (CMK). MongoDB encrypts all data encryption keys using the
  specified CMK *prior* to storing them in the key vault, leaving only
  metadata unencrypted.
  
  4.2+ compatible drivers, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, and the MongoDB 4.2
  or later legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell need access to the KMS to
  encrypt and decrypt protected fields *or* to create new data
  encryption keys.

Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement
----------------------------------------------

The MongoDB 4.2 server supports using :doc:`schema validation
</core/schema-validation>` to enforce encryption of specific fields in a
collection. If the collection validation :query:`$jsonSchema`
requires encryption for a field, clients performing explicit (manual)
field level encryption **must** 
:method:`encrypt <ClientEncryption.encrypt()>` that field.

For complete documentation on server-side client-side field level
encryption enforcement, see
:ref:`field-level-encryption-enforce-schema`.
