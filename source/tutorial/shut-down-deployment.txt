===========================
Shut Down a MongoDB Process
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| supports shutting down individual :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` processes, as well as :term:`replica sets <replica set>`
and :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. When you shut down a
process, cluster, or replica set, |mms| continues to manage it, even
though it is not running.

You can later :doc:`restart </tutorial/restart-deployment>` your
processes, or, if you no longer want |mms| to manage them, you can
:doc:`remove </tutorial/unmanage-deployment>` them.
