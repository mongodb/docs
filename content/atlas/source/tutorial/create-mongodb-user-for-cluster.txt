You must create a database user to access your cluster. For
security purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB
database users to access clusters.

Database users are separate from |service| users:

- Database users can access databases hosted in |service|.

- |service| users can log in to |service| but do not have access to
  MongoDB databases.

Required Access
---------------

To create a database user, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
the project.


Procedure
---------

You created a database user when you created your first {+cluster+}.

To manage the database users on your {+cluster+}, see 
:doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users/`.

To learn more about the security features available, see 
:ref:`setup-cluster-security`.

Next steps
----------

Now that you have a database user for your cluster, proceed to 
:doc:`/security/add-ip-address-to-list`.
