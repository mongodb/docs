Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to run a series of operations that do
not apply until all data changes are successful. If any operation in the
transaction fails, the driver cancels the transaction and discards all data
changes without ever becoming visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
session is a grouping of related
read or write operations that you intend to run sequentially. With sessions, you can
enable :manual:`causal consistency
</core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#causal-consistency>` for a
group of operations, and run :website:`ACID transactions
</basics/acid-transactions>`. MongoDB guarantees that the data involved in your
transaction operations remains consistent, even if the operations encounter
unexpected errors.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a ``MongoClient``
instance as a ``ClientSession`` type. We recommend that you reuse your client for
multiple sessions and transactions instead of instantiating a new client each
time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``ClientSession`` only with the ``MongoClient`` (or associated
   ``MongoDatabase`` or ``MongoCollection``) that created it. Using a ``ClientSession`` with
   a different ``MongoClient`` results in operation errors.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` and ``sample_mflix.movies`` collections
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>`.

Transaction Methods
-------------------

Create a ``ClientSession`` by using the ``startSession()`` method on your ``MongoClient``
instance. You can then modify the session state by using the methods provided by
the ``ClientSession``. The following table details the methods you can use to
manage your transaction:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1
 
   * - Method
     - Description
 
   * - ``startTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on
         this session. Throws an exception if there is already
         a transaction in progress for the session. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>`  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
 
   * - ``abortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Throws an exception
         if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction is already committed or ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>`  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
 
   * - ``commitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Throws an exception
         if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>`  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. tip:: Transaction Timeout

   You can set a limit on amount of time that operations can take
   to complete in your transactions. To learn more, see the
   :ref:`java-rs-csot-transaction` section of the Limit Server Execution
   Time guide.

Transaction Example
-------------------

The following example demonstrates how to create a session, create a
transaction, and insert documents into multiple collections in one transaction.
The code executes the following steps:

1. Creates a session from the client by using the ``startSession()`` method
#. Starts a transaction by using the ``startTransaction()`` method
#. Inserts documents into the ``restaurants`` and ``movies`` collections
#. Commits the transaction by using the ``commitTransaction()`` method

      If you're using {+mdb-server+} v8.0 or later, you can perform
      write operations on multiple namespaces within a single
      transaction by using bulk write operations. To learn more, see the
      :ref:`java-rs-client-bulk-write` section of the Bulk Write
      Operations guide.
