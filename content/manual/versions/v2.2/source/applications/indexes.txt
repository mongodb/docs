This document provides strategies for indexing in MongoDB. For
fundamentals of MongoDB indexing, see :doc:`/core/indexes`. For
operational guidelines and procedures, see
:doc:`/administration/indexes`.

Strategies
----------

The best indexes for your application are based on a number of factors,
including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to writes,
and the amount of free memory on your system.

When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep
understanding of:

- The application's queries.

- The relative frequency of each query in the application.

- The current indexes created for your collections.

- Which indexes the most common queries use.

The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety
of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be
running in production to see which configurations perform best.

MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given
operation. However, each clause of an :query:`$or` query may use
a different index.

.. _indexes-create-to-match-queries:

Create Indexes to Support Your Queries
--------------------------------------

If you only ever query on a single key in a given collection, then you need
to create just one single-key index for that collection. For example, you
might create an index on ``category`` in the ``product`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "category": 1 } )

However, if you sometimes query on only one key and at other times
query on that key combined with a second key, then creating a
:ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` is more efficient. MongoDB
will use the compound index for both queries. For example, you might
create an index on both ``category`` and ``item``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "category": 1, "item": 1 } )

This allows you both options. You can query on just ``category``, and
you also can query on ``category`` combined with ``item``.
(To query on multiple keys and sort the results, see :ref:`index-sort`.)

With the exception of queries that use the :query:`$or` operator, a
query does not use multiple indexes. A query uses only one index.

.. _compound-key-indexes:
.. _indexes-compound-key-indexes:

Use Compound Indexes to Support Several Different Queries
---------------------------------------------------------

A single :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on multiple fields
can support all the queries that search a "prefix" subset of those fields.

.. example::

   The following index on a collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }

   Can support queries that the following indexes support:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1 }
      { x: 1, y: 1 }

   There are some situations where the prefix indexes may offer better
   query performance: for example if ``z`` is a large array.

   The ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index can also support many of the same
   queries as the following index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1, z: 1 }

   Also, ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` has an additional use. Given the following
   query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { x: 5 } ).sort( { z: 1} )

   The ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` index supports both the query and the sort
   operation, while the ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index only supports
   the query. For more information on sorting, see
   :ref:`sorting-with-indexes`.

.. _covered-queries:
.. _indexes-covered-queries:

Create Indexes that Support Covered Queries
-------------------------------------------

A covered query is a query in which:

- all the fields in the :ref:`query <read-operations-query-document>`
  are part of an index, **and**

- all the fields returned in the results are in the same index.

Because the index "covers" the query, MongoDB can both match the
:ref:`query conditions <read-operations-query-document>` **and** return
the results using only the index; MongoDB does not need to look at
the documents, only the index, to fulfill the query.

Querying *only* the index can be much faster than querying documents
outside of the index. Index keys are typically smaller than the
documents they catalog, and indexes are typically available in RAM or
located sequentially on disk.

MongoDB automatically uses an index that covers a query when possible.
To ensure that an index can *cover* a query, create an index that
includes all the fields listed in the :ref:`query document
<read-operations-query-document>` and in the query result. You can
specify the fields to return in the query results with a
:ref:`projection <projection>` document. By default, MongoDB includes
the ``_id`` field in the query result. So, if the index does **not**
include the ``_id`` field, then you must exclude the ``_id`` field
(i.e. ``_id: 0``) from the query results.

Consider the following example where the collection ``user`` has
an index on the fields ``user`` and ``status``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { status: 1, user: 1 }

Then, the following query which queries on the ``status`` field and
returns only the ``user`` field is covered:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.find( { status: "A" }, { user: 1, _id: 0 } )

However, the following query that uses the index to match documents is
**not** covered by the index because it returns both the ``user`` field
**and** the ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.find( { status: "A" }, { user: 1 } )

An index **cannot** cover a query if:

- any of the indexed fields in any of the documents in the collection
  includes an array. If an indexed field is an array, the index becomes
  a :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multikey>` index and cannot
  support a covered query.

- any of the indexed fields are fields in subdocuments. To index fields
  in subdocuments, use :term:`dot notation`. For example, consider
  a collection ``users`` with documents of the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { _id: 1, user: { login: "tester" } }

  The collection has the following indexes:

  .. code-block:: none

     { user: 1 }

     { "user.login": 1 }

  The ``{ user: 1 }`` index covers the following query:

  .. code-block:: none

     db.users.find( { user: { login: "tester" } }, { user: 1, _id: 0 } )

  However, the ``{ "user.login": 1 }`` index does **not** cover the
  following query:

  .. code-block:: none

     db.users.find( { "user.login": "tester" }, { "user.login": 1, _id: 0 } )

  The query, however, does use the ``{ "user.login": 1 }`` index to
  find matching documents.

To determine whether a query is a covered query, use the
:method:`~cursor.explain()` method. If the :method:`~cursor.explain()`
output displays ``true`` for the :data:`~explain.indexOnly` field, the query is
covered by an index, and MongoDB queries only that index to match the
query **and** return the results.

For more information see :ref:`indexes-measuring-use`.

.. _index-sort:
.. _sorting-with-indexes:

Use Indexes to Sort Query Results
---------------------------------

For the fastest performance when sorting query results by a given field,
create a sorted index on that field.

To sort query results on multiple fields, create a :ref:`compound
index <index-type-compound>`. MongoDB sorts results based on the field
order in the index. For queries that include a sort that uses a
compound index, ensure that all fields before the first sorted field
are equality matches.

.. example::

   If you create the following index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1 }

   The following query and sort operations can use the index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().sort( { a:1 } )
      db.collection.find().sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:4 } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:5 } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5 } ).sort( { b:1, c:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5, c:4, b:3 } ).sort( { d:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a: { $gt:4 } } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { a: { $gt:5 } } ).sort( { a:1, b:1 } )

      db.collection.find( { a:5, b:3, d:{ $gt:4 } } ).sort( { c:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { a:5, b:3, c:{ $lt:2 }, d:{ $gt:4 } } ).sort( { c:1 } )

   However, the following queries cannot sort the results using the
   index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().sort( { b:1 } )
      db.collection.find( { b:5 } ).sort( { b:1 } )

.. note::

   For in-memory sorts that do not use an index, the :method:`sort()
   <cursor.sort()>` operation is significantly slower. The
   :method:`~cursor.sort()` operation will abort when it uses 32
   megabytes of memory.

.. _indexes-ensure-indexes-fit-ram:

Ensure Indexes Fit RAM
----------------------

For the fastest processing, ensure that your indexes fit entirely in RAM so
that the system can avoid reading the index from disk.

To check the size of your indexes, use the
:method:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` helper, which returns data in
bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.collection.totalIndexSize()
   4294976499

The above example shows an index size of almost 4.3 gigabytes. To ensure
this index fits in RAM, you must not only have more than that much RAM
available but also must have RAM available for the rest of the
:term:`working set`. Also remember:

If you have and use multiple collections, you must consider the size
of all indexes on all collections. The indexes and the working set must be able to
fit in memory at the same time.

There are some limited cases where indexes do not need
to fit in memory. See :ref:`indexing-right-handed`.

.. seealso:: For additional :doc:`collection statistics
   </reference/collection-statistics>`, use :dbcommand:`collStats` or
   :method:`db.collection.stats()`.

.. _indexing-right-handed:

Indexes that Hold Only Recent Values in RAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the
value of the indexed field increments with every insert, and most queries
select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the
parts of the index that hold the most recent or "right-most" values in
RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write
operations and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the
index.

.. _index-selectivity:

Create Queries that Ensure Selectivity
--------------------------------------

Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index.
Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index
for a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query.

To ensure selectivity,
write queries that limit the number of possible documents with the
indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately selective relative
to your indexed data.

.. example::

   Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values
   are ``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status``
   you've created a low-selectivity index. The index will
   be of little help in locating records.

   A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a
   :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the
   low-selectivity field and another field. For example, you could
   create a compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``

   Another option, again depending on your use case, might be to use
   separate collections, one for each status.

.. example::

   Consider an index ``{ a : 1 }`` (i.e. an index on the key ``a``
   sorted in ascending order) on a collection where ``a`` has three
   values evenly distributed across the collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ab" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "cd" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ef" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "jk" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "lm" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "no" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "pq" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "rs" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "tv" }

   If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: "no" }`` MongoDB must scan 3
   :term:`documents <document>` in the collection to return the one
   matching result. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: { $gt: 1}, b: "tv" }``
   must scan 6 documents, also to return one result.

   Consider the same index on a collection where ``a`` has *nine* values
   evenly distributed across the collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 1, b: "ab" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 2, b: "cd" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 3, b: "ef" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 4, b: "jk" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 5, b: "lm" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 6, b: "no" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 7, b: "pq" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 8, b: "rs" }
      { _id: ObjectId(), a: 9, b: "tv" }

   If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: "cd" }``, MongoDB must scan only one
   document to fulfill the query. The index and query are more selective
   because the values of ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query
   can select a specific document using the index.

   However, although the index on ``a`` is more selective, a query such
   as ``{ a: { $gt: 5 }, b: "tv" }`` would still need to scan 4
   documents.

   .. todo:: is there an answer to that last "However" paragraph?

If overall selectivity is low, and if MongoDB must read a number of
documents to return results, then some queries may perform faster
without indexes. To determine performance, see
:ref:`indexes-measuring-use`.

Consider Performance when Creating Indexes for Write-heavy Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your application is write-heavy, then be careful when creating new
indexes, since each additional index with impose a
write-performance penalty. In general, don't be careless about adding
indexes. Add indexes to complement your queries. Always have
a good reason for adding a new index, and be sure to benchmark
alternative strategies.

Consider Insert Throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo:: insert link to /source/core/write-operations when that page is complete.
   Do we want to link to write concern? -bg

MongoDB must update *all* indexes associated with a collection after
every insert, update, or delete operation. For update operations, if
the updated document does not move to a new location, then MongoDB only
modifies the updated fields in the index. Therefore, every index on a
collection adds some amount of overhead to these write operations. In
almost every case, the performance gains that indexes realize for read
operations are worth the insertion penalty. However, in some cases:

- An index to support an infrequent query might incur more
  insert-related costs than savings in read-time.

  .. todo:: How do you determine if the above is the case?
     Empirically.

- If you have many indexes on a collection with a high insert throughput
  and a number of related indexes, you may find better overall
  performance with a smaller number of indexes, even if some queries
  are less optimally supported by an index.

  .. todo:: The above is unclear. -bg

- If your indexes and queries are not sufficiently :ref:`selective
  <index-selectivity>`, the speed improvements for query operations
  may not offset the costs of maintaining an index. For more
  information see :ref:`index-selectivity`.
