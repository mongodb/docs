  To view deployment progress, click :guilabel:`View Agent Logs` and
  select an agent at the top of the :guilabel:`Agent Logs` page. To check
  for updated entries, refresh the page.

  If you diagnose an error and need to correct the deployment
  configuration, click :guilabel:`Edit Configuration` and then click
  :guilabel:`Edit Configuration` again. Reconfigure the deployment through
  the deployment arrow button or through the :guilabel:`Add` button. If
  you cannot find a solution, :doc:`shut down
  </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` the deployment. When you complete your
  changes, click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy` and then :guilabel:`Confirm &
  Deploy`.

  Upon completion, |mms| removes the member from the replica set, but it will continue to run
  as a :term:`standalone MongoDB instance <standalone>`. To shut down the standalone,
  see :doc:`/tutorial/shut-down-deployment`.
