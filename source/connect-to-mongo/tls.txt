By default, the driver supports TLS/SSL connections to MongoDB
servers using the underlying support for TLS/SSL provided by the JDK.
This can be changed either by utilizing the extensibility of the `Java SE
API <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/>`__, or by using the
`Netty API <https://netty.io/4.1/api/>`__.

MongoClient API
---------------

You can configure the driver to use 
TLS/SSL by specifying options in a ``ConnectionString`` or in a
``MongoClientSettings`` instance.

Specify TLS/SSL in ConnectionString
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the following import statements:

.. code-block:: java
   
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClient;

To specify TLS/SSL in a ``ConnectionString``, specify ``ssl=true`` as
part of the connection string:

.. code-block:: java
   
   MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true");

Specify TLS/SSL in MongoClientSettings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the following import statements:

.. code-block:: java
   
   import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClient;

To specify TLS/SSL in a ``MongoClientSettings`` instance, set the
``enabled`` property to ``true``:

.. code-block:: java
   
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
       .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true))
       .build();
   MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

Specify Java SE SSLContext in MongoClientSettings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the following import statements:

.. code-block:: java
   
   import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
   import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;
   import com.mongodb.MongoClient;

To specify the ``javax.net.ssl.SSLContext`` with
``MongoClientSettings``, set the ``sslContext`` property:

.. code-block:: java
   
   SSLContext sslContext = ...
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
       .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true).context(sslContext))
       .build();
   MongoClient client = new MongoClient(settings);

Customize TLS/SSL Configuration through the Netty SslContext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the following import statements:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;
   import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider;

.. note::

   The driver tests with Netty version ``io.netty:netty-all:4.1.87.Final``

To instruct the driver to use
`io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext <https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContext.html>`__,
configure `NettyTransportSettings <{+core-api+}/connection/NettyTransportSettings.html>`__
when you define your ``MongoClientSettings``.

Use ``MongoClientSettings.Builder.transportSettings()``
and ``NettyTransportSettings.Builder.sslContext()`` to build your settings:

.. code-block:: java

   SslContext sslContext = SslContextBuilder.forClient()
           .sslProvider(SslProvider.OPENSSL)
           .build();
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
           .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true))
           .transportSettings(TransportSettings.nettyBuilder()
                              .sslContext(sslContext)
                              .build())
           .build();
   MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

For more details about the ``io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider``, see the `Netty
documentation <https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html>`__.

Disable Hostname Verification
-----------------------------

By default, the driver ensures that the hostname included in the
server's SSL certificate matches the hostname provided when
constructing a ``MongoClient``.

If your application needs to disable hostname verification, you must
explicitly indicate this in ``MongoClientSettings``:

.. code-block:: java
   
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
       .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {
               builder.enabled(true);
               builder.invalidHostNameAllowed(true);
           })
       .build();

Common TLS/SSL Configuration Tasks
----------------------------------

This section is based on the documentation for `Oracle JDK
<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#JDK8>`__, so some
parts may be inapplicable to your JDK or to the custom TLS/SSL
implementation you use.

Configure Trust Store and Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might configure trust stores and key stores specific to the
client by using ``javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.init(KeyManager[] km,
TrustManager[] tm, SecureRandom random)``, or you might set the JVM default
ones.

Set the Default Trust Store
```````````````````````````

A typical application will need to set several JVM system properties
to ensure that the client can *validate* the TLS/SSL
certificate presented by the server:

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``: the path to a trust store containing the
  certificate of the signing authority
- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword``: the password to access this
  trust store

The trust store is typically created with the ``keytool`` command-line
program provided as part of the JDK:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>
                -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <trust store password>

Set the Default Key Store
`````````````````````````

A typical application will also need to set several JVM system
properties to ensure that the client *presents* a TLS/SSL client
certificate to the MongoDB server:

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``: the path to a key store containing the
  clients TLS/SSL certificates
- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword``: the password to access this key
  store

The key store is typically created with the ``keytool`` or the
``openssl`` command-line program. For example, if you have a file with
the client certificate and its private key, and you want to create a key
store in the `PKCS #12 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7292>`__
format, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   openssl pkcs12 -export -in <path to client certificate & private key file>
                -out <path to key store> -passout pass:<trust store password>

To learn more about configuring a Java application for TLS/SSL,
refer to the `JSSE Reference Guide
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html>`__.

Forcing TLS v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some applications might want to force only the TLS 1.2 protocol. To do
this, set the ``jdk.tls.client.protocols`` system property to ``TLSv1.2``.

Java runtime environments before Java 8 started to enable the TLS
1.2 protocol only in later updates, as shown in the previous section.
For the driver to force the use of the TLS 1.2 protocol with a Java
runtime environment before Java 8, ensure that the update has TLS
1.2 enabled.

OCSP
~~~~

.. note::

   The driver cannot enable OCSP by default on an individual
   ``MongoClient`` basis.

Client-Driven OCSP
``````````````````

An application will need to set the following JVM system and security properties to
ensure that client-driven OCSP is enabled:

- ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``: when set to ``true``, this system
  property enables revocation checking
- ``ocsp.enable``: When set to ``true``, this security property enables
  client-driven OCSP

To configure an application to use client-driven OCSP, the application
must already be set up to connect to a server using TLS. Setting these
system properties is required to enable client-driven OCSP.

.. note::

   The support for TLS provided by the JDK utilizes "hard fail" behavior
   in the case of an unavailable OCSP responder in contrast to
   ``mongosh`` and the drivers that utilize "soft fail" behavior.

OCSP Stapling
`````````````

.. important::

   The following exception may occur when using OCSP stapling with Java
   runtime environments that use the TLS 1.3 protocol (Java 11 and higher
   use TLS 1.3 by default):

   .. code-block:: none
      
      javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request

   The exception is due to a known issue with TLS 1.3 in Java 11 and
   higher. To avoid this exception when using Java runtime environments
   that operate on the TLS 1.3 protocol, you can force the application to use the
   TLS 1.2 protocol. To do this, set the ``jdk.tls.client.protocols``
   system property to ``TLSv1.2``.

An application will need to set several JVM system properties to set
up OCSP stapling:

- ``jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension``: when set to ``true``
  (its default value), this enables OCSP stapling.
- ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``: when set to ``true``, this enables
  revocation checking. If this property is not set to ``true``, then the
  connection will be allowed to proceed regardless of the presence or
  status of the revocation information.

To configure an application to use OCSP stapling, the application must
already be set up to connect to a server using TLS, and the server
must be set up to staple an OCSP response to the certificate it
returns as part of the TLS handshake.

To learn more about configuring a Java application to use OCSP,
refer to `Client-Driven OCSP and OCSP Stapling
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ocsp.html>`__
in the Java documentation.
