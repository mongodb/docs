Building the mongo-c-driver Documentation Pages

This documentation is rendered using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__.
To easily ensure that all tooling matches expected versions, it is recommended to use
`Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`__ to install and run the required tools.

.. tip::

   Poetry itself may be installed externally, but can also be automatically
   managed using the included wrapping scripts for Bash (At ``tools/poetry.sh``)
   or PowerShell (at ``tools/poetry.ps1``). These scripts can stand in for
   ``poetry`` in any command written below.


Setting Up the Environment
--------------------------

To install the required tooling, use the ``poetry install`` command, enabling
documentation dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   $ poetry install --with=docs

This will create a user-local Python virtualenv that contains the necessary
tools for building this documentation. The ``poetry install`` command only needs
to be run when the ``pyproject.toml`` file is changed.


Running Sphinx
--------------

Poetry can be used to execute the ``man/sphinx-build`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ poetry run sphinx-build -b dirhtml "./src/libmongoc/doc" "./_build/docs/html"

This command will generate the HTML documentation in the ``_build/docs/html``
subdirectory.

.. tip::

   Because Sphinx builds many pages, the build may run quite slowly. For faster
   builds, it is recommended to use the ``--jobs <sphinx:sphinx-build.--jobs>``
   command-line option when invoking ``sphinx:man/sphinx-build``.


Viewing the Documentation
-------------------------

To quickly view the rendered HTML pages, a simple local HTTP server can be
spawned on the command line by using Python's built-in
``http.server`` module:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ poetry run python -m http.server --directory=_build/docs/html

By default, this will serve the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000, which
you can open in any web browser to see the rendered pages.
