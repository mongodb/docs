MongoDB keeps frequently accessed data, referred to as the 
:term:`working set`, in RAM. When the working set of data 
and indexes grows beyond the physical RAM allotted, performance 
is reduced as disk accesses starts to occur and data is no longer retrieved from RAM.

To solve this problem, you can shard your collection. However, 
sharding can create additional costs and complexities that your 
application may not be ready for. Rather than sharding your collection, 
you can reduce the size of your working set by using the subset pattern. 

The subset pattern is a data modeling technique used to handle 
scenarios where you have a large array of items within a document, 
but need to access frequently a small subset of those items. 
In this case, the document size can often cause the working set to exceed 
the computer's RAM capacities. The subset pattern helps optimize performance by reducing 
the amount of data that needs to be read from the database for common queries.

About this Task 
---------------

Consider an e-commerce site that has a list of reviews for a product, stored in a 
collection called ``products``. The e-commerce site inserts
documents with the following schema into the ``products`` collection: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection('products').insertOne( [
      {
         _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd99338452"),
         name: "Super Widget",
         description: "This is the most useful item in your toolbox."
         price: { value: Decimal128("119.99"), currency: "USD" },
         reviews: [
            {
              review_id: 786,
              review_author: "Kristina",
              review_text: "This is indeed an amazing widgt.",
              published_date: ISODate("2019-02-18")
            },
            {
              review_id: 785,
              review_author: "Trina",
              review_text: "Very nice product, slow shipping.",
              published_date: ISODate("2019-02-17")
            },
            [...],
            {
              review_id: 1,
              review_author: "Hans",
              review_text: "Meh, it's ok.",
              published_date: ISODate("2017-12-06")
            }
         ]  
      }
   ] )

When accessing a product’s data, you likely only need the most recent reviews. 
The following procedure demonstrates how to apply the subset pattern to the above schema. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify the subset of frequently accessed data.

      In an array field containing information about a document, determine the subset of 
      information you need to access the most. For example, in the ``products`` 
      collection, you might only need to access the ten most recent reviews. 

   .. step:: Separate the subset into different collections.

      Instead of storing all the reviews with the product, split your collection 
      into two collections: one for your most accessed data, and one for your least 
      accessed data. This allows for quick access to the most relevant data without 
      having to load the entire array. 
      
      The first collection, the ``products`` collection, contains the 
      most frequently used data, such as current reviews:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection('products').insertOne( [
           {
             _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd99338452"),
             name: "Super Widget",
             description: "This is the most useful item in your toolbox."
             price: { value: Decimal128("119.99"), currency: "USD" },
             reviews: [
               {
                 review_id: 786,
                 review_author: "Kristina",
                 review_text: "This is indeed an amazing widget.",
                 published_date: ISODate("2019-02-18")
               },
               [...],
               {
                 review_id: 776,
                 review_author: "Pablo",
                 review_text: "Amazing!",
                 published_date: ISODate("2019-02-15")
               }
             ]
           }
         ] )

      The ``products`` collection only contains the ten most recent reviews. 
      This reduces the working set by only loading in a portion, or a subset, of the overall data. 

      The second collection, the ``reviews`` collection, contains less frequently used data, such as old reviews:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection('review').insertOne( [
            {
                review_id: 786,
                review_author: "Kristina",
                review_text: "This is indeed an amazing widget.",
                product_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd99338452"),
                published_date: ISODate("2019-02-18")
              },
              {
                review_id: 785,
                review_author: "Trina",
                review_text: "Very nice product, slow shipping.",
                product_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd99338452"),
                published_date: ISODate("2019-02-17")
              },
              [...],
              {
                review_id: 1,
                review_author: "Hans",
                review_text: "Meh, it's ok.",
                product_id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd99338452"),
                published_date: ISODate("2017-12-06")
              }
          ] )
      
      You can access the ``reviews`` collection whenever you need to see additional 
      reviews. When considering where to split your data, store the most used fields 
      of your documents in your main collection and the less frequently used data in a new collection. 

Results 
-------

By using smaller documents with more frequently accessed data, you reduce the overall size 
of the working set. This allows for shorter disk access times for the most frequently used 
information that your application needs.

.. note:: 

   The subset pattern requires you to manage two collections, rather than one, as well as query
   multiple databases when you need to gather comprehensive information on a document, rather than 
   the subset.
