Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $out

   Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes
   them to a specified collection. The :pipeline:`$out` operator must
   be *the last stage* in the pipeline.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2.0

      MongoDB 3.2 added support for :ref:`document validation
      <3.2-rel-notes-document-validation>`. The ``bypassDocumentValidation``
      field enables you to bypass document validation during the
      :pipeline:`$out` phase of the aggregation operation. This lets you
      insert documents that do not meet the validation requirements.
      Specify ``bypassDocumentValidation`` as an option on the aggregation
      method or command.

   The :pipeline:`$out` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $out: "<output-collection>" }

   :pipeline:`$out` takes a string that specifies the output collection
   name.

   .. important::

      - You cannot specify a sharded collection as the output collection.
        The input collection for a pipeline can be sharded.

      - The :pipeline:`$out` operator cannot write results to a
        :doc:`capped collection </core/capped-collections>`.

Behaviors
---------

Create New Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$out` operation creates a new collection in the current
database if one does not already exist. The collection is not visible
until the aggregation completes. If the aggregation fails, MongoDB does
not create the collection.

Replace Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the collection specified by the :pipeline:`$out` operation already
exists, then upon completion of the aggregation, the :pipeline:`$out`
stage atomically replaces the existing collection with the new results
collection. Specifically, the :pipeline:`$out` operation:

#. Creates a temp collection.
#. Copies the indexes from the existing collection to the temp collection.
#. Inserts the documents into the temp collection.
#. Calls :method:`db.collection.renameCollection` with ``dropTarget: true``
   to rename the temp collection to the destination collection.

The :pipeline:`$out` operation does not change any indexes that existed on the
previous collection. If the aggregation fails, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
makes no changes to the pre-existing collection.

Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline will fail to complete if the documents produced by the
pipeline would violate any unique indexes, including the index on the
``_id`` field of the original output collection.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$out`` is not allowed in :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.


Interaction with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongodump` started with 
:option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` fails if a client issues an
aggregation pipeline that includes :pipeline:`$out` during the 
dump process. See :option:`mongodump --oplog` for more information.

Example
-------

A collection ``books`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 }
   { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection to have titles grouped by authors and then writes
the results to the ``authors`` collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate( [
                         { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
                         { $out : "authors" }
                     ] )

After the operation, the ``authors`` collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
