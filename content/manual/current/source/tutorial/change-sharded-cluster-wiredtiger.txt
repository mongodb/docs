===================================================
Change a Self-Managed Sharded Cluster to WiredTiger
===================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. note::

   You must upgrade to WiredTiger. MongoDB removed the deprecated MMAPv1 storage 
   engine in version 4.2. 

Use this tutorial to update a sharded cluster to use :ref:`WiredTiger 
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

If you change the host or port of any :term:`shard`, you must update
the shard configuration as well.

.. _sharded-cluster-mmapv1-wt-4.0-psa:

PSA 3-member Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern,
available for WiredTiger, is enabled by default. However,
if you have a three-member shard replica set with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture, you can disable
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern for that shard replica set.
Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` for a three member PSA architecture
avoids possible cache-pressure build up.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-read-concern-majority.rst

For more information on PSA architecture and read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"`, see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Config servers must be deployed as replica sets (CSRS). As such, config
servers already use the WiredTiger storage engine.

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.

MMAPv1 Only Restrictions

Procedure
---------

For each replica set :term:`shard <shard>`, to change the storage
engine to WiredTiger:

A. Update the secondary members to WiredTiger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the secondary members one at a time:

.. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the steps for the remaining secondary members, updating them one
at a time.

B. Step down the primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the secondary members have been upgraded to WiredTiger,
connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary and use
:method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an election
of a new primary.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.stepDown()

C. Update the old primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the primary has stepped down and become a secondary, update the
secondary to use WiredTiger as before:

.. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst


Repeat the procedure for the other shards.
