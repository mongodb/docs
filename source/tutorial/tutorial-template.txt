Tutorial Template
=================

.. Tutorial titles use a verb: "verb something for a goal"

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

.. As appropriate, contains the following:

.. - What does the tutorial accomplish?

.. - In what situation would a user use this tutorial? / What are the indications for this tutorial?

.. - Links to relevant conceptual docs
     (I would refrain from putting links to other tutorials or reference docs. We can discuss.)

Considerations
--------------

.. Use the "Considerations" section in cases where indications are complex or contraindications
   need mention. This section is analogous to the "Behavior" section in reference pages.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. Some examples:

.. To create this role, you must have :authaction:`createRole` access.

.. To perform this procedure on a sharded cluster, you must authenticate via a :program:`mongos`.

Procedure
---------

.. Steps. Each step has a header and an explanation.
   For example:

.. Create the Role
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. 
.. To create the role, use the :dbcommand:`createRole` command. ...
