=============================================
Migrate Config Servers with the Same Hostname
=============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This procedure migrates a :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`
in a :doc:`sharded cluster </core/sharding>`
to a new system that uses *the same* hostname.

To migrate all the config servers in a cluster, perform this procedure
for each config server separately and migrate the config servers in
reverse order from how they are listed in the :program:`mongos`
instances' :setting:`~sharding.configDB` string. Start with the last config server
listed in the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` string.

.. include:: /includes/steps/migrate-config-servers-with-same-hostname.rst

When you start the third config server, your cluster will become
writable and it will be able to create new splits and migrate chunks
as needed.
