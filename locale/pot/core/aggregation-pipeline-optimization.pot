msgid "If the aggregation pipeline contains a :pipeline:`$project` stage that specifies the fields to **include**, then MongoDB applies the projection to the head of the pipeline. This reduces the amount of data passing through the pipeline from the start. In the following example, the :pipeline:`$project` stage specifies that the results of this stage return only the ``_id`` and the ``amount`` fields. The optimization phase applies the projection to the head of the pipeline such that only the ``_id`` and the ``amount`` fields return in the resulting documents from the :pipeline:`$match` stage as well."
