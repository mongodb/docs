If your source replica set is running MongoDB 4.4 or 5.0 and is monitored by |com|, 
and you are migrating to a destination replica set running MongoDB 6.0, you can use 
the procedures linked from this section
to live migrate data into |service| using the legacy live migration service
through the {+atlas-ui+}.

Restrictions
------------

The following statements describe restrictions for various aspects
of legacy live migration. Legacy live migration is a type of live migration
that you run in the {+atlas-ui+} and that is backed by |mongomirror|.

- **Legacy live migration (push) is not supported for deployments managed or monitored by Ops Manager**

  - For source deployments running MongoDB 6.0 or later,
    where the deployments are managed or monitored by |onprem|, legacy live migration (push)
    is not supported.
  - For source deployments running a MongoDB version earlier than 6.0,
    where the deployments are managed or monitored by |onprem|, live migration (push)
    is deprecated.

    Use the following alternative ways to migrate your source deployments
    that are managed or monitored by |onprem| into |service|:

    - :cloudmgr:`Add your deployment to monitoring in Cloud Manager </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
      and use live migrate (push). See :ref:`<c2c-push-live-migration>` for most 
      cases except for the following cases:
      
      If you are migrating a source replica set running MongoDB versions 4.4 or 5.0, 
      where the replica set is managed or monitored by |com|, to a destination replica 
      set running MongoDB version 6.0, see the procedures in this section.
    
    - Use live migration (pull). 
      See :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration` for most cases except for the following cases:

      If you are migrating a source replica set running MongoDB versions 4.4 or 5.0 
      to a destination replica set running MongoDB version 6.0, see :ref:`live-migration-pre60`.
    
    - Use standalone |mongosync|.

- **Legacy live migration (push) is not supported for sharded clusters**

Go to Legacy Live Migration (Push)
----------------------------------

To locate legacy live migration (push) in the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-live-migration.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`.

     - Description
   
   * - :doc:`Live migrate (push) a replica set monitored in Ops Manager or Cloud Manager to Atlas </import/migrate-from-com-rs>`
   
     - |com| **pushes** data from the source replica set running a MongoDB version 
       earlier than 6.0 to a destination replica set in |service|.

   * - Live migrate a sharded {+cluster+} monitored in |onprem| or |mms| to |service|

     - .. include:: /includes/fact-no-sharded-legacy-push-live-migration.rst

   * - Live migrate a standalone MongoDB node running a MongoDB version earlier than 6.0.

     - :opsmgr:`Convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
       the standalone MongoDB node in |onprem|, or
       :cloudmgr:`convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
       the standalone MongoDB node in |mms| to a single-node
       replica set and then :doc:`live migrate (push) <import/migrate-from-com-rs>`
       it to |service|.
