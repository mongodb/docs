Example
-------

This example demonstrates how to build a text index and use it to find
coffee shops, given only text fields.

Create a collection ``stores`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.insert(
      [
        { _id: 1, name: "Java Hut", description: "Coffee and cakes" },
        { _id: 2, name: "Burger Buns", description: "Gourmet hamburgers" },
        { _id: 3, name: "Coffee Shop", description: "Just coffee" },
        { _id: 4, name: "Clothes Clothes Clothes", description: "Discount clothing" },
        { _id: 5, name: "Java Shopping", description: "Indonesian goods" }
      ]
   )
