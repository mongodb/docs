Overview
--------

Auditing allows
administrators to track system activity for deployments with multiple
users. |service| administrators can select the actions that they want 
to audit, as well as the database users, |service| roles, and LDAP 
groups whose actions they want audited. |service| supports 
:manual:`auditing </core/auditing>` all system event actions documented 
at :ref:`audit-action-details-results`.

The ``authCheck`` event action logs authorization attempts by users
trying to read from and write to databases in the clusters in your
project. The following specific commands are audited:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - ``authCheck Reads``
     - ``authCheck Writes``

   * - :manual:`aggregate </reference/command/aggregate>`

.. [1] MongoDB versions 4.2 and later do not support these commands.

|service| implements the ``authCheck`` event action as the following
four separate actions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Event Action
     - Description

   * - ``authChecksReadFailures``
     - The ``authCheck`` event action for all failed reads with the `auditAuthorizationSuccess
       <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`_
       parameter set to false. This is the default for read-related event actions.

   * - ``authChecksReadAll``
     - The ``authCheck`` event action for all reads, both sucesses and failures.
       Same as ``authChecksReadFailures`` but with the `auditAuthorizationSuccess <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`_
       parameter set to true.

       .. warning::

          Enabling Audit authorization successes can severely impact cluster performance. Enable this option with caution.

   * - ``authChecksWriteFailures``
     - The ``authCheck`` event action for all failed writes with the `auditAuthorizationSuccess
       <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`_
       parameter set to false. This is the default for write-related event actions.

   * - ``authChecksWriteAll``
     - The ``authCheck`` event action for all writes, both successes and failures.
       Same as ``authChecksWriteFailures`` but with the `auditAuthorizationSuccess <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`_
       parameter  set to true.

       .. warning::

          Enabling Audit authorization successes can severely impact cluster performance. Enable this option with caution.

See `Audit Guarantee <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/auditing/#audit-guarantee>`_
for information about how MongoDB writes audit events to disk.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   To learn about best practices for auditing the actions of temporary
   database users, see :ref:`audit-temp-db-users`.

Use the following procedure to set up database auditing:

.. include:: /includes/steps/set-up-database-auditing.rst

To retrieve the audit logs in |service|, see :ref:`MongoDB Logs <mongodb-logs>`.
To retrieve the audit logs using the API, see :doc:`Logs </reference/api/logs>`.
