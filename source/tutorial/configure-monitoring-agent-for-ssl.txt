==================================
Configure Monitoring Agent for SSL
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| supports SSL for encrypting the following connections made by
Monitoring Agents:

- Connections between the Monitoring Agents and MongoDB instances.

- Connections between the Monitoring Agents and |mms| servers.

Connections between Agents and MongoDB Instances
------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/monitoring-agent-configure-ssl.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-host-settings.rst

Connections between Agents and MMS Servers
------------------------------------------

.. only:: saas

   The Monitoring Agents always use SSL when connecting to the
   |MMS| servers.

.. only:: hosted

   To ensure that the Monitoring Agents use SSL when connecting
   to the |MMS| servers, use an HTTPS proxy in front of |MMS|.

   You can optionally configure a Jetty instance to use HTTPS for
   connections between the |mms| application and agents. To do so, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-jetty-https`.

For the settings used by the Monitoring Agent to connect to the |MMS|
servers, see :ref:`server-monitoring-ssl`.

Additional Information

For information about MongoDB and SSL, see
:manual:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
