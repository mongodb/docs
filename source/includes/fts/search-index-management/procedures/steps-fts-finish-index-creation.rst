   The newly created index appears on the :guilabel:`Atlas Search` tab. While 
   the index is building, the :guilabel:`Status` field reads 
   :guilabel:`Build in Progress`. When the index is finished building,
   the :guilabel:`Status` field reads :guilabel:`Active`.

      notification when your index is finished building.
