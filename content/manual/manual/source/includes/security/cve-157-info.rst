.. important:: Pre-authentication Denial of Service Stack Overflow Vulnerability in JSON Parsing via Excessive Recursion in MongoDB

   Due to CVE-2025-6710, in |cve-version-list|, MongoDB Server may be susceptible 
   to stack overflow due to JSON parsing mechanism, where specifically crafted 
   JSON inputs may induce unwarranted levels of recursion, resulting in excessive 
   stack space consumption. Such inputs can lead to a stack overflow that causes 
   the server to crash which could occur pre-authorisation.
   
   This issue affects the following MongoDB Server versions:

   - 8.0.0 - 8.0.4
   - 7.0.0 - 7.0.16

   The same issue affects MongoDB Server v6.0, but an attacker can only induce 
   denial of service after authenticating. This issue affects the 
   following MongoDB Server versions:
   
   - 6.0.0 - 6.0.20

   **CVSS Score**: 7.5

   **CWE**: CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
