            default value is ``secondary``.
                  
            If you don't set anything in your {+fdi+} storage
            configuration, the default value is ``nearest``. To
            learn more, see :manual:`Read preference mode 
            </core/read-preference/#read-preference-modes>`.

        * - :guilabel:`TagSets`

            route read requests. To learn more, see :manual:`Read 
            Preference Tag Sets </core/read-preference-tags/>`.

        * - :guilabel:`Maxstaleness Seconds`
          - Specifies the maximum replication lag, or 
            "staleness", for reads from secondaries. To learn

  You can select an existing |aws| IAM role that |service| is 
  authorized for from the role selection dropdown list or choose 
  :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM Role` to authorize a new role. 
  
  If you selected an existing role that |service| is authorized for, 
  proceed to the next step to list your |aws| |s3| buckets. 
  
  If you are authorizing |service| for an existing role or are creating 
  a new role, complete the following steps before proceeding to the 
  next step:
  
  a. From the dropdown, select :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM Role` to authorize a new role or select an existing role.

  #. Use the |aws| :abbr:`ARN (Amazon Resource Name)` and unique 
     External ID in the :guilabel:`Role Authorization` section to add |service| to the trust 
     relationships of an existing or new |aws| IAM role. 

     In the |service| UI, click one of the following:

     - The :guilabel:`Create new AWS IAM role` shows how to 
       use the |arn| and the unique External ID to add |service| to the 
       trust relationships of a new |aws| |iam| role. Follow the steps 
       in the |service| UI for creating a new role. To learn more, see  
       :atlas:`Create New Role with the AWS CLI 
       </security/set-up-unified-aws-access/#procedure>`. 

       When authorizing a new role, if you quit the workflow: 
     
       - Before validating the role, |service| will not create the 
         {+fdi+}. You can go to the |service| :guilabel:`Integrations` 
         page to :atlas:`authorize 
         </security/set-up-unified-aws-access/>` a new role, then start
         the procedure for :ref:`deploying a {+fdi+} <gst-deploy-adf>` again when you have
         the |aws| IAM role |arn|.
       - After validating the role, |service| will not create the 
         {+fdi+}. However, the role is available in the role selection 
         dropdown and can be used to create a {+fdi+}. You do not need 
         to authorize the role again. 

     - The :guilabel:`Use existing AWS IAM role` 
       shows how to use the |arn| and the unique External ID to add 
       |service| to the trust relationships of an existing |aws| |iam| 
       role. Follow the steps in the |service| UI for adding |service| 
       to the trust relationship to an existing role. To learn more, 
       see :atlas:`Add Trust Relationships to an Existing Role 
       </security/set-up-unified-aws-access/#procedure>` . 

     .. important::

        If you modify your custom |aws| role |arn| in the future, 
        ensure that the access policy of the role includes the 
        appropriate access to the |s3| resources for the {+fdi+}.

     To learn more, see :atlas:`Set Up Unified AWS Access 
     </security/set-up-unified-aws-access/>` and

  Schedule a :ref:`trigger <atlas-scheduled-trigger>` to continuously copy data from your |service| {+cluster+} into your |s3| bucket using :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out/#-out--aggregation->` in the :guilabel:`Schedule Queries` section. 

  a. Specify how often you want to extract data from your |service| {+cluster+} using the :guilabel:`Repeat Once By` dropdowns.

  #. *Optional*. Specify whether {+adf+} must re-run the same query if it missed it for any reason. By default, this is disabled to allow {+adf+} to re-run missed queries. Alternatively, to skip missed queries and not catch up, toggle on :guilabel:`Skip Catch Up Events`.

  #. *Optional*. Choose the format you want for your data when {+adf+} writes it to your |s3| bucket. {+adf+} supports `Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/docs/>`__, :ref:`CSV <adf-csv-tsv-data>` , |bson| , and :manual:`MongoDB Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>`.

  #. Specify the :guilabel:`Max File Size` to limit how large each file that {+adf+} writes to your |s3| bucket can be. For example, if you set :guilabel:`Max File Size` to 100 MB and a query returns 1 GB of data, {+adf+} writes the query to your |s3| bucket in 10 files, each 100 MBs.  

  #. Enter the :aws:`AWS prefix <AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html>` for your destination |s3| bucket.

  #. Enter the name of the :manual:`indexed </indexes>` date field in :guilabel:`Date Field` and specify the format of its value using the dropdown. Every collection that you want to copy downstream must have an :manual:`indexed </indexes>` field that stores a timestamp as its value.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

     - View to edit the view name. 

     You can click: 
     
     - :guilabel:`Add Database` to add databases and collections. 
     - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the database to add collections 
       to the database. 
     - :icon-fa4:`plus` associated with the collection to add 
       :manual:`views </core/views/>` on the collection. To create a 
       view, you must specify:

       - The :manual:`pipeline 
         </core/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline>` 
         to apply to the view.

         The view definition pipeline cannot include the ``$out`` or 
         the ``$merge`` stage. If the view definition includes 
         nested pipeline stages such as ``$lookup`` or ``$facet``, 
         this restriction applies to those nested pipelines as well.

       To learn more about views, see:

       - :manual:`db.createView </reference/method/db.createView/>`

     - :icon-fa4:`trash-o` associated with the database, collection, or 
       view to remove it.

  #. Select {{data-source}} from the dropdown in the 
     :guilabel:`Data Sources` section.
  #. Drag and drop the data store to map with the collection.
