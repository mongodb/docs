:guilabel:`Deployment` provides access to all your monitored objects. The
:guilabel:`Deployment` tab includes the pages described here.

Deployment Page
---------------

The :guilabel:`Deployment` page provides access to all monitored
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. The page includes the
following information:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Last Ping`

     - The last time this agent sent a ping to the |mms| servers. Click a
       ping to view a detailed status from the ping.

   * - :guilabel:`Host`

     - The hostname and port of the instance. Click the hostname to
       view :doc:`host statistics </reference/host-statistics>`.

   * - Orange triangle icon under a host name.

     - The startup warning indicator for the host. Only displayed when
       warnings exist. Click the host's last ping for warning details.
       |mms| startup warnings can include the following:

       - |mms| suspects the host has a low ``ulimit`` setting of less
         than ``1024``. |mms| infers the host's ``ulimit`` setting using
         the total number of available and current connections. See the
         :manual:`UNIX ulimit Settings </reference/ulimit/>` reference
         page.

       - |mms| flags a deactivated host.

         .. important:: If you have deactivated hosts, review all deactivated
            hosts to ensure that they are still in use, and remove all hosts
            that are not active. Then click on the warning icon and select
            :guilabel:`Reactive ALL hosts`.

   * - :guilabel:`Type`

     - The type of host. Possible types include: :replstate:`PRIMARY`,
       :replstate:`SECONDARY`, :replstate:`STANDALONE`, and
       :replstate:`ARBITER`. When the host recovers, the rectangle flag
       turns yellow and displays :replstate:`RECOVERING`. When the host
       returns a fatal error, the flag displays :replstate:`FATAL`. The
       flag also can display ``NO DATA``.

   * - :guilabel:`Cluster`

     - The name of the cluster to which this instance belongs. Only
       cluster members display this value. Click the cluster name to
       display aggregated information on the cluster's replica sets.
       See :doc:`/tutorial/view-cluster-statistics` for details.

   * - :guilabel:`Shard`

     -  The name of the shard.

   * - :guilabel:`Repl Set`

     - The name of the shard's replica set. Click the replica set name
       to display replica set statistics. See
       :doc:`/tutorial/view-replica-set-statistics` for details.

   * - :guilabel:`Up Since`

     -  The date the host first pinged MMS.

   * - :guilabel:`Version`

     - The version of the MongoDB running on this instance.

Host Mapping Page
-----------------

The :guilabel:`Host Mapping` page shows the mapping between system hostnames
and the names provided by the monitored :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` processes.
