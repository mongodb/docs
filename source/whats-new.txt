.. _csharp-version-3.2:

What's New in 3.2
-----------------

The 3.2 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds a new ``ObjectSerializerAllowedTypesConvention`` convention that
  allows you to specify which types are allowed to be serialized and
  deserialized by the object serializer. To learn more about conventions,
  see the :ref:`csharp-conventions` guide.

- Adds a new constructor for the ``EnumRepresentationConvention`` class that
  allows you use the ``topLevelOnly`` parameter to specify whether the
  convention applies to only enum properties or to all properties that include
  collections of enums.

  You can instantiate the ``EnumRepresentationConvention`` class by using the new
  constructor as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     EnumRepresentationConvention(BsonType representation, bool topLevelOnly);

.. _csharp-version-3.1:

What's New in 3.1
-----------------

The 3.1 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds new default serializers for immutable collections in the
  `System.Collections.Immutable <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.immutable?view=net-8.0>`__
  namespace. The driver can now serialize ``ImmutableArray`` objects, and serialization
  for other immutable collections is more memory efficient.

- Adds support for the token field type and array field expressions with Atlas Search
  builders for the ``equals`` operator. To learn more about using Atlas Search with the
  {+driver-short+}, see :ref:`csharp-atlas-search`.

- Adds support for sequential pagination in Atlas Search.

- Adds support for valid SRV hostnames with fewer than 3 parts.

- Adds support for the ``Exists``, ``IsMissing``, and ``IsNullOrMissing`` methods
  in MongoDB Query API filters.

- Adds support for Exact Nearest Neighbor (ENN) vector search. To learn more about ENN
  Vector Search, see :atlas:`Run Vector Search Queries </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage>`
  in the Atlas Search documentation.

- Adds support for the ``sort`` option to be passed to update commands. To learn more about
  using update commands with the {+driver-short+}, see :ref:`csharp-change-guide`.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.1 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v3.1.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-3.0:

What's New in 3.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v3.0

   The v3.0 driver contains breaking changes. See :ref:`<csharp-breaking-changes-v3>`
   for more information.

The 3.0 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds the ``MongoClientSettings.TranslationOptions`` connection option, which specifies
  options for translating LINQ queries to the Query API. See :ref:`csharp-connection-options`
  for more information.

- Adds support for the ``Half`` type, which represents a half-precision floating-point number.
  This type is available in .NET 5 and later.
  To learn more about the ``Half`` type, see the
  `Half Struct <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.half?view=net-8.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- The ``IMongoClient`` interface inherits the ``IDisposable`` interface. As a result, the
  ``MongoClient`` class and other classes that implement the ``IMongoClient`` interface
  contain a ``Dispose()`` method, which disposes of the client. This method does not
  dispose the underlying cluster and connections to the MongoDB server. To
  dispose of the cluster and connections, call the
  ``ClusterRegistry.UnregisterAndDisposeCluster()`` method. 
  The implementation of the ``IDisposable`` interface is experimental.
  
  To learn more about the ``IDisposable`` interface and use of the
  ``Dispose()`` method, see
  `Dispose Pattern <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/dispose-pattern>`__
  on MSDN.

- Adds support for the ``DateOnly`` type, which represents a date value with no
  time component. This type is available in .NET 6 and later. To learn more about the
  ``DateOnly`` type, see the
  `DateOnly Struct. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly?view=net-6.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- Adds support for the ``TimeOnly`` type, which represents a time value with no
  date component. This type is available in .NET 6 and later. To learn more about the
  ``TimeOnly`` type, see the
  `TimeOnly Struct. <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timeonly?view=net-6.0>`__
  API reference page on MSDN.

- Adds support for implicit client-side projection when using the ``Find()`` method,
  the ``Select()`` method, or the ``Project()`` aggregation stage with the LINQ3 provider.
  In previous versions of the driver, you could perform client-side
  projection with the LINQ3 provider only after calling the ``ToEnumerable()`` or
  ``AsEnumerable()`` method.
  
  To learn how to enable and use client-side projection for a driver method, select the
  corresponding tab:

  .. tabs::

    .. tab:: Find() Method
       :tabid: find-method

       .. code-block:: csharp

          // Enable client-side projection
          var findOptions = new FindOptions();
          findOptions.TranslationOptions = new ExpressionTranslationOptions
          {
              EnableClientSideProjections = true
          };
         
          var find = collection
              .Find(doc => doc.Id == 1, findOptions);
              .Project(doc => new { R = MyFunction(doc.Name) });
  
    .. tab:: Select() Method
       :tabid: select-method

       .. code-block:: csharp

          // Enable client-side projection
          var aggregateOptions = new AggregateOptions();
          aggregateOptions.TranslationOptions = new ExpressionTranslationOptions
          {
              EnableClientSideProjections = true
          };
         
          var queryable = collection
              .AsQueryable(aggregateOptions)
              .Where(doc => doc.Id == 1)
              .Select(doc => new { R = MyFunction(doc.Name) });

    .. tab:: Project() Method
       :tabid: project-method

       .. code-block:: csharp

          // Enable client-side projection
          var aggregateOptions = new AggregateOptions();
          aggregateOptions.TranslationOptions = new ExpressionTranslationOptions
          {
              EnableClientSideProjections = true
          };

          var aggregate = collection
              .Aggregate(aggregateOptions)
              .Project(doc => new { R = MyFunction(doc.Name) });
  
  .. tip:: MongoClientSettings

     To enable client-side projection for all queries on a client, set the
     ``TranslationOptions`` property of your ``MongoClientSettings`` object, as shown
     in the following example:
     
     .. code-block:: csharp

        clientSettings.TranslationOptions = new ExpressionTranslationOptions
        {
            EnableClientSideProjections = true
        }; 
  
  To learn more about using the aggregation pipeline with the {+driver-short+}, see
  :ref:`csharp-aggregation`.

- Adds a ``MongoClient`` API for bulk write operations. To learn more about bulk write
  operations, see :ref:`csharp-bulk-write`.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v3.0 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v3.0.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-2.30:

What's New in 2.30

     has dependencies that reference multiple {+driver-short+}
     versions, you must create binding redirects to manage those dependencies.
     For more information, see :ref:`csharp-breaking-changes-2.28.0`.

The 2.28 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for additional numeric conversions involving ``Nullable<T>``.
- Adds support for the ``delegated`` option when using KMIP for :ref:`CSFLE or
  Queryable Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

For more information about this release, see the :github:`v2.28 release notes
</mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases/tag/v2.28.0>`.

.. _csharp-version-2.27:

What's New in 2.27
------------------

The 2.27 driver release includes the following new features:
