You can verify which Linux distribution you are running by running the
following command on the command-line:

.. code-block:: none

   grep ^NAME  /etc/*release

The result should be **Amazon Linux AMI**. If using a different Linux
distribution, please see the
:doc:`install instructions for your platform
</administration/install-on-linux>`.
