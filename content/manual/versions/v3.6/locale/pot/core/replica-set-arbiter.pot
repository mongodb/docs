msgid "An arbiter does **not** have a copy of data set and **cannot** become a primary. Replica sets may have arbiters to add a vote in :ref:`elections for primary <replica-set-elections>`. Arbiters *always* have exactly ``1`` election vote, and thus allow replica sets to have an uneven number of voting members without the overhead of an additional member that replicates data."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-arbiter-priority.rst:1
msgid "Starting in MongoDB 3.6, arbiters have priority ``0``. When you upgrade a replica set to MongoDB 3.6, if the existing configuration has an arbiter with priority ``1``, MongoDB 3.6 reconfigures the arbiter to have priority ``0``."

msgid "When running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, arbiters exchange credentials with other members of the set to authenticate via :setting:`keyfiles <keyfile>`. MongoDB encrypts the authentication process. The MongoDB authentication exchange is cryptographically secure."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-arbiter.txt:62
msgid "Because arbiters do not store data, they do not possess the internal table of user and role mappings used for authentication.  Thus, the only way to log on to an arbiter with authorization active is to use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`."
