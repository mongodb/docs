|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
clusters. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
|service| :ref:`data-explorer` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For a list of datasets in the sample and a description of each, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

Load Sample Data
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
an |service| cluster to load data into. See :ref:`create-new-cluster`
for instructions.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways in which you can load sample data into your
|service| cluster. You can either load sample data from the
:guilabel:`Clusters` view or the
:ref:`Data Explorer <data-explorer>`.

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to load
sample data:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: clusters-view
       name: Clusters View
       content: |

         To load sample data into your cluster from the :guilabel:`Clusters`
         view:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-clusters.rst

     - id: data-explorer
       name: Data Explorer
       content: |

         .. important::
         
            You can only load sample data through the
            :guilabel:`Data Explorer` if you do not have any data
            already in your collection.
         
         To load sample data into your cluster from the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-de.rst

Sample Data Namespaces
----------------------

When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
namespaces on your cluster:

.. warning::

   If any of these namespaces already exist on your cluster when you
   attempt to load the sample data, the operation will fail and no
   sample data will be loaded into your cluster.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

     - Collection

   * - ``sample_airbnb``
     - ``listingsAndReviews``

Tutorials Using Sample Data
---------------------------

|service| Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`atlas-getting-started` tutorial walks through setting up
an |service| cluster and populating that cluster with sample data.

The :ref:`Atlas Search tutorial<fts-tutorial-ref>` demonstrates how
to create  an |fts| index using data from the
:ref:`sample_mflix <sample-mflix>` sample database.

MongoDB Charts Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` tutorials guide you through
visualizing sample data provided by |service|:

:charts:`Visualizing Order Data </tutorial/order-data/order-data-tutorial-overview/>`
  Visualize the :ref:`sample-supplies`, which contains sales order data
  from a mock office supply company.

:charts:`Visualizing Movie Details </tutorial/movie-details/movie-details-tutorial-overview/>`
  Visualize the :ref:`sample-mflix`, which contains data on movies and
  movie theaters.
