Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can unshard a sharded collection by using the 
:dbcommand:`unshardCollection` command. When you unshard a collection,
MongoDB moves the collection data onto a single shard and updates the metadata 
to reflect the unsharded state. 

Command Syntax
--------------

To unshard a collection, use the :dbcommand:`unshardCollection` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({
      unshardCollection : "<database>.<collection>",
      toShard : "<recipient shard ID>"
   })

Use Cases
---------

A user can unshard a collection if: 

- You can store the collection entirely on a single shard.

- The collection requires resource isolation, and access patterns are better 
  supported if the collection lives on a single shard. To meet the same 
  requirements on a sharded collection, see :ref:`Zone Sharding 
  <zone-sharding>`.

- The collection was previously sharded but no longer needs to be sharded.

Get Started
-----------

- :ref:`unshard-collection-task`

Access Control 
--------------

.. include:: /includes/access-control-unshardCollection.rst

Details
-------

An unsharded collection's data only lives on one shard and the :term:`shard key` 
is removed. Collections that you manually unshard behave the same as newly 
created collections that were never sharded.

You can specify the destination shard with the optional ``toShard`` field. If 
you don't specify a destination shard, MongoDB automatically selects the shard
with the least amount of data.
