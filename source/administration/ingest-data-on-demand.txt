Trigger Data Ingestion On Demand 
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can manually trigger an ingestion of snapshot data from the 
|service| cluster to {+adl+} datasets if you configured :guilabel:`On 
Demand` extraction in your {+dl+} pipeline. You can trigger data 
ingestion from the |service| |ui| and {+dl+} Pipelines |api|.

Trigger Data Ingestion from the |service| UI  
--------------------------------------------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

   .. step::  Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` on the left-hand navigation.

   .. step:: Click the vertical ellipsis (:icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v`) for the {+dl+} for which you configured :guilabel:`On Demand` ingestion and select :guilabel:`Trigger an On Demand Pipeline Run`.

   .. step:: Select the snapshot, from which to ingest data, from the dropdown.

      The dropdown shows a list of all the snapshots on your |service| 
      cluster. However, you can select only the snapshots from which 
      {+dl+} hasn't yet ingested data; the grayed-out snapshots are 
      snapshots from which your {+dl+} has already ingested data.

      You can also send a ``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} 
      </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``availableSnapshots`` endpoint to 
      retrieve the list of backup snapshots that you can use to trigger 
      an on-demand pipeline run. To learn more about the |api| syntax 
      and options for the ``availableSnapshots`` endpoint, see 
      :oas-atlas-op:`Return Available Backup Snapshots for One Data 
      Lake Pipeline </returnAvailableSnapshotsForPipeline>`.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

      |service| displays a blue banner at the top of the page that 
      shows the data ingestion status. 

Trigger Data Ingestion from the API  
-----------------------------------

To trigger data ingestion through the |api|, send a ``POST`` request 
to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``trigger`` 
endpoint with the name of the pipeline for which you want to trigger 
data ingestion. To learn more about the |api| syntax and parameters for 
the ``trigger`` endpoint, see :oas-atlas-op:`Trigger On-Demand Snapshot 
Ingestion </triggerOneOnDemandSnapshotIngestion>`.

.. tip:: 

   You can send a ``GET`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} 
   </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``availableSnapshots`` endpoint to retrieve 
   the list of backup snapshots that you can use to trigger an 
   on-demand pipeline run. To learn more about the |api| syntax and 
   options for the ``availableSnapshots`` endpoint, see 
   :oas-atlas-op:`Return Available Backup Snapshots for One Data Lake 
   Pipeline </returnAvailableSnapshotsForPipeline>`.
