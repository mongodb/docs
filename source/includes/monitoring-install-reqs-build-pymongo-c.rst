Before you build PyMongo packages with PyMongo C extensions, these software
packages must be available or installed on the target system:

- Python 2.6+ (recommended)
- ``curl`` to retrieve PyMongo archived file
- ``gcc`` or similar to install a C compiler
- ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel`` to install Python C extensions
- ``pip`` to install and uninstall PyMongo
- ``pymongo`` to install the Python driver used by the monitoring agent
- ``agent.py`` to install the MongoDB monitoring agent

The packages distributed in PyPI for Windows include C extensions.
