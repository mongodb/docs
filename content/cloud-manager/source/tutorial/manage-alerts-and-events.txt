Overview
--------

|mms| issues alerts for the database and server conditions
configured in your :ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>`. When a 
condition triggers an alert, you receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert resolves or |mms| cancels it. You should fix 
the immediate problem, implement a long-term solution, and 
:ref:`view metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` to monitor 
your progress.

.. _get-activity-feed:

Retrieve the Activity Feed
--------------------------

You can retrieve events for a specified organization or project using
the :doc:`/reference/api/events/` |api| resource.

.. _acknowledge-alert:

Acknowledge an Alert
--------------------

When you acknowledge the alert, |mms| sends no further notifications to
the alert's distribution list until the acknowledgment period has
passed or until you resolve the alert. The distribution list
receives *no* notification of the acknowledgment.

If the alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |mms|
sends a notification of the resolution.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident
management service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your
PagerDuty dashboard.

.. _manage-host-alerts:

Disable Alerts for a Specific Process

You can turn off alerts for a given process. This might be useful, for

it hidden from monitoring. Use the following procedure both to turn
alerts off or on.
