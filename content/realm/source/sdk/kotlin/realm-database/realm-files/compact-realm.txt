Realm reduces the file size by writing a new (compact) version of the file, and 
then replacing the original with the newly-written file. Therefore, to compact, 
you must have free storage space equivalent to the original realm file size. 

You can configure realm to automatically compact the database each time a
realm is opened, or you can compact the file without first obtaining a
realm instance.

Realm Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure Realm to compact the realm file each time it is opened
by setting a callback for the `compactOnLaunch 
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-configuration/-shared-builder/compact-on-launch.html>`__ function
for the configuration. When you call ``compactOnLaunch`` for the 
configuration, the `DEFAULT_COMPACT_ON_LAUNCH_CALLBACK 
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/
-d-e-f-a-u-l-t_-c-o-m-p-a-c-t_-o-n_-l-a-u-n-c-h_-c-a-l-l-b-a-c-k.html>`__ 
will trigger if the file is above 50 MB and 50% or more of the space in 
the realm file is unused. You can specify custom compaction settings 
when calling ``compactOnLaunch`` depending on your applications needs.
The following code example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Compacting.snippet.compactOnLaunch.kt
   :language: kotlin

Realm.compactRealm Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without having to open it by calling 
the `compactRealm <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}
io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/compact-realm.html>`__ method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Compacting.snippet.compactRealm.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``compactRealm`` method will return true if the operation is successful 
and false if not.

.. important::

   `compactRealm <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/-companion/compact-realm.html>`__ 
   is not available on Windows (JVM), and will throw a 
   `NotImplementedError <https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-not-implemented-error/>`_ there.

Make a Compacted Copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can save a compacted (and optionally :ref:`encrypted
<kotlin-encrypt-a-realm>`) copy of a realm to another file location
with the `Realm.writeCopyTo
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-copy-to.html>`__
method. The destination file cannot already exist.

.. important::

   Avoid calling ``writeCopyTo`` within a :ref:`write transaction
   <kotlin-write-transactions>`. If called within a write transaction, this
   method copies the absolute latest data. This includes any
   **uncommitted** changes you made in the transaction before this
   method call.
