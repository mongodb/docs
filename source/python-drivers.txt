Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Python
drivers. Add one of the following drivers to your application to work with
MongoDB in Python.

PyMongo
-------

You can add PyMongo to your application to work with MongoDB in Python. See
the `PyMongo documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/>`__
to learn how to install and begin using the driver.

`PyMongoArrow <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-arrow-driver/current/>`__
is a PyMongo extension for loading MongoDB query result sets as Apache Arrow tables.

.. important:: Motor Deprecation

   As of May 14, 2025, Motor is deprecated in favor of the GA release of the PyMongo Async
   API in the PyMongo library. We
   strongly recommend migrating to the PyMongo Async API while Motor is still supported.
    
   For more information about migrating, see the `Migrate to PyMongo Async <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/reference/migration/>`__
   guide in the PyMongo documentation.

Tools and Projects
------------------

The `Full Stack FastAPI App Generator <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/full-stack-fastapi-mongodb>`__
simplifies setup of web applications that use the FastAPI, React, and MongoDB
(FARM) stack. You can learn more about this tool on the
:website:`MongoDB blog. </blog/post/introducing-full-stack-fast-api-app-generator-for-python-developers>` 

.. important::

   The MongoDB Full Stack FastAPI App Generator is an experimental project
   and is not yet supported by MongoDB.
