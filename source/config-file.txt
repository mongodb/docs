You can configure |compass| settings using a configuration file. Configure 
settings with a configuration file to maintain consistent behavior between 
|compass-short| sessions. 

Use Cases
---------

Use the configuration file to specify |compass-short| settings and behaviors. 
For example:

- If your deployment has strict privacy requirements, you can configure 
  |compass-short| to block outgoing network connections.

- If you need to restrict what actions users can perform in |compass-short|, you 
  can disable the embedded shell and make |compass-short| read-only.

- If you have multiple team members using |compass-short|, you can use a common 
  configuration file to ensure a consistent user experience.

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

- For macOS and Linux, the configuration file is located at ``/etc/mongodb-compass.conf``.

- For Windows, the configuration file is located at ``<path\to\compass>\..\mongodb-compass.cfg``.

Behavior
--------

When you configure settings with a configuration file:

- You can not modify settings set in the configuration file after startup.

- You can specify the configuration file in either EJSON or YAML format.

- To view all available |compass-short| configuration options, run the following
  command in the folder containing your |compass| executable:
  
  .. code-block:: sh

     <path-to-Compass-executable> --help
