|mongomirror| is not compatible with :manual:`TTL indexes
</core/index-ttl>`. Drop any existing TTL indexes and rebuild
them when the migration process is complete. If you do not want to drop 
an existing index because it is important for query performance, 
:ref:`contact support <request-support>` for alternative options.
