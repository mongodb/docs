  Enter information as required and click :guilabel:`Apply`. 

  The :guilabel:`Auth Schema Version` field determines the schema for
  storing user data. MongoDB 3.0 uses a different schema for user data
  than previous versions. For compatibility information, see the
  :manual:`MongoDB Release Notes <release-notes>`.

  If you run MongoDB 3.0 or higher, you can choose a storage engine by
  selecting :guilabel:`Advanced Options` and adding the :guilabel:`engine`
  option. For information on storage engines, see :manual:`Storage
  </core/storage>` in the MongoDB manual.

  For descriptions
  of :guilabel:`Advanced Options`, see
  :doc:`/reference/deployment-advanced-options`.
