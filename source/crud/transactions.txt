Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform 
**transactions**. :manual:`Transactions </core/transactions/>` allow
you to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the
transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction returns an
error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards all data changes
before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you
intend to run sequentially. Sessions allow you to run operations
in an ACID-compliant transaction, which is a transaction that meets
an expectation of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a 
``MongoClient`` instance as a ``ClientSession`` type. We recommend that you reuse
your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
instantiating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``ClientSession`` only with the ``MongoClient`` (or associated
   ``MongoDatabase`` or ``MongoCollection``) that created it. Using a
   ``ClientSession`` with a different ``MongoClient`` results in operation
   errors.

.. important::

   You must include the ``session`` as a parameter for any operations that you
   want to include in a transaction.

Methods
-------

Create a ``ClientSession`` by using the ``startSession()`` method on your 
``MongoClient`` instance. You can then modify the session state by using the 
methods provided by the ``ClientSession``. The following table describes the 
methods you can use to manage your transaction:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``startTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction for this session with the
         default transaction options. Pass an instance of ``TransactionOptions`` 
         as a parameter to start a transaction with given options. You 
         cannot start a transaction if there's already an active transaction
         running in the session.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``TransactionOptions transactionOptions``

   * - ``abortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Returns an error 
         if there is no active transaction for the
         session or the transaction was previously ended.

   * - ``commitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was ended.

   * - ``withTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction for this session and runs the given function. This
         method handles retries, committing, and aborting transactions. Pass an 
         instance of ``TransactionBody`` as a parameter that defines the 
         operations you want to execute within the transaction.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``TransactionBody<T> transactionBody``

A ``ClientSession`` also has methods to retrieve session properties and modify mutable 
session properties. View the :ref:`API
documentation <api-docs-transaction>` to learn more about these methods.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how you can create a session, create a transaction, 
and commit a multi-document insert operation through the following steps:

1. Create a session from the client by using the ``startSession()`` method.
#. Set transaction options to configure transaction behavior.
#. Use the ``withTransaction()`` method to start a transaction.
#. Insert multiple documents. The ``withTransaction()`` method executes, commits, and aborts 
   the transaction. If any operation results in errors, ``withTransaction()`` handles canceling
   the transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Transaction.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start transaction
   :end-before: end transaction

If you require more control over your transactions, you can use the ``startTransaction()``
method. You can use this method with the ``commitTransaction()`` and ``abortTransaction()``
methods described in the preceding section to manually manage the transaction lifecycle. 

.. note:: Parallel Operations Not Supported

   The {+driver-short+} does not support running parallel operations within a single transaction.
