Avoid Storing Important User Data
---------------------------------

Avoid storing important user data in a realm on tvOS. Instead, it's
best to treat Realm as a rebuildable cache. 

.. note::

   The reason for this has to do with where Realm writes its
   :ref:`Realm files <ios-realm-file>`. On other Apple platforms,
   Realm writes its Realm files to the "Documents"
   directory. Because tvOS restricts writes to that directory, the
   default Realm file location on tvOS is instead ``NSCachesDirectory``.
   tvOS can purge files in that directory at any time, so reliable
   long-term persistence is not possible. For cloud-backed persistence
   on tvOS, consider using :ref:`Device Sync
   <ios-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

You can also use Realm as an initial data source by
:ref:`bundling prebuilt Realm files <ios-bundle-a-realm>` in your app.
Note that the :apple:`App Store guidelines <tvos/submit/>` limit your
app size to 4GB.

.. tip::

   Browse our :github:`tvOS examples
   <realm/realm-swift/tree/master/examples/tvos>` for sample tvOS apps
   that demonstrate how to use Realm as an offline cache.

Share Realm Files with TV Services Extensions
---------------------------------------------

To share a :ref:`Realm file <ios-realm-file>` between a tvOS app and a
TV services extension such as :apple:`Top Shelf
<design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/overview/top-shelf/>`, use the
``Library/Caches/`` directory in the shared container for the
application group:
