You can use the |compass-short| :abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)` to
import saved connections. This lets you use saved connections from
other workspaces or connections used by other team members.

Prerequisite
------------

To import saved connections, you must first :ref:`export the
connections <compass-export-connections-cli>`.

.. _compass-import-connections-cli-encrypted:

Import Encrypted Saved Connections
----------------------------------

Use this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is
:ref:`encrypted with a passphrase
<compass-export-connections-cli-encrypted>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To import unencrypted saved connections with the |compass-short|
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`, specify:

- The path to the |compass| executable. The name and filepath of the
  executable depend on your operating system.

- The ``--import-connections`` option set to the destination of the file
  containing saved connections.

- The ``--passphrase`` option set to the passphrase used to encrypt the
  exported file.

Your operation should resemble the following prototype:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> \
   --import-connections=<filename> \
   --passphrase=<passphrase>

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example imports saved |compass-short| connections from
a file with the path
``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json`` that is encrypted
with the passphrase ``abc123``.

Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass
executable:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./MongoDB\ Compass \
   --import-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \
   --passphrase=abc123

.. note::

   The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating
   system. The preceding command is for macOS.

Results
```````

After you run the import command, you will see this output:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Importing connections from "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json" (with passphrase)
   
MongoDB Compass starts and you will see the imported connections under
:guilabel:`Saved Connections` on the Connect screen.

Errors
~~~~~~

When you try to import encrypted saved connections, you may
see these errors:

- If do not specify a passphrase, you will see this error:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     Failed to perform operation Be [Error]: Input file contains encrypted
     secrets but no passphrase was provided
   
- If you specify an incorrect passphrase, you will see this error:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false
  
     Failed to perform operation Be [Error]: Cannot decrypt due to corrupt
     data or wrong passphrase

Import Unencrypted Saved Connections
---------------------------------------

Use this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is not
encrypted with a passphrase.

   Importing connections from "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json" (without passphrase)
   
MongoDB Compass starts and you will see the imported connections under
:guilabel:`Saved Connections` on the Connect screen.
