Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are viewing your
documents in List, JSON, or Table view:

   :alt: Document View Selection


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To modify a document, hover over the document and click the pencil
      icon:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Document Edit Selection

      After you click the pencil icon, the document enters edit mode.
      You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
      of values.

      Delete Fields
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To delete a field from a document, click the :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` icon to 
      the left of the field:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc3.png
         :figwidth: 740px
         :alt: Document Deletion

      Once selected, the field is marked for removal and appears
      highlighted in red. |compass-short| asks for confirmation that you want to 
      update the document by removing the field.

      Add New Fields
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To add a new field in the document after an existing field, hover
      over the row number in the dialog and click on the plus sign. The
      row number is not part of the document but is part of the dialog
      display.

      You can also add a new field at the end of the document by
      pressing the tab key when your text cursor is in the value of the
      last document field.

      Modify an Existing Field
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To modify documents, click on existing field names or
      values and make changes. In this example, the ``borough`` was
      changed from ``Manhattan`` to ``Queens``. Changed fields appear highlighted in
      yellow:

      When you are finished editing the document, click the ``Update``
      button to commit your changes.
