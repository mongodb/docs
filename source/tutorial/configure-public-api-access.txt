   To access the |mms| |api|, you must generate an |api| key for
   :ref:`programmatic access <mms-prog-api-key>` for an organization.

.. cond:: cloud

   To access the |mms| |api| using
   :ref:`applications <mms-prog-api-key>`,
   generate an |api| key for your organization.

.. admonition:: API Keys can't use the |mms| Console
   :class: note

   Organization-based |api| Keys aren't associated with user
   credentials. You can't use these |api| Keys to log in to the |mms|
   console.

Require an API Access List for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |mms| users with a non-empty |api| access list all |api| access must
originate from an |ipv4| address in the access list. Ensure your 
configured access list entries provide appropriate coverage for all 
clients that require |api| access. An empty |api| access list grants 
access to all |api| endpoints except those that explicitly require an access list.

|mms| supports requiring an |api| access list at the organization
level, such that any |api| activity for all projects within that
organization must originate from an entry on each respective
|mms| user's |api| access list. For organizations that require an |api|
access list, |mms| users cannot access any |api| operations until
they define at least one |api| access list entry.

To require an |api| access list for an Organization:

1. Log into |mms|.

#. Access the Organization using the :guilabel:`Context` picker in
   the top-left hand corner of the |mms| UI.

#. Click :guilabel:`Settings` from the left hand navigation.

#. Toggle the :guilabel:`Require IP Access List for {+admin-api+}`
   setting to :guilabel:`On`.

Manage Access to the API
------------------------

You can set API Keys for an entire organization or project.
