.. note:: While basic queries using spherical distance are supported by
   the ``2d`` index, consider moving to a ``2dsphere`` index if your
   data is primarily longitude and latitude.

The ``2d`` index supports queries that calculate distances on a
Euclidean plane (flat surface). The index also supports the following
query operators and command that calculate distances using spherical
geometry:

- :query:`$nearSphere`

- :query:`$centerSphere`

- :query:`$near`

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command with the ``{ spherical: true }`` option.

.. important:: These three queries use radians for distance. Other query
   types do not.

   For spherical query operators to function properly, you must convert
   distances to radians, and convert from radians to the distances units
   used by your application.

   To convert:

   - *distance to radians*: divide the distance by the radius of the
     sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the same units as the distance
     measurement.

   - *radians to distance*: multiply the radian measure by the radius
     of the sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the units system that you want to
     convert the distance to.

   The equatorial radius of the Earth is approximately ``3,963.2``
   miles or ``6,378.1`` kilometers.

The following query would return documents from the ``places``
collection within the circle described by the center ``[ -74, 40.74 ]``
with a radius of ``100`` miles:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $geoWithin: { $centerSphere: [ [ -74, 40.74 ] ,
                                                        100 / 3963.2 ] } } } )

You may also use the ``distanceMultiplier`` option to the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` to convert radians in the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
process, rather than in your application code. See :ref:`distance
multiplier <geospatial-indexes-distance-multiplier>`.

The following spherical query, returns all documents in the
collection ``places`` within ``100`` miles from the point ``[ -74,
40.74 ]``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "places",
                    near: [ -74, 40.74 ],
                    spherical: true
                  }  )

The output of the above command would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      // [ ... ]
      "results" : [
         {
            "dis" : 0.01853688938212826,
            "obj" : {
               "_id" : ObjectId( ... )
               "loc" : [
                  -73,
                  40
               ]
            }
         }
      ],
      "stats" : {
         // [ ... ]
         "avgDistance" : 0.01853688938212826,
         "maxDistance" : 0.01853714811400047
      },
      "ok" : 1
   }

Distance Multiplier
-------------------

The ``distanceMultiplier`` option of the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command returns
distances only after multiplying the results by an assigned value. This allows
MongoDB to return converted values, and removes the requirement to
convert units in application logic.

Using ``distanceMultiplier`` in spherical queries provides results from
the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command that do not need radian-to-distance
conversion. The following example uses ``distanceMultiplier`` in the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command with a :doc:`spherical
</tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes>` example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "places",
                    near: [ -74, 40.74 ],
                    spherical: true,
                    distanceMultiplier: 3963.2
                  }  )

The output of the above operation would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      // [ ... ]
      "results" : [
         {
            "dis" : 73.46525170413567,
            "obj" : {
               "_id" : ObjectId( ... )
               "loc" : [
                  -73,
                  40
               ]
            }
         }
      ],
      "stats" : {
         // [ ... ]
         "avgDistance" : 0.01853688938212826,
         "maxDistance" : 0.01853714811400047
      },
      "ok" : 1
   }
