Resize Text Labels
------------------

You can resize the text labels on a chart. Resizing text labels changes:

- Axis labels
- Axis tick labels
- Data value labels
- Data category labels
- Legend caption and entries

To set this option:

1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Customization` tab in the
   :doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`.

#. In the :guilabel:`General Customization` section, set the
   :guilabel:`Label Size` slider to the desired text size. You can 
   adjust label text to be between 50% and 200% of the default text 
   size.

Applicable Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This customization option is available for all charts *except*
:ref:`Gauge <gauge-chart-example>`,
:ref:`Number <number-chart-example>`,
:ref:`Table <data-table-example>`, and
:ref:`Word Cloud <word-cloud-example>` charts.

Customize Legend
----------------

You can show or hide a chart legend. If you show the legend, you can 
specify its position relative to your chart.

To set this option:

1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Customization` tab in the
   :doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`.

#. In the :guilabel:`General Customization` section, set the 
   :guilabel:`Legend` toggle switch to the desired setting. The 
   legend is shown by default.

#. If you toggle :guilabel:`Legend` on, you may select a position for 
   the legend relative to the chart:

   - Right
   - Bottom
   - Top

   The legend is positioned to the right of the chart by default.

Applicable Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This customization option is available for all charts which may display 
a legend. This includes any multi-series chart, as well as charts that 
have a field mapped to a Color, Intensity, Shape or Size channel.

Color Palette Customization
---------------------------

Palette customization allows you to select custom colors for your
chart. To enable color customization, select the
:guilabel:`Customization` tab of the :guilabel:`Chart Type` column.
A toggle switch labeled :guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` appears in
the :guilabel:`General Customization` section. 

Most chart types allow you to customize individual colors in their
palette. The :ref:`heatmap <heatmap-chart-ref>` and :ref:`colored bar
and column <column-bar-chart-ref>` types use a gradient color scale,
while other types use a custom color picker. The gradient color
scale allows you to choose from a set of pre-defined gradients.

Other chart types use a color picker for selecting a customized
set of colors.

For chart types which use a color picker for customization,
each numbered color swatch corresponds to a data series on the chart.
Select a color swatch to modify the color of its corresponding
data series. You can select a new color with a color slider, by
entering a hex value, by entering RGB values, or by choosing a
predefined color. You can also drag and drop the existing color
selections if you want to use the current color choices but change
which color goes with which data series.

.. note::

   By default, the custom color picker shows color swatches for 10
   data series, but you can only modify as many of the swatches as
   you have data series. The palette can expand to show 20 data series. 
   Charts will use as many colors as needed to show your chart,
   starting from the first color. For example, if you have only two
   data series in your chart, only the colors numbered ``1`` and
   ``2`` have any effect on your chart.

To close the color customization tool, click somewhere outside it.
To revert the entire chart to its default colors, set the
:guilabel:`Custom Color Palette` toggle switch back to :guilabel:`Off`.

Applicable Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This customization option is available for all chart types except
:ref:`Text <chart-type-text-charts>`.
