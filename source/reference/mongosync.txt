Definition
----------

The ``mongosync`` binary is the primary process used in {+c2c-product-name+}. 
``mongosync`` migrates data from a source cluster to a 
destination cluster and keeps the clusters in continuous sync until you 
:ref:`finalize <c2c-about-finalizing>` the sync. 
In addition to continuous data synchronization, ``mongosync`` can also
perform a one time data migration between clusters.

For an overview of the ``mongosync`` process, see :ref:`about-mongosync`.

To get started with ``mongosync``, refer to the :ref:`Quick Start Guide
<c2c-quickstart>`.

The :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <c2c-faq>` page addresses questions users have asked about ``mongosync``.

Compatibility
-------------

- .. include:: /includes/fact-partial-8.0-support.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-minimum-server-version-support.rst
     
  You can migrate data on clusters (source) with versions of MongoDB
  lower than 6.0 to an Atlas cluster (destination). Migration from clusters with
  lower version requires additional preparation and configuration in
  the clusters with the lower version. `Contact
  <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about 
  Professional Services.  

- ``mongosync`` supports replica sets and sharded clusters.
- Standalone MongoDB instances are not supported. :ref:`Convert the
  standalone instance <server-replica-set-deploy-convert>` to a
  replica set before using {+c2c-product-name+}. 
- ``mongosync`` does not support Atlas shared clusters or serverless 
  instances. 
- For a full list of limitations, see :ref:`Cluster-to-Cluster Sync
  Limitations<c2c-limitations>`.
