.. dbcommand:: dropIndexes

   The :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command drops one or all indexes from
   the current collection.
   To drop all indexes, issue the command like so:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dropIndexes: "collection", index: "*" }

   To drop a single, issue the command by specifying the name
   of the index you want to drop. For example, to drop the index
   named ``age_1``, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { dropIndexes: "collection", index: "age_1" }

   The shell provides a useful command helper. Here's the equivalent command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.dropIndex("age_1");

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.
