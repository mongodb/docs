            Use this connection type if you enabled peering:
      
            - For |gcp| or |azure| and are connecting with {{connChoice}}
              from a peered network, or
            - For |aws| and are connecting with {{connChoice}} from a
              peered network which uses a custom |dns| service.
      
            If neither of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
            access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
            connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
            network, this might be the preferred option.

               If your application isn't hosted on the same cloud service
               provider as your cluster's :term:`primary`, the application
               can only perform secondary reads.

            endpoint if you are connecting with {{connChoice}} over a
            Private Endpoint connection either because {{connChoice}}:
      
            - Runs inside your cloud provider network, or
            - Has transitive network access to your cloud provider network.
            - You want to use an :ref:`optimized connection string
              <optimized-connection-strings>`.
      
            If none of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
            access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
            connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
            network, this might be the preferred option.

            If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an

               1. Select ``mongosh`` from the dropdown menu.
                  We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version
                  of the shell. To check the installed version of the
                  {+mongosh+}, run:
      
                  .. code-block:: sh
      
                     mongosh --version
      
               #. *Step 2* of the |service| modal displays a copyable
                  connection string that includes the name of the
                  MongoDB user that can authenticate with the {+database-deployment+}. Copy
                  this string. To connect as a different MongoDB user,
                  change the :mongosh:`--username </reference/options/#std-option-mongosh.--username>`
                  option.
      
               #. Paste the {+mongosh+} command and connection string into a
                  terminal. Run the command. The shell prompts you for the
                  :mongosh:`password </reference/options/#std-option-mongosh.--password>`.
