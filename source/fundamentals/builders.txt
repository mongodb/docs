Overview
--------

This section includes guides on how to use each of the available
builders, and demonstrates the utility the MongoDB Java driver builder classes
provide.

The Java driver provides classes to simplify the process for developers
to use CRUD operations and the Aggregation API. The static utility methods allow you
to build a query more efficiently.

Why Use Builders?
-----------------

Using the builders class, you leverage the power of:

- The Java compiler and the IDE to find errors during development
- The IDE for discovery and code completion

When using builders, the Java compiler and the IDE catch errors such as misspelled
operators early on. When using the MongoDB shell or plain Java, you
write operators as strings and get no visual sign of a problem,
pushing these errors to runtime instead of compile time

With the builder classes, you write operators as methods. The IDE
instantly underlines and gives you a red bar on the right indicating
something is wrong. While developing, the IDE also shows you the
methods you can use. It automatically completes your code with
placeholder parameters once you select which method you want to use.

Scenario
--------

Imagine we want to send a marketing email to all users in our ``users``
collection with the following criteria:

- Users that identify as "female" gender
- Users that are older than "29"

We only want their email address, so we want to ensure our query doesn't
return data we pay bandwidth costs for but don't need.

Using the MongoDB Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: js

   collection.find({ "gender": "female", "age" : { "$gt": 29 }}, { "_id": 0, "email": 1 })

Without Using Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java

   Bson filter = new Document().append("gender", "female").append("age", new Document().append("$gt", 29));
   Bson projection = new Document().append("_id", 0).append("email", 1);
   collection.find(filter).projection(projection);

Using Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: java

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;
   ...

   Bson filter = and(eq("gender", "female"), gt("age", 29));
   Bson projection = fields(excludeId(), include("email"));
   collection.find(filter).projection(projection);
