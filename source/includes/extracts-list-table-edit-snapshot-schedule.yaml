      * - :guilabel:`Take snapshots every ... hours and save for ... days`

        - Sets how frequently, in hours, |mms| takes a base snapshot of
          the deployment and the number of days |mms| retains base
          snapshots.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/snapshot-schedule-changes-and-pricing.rst

      * - :guilabel:`Create cluster checkpoint every ... minutes`
          (Sharded Clusters only)

        - Sets how frequently, in minutes, |mms| creates a
          :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoint>` in between snapshots of a
          sharded cluster. Checkpoints provide restore points that you
          can use to create custom *point-in-time* snapshots.

          See :ref:`checkpoint`.

      * - :guilabel:`Store daily snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains daily snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Store weekly snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of weeks that |mms| retains weekly snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Store monthly snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of months that |mms| retains monthly snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Allow point-in-time restores going back`

        - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains oplogs alongside snapshots.

          See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview` for how snapshots and
          point-in-time restores work.

      * - :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day (UTC)`

        - Sets the time of day at `UTC
          <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html>`_ from which 
          the snapshot schedule starts. When you change the :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day`, 
          snapshots that are in progress remain unaffected. Only snapshots
          taken after you change the reference time follow the updated schedule.

          .. note::
             Changing the reference time causes the next scheduled snapshot to occur
             at the next instance of the new reference time after the next originally
             scheduled snapshot. If you set the reference time to a time before the
             originally scheduled next snapshot, the next snapshot occurs 24 hours
             after the new reference time. If you set the reference time to a time
             after the next originally scheduled snapshot and make the change before
             the next originally scheduled next snapshot, the next snapshot occurs 
             at the desired time today. However, if you set the reference time to a time after
             the next originally scheduled snapshot but make the change after the next
             originally scheduled snapshot, the next snapshot occurs 24 hours after
             the new reference time.

             .. example::

                It is currently 13:00 UTC. You change the
                :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day (UTC)` to 10:00 UTC:

                - If you are using a *24-hour* snapshot schedule, all
                  snapshots are suspended until *tomorrow* at 10:00 UTC.

                - If you are using a *6-hour* snapshot schedule, all 
                  snapshots are suspended until *today* at 16:00 UTC.

             See :ref:`Snapshot Frequency and Retention <changing-reference-time>`
             for more details and examples.
