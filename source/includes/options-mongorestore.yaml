   If specified,
   
   - Starting in version 4.2, {{program}} inserts the documents in the
     order of their appearance in the input source. That is, both the
     bulk write batch order and document order within the batches are
     maintained.

   - In earlier versions, only the batch order is maintained; document
     order within batches are not maintained.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2,
   specifying {{role}} also enables :option:`--stopOnError
   <mongorestore --stopOnError>` and sets
   :option:`numInsertionWorkersPerCollection 
   <mongorestore --numInsertionWorkersPerCollection>` to 1.

   If unspecified, {{program}} may perform the insertions in an
   arbitrary order.

program: mongorestore
name: db
aliases: -d
directive: option
args:  <database>
description: |

  Specifies the destination database for {{program}} to restore data
  *into* when restoring from a BSON file. If the database does not
  exist, {{program}} creates the database. For example, the following
  restores the ``salaries`` collection into the ``reporting`` database.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     mongorestore --db reporting dump/test/salaries.bson 

  If you do not specify {{role}}, {{program}} takes the database name
  from the data files.

  The use of :option:`--db` and :option:`--collection` options are
  deprecated when restoring from a directory or an archive file.
  Instead, to restore from an archive or a directory, see
  :option:`--nsInclude` instead.
  
  .. note::
   
      You cannot specify both {{role}} and :option:`--uri`.
 
optional: true

program: mongorestore
name: collection
aliases: -c
directive: option
args: <collection>
description: |

  Specifies the name of the destination collection for {{program}} to
  restore data *into* when restoring from a BSON file. If
  you do not specify {{role}}, {{program}} takes
  the collection name from the input filename. If the input file has an
  extension, MongoDB omits the extension of the file from the collection
  name.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     mongorestore --db reporting --collection employeesalaries dump/test/salaries.bson 

  The use of :option:`--db` and :option:`--collection` options are
  deprecated when restoring from a directory or an archive file.
  Instead, to restore from an archive or a directory, see
  :option:`--nsInclude` instead.

description: |
  Forces {{program}} to validate all requests from clients

program: mongorestore
name: drop
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Before restoring the collections from the dumped backup, drops the
  collections from the target database. {{role}} does not drop
  collections that are not in the backup.

  When the restore includes the ``admin`` database, {{program}} with
  {{role}} removes all user credentials and replaces them with the
  users defined in the dump file. Therefore, in systems with
  :setting:`~security.authorization` enabled, {{program}} must be able
  to authenticate to an existing user *and* to a user defined in the
  dump file. If {{program}} can't authenticate to a user defined in the
  dump file, the restoration process will fail, leaving an empty
  database.

optional: true

program: mongorestore
name: oplogReplay
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  After restoring the database dump, replays the :term:`oplog` entries
  from a bson file.
  When used in conjunction with :option:`mongodump --oplog`,
  :binary:`mongorestore --oplogReplay <~bin.mongorestore>`
  restores the database to the point-in-time backup captured with the
  ``mongodump --oplog`` command. 
  
  {{program}} searches for any valid source  for the bson file
  in the following locations:

  - The top level of the dump directory, as in the case of a dump created
    with :option:`mongodump --oplog`.

  - The path specified by :option:`--oplogFile`.

  - ``<dump-directory>/local/oplog.rs.bson``, as in the case of a dump
    of the ``oplog.rs`` collection in the ``local`` database
    on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` that is a member of a replica set.

  If there is an ``oplog.bson`` file at the top level of the dump
  directory **and** a path specified by :option:`--oplogFile`,
  {{program}} returns an error.
     
  If there is an ``oplog.bson`` file at the top level of the dump directory,
  {{program}} restores that file as the oplog. If there are also bson
  files in the ``dump/local`` directory, {{program}} restores them like
  normal collections.
  
  If you specify an oplog file using :option:`--oplogFile`,
  {{program}} restores that file as the oplog. If there are also bson
  files in the ``dump/local`` directory, {{program}} restores them like
  normal collections.
  
  For an example of {{role}}, see :ref:`backup-restore-oplogreplay`.

  .. note::

     When using :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` with {{role}} to restore
     a replica set, you must 
     restore a full dump of a :term:`replica set` member created 
     using :binary:`~bin.mongodump --oplog <mongodump>`. 
     :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` with {{role}} fails if you use any of 
     the following options to limit the data be restored:

     - :option:`--db`
     - :option:`--collection`
     - :option:`--nsInclude`
     - :option:`--nsExclude`

  Restores from an archive file or from the standard input (``stdin``).

  To restore from an archive file, run {{program}} with the ``--archive``
  option and the archive filename.

  To restore from the standard input, run {{program}} with the
  ``--archive`` option but *omit* the filename.

  .. note::

     - You cannot use the ``--archive`` option with the :option:`--dir`
       option. 

     - If you use the {{role}} option with the :option:`\<path\>`
       parameter, {{program}} ignores :option:`\<path\>` parameter.

      restore a *single* collection from the standard input.
