Configuration File Options

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   MongoDB introduces a YAML-based configuration file format; however
   the :v2.4:`2.4 configuration file format
   </reference/configuration-options>` remains for backward
   compatibility.

Synopsis
--------

Administrators and users can control :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` instances at runtime either directly from
:doc:`mongod's command line arguments </reference/program/mongod>` or using a
configuration file.

While both methods are functionally equivalent and all settings are
similar, the configuration file method is preferable. If you
installed from a package and have started MongoDB using your system's
:term:`control script`, you're already using a configuration file.

To start :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` using a config file,
use one of the following forms:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf
   mongod -f /etc/mongodb.conf
   mongos --config /srv/mongodb/mongos.conf
   mongos -f /srv/mongodb/mongos.conf

The configuration file is in `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_ format:
specify a single YAML document or record with options describe
below. Consider the following configuration file fragment:

.. code-block:: yaml

   systemLog:
      quiet: true
      path: /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
      logAppend: true
      destination:
   storage:
      journal:
         enabled: true
   processManagement:
      fork: true
   net:
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1
      port: 27017
   ...
