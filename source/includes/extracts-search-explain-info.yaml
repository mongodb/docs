ref: explain-args
content: | 

  The :ref:`explain response <explain-response>` of a search command 
  contains information about the query executed with that command. The 
  response in the ``args`` field includes structured details of what
  Lucene queries |fts| executed to satisfy a ``$search`` query. 

  This section contains: 

  - Some of the Lucene queries that |fts| operators create
  - Lucene query options that are included in the structured summary 
  - Lucene query structured summary example for each Lucene query type

  .. note:: About the Examples

     The examples in this section are based on queries run against the 
     :ref:`sample datasets <available-sample-datasets>` with the 
     ``queryPlanner`` :ref:`verbosity mode <explain-verbosity>`. In the 
     example response, the: 
    
     - ``mongotQuery`` field shows the |fts| operator and the query 
       that was run. 
     - ``explain.type`` field shows the Lucene Query that the operator 
       created.

  The ``explain`` response for :manual:`executionStats 
  </reference/explain-results/#explain.executionStats>` and 
  :manual:`allPlansExecution
  </reference/explain-results/#explain.executionStats>` verbosity modes 
  includes a ``stats`` field that contains information on how much 
  :ref:`time <timing-breakdown>` a query spends in various :ref:`stages 
  of query <areas-of-query>` execution. 

---
ref: explain-time-breakdown
content: | 

  The timing breakdown describes execution statistics pertinent to an 
  :ref:`area of query <areas-of-query>` execution. The following fields 
  show the timing breakdown:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1 
     :widths: 15 15 70 

     * - Field
       - Type
       - Description

     * - ``millisElapsed``
       - Long
       - Approximate wall-clock time elapsed performing tasks in this 
         :ref:`area <areas-of-query>` including the amount of time the 
         children of the query spent in this :ref:`area 
         <areas-of-query>`. The value is approximate number of 
         milliseconds elapsed while performing tasks in this area.

     * - ``invocationCounts`` 
       - Docuemnt
       - Number of invocations of tasks included in this :ref:`area 
         <areas-of-query>`. The value is a map of task names to their 
         invocation count.

ref: explain-areas-of-query
content: | 

  Statistics are available for the following areas of query:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1 
     :widths: 20 80 

     * - Option
       - Description

     * - ``context`` 
       - Statistics related to the execution of the Lucene query. There 
         are two tasks whose invocation counts are enumerated in this 
         area: 
        
         .. list-table:: 
            :widths: 20 80 

            * - ``createScorer``
              - Scorer iterates over documents and generates a score for 
                each document. Invocations of ``createScorer`` create the 
                object responsible for scoring. Note that time associated 
                with this task is not time spent actually scoring 
                documents. Count includes the number of 
                ``scorerSupplier`` invocations.

            * - ``createWeight``
              - Weight stores state associated with a query and 
                ``IndexSearcher``. Count includes the number of 
                ``createWeight`` invocations.
        
         The :ref:`time <timing-breakdown>` spent in this area is related 
         to the structure of the query, and is not based on the number of 
         results that are iterated through and scored. 

         For example: 

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: false 

            "context" : {
              "millisElapsed" : NumberDouble(4.934751),
              "invocationCounts" : {
                "createWeight" : NumberLong(1),
                "createScorer" : NumberLong(10)
              }
            }

     * - ``match``
       - Statistics related to iterating over and matching result 
         documents. This statistic shows the time it takes to determine 
         which document is the next match. Time spent matching results 
         can vary significantly depending on the nature of the query. 
         There are two tasks whose invocation counts are enumerated in 
         this area: 

         .. list-table:: 
            :widths: 20 80 

            * - ``nextDoc`` 
              - Requests to advance to the next document of the result 
                set. This involves identifying and moving past skips, or 
                other tasks necessary to find the next match. Count 
                includes the number of ``nextDoc`` and ``advance`` 
                invocations.

            * - ``refineRoughMatch`` 
              - Performs a more thorough match. Some queries execute in a 
                two-phase process where a document is first "roughly" 
                matched, and is checked with a second, more thorough 
                phase only after satisfying the first rough match. The 
                ``refineRoughMatch`` task is the second phase of the 
                two-phase process. Count includes the number of ``refineRoughMatch`` invocations.

         For example: 

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: false 

            "match" : {
              "millisElapsed" : NumberDouble(4.901597),
              "invocationCounts" : {
                "nextDoc" : NumberLong(541),
                "refineRoughMatch" : NumberLong(0)
              }
            }

     * - ``score``
       - Statistics related to scoring documents in the result set. There 
         are two tasks whose invocation counts are enumerated in this 
         area:

         .. list-table:: 
            :widths: 20 80 

            * - ``score``
              - Scores each document in the result set. Count includes 
                the number of ``score`` invocations.

            * - ``setMinCompetitiveScore``
              - Ignores documents whose score is less than the given 
                value. Indicates that a query may have been able to 
                reduce the number of scoring operations performed by 
                ignoring documents with scores below some uncompetitive 
                threshold. Count includes the number of 
                ``setMinCompetitiveScore`` invocations.

         For example: 

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: false 

            "score" : {
              "millisElapsed" : NumberDouble(3.931312),
              "invocationCounts" : {
                "score" : NumberLong(536),
                "setMinCompetitiveScore" : NumberLong(0)
              }
            }

  The ``resultMaterialization`` tracks the amount of time ``mongot`` takes
  to accomplish the following: 

  a. Retrieve result data stored in Lucene in the form of either ``_id`` or
     ``storedSource``. 
  #. Serialize the data into |bson| format before sending it to ``mongod``.

ref: explain-resource-usage
content: | 

  The ``resourceUsage`` tracks the resource used for running the query. It
  contains the following fields:

  .. list-table:: 
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 15 10 65

     * - Option 
       - Type

       - Purpose

     * - ``majorFaults``
       - Long
       - Required
       - Number of major page faults, which occur when the system
         can't find the required data in memory resulting in reading from
         the backing store such as disk, during query execution.

     * - ``minorFaults``
       - Long
       - Required
       - Number of minor page faults, which occur when the data
         is in the page cache, but hasn't yet been mapped to the process'
         page table. 

     * - ``userTimeMs``
       - Long
       - Required
       - Amount of CPU time, in milliseconds, spent in user
         space. 

     * - ``systemTimeMs``
       - Long
       - Required
       - Amount of CPU time, in milliseconds, spent in system
         space. 

     * - ``maxReportingThreads``
       - Integer
       - Required
       - Maximum number of threads that ``mongot`` used during
         query execution across all batches. For non-concurrent explain
         queries, the value is ``1``.

     * - ``numBatches``
       - Integer
       - Required
       - Total number of batches that ``mongot`` was requested
         when processing the query.
