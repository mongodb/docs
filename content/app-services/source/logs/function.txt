Overview
--------

Function logs are created whenever a user calls an Atlas Function using a
Realm SDK. While you can execute Functions with a
:ref:`Trigger <triggers>`, only functions directly called
from an SDK generate logs of the function type.

Log Format
----------

Function log entries have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   Logs:
   [
      <log line>,
      <log line>,
      ...
   ]

   {
      "arguments": [
         <arg1>,
         <arg2>
      ],
      "name": <function name>,
      "service": ""
   }

   Function Call Location: <location>

   Compute Used: <number> bytesâ€¢ms

   Remote IP Address: <ip address>

   SDK: <sdk>

   Platform Version: <version>

       .. example::

          This request came from the Realm Web SDK version 4.0.0
          running on Mozilla Firefox:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: firefox v4.0.0

          This request came from the Realm Java SDK version 4.6.0 running
          on Android Marshmallow:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: android v4.6.0

   * - Function Call Location
     - The data center in which the function was executed.

   * - Logs
     - A list of ``console.log`` outputs. App Services saves the first 512 bytes of the last 25 ``console.log()`` calls.
