.. phpmethod:: MongoDB\BulkWriteResult::getUpsertedIds()

   Return a map of IDs (i.e. ``_id`` field values) for documents that were
   upserted by all update and replace operations in the bulk write.

   .. code-block:: php

      function getUpsertedIds(): array

Return Values
-------------

A map of IDs (i.e. ``_id`` field values) for documents that were upserted by all
update and replace operations in the bulk write.

The index of each ID in the map corresponds to each document's position in the
bulk operation. If a document had an ID prior to upserting (i.e. the server did
not generate an ID), the index will contain its ``_id`` field value. Any
server-generated ID will be a :php:`MongoDB\BSON\ObjectId
<class.mongodb-bson-objectid>` instance.
