|service| {+free-clusters+} provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. {+Free-clusters+} never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster`.

.. note::

   You can deploy only one {+free-cluster+} per |service| project.

Procedure
---------

You can create {+free-clusters+} through the `{+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/>`__, 
|service| User Interface, and |service| Administration API. Select the appropriate 
tab based on how you would like to create the {+free-clusters+}.

.. tabs:: 

   
   .. tab:: Atlas CLI 
      :tabid: atlascli  

      To create a free cluster using the {+atlas-cli+}, run the
      ``atlas quickstart`` command: 

      .. code-block:: 

         atlas quickstart [options]  

      ``atlas quickstart`` performs the following steps in the getting started
      process:

      - Create one cluster in your |service| project
      - Load :doc:`sample data </sample-data/available-sample-datasets/>` 
        into your |service| cluster
      - Add your IP address to your project's IP access list 
      - Create a MongoDB user for your |service| cluster
      
      To learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see 
      `Set Up Atlas with atlas quickstart <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/atlas-cli-quickstart>`__.

      .. see:: Related Links

         - `Install the {+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/install-atlas-cli/>`__
         - `Connect to the {+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/connect-atlas-cli/>`__
 
   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui 

      To create a free cluster through the |service| UI:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-create-cluster.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Administration API 
      :tabid: api 

      To create a free cluster using the |service| Administration API, 
      send a ``POST`` request to the ``clusters`` endpoint with the 
      ``instanceSize`` set to ``M0``. To learn more about the resource 
      and parameters, see: 

      - :ref:`create-one-cluster-ref`
      - :ref:`create-one-advanced-cluster-ref`
  

Next Steps
----------

Now that your {+cluster+} is provisioned, proceed to
:doc:`/security/add-ip-address-to-list`.
