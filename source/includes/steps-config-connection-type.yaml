  - :guilabel:`Standard connection` - to configure this type of 
    connection, you must do the following: 

    1. :ref:`add-ip-address`
    #. :ref:`create-mdb-user`

  - :guilabel:`Private endpoint` - to configure this type of 
    connection, you must do the following:

     connections including those over PrivateLink.
