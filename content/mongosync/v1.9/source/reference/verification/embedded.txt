``mongosync`` includes an embedded verifier to perform a series
of checks on the destination cluster to verify the sync of
supported collections.

About this Task
---------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-verifier-limitations

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Initialize ``mongosync``

     Initialize the ``mongosync`` process:

     .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/verification/embedded/1.sh
        :language: shell

   .. step:: Start the Sync

      To start syncing data from the source cluster to the
      destination, use the :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>`
      endpoint.

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/verification/embedded/2.sh
         :language: shell

      Example output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      Note, the verifier is enabled by default for replica set
      migrations.

   .. step:: Examine Progress

      To examine the status of the sync, use the :ref:`/progress
      <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/progress.sh
         :language: shell

      Example output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/progress.json
         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      Examine the ``verification`` response field for
      information on the status of the embedded verifier.

Behavior
--------

Verification Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The embedded verifier performs a series of checks on the
destination cluster. It checks all supported collections to
confirm that ``mongosync`` was successful in transferring
documents from the source cluster to the destination.

If the verifier encounters errors, it fails the migration with
an error. If the verifier finds no errors, the ``/progress``
endpoint returns ``canWrite: true``. To learn more about the ``canWrite`` field, 
see :ref:`c2c-canWrite-committed`.

Please `contact <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ support to
investigate verification issues.
