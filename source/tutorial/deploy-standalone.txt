You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance for |mms| to 
manage. Use standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments for production systems as they lack 
replication and high availability. For all production deployments
use replica sets. To learn about replica sets, see 
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.

Prerequisites

          content: |

            You must :doc:`provision a server </tutorial/nav/add-servers>`
            to which to deploy. For testing purposes, you can use your 
            localhost.

            To deploy a standalone using a Kubernetes object, you need
