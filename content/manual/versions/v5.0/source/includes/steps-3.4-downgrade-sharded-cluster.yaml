  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the 3.2 series.  If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the 3.2 binaries, then perform the actual downgrade

ref: 3.4-downgrade-shard

   Downgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

   1. Downgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace the |newversion|
         binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options.
 
         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> 

         Of if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>` and :setting:`net.port` and start:

         .. code-block:: yaml

            sharding:
               clusterRole: shardsvr
            net:
               port: <port>
            storage:
               dbpath: <path>

         Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         downgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's
         state, you can issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
         :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

         Repeat for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
      election of a new primary:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown()

   #. When :method:`rs.status()`
      shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
      has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, downgrade the stepped-down primary: 

      1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options.
 
         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> 

         Or if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>` and :setting:`net.port` and start the
         |oldversion| binary:

         .. code-block:: yaml

            sharding:
               clusterRole: shardsvr
            net:
               port: <port>
            storage:
               dbpath: <path>

         Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.
