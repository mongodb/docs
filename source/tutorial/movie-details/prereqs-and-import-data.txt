Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial you will need a
`MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_ cluster. Refer
to the :atlas:`Create a Cluster </create-new-cluster/>` documentation
for instructions on creating an |service| cluster.

Load the Sample Data into Your |service| Cluster
------------------------------------------------

|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
cluster. To load sample data into your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data.rst

The following is a sample document from the dataset:

Now that you have a data source in |charts-short|, you
can :ref:`Create a New Dashboard <movie-data-new-dash>` which will
hold the visualizations.
