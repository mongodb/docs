   You are prompted to verify your identity:

   - If you use |mfa|, you are prompted verify your identity with your 
     chosen |mfa-short| authentication method.
    
   - If you use Google SSO or do not have |mfa| configured, MongoDB 
     sends a code to your email address. Use that code to verify your 
     identity. Accounts that use Google SSO are automatically 
     unlinked as part of the account deletion process.

   Your account is deleted.
