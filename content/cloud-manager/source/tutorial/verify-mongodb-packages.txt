Starting in |mms| {+magent-version-cloud+}, the MongoDB release team
digitally signs |mms| packages to certify that they are valid and
unaltered MongoDB releases. Before installing |mms|, validate the
package using the provided PGP signature.

PGP signatures provide the strongest guarantees by checking both the
authenticity and integrity of a file to prevent tampering.

Verify a PGP/GPG file
---------------------

MongoDB signs each release branch with a different PGP key. The public
key files for the Mongodb Agent are available for download from the 
`key server <https://pgp.mongodb.com/>`__ in both textual ``.asc`` and
binary ``.pub`` formats under `automation-agent.asc
<https://pgp.mongodb.com/automation-agent.asc>`__ and
`automation-agent.pub <https://pgp.mongodb.com/automation-agent.pub>`__,
respectively.
