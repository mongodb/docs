The |k8s-op-short| can orchestrate the recovery of MongoDB replica set
members to a healthy |k8s| cluster when the |k8s-op-short| identifies
that the original |k8s| cluster is down.

.. _disaster-recovery-modes:

Disaster Recovery Modes
-----------------------

The |k8s-op-short| can orchestrate either an automatic or manual remediation
of the |mongodb-multis| in a disaster recovery scenario, using one of the following modes:

- **Auto Failover Mode** allows the |k8s-op-short| to shift the affected
  MongoDB replica set members from an unhealthy |k8s| cluster to healthy
  |k8s| clusters. When the |k8s-op-short| performs this auto remediation,
  it evenly distributes replica set members across the healthy |k8s| clusters.
  
  To enable this mode, use ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=true`` in
  the MongoDB Helm Charts for |k8s|. In the ``values.yaml`` file in the
  `MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes 
  <https://mongodb.github.io/helm-charts>`__ directory,
  the environment's variable default value is ``true``.

  Alternatively, you can set the |multi-cluster| environment variable
  ``PERFORM_FAILOVER`` to ``true``, as in the following abbreviated example:

  .. code-block:: yaml
     :copyable: false

     spec:
       template:
         ...
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: mongodb-enterprise-operator
             ...
             env:
             ...   
             - name: PERFORM_FAILOVER
               value: "true"
             ...
  

- **Manual(plugin-based) Failover Mode** allows you to use the
  :ref:`MongoDB kubectl plugin <kubectl-plugin-ref>` to
  reconfigure the |k8s-op-short| to use new healthy |k8s| clusters.
  In this mode, you distribute replica set members across the new healthy
  clusters by configuring the |mongodb-multi| based on your configuration.

  To enable this mode, use ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=true``
  in the `MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes 
  <https://mongodb.github.io/helm-charts>`__,
  or set the |multi-cluster| environment variable ``PERFORM_FAILOVER``
  to ``false``, as in the following abbreviated example:

  .. code-block:: yaml
     :copyable: false

     spec:
       template:
         ...
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: mongodb-enterprise-operator
             ...
             env:
             ...   
             - name: PERFORM_FAILOVER
               value: "false"
             ...

.. note::
   
   You can't rely on the :ref:`auto or manual failover modes <disaster-recovery-modes>`
   when a |k8s| cluster hosting one or more |k8s-op-short| instances goes
   down, or the replica set member resides on the same failed |k8s|
   cluster as the |k8s| that manages it.

   In such cases, to restore replica set members from lost |k8s| clusters
   to the remaining healthy |k8s| clusters, you must first restore the
   |k8s-op-short| instance that manages your |multi-clusters|, or
   redeploy the |k8s-op-short| to one of the remaining |k8s| clusters,
   and rerun the |kubectl-mongodb|. To learn more, see :ref:`disaster-recovery-manual`.

.. _disaster-recovery-manual:

Manually Recover from a Failure Using the MongoDB Plugin
---------------------------------------------------------

When a |k8s| cluster hosting one or more |k8s-op-short| instances goes down,
or the replica set member resides on the same failed |k8s| cluster as the
|k8s| that manages it, you can't rely on the
:ref:`auto or manual failover modes <disaster-recovery-modes>`
and must use the following procedure to manually recover from a failed
|k8s| cluster.

The following procedure uses the :ref:`MongoDB kubectl Plugin <kubectl-plugin-ref>`
to:

- Configure new healthy |k8s| clusters.
- Add these |k8s| clusters as new member clusters to the ``mongodb-enterprise-operator-member-list``
  ConfigMap for your |multi-cluster|.
- Rebalance nodes hosting |mongodb-multis| on the nodes in the healthy |k8s| clusters.

The following tutorial for manual disaster recovery assumes that you:

- Deployed one central cluster and three member clusters, following the
  :ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`. In this case, the
  |k8s-op-short| is installed with the automated failover disabled with
  ``--set multiCluster.performFailover=false``.

- Deployed a |mongodb-multi| as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl apply -n mongodb -f - <<EOF
     apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
     kind: MongoDBMultiCluster
     metadata:
      name: multi-replica-set
     spec:
      version: 8.0.0
      type: ReplicaSet
      persistent: false
      duplicateServiceObjects: true
      credentials: my-credentials
      opsManager:
        configMapRef:
          name: my-project
      security:
        tls:
          ca: custom-ca
      clusterSpecList:
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}
          members: 3
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}
          members: 2
        - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_3_FULL_NAME}
          members: 3
     EOF


The |k8s-op-short| periodically checks for connectivity to the clusters
in the |multi-cluster| by pinging the ``/healthz`` endpoints of the
corresponding servers. To learn more about ``/healthz``, see |k8s-healthchecks|.

In the case that ``CLUSTER_3`` in our example becomes unavailable, the
|k8s-op-short| detects the failed connections to the cluster and marks the
|mongodb-multis| with the ``failedClusters`` annotation for subsequent reconciliations.

The resources with data nodes deployed on this cluster fail reconciliation
until you run the manual recovery steps as in the following procedure.

To rebalance the MongoDB data nodes so that all the workloads run on
``CLUSTER_1`` and ``CLUSTER_2``:

Manually Recover from a Failure Using GitOps Workflows
------------------------------------------------------

For an example of use of the :ref:`MongoDB kubectl plugin <kubectl-plugin-ref>`
in a GitOps workflow with `Argo CD <https://argoproj.github.io/cd>`__, see
:github:`multi-cluster plugin example for GitOps </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/samples/multi-cluster-cli-gitops>`.

GitOps recovery requires manual reconfiguration of
:k8sdocs:`Role Based Access Control </reference/access-authn-authz/rbac>`
using ``.yaml`` resource files. To learn more, see
:ref:`multi-cluster-rbac-manual`.
