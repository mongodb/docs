Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: endSessions

   The :dbcommand:`endSessions` command marks a session as expired to
   signal to the server to clean up the session and updates the
   expiration time of the session. The command overrides the timeout
   period that sessions wait before expiring.  

   .. note:: 

      Use the :dbcommand:`killSessions` command to immediately terminate 
      and remove a session.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( 
      { 
        endSessions: [ { id : <UUID> }, ... ] 
      }
   )

.. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

.. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`endSessions`

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( 
      { 
        endSessions: [ { id : <UUID> }, ... ] 
      } 
    )

Behavior
--------

Session Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB concatenates each of the specified UUIDs with the hash of the
authenticated user credentials to identify the user's sessions to end.
If the user has no session that match, the :dbcommand:`endSessions`
has no effect.

Access Control
--------------

If the deployment enforces authentication/authorization, you must be
authenticated to run the :dbcommand:`endSessions` command.

A user can only end sessions belonging to the user.
