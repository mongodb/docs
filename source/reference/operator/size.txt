$size

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $size

   The :operator:`$size` operator matches any array with the number of
   elements specified by the argument. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $size: 2 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` where ``field`` is an array
   with 2 elements. For instance, the above expression will
   return ``{ field: [ red, green ] }`` and ``{ field: [ apple,
   lime ] }`` but *not* ``{ field: fruit }`` or ``{ field: [
   orange, lemon, grapefruit ] }``. To match fields with only one
   element within an array use :operator:`$size` with a value of 1, as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $size: 1 } } );

   :operator:`$size` does not accept ranges of values. To select
   documents based on fields with different numbers of elements,
   create a counter field that you increment when you add elements to
   a field.

   Queries cannot use indexes for the :operator:`$size` portion of a
   query, although the other portions of a query can use indexes if
   applicable.
