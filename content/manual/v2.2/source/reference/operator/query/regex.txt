.. query:: $regex

   The :query:`$regex` operator provides regular expression
   capabilities for pattern matching *strings* in queries. MongoDB uses
   Perl compatible regular expressions (i.e. "PCRE.")

   You can specify regular expressions using regular expression objects
   (i.e. ``/pattern/``) or using the :query:`$regex` operator. The
   following examples are equivalent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: /acme.*corp/i } );
      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: 'acme.*corp', $options: 'i' } } );

   These expressions match all documents in ``collection`` where the
   value of ``field`` matches the case-insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp``.

   .. operator:: $options

     :query:`$regex` provides four option flags:

     - ``i`` toggles case insensitivity, and allows all letters in the
       pattern to match upper and lower cases.

     - ``m`` toggles multiline regular expression. Without this option,
       all regular expression match within one line.

       If there are no newline characters (e.g. ``\n``) or no
       start/end of line construct, the ``m`` option has no effect.

     - ``x`` toggles an "extended" capability. When set,
       :query:`$regex` ignores all white space characters unless
       escaped or included in a character class.

       Additionally, it ignores characters between an un-escaped ``#``
       character and the next new line, so that you may include
       comments in complicated patterns. This only applies to data
       characters; white space characters may never appear within
       special character sequences in a pattern.

       The ``x`` option does not affect the handling of the VT character
       (i.e. code 11.)

     .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

     - ``s`` allows the dot (e.g. ``.``) character to match all
       characters *including* newline characters.

     Only the ``i`` and ``m`` options are available for the native
     JavaScript regular expression objects (e.g. ``/acme.*corp/i``). To
     use ``x`` and ``s`` options, you must use the :query:`$regex`
     operator with the :operator:`$options` syntax.

   To combine a regular expression match with other operators, you
   need to use the :query:`$regex` operator. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: /acme.*corp/i, $nin: [ 'acmeblahcorp' ] } } );

   This expression returns all instances of ``field`` in
   ``collection`` that match the case insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp`` that *don't* match ``acmeblahcorp``.

Behavior
--------

PCRE Matching Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$regex` uses "Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" (PCRE) as
the matching engine.

``$in`` Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To include a regular expression in an ``$in`` query expression, you can
only use JavaScript regular expression objects (i.e. ``/pattern/`` ).
You *cannot* use :query:`$regex` operator expressions inside an
:query:`$in`.

Index Use
~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$regex` can only use an :term:`index <index>` efficiently
when the regular expression has an anchor for the beginning (i.e. ``^``)
of a string and is a case-sensitive match.  Additionally, while
``/^a/``, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/`` match equivalent strings, they
have different performance characteristics. All of these expressions
use an index if an appropriate index exists; however, ``/^a.*/``,
and ``/^a.*$/`` are slower. ``/^a/`` can stop scanning after matching
the prefix.
