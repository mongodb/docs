Overview
--------

MongoDB supports multiple mechanisms that secure your database connection.
This page contains code examples that demonstrate each of these mechanisms.

.. tip::

   To learn more about any of the mechanisms shown on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <php-auth-sample>` or your own application.
Make sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

The following code shows how to authenticate by using the ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
authentication mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-256-client
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-256-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-256-uri
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-256-uri

To learn more about SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, see :ref:`php-scram-sha-256` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB X.509
-------------

The following code shows how to create a connection URI to authenticate by using
the ``X.509`` authentication mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:

To learn more about X.509 authentication, see :ref:`php-mongodb-x509` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB-AWS
-----------

The following sections show how to connect to MongoDB by using the ``MONGODB-AWS``
authentication mechanism. When you use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` mechanism, the {+php-library+}
attempts to retrieve your AWS credentials from the following sources, in the order listed:

1. Options passed to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor, either as part of the connection
   string or the ``$uriOptions`` array parameter
#. Environment variables
#. AWS EKS ``AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`` request
#. ECS container metadata
#. EC2 instance metadata
 
Each section shows how to authenticate with ``MONGODB-AWS`` when retrieving your
AWS credentials from options passed to your client or the alternative external sources.

To learn more about authenticating with AWS, see :ref:`php-mongodb-aws` in the
Authentication guide.

To learn more about providing a key file password, see :ref:`php-key-file-password` in
the TLS Configuration guide.

Allow Insecure TLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to relax TLS constraints, which has the same
effect as disabling both :ref:`certificate validation <php-connect-disable-cert>`
and :ref:`hostname verification <php-connect-disable-hostname>`:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php

         :start-after: start-insecure-tls-client
         :end-before: end-insecure-tls-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

To learn more about allowing insecure TLS, see :ref:`php-insecure-tls` in
the TLS Configuration guide.

.. warning::

   Setting the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``true`` might expose your application
   to security risks. Enabling this option makes your application insecure and
   potentially vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.

.. _php-connect-disable-cert:
