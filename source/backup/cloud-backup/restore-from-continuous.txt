|service| lets you restore data from a 
:ref:`Continuous Cloud Backup <pit-restore>` by specifying one of the 
following options: 

- A specific date and time to which you want to restore
- A specific :term:`oplog` entry from which you want to restore

Restore Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`prerequisites <restore-prereq>` consider the
following requirements and limitations when restoring from a
:ref:`Continuous Cloud Backup <pit-restore>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-reqs.rst

- This feature is only available for ``M10+`` dedicated {+clusters+} 
  and {+Serverless-instances+}.

- If you are restoring from :guilabel:`Serverless Continuous Backup`,
  you can only use a :guilabel:`Date & Time` within the last 72 hours. 
  {+Serverless-instance+}s don't support restoring from an 
  :term:`oplog` entry.

Recommendations to Optimize Restore Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-indexes-backup-restore.rst

  .. note::

     The |fts| index definitions captured at the snapshot time specified 
     for the point in time restore replace any existing |fts| index 
     definitions.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore`.
            
            Click the :guilabel:`Point in Time Restore` button on the 
            far right side of the screen.

            #. Select either the :guilabel:`Date & Time` or :guilabel:`Oplog
               Timestamp` tab.

               .. note::

                  If you select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` option, you can
                  specify the time of restore with one minute of granularity.
                  If you select the :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp` option, you
                  can specify the time of restore with one second of
                  granularity.

            #. Enter the desired point in time to restore from.

               .. important::

                  You can restore a {+cluster+} from any time during its 
                  {+pit-restore+} window **except** between when you 
                  initiated a restore and when |service| completes a 
                  snapshot after the restore.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

            #. Choose a project and cluster to restore to from the dropdown
               menus.

               .. important::

                  |service| might create a host rollback alert due to
                  differences in the data between the source and target
                  clusters. You can ignore this alert.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.

         .. tab:: Serverless Instance
            :tabid: serverless

            #. Select the :guilabel:`Date & Time` from which you want to
               restore data. The date and time must be within the last 72
               hours. You can specify the time of restore with one minute
               of granularity.

               .. important::

                  You can restore a {+database-deployment+} from any time
                  during its {+pit-restore+} window **except** between when
                  you initiated a restore and when |service| completes a 
                  snapshot after the restore.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Next: Select Cluster` button.

            #. Choose a project and {+database-deployment+} to restore to
               from the dropdown menu.

               .. important::

                  |service| might create a host rollback alert due to
                  differences in the data between the source and target
                  {+database-deployments+}. You can ignore this alert.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Restore` button.

After the restore completes, |service| takes a snapshot of
the restored {+cluster+}. This snapshot has a retention period
equal to the {+cluster+}'s {+pit-restore+} window.
