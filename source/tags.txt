You can use tags to categorize resources by purpose, environment, team, 
or billing center. You can :ref:`add tags to your 
{+database-deployments+} <database-deployment-tags>` to better 
understand, organize, and identify your {+database-deployments+}. A 
key-value pair makes up each tag. For example, you might add an 
``environment : production`` tag. In this example, you set the tag key 
to ``environment`` and you set the tag value to ``production``. You can 
manage resource tags from the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, and 
{+atlas-cli+}.

.. _resource-tag-reqs:

Requirements
------------

The following requirements apply to resource tags:

.. include:: /includes/fact-sensitive-info-resource-tags.rst

- You can have a maximum of 50 tags per {+database-deployment+}.

- Each tag must contain a key and a value.

- Each tag key can have a maximum of 255 characters.

- Each tag key must be unique.

- Each tag value can have a maximum of 255 characters.

- Each tag can contain only the following allowable characters:
 
  - letters
  - numbers
  - spaces
  - colons (:)
  - semi-colons (;)
  - at symbols (@)
  - underscores (_)
  - dashes (-)
  - periods (.)
  - plus signs (+) 

.. _resource-tag-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-sensitive-info-resource-tags.rst

- Add tags (key-value pairs) to your resources to better 
  understand, organize, and identify your resources.

- Use tags to categorize resources by purpose, environment, team, 
  or billing center.

- {+Cluster+} labels will be deprecated in a future release. We 
  strongly recommend that you use resource tags instead.

- Tags keys and tag values are case sensitive. For example, |service| 
  accepts both ``environment`` and ``Environment`` as separate tag 
  keys.

- If you delete a tag, |service| removes the tag from the associated 
  resources.

- Whenever a user adds, modifies, or deletes a resource tag, |service| 
  reflects the event in the :ref:`Project Activity Feed 
  <view-activity-feed>`.

.. _tag-best-practices:

Best Practices
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-sensitive-info-resource-tags.rst

- Use a standardized, case-sensitive format for tags, and 
  apply it consistently across all resource types.

- Create a tagging strategy that uses standard tags across all of your 
  resource types.

- Apply tags for cost allocation. Use a consistent tag key, such as 
  cost-center or billing-unit, to associate related resources based on 
  the billing entity or purpose. Doing so can help you perform cost 
  allocation based on custom dimensions.

- Apply tags for resource organization. Use a consistent tag key, such 
  as ``environment``, ``application``, ``team``, or ``owner``, to 
  group resources.

- Use the :doc:`{+atlas-admin-api+} </api/atlas-admin-api>` to 
  programmatically manage tags across your resources. 

.. _tag-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

To create or modify resource tags, you must have the 
the :authrole:`Project Owner`  role for the project or the 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` role on its parent organization.
