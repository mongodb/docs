To quickly connect to a shared deployment, export and share your
saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can
use them yourself in your other workspaces. You can manage saved connections 
in the |compass-short| :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` or with the |compass-short| 
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`.

.. important:: Export Contains Sensitive Information

   By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in 
   plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported 
   file with a passphrase. When you do, users must specify the matching 
   passphrase to import the connections.
