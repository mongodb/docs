   * - Deployment Model

     - Description

   * - Local

     - Suitable for evaluation and proof of concept jobs. 

       For more information, see :ref:`Install on a Local Machine 
       <local-machine-install>`. 

   * - Unattended server

     - Suitable for smaller production jobs. 
       
       For more information, see :ref:`Install on an Unattended Server 
       <unattended-server>`. 

   * - Docker

     - Suitable if your familiar with Docker and don't want to run 
       Relational Migrator directly on a server or machine.

       For more information, see :ref:`Install with Docker <rm-install-docker>`.

   * - Kafka

     - The Kafka deployment method is suitable for long-running Change Data 
       Capture (CDC) migration jobs and large data migrations that exceed 4 weeks in 
       duration or involve databases larger than 20GB. `Apache Kafka 
       <https://kafka.apache.org/>`__ is an open-source platform for distributed 
       workloads that offers high availability and automatic recovery. This is the 
       most advanced option that is intended for users who require long-running or 
       large production data migrations.

       For more information, see :ref:`kafka-intro`.

   * - Kafka with Confluent Cloud

     - The Kafka with Confluent Cloud deployment method is an option for users who 
       want the reliability of Kafka without having to manage their own cluster. 
       `Confluent  <https://www.confluent.io/>`__ is a fully-managed Kafka hosting 
       provider run by the founders of Kafka. This deployment method uses APIs to 
       add the newest Relational Migrator sink connectors to Confluent Cloud as 
       managed connectors.

       For more information, see :ref:`install-confluent-kafka`.
