.. default-domain:: mongodb


|mms| Server 1.4.3
------------------

*Released 2014-07-22*

- Addressed issues related to Backup Job assignment for 2.6.x clusters
  that used the :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role to support MMS
  Monitoring.

- Fixed problem importing email addresses for users for deployments
  that use LDAP integration.

- Fixed rare race condition caused high CPU usage in the MMS HTTP
  Service if the application cannot connect to one of the backing databases.

- Additional security enhancements.

|mms| Server  ``1.4.2``
-----------------------

*Released 2014-05-29*

- Critical bug fix for backing up MongoDB 2.6 deployments that include
  user or custom role definitions:

  - The :data:`system.version` collection in the admin database will
    be included in all future snapshots.

  - The :data:`system.roles` collection in the admin database will be
    included after a new initial sync is performed.

  Users capturing backups of MongoDB 2.6 replica sets
  or clusters with MMS that include custom role definitions should perform a
  new initial sync. Taking a new initial sync will ensure that the
  role definitions are included in the backup.

- Disable MongoDB :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` for insert-only MMS
  Backup collections.

- Speed optimization for MMS Backup HTTP pull restores.

- Fix for LDAP integration, MMS now passes full ``dn`` correctly when
  authenticating the user.
