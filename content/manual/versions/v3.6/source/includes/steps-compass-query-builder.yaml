    Charts in Compass are fully interactive. Clicking on a chart value or bar
    will automatically build a MongoDB query that matches the documents
    pertaining to that section of the chart.

    In the example below, clicking on the "JFK" bar builds a query matching all
    documents whose ``departureAirportFsCode`` field matches "JFK".

    Clicking on other field values adds them to the selection, creating a more
    complex query.

    Continuing with the example, this selects a particular ``flightId`` in
    addition to departures from JFK Airport.

    To select multiple values within the same field, click and drag the mouse
    over a selection of values. Alternatively, hold the Shift key while
    selecting the desired values.

    To deselect a previously-selected value, hold the Shift key while clicking
    on the selection.

    After building a query, run it by clicking the Apply button. To clear the
    query, use the Reset button.

    Note that composing "OR" queries is **not yet possible** with the automatic
    query builder.
