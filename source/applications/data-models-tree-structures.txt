MongoDB allows various ways to use tree data structures to model large
hierarchical or nested data relationships.

:doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-parent-references`
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
   to "parent" nodes in "child" nodes.

:doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-child-references`
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
   to "child" nodes in "parent" nodes.

:doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-ancestors-array`
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
   to "parent" nodes and an array that stores all ancestors.

:doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-materialized-paths`
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing full relationship paths between documents. In
   addition to the tree node, each document stores the ``_id`` of the
   nodes ancestors or path as a string.

:doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-nested-sets`
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure using the *Nested Sets* pattern. This optimizes
   discovering subtrees at the expense of tree mutability.
