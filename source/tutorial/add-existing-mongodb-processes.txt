=======================================
Add Existing MongoDB Processes to |mms|
=======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| provides a wizard for adding your existing MongoDB deployments to
monitoring and management. The wizard prompts you to install an Automation
Agent if none exists, and then prompts you to identify the :term:`cluster
<sharded cluster>`, :term:`replica set`, or :term:`standalone` to add. You
can choose to add the deployment to both :ref:`monitoring
<monitoring-functional-overview>` and :ref:`automation
<automation>`, or just to monitoring.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your deployment requires authentication you must provide the necessary
credentials when adding the deployment to |mms|. For information on
configuring authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`.

Unique Replica Set Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not add two different replica sets with the same name. |mms| uses the replica
set name to identify which set a member belongs to.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB process is accessible only by specific hostname or IP
address, or if you need to specify the hostname to use for servers with
multiple aliases, set up a preferred hostname. For details, see the
:guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` setting in :ref:`group-settings-page`.
