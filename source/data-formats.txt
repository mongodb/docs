Overview
--------

The {+driver-short+} supports the ``kotlinx.serialization`` library for
serializing and deserializing {+language+} objects. You can use this
library to convert between MongoDB documents and different data formats
in your application. To learn more about serialization, see the
:ref:`kotlin-sync-serialization` guide.

You can use several types of specialized document data formats in your
application. To learn how to work with these data formats, see the following
sections:

- Learn how to work with the BSON data format in the :ref:`kotlin-sync-bson` guide.
- Learn how to store and interact with time series data in the :ref:`kotlin-sync-time-series` guide.
