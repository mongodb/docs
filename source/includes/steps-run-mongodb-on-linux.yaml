title: Create the data directory.
stepnum: 1
ref: create-dbpath
pre: |
  Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the directory to
  which the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process will write data. By default, the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` process uses the ``/data/db`` directory. If you create
  a directory other than this one, you must specify that directory in the
  :setting:`dbpath` option when starting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
  later in this procedure.
action:
  pre: |
    The following example command creates the default ``/data/db`` directory:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mkdir -p /data/db
---
title: Set permissions for the data directory.
stepnum: 2
ref: set-dbpath-permission
action:
  pre: |
    Before running :binary:`~bin.mongod` for the first time, ensure that the
    user account running :binary:`~bin.mongod` has read and write permissions
    for the directory.
---
title: Run MongoDB.
stepnum: 3
ref: start-mdb
pre: |
  To run MongoDB, run the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process at the system prompt.
  If necessary, specify the path of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or the data
  directory. See the following examples.
action:
  - heading: Run without specifying paths
    pre: |
      If your system ``PATH`` variable includes the location of the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary and if you use the default data directory
      (i.e., ``/data/db``), simply enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod
  - heading: Specify the path of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
    pre: |
      If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary, enter the full path to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
      binary at the system prompt:
    language: sh
    code: |
      <path to binary>/mongod
  - heading: Specify the path of the data directory
    pre: |
      If you do not use the default data directory (i.e., ``/data/db``),
      specify the path to the data directory using the :option:`--dbpath
      <mongod --dbpath>` option:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>

title: Begin using MongoDB.
stepnum: 4
ref: begin-using-mongodb
content: |
  To begin using MongoDB, see :doc:`/tutorial/getting-started`. Also
  consider the :doc:`/administration/production-notes` document before
  deploying MongoDB in a production environment.
post: |
  Later, to stop MongoDB, press ``Control+C`` in the terminal where the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is running.
