MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`.

An |service| :ref:`group <create-group>` can have multiple MongoDB
clusters.

Create a Cluster
----------------

To create a cluster, go to the :guilabel:`Clusters` view and click the
:guilabel:`Add New Cluster` or :guilabel:`Build a New Cluster` button.
Configure your cluster as described in the steps below. As
you build your cluster, |service| displays the associated costs.

If no MongoDB user exists for your |service| :ref:`group
<create-group>`, you will also create your first MongoDB user.

You must save the admin user and password or you will lose admin access
to your MongoDB databases until you reset the password. If you choose
to have |service| generate the admin password, save the password when
it is displayed since |service| displays it only once.

Next Steps
----------

To continue setting up the cluster, see:

- :doc:`Set up security </setup-cluster-security>`.

- :doc:`Connect to the cluster </connect-to-cluster>`.

To change the cluster configuration after deployment, see
:doc:`scale-cluster`.
