You can use |compass| to ask natural language questions about your
data. |compass-short| uses AI to generate filter queries and aggregations based 
on the prompts you provide.

Use Cases
---------

You may want to use natural language to query in |compass-short| to:

- Ask plain text questions about your data.
- Create an initial query or aggregation pipeline that you can 
  modify to suit your requirements.
- Learn how to write complex queries with multiple aggregation stages.

Behavior
--------

.. BEGIN-COMPASS-ONLY

- |compass-short| natural language querying is available starting in version 
  ``1.40.x``.

.. END-COMPASS-ONLY

- Natural language querying utilizes `Azure Open AI 
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
  as its current provider. This provider may be subject to change in 
  the future.

- The |compass| natural language querying feature is on a rolling 
  release schedule. As a result, some users may temporarily have functionality
  that other users do not.
