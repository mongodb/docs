Definition
----------

.. versionadded:: 8.2

.. |command| replace:: ``$encStrNormalizedEq``

.. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-aggregation-operator.rst

.. expression:: $encStrNormalizedEq

   Returns ``true`` if a :term:`normalized string` value matches the
   :term:`normalized string` version of the specified string. The queried field
   must have :ref:`substring queries enabled <qe-encryption-schema>`, and the
   length of the query string must be between the configured minimum and
   maximum number of characters, inclusive. 
   
   .. note::
      
      This operator must operate on a text search index.

   The :expression:`$encStrNormalizedEq` expression has the following
   :ref:`operator expression syntax <aggregation-expressions>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $encStrNormalizedEq: { input: ’$fieldname’, string: <target search key> } }


Behavior
--------

- Case sensitivity and diacritical mark sensitivity are determined by the
  configuration of the associated text search index.

.. include:: includes/queryable-encryption/qe-substring-search-behavior.rst

Example
--------

Consider the character é, which can be represented two ways:

- One code point, ``U+00E9`` (Latin small letter E with acute)
- Two code points, ``U+0065`` (Latin small letter E) followed by ``U+0301``
  (combining acute accent)

When comparing these two different representations of the name Béatrice:

- Using :expression:`$eq` evaluates to ``false``, because the binary 
  representations are different.
- Using ``$encStrNormalizedEq`` evaluates to ``true``, regardless of the
  :parameter:`diacriticSensitive` setting, because the operator normalizes both
  strings prior to comparing them.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

.. code-block:: shell

   db.collection('MyCollection').aggregate([
      {
         $match: {
            $expr: {
               $encStrNormalizedEq: {
                  input: '$employeeLastName',
                  string: 'Béatrice'
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ])
