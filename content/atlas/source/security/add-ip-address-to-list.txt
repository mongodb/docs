An |ipaddr| is a unique numeric identifier for a device connecting to a
network. In |service|, you can only connect to a cluster from a trusted
IP address. Within |service|, you can create a list of trusted IP
addresses, referred to as a IP access list, that can be used to connect
to your cluster and access your data.

Required Access
---------------

To add your IP address to an IP access list, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

Procedure
---------

You added your IP address to the IP access list when you created your 
first {+cluster+}.

To add other IP access list entries, see :ref:`access-list`.

To learn more about the security features available, see 
:ref:`setup-cluster-security`.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you added your connection IP address to the IP access list,
proceed to :doc:`Connect to Your Cluster 
</tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster>`.
