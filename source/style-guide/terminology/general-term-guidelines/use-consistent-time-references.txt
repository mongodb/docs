.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use the following terms consistently:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Terms
     - Usage
     - Examples
   * - before, after
     - To locate an action in time
     - **Before** you print your document, save it.

       **After** you save your document, you can print it.
   * - following, preceding
     - To locate an item in text or copy

       .. note::

          Don't use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, *later*, *before*, or
          *after* as references to information in text. Where possible,
          use specific references. If you can't make specific
          references, use *preceding* and *following* as adjectives for
          elements such as figures and tables.
     - The **preceding** information explains how to print a document
       correctly.

       The utility analyzes the **following** information to prepare
       the report.
   * - earlier, later
     - To refer to product releases (version numbers).

       .. note::

          Don't use *higher*, *lower*, *above*, *below*, *older*, or
          *newer*.
     - The required namespace kernel features aren't available in the
       default kernel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, CentOS
       6.4, and **earlier** versions of these operating systems.

       MongoDB Ops Manager version 4.0 hasn't been tested on versions
       of Ubuntu **later** than 12.04.
