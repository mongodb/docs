.. important::

   Don't include sensitive information such as Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) in your
   resource tags. Other MongoDB services, such as Billing, can access
   resource tags. MongoDB also sends cluster resource tags to DataDog
   and Prometheus integrations. Resource tags are *not* intended for
   private and sensitive data. To learn more, see
   :ref:`sensitive-info`.
