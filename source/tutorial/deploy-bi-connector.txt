The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence allows you to query a 
MongoDB database using SQL commands to aid in data analysis. It 
translates SQL queries from data analysis tools to MongoDB aggregation 
pipelines on MongoDB database. To learn more about the 
|bic-short-no-link|, see the `BI Connector manual <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/>`_.

Use the following procedure to deploy a new MongoDB |bic-short-no-link|
for |mms| to manage.

Limitations
-----------

- The |bic-short| allows only
  `read-only operations <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/current/supported-operations/>`_ 
  on data served in MongoDB databases. To create, update, or delete 
  data you must use {+mongosh+} or any appropriate driver.

- MongoDB |bic-short-no-link| for |mms| is not compatible with the 
  following authentication methods:

  - :doc:`Kerberos 
    </tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group>`

  - :doc:`x.509 </tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group>`

- The |bic-short-no-link| cannot be deployed using |mms|
  if the automation agent authentication mechanism is 
  Kerberos (``GSSAPI``) authentication.

- The |bic-short-no-link| skips field names that contain a period (.), such as ``price.usd``.
  Such fields don't appear in the output schema.
