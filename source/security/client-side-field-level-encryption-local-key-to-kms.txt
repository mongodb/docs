Introduction
------------

This guide is intended to help users migrate from using Client-Side Field
Level Encryption (CSFLE) with a **locally-managed master key** to one that
uses a remote **Key Management Service** such as
`AWS KMS <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`_ to prepare their implementation
for production. This guide assumes that you have already created
a CSFLE-enabled client, appropriate access to the MongoDB replica set and
AWS KMS.

For a detailed walkthrough on developing and configuring a CSFLE client
with an example use case, see our `CSFLE guide
</security/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide>`_.

Reasons to Use a KMS
--------------------

A remote KMS for master key management offers the following advantages over
storing it on the local filesystem:

- Secure storage with access auditing
- Reduced risk of access permission issues
- Availability and distribution to remote clients
- Automated backup and recovery
- Centralized encryption key lifecycle management

Additionally, MongoDB trasmits the data encryption keys to the KMS for
encryption and decryption, ensuring the Customer Master Key (CMK) is never
exposed to the client.

Convert to a Remote Master Key
------------------------------

.. admonition:: Decrypt all encrypted field data first
   :class: warning

   Before you switch from a locally-managed master key to a remote KMS,
   you must decrypt all documents containing field-encrypted data if you
   want to keep it. Your existing data encryption keys can only be decrypted
   with the original locally-managed master key and not the CMK that AWS KMS
   generates.

   Failure to decrypt all data at this stage may cause permanent and
   unrecoverable data loss.

This following steps explain the setup and updates necessary to move from
a local key provider to AWS KMS.
