.. _troubleshoot-initial-sync:

Initial Sync in Progress 
------------------------

|fts| starts the initial sync process in the following scenarios:

- When you create a new {+cluster+} or perform certain upgrades on a
  {+cluster+}, an initial sync process occurs.  
- If you add shards to a collection with an existing |fts| index, an
  initial sync occurs on the added shards for that index. 
- If you shard a collection that already has an |fts| index, an initial
  sync occurs on shards where the collection begins to exist. 

The initial sync process includes the following steps:
    
1. The ``mongod`` performs an initial sync.
2. The ``mongot`` performs an initial sync, which rebuilds the search indexes.

While a search index rebuilds, you can still perform ``$search`` queries 
on the existing indexed fields. However, |fts| might return an error if you run a
``$search`` query against a new field or a node that you've recently created.
Try your query again after the initial syncs complete and ``mongot`` 
rebuilds the indexes. You can check the status of the ``mongot`` initial 
sync using the following steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-atlas-search.rst

   .. step:: View the status details.

      a. In the index's ``Status`` column, click 
         :guilabel:`View Status Details`.

      #. Check the state of the index for the node. During ``mongot`` 
         initial sync, the status is ``INITIAL SYNC``. When ``mongot`` 
         finishes rebuilding the index, the status is ``ACTIVE``.

.. _troubleshoot-mongot-process:

``mongot`` Process Not Installed or Running
-------------------------------------------

The following error is returned if you run ``$search`` queries when 
the |fts| ``mongot`` process isn't installed or running:

.. code-block:: shell 
   :copyable: false 

   MongoError: Remote error from mongot :: caused by :: Error connecting to localhost:28000.

The ``mongot`` process is installed only when the first |fts| index is 
defined. If you don't have any |fts| index in your |service| cluster, 
create at least one |fts| index to resolve this error.

.. _troubleshoot-empty-results:

Empty Result Set 
----------------

``mongot`` doesn't return any errors, but returns an empty result set if
your :pipeline:`$search` query:

- References an index that doesn't exist. If you don't specify an index
  by name in the query, |fts| defaults to an index named ``default``. If
  you don't have an index named ``default`` or if the index that you
  specified doesn't exist, |fts| doesn't return an error and returns an
  empty result set. You can specify a valid index by its name using the
  ``index`` option. To learn more, see |fts| :ref:`aggregation pipeline
  stage options <query-syntax-ref>`.
- Specifies a non-indexed field. If you run a query against a field that
  isn't indexed, |fts| doesn't return an error and returns an empty
  result set. You must specify only indexed fields as values for the 
  ``path`` parameter. You can enable :ref:`dynamic mapping
  <static-dynamic-mappings>` in your index definition for the collection
  to ensure that all the :ref:`dynamically indexable fields
  <bson-data-chart>` in the collection are automatically indexed. To
  learn more, see :ref:`dynamic mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>`.
- Uses the ``text`` operator on a field path which is not indexed as a 
  ``string`` type. If a field is indexed as an |fts| field type other than 
  ``string``, such as ``stringFacet`` or ``autocomplete``, |fts| doesn't 
  return an error and returns an empty result set. You *must* index the 
  fields with ``string`` |bson| data type values as 
  :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` type to query the fields using 
  the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator.

``PlanExecutor`` Error
----------------------

``mongot`` returns a ``PlanExecutor`` error if your :pipeline:`$search` query:

- Specifies a field that is indexed as an incorrect data type. In this
  case, if you run a query, |fts| returns an error message identifying the 
  field that was indexed incorrectly and its correct data type. For 
  example:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :copyable: false

     PlanExecutor error during aggregation :: caused by :: Cannot facet on field "genres" because 
     it was not indexed as a "stringFacet" field.

  For example, to run :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries
  against ``string``, ``number``, or ``date`` fields, create an index
  for the fields using the corresponding |fts| field type such as
  ``stringFacet``, ``number``, and ``date`` respectively. To learn more,
  see :ref:`Supported and Unsupported Data Types <bson-data-chart>`. 

``Failed to Execute search Command`` Error 
------------------------------------------

If you deployed ``mongot`` to run alongside ``mongod`` (i.e. didn't
configure :ref:`configure-search-nodes`), ``mongot`` might return this
error if the ``mongot`` process terminates, such as during any of the
following events:  

- {+Cluster+} upscale
- Node failover
- ``mongot`` upgrade

If you deployed ``mongot`` on a dedicated search node, ``mongod`` uses a
proxy that is aware of each search node and therefore, ``mongod`` routes
search queries to only healthy nodes where the ``mongot`` is active.
