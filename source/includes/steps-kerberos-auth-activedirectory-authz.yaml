title: Configure TLS/SSL for the server running MongoDB.
stepnum: 1
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-configTLS
level: 4
content: |

  To connect to the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` (AD) server via TLS/SSL, the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` require access to the :abbr:`AD
  (Active Directory)` server's Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.

  On Linux, specify the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server's CA certificates
  via the ``TLS_CACERT`` or ``TLS_CACERTDIR`` option in the ``ldap.conf`` file.

  Your platform's package manager creates the ``ldap.conf`` file while
  installing MongoDB Enterprise's ``libldap`` dependency. For complete
  documentation on the configuration file or the referenced options, see
  `ldap.conf <http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap.conf>`_.

  On Microsoft :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)`, load the :abbr:`AD (Active
  Directory)` server's Certificate Authority (CA) certificates with the
  platform's credential management tool. The exact credential management tool
  is :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` version dependent. To use the tool,
  refer to its documentation for your version of :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft
  Windows)`.

  If :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` cannot access to the :abbr:`AD
  (Active Directory)` CA files, they cannot create TLS/SSL connections to the
  Active Directory server.

  Optionally, set :setting:`security.ldap.transportSecurity` to ``none``
  to disable TLS/SSL.

  .. warning::

     Setting :setting:`~security.ldap.transportSecurity` to ``none`` transmits
     plaintext information, including user credentials, between MongoDB and
     the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server.

title: (Windows only) Assign Service Principal Name to MongoDB Windows Service.
stepnum: 2
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-Windowsspn
level: 4
pre: |

  For MongoDB servers running on the :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)`
  operating system, you must use `setspn.exe
  <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731241(v=ws.11).aspx>`_ to
  assign the service principal name (SPN) to the account running the MongoDB
  service.

  .. code-block:: powershell

     setspn.exe -S <service>/<fully qualified domain name> <service account name>

  .. example::

     For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongod` runs as a service named ``mongodb`` on
     ``mongodbserver.example.com`` with the service account name
     ``mongodb_dev@example.com``, the command to assign the SPN would look as
     follows:

     .. code-block:: powershell

        setspn.exe -S mongodb/mongodbserver.example.com mongodb_dev@example.com

  .. note::

     :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` Server 2003 does not support
     ``setspn.exe -S``. For complete documentation on ``setspn.exe``, see
     `setspn.exe
     <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731241(v=ws.11).aspx>`_.

title: (Linux only) Create keytab file for the MongoDB server.
stepnum: 2
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-keytab
level: 4
content: |

  For MongoDB servers running on the Linux platform, you must ensure the
  server has a copy of the :ref:`keytab file <keytab-files>` specific to the
  MongoDB instance running on that server.

  You must grant the Linux user running the MongoDB service read permissions
  on the keytab file. Take note of the full path of the keytab file location.

---
title: Connect to the MongoDB server.
stepnum: 3
ref: security-nativeldap-activedirectory-preconnect
level: 4
pre: |

  Connect to the MongoDB server using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell using the
  :option:`--host <mongo --host>` and :option:`--port <mongo --port>` options.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongo --host <hostname> --port <port>

  If your MongoDB server currently enforces authentication, you must
  authenticate to the ``admin`` database as a user with role management
  privileges, such as those provided by :authrole:`userAdmin` or
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`. Include the appropriate
  :option:`--authenticationMechanism <mongo --authenticationMechanism>` for the
  MongoDB server's configured authentication mechanism.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongo --host <hostname> --port <port> --username <user> --password <pass> --authenticationDatabase="admin" --authenticationMechanism="<mechanism>"

  .. note::

     For :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` MongoDB deployments, you should replace :binary:`~bin.mongo` with
     :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`

---
title: Create user administrative role.
ref: security-nativeldap-activedirectory-authz-userAdmin
level: 4
stepnum: 4
pre: |

  To manage MongoDB users using :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)`, you need to
  create at least one role on the ``admin`` database that can create and
  manage roles, such as those provided by :authrole:`userAdmin` or
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

  The role's name must exactly match the Distinguished Name of an :abbr:`AD
  (Active Directory)` group. The group must have at least one :abbr:`AD
  (Active Directory)` user as a member.

  Given the available :ref:`Active Directory groups
  <kerb-auth-ldap-authz-groupObj>`,the following operation:

  - Creates a role named for the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` group
    ``CN=dba,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com``, and

  - Assigns it the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin``
    database.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin")
     admin.createRole(
        {
          role: "CN=dba,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com",
          privileges: [],
          roles: [ "userAdminAnyDatabase" ]
        }
     )

  You could alternatively grant the :authrole:`userAdmin` role for each
  database the user should have user administrative privileges on. These roles
  provide the necessary privileges for role creation and management.

  .. important::

     Consider applying the `principle of least privilege
     <https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege>`_
     when configuring MongoDB roles, :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` groups, or
     group membership.

---
title: Create a MongoDB configuration file.
stepnum: 5
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-configfile
level: 4
pre: |

  A MongoDB :doc:`configuration file </administration/configuration>` is a
  plain-text YAML file with the ``.conf`` file extension.

  * If you are upgrading an existing MongoDB deployment, copy the
    current configuration file and work from that copy.

  * (Linux Only) If this is a new deployment *and* you used your platform's
    package manager to install MongoDB Enterprise, the installation includes
    the ``/etc/mongod.conf`` default configuration file. Use that default
    configuration file, or make a copy of that file to work from.

  * If no such file exists, create an empty file with the ``.conf`` extension
    and work from that new configuration file.

title: Configure MongoDB to connect to Active Directory`.
stepnum: 6
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-configuremongodb
level: 4
pre: |

  In the MongoDB configuration file, set :setting:`security.ldap.servers` to
  the host and port of the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server. If your
  :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` infrastructure includes multiple :abbr:`AD
  (Active Directory)` servers for the purpose of replication, specify the host
  and port of the servers as a comma-delimited list to
  :setting:`security.ldap.servers`.

  .. example::

     To connect to an :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server located at
     ``activedirectory.example.net``, include the following in the
     configuration file:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        security:
          ldap:
            servers: "activedirectory.example.net"

  MongoDB must bind to the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server to perform
  queries. By default, MongoDB uses the simple authentication mechanism to
  bind itself to the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server.

  Alternatively, you can configure the following settings in the configuration
  file to bind to the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server using ``SASL``:

  - Set :setting:`security.ldap.bind.method` to ``sasl``

  - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.saslMechanisms`, specifying a string of
    comma-separated SASL mechanisms the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server
    supports.

  This tutorial uses the default ``simple`` LDAP authentication mechanism.

---
title: Configure MongoDB for Kerberos authentication.
stepnum: 7
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-configurebinding
level: 4
pre: |

  In the MongoDB configuration file, set :setting:`security.authorization` to
  ``enabled`` and :setting:`setParameter` :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms`
  to ``GSSAPI``


  To enable authentication via Kerberos, include the following in
  the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     security:
       authorization: "enabled"
     setParameter:
       authenticationMechanisms: "GSSAPI"

---
title: Configure LDAP Query Template for authorization.
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-querytemplate
level: 4
stepnum: 8
pre: |

  In the MongoDB configuration file, set
  :setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate` to an `RFC4516
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_ formatted LDAP query URL template.
 
 
  In the template, you can use either:

  - ``{USER}`` placeholder to substitute the authenticated username
    into the LDAP query URL.

  - ``{PROVIDED_USER}`` placeholder to substitute the supplied
    username, i.e. before either authentication or LDAP transformation,
    into the LDAP query. (*Available starting in version 4.2*)
 
  Design the query template to retrieve the user's groups.

  .. note::

     A full description of `RFC4515 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515>`_,
     RFC4516, or :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` queries is out of scope for
     this tutorial. The :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate` provided
     in this tutorial is an example only, and may not be applicable for your
     specific :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` deployment.

  .. example::

     The following query template returns any groups that list ``{USER}`` as a
     member, following recursive group memberships. This LDAP query assumes
     that group objects track user membership by storing full user
     Distinguished Name (DN) using the ``member`` attribute. The query
     includes the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` specific matching rule OID
     ``1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`` for `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN
     <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx>`_. This
     matching rule is an :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` specific extension to
     LDAP search filters.

     .. code-block:: yaml

        security:
          ldap:
            authz:
              queryTemplate:
                "DC=example,DC=com??sub?(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={USER}))"

     Using the query template, MongoDB substitutes ``{USER}`` with the
     authenticated username to query the LDAP server.

     For example, a user authenticates as
     ``CN=sam,CN=Users,DC=dba,DC=example,DC=com``. MongoDB creates an LDAP
     query based on the :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`,
     substituting the ``{USER}`` token with the authenticated username. The Active
     Directory server performs a recursive group lookup for any group that
     either directly or transitively lists the user as a member. Based on the
     :ref:`Active Directory groups <kerb-auth-ldap-authz-groupObj>`, the
     :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server returns
     ``CN=dba,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com`` and
     ``CN=engineering,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com``.
     

  MongoDB maps each returned group :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` to a role
  on the ``admin`` database. For each mapped group :abbr:`DN (Distinguished
  Name)`, if there is an existing role on the ``admin`` database whose name
  exactly matches the :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)`, MongoDB grants the user
  the roles and privileges assigned to that role.

  The matching rule ``LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`` requires providing the
  full :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` of the authenticating user. Since
  Kerberos requires authenticating with a user's ``userPrincipalName``, you
  must transform the incoming usernames into :abbr:`DNs (Distinguished Name)`
  using :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping`. The next step provides
  guidance on transforming incoming usernames to support the
  :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`.

---
title: Transform incoming usernames for authentication via Active Directory.
stepnum: 9
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-transform
level: 4
pre: |

  In the MongoDB configuration file, set
  :setting:`~security.ldap.userToDNMapping` to transform the authenticating
  user's provided username into an :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` DN to support
  the :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`.

  .. example::

     The following :setting:`~security.ldap.userToDNMapping` configuration
     uses the ``match`` regular expression filter to capture the provided
     username. MongoDB inserts the captured username into the ``ldapQuery``
     query template before executing the query.

     .. code-block:: yaml

        security:
          ldap:
            userToDNMapping:
              '[
                 {
                    match : "(.+)",
                    ldapQuery: "DC=example,DC=com??sub?(userPrincipalName={0})"
                 }
            ]'

  You must modify the given sample configuration to match your deployment. For
  example, the ``ldapQuery`` base :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` must match
  the base :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` which contains your user entities.
  Other modifications may be necessary to support your :abbr:`AD (Active
  Directory)` deployment.

  .. example::

     A user authenticates as ``alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM``. MongoDB first
     applies any transformations specified in
     :setting:`~security.ldap.userToDNMapping`. Based on the provided
     configuration, MongoDB captures the username in the ``match`` stage and
     executes an LDAP query:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        DC=example,DC=com??sub?(userPrincipalName=alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM)

     Based on the configured :ref:`Active Directory
     users<kerb-auth-ldap-authz-userObj>`, the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)`
     server should return
     ``CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=engineering,DC=example,DC=com``.

     MongoDB then executes the LDAP query configured in
     :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`, replacing the ``{USER}``
     token with the *transformed* username
     ``CN=alice,CN=Users,DC=engineering,DC=example,DC=com``.

title: Configure query credentials.
stepnum: 10
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-credentials
level: 4
pre: |

  MongoDB requires credentials for performing queries on the :abbr:`AD (Active
  Directory)` server.

  Configure the following settings in the configuration file:

  - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryUser`, specifying the {{AUTH}} user the
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` binds as for performing queries on
    the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server.

  - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`, specifying the password for
    the specified :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryUser`.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     security:
       ldap:
         bind:
           queryUser: "mongodbadmin@dba.example.com"
           queryPassword: "secret123"

  On :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` MongoDB servers, you can set
  :setting:`security.ldap.bind.useOSDefaults` to ``true`` to use the
  credentials of the OS user instead of ``queryUser`` and ``queryPassword``.

  The :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryUser` must
  have permission to perform all LDAP queries on behalf of MongoDB.

ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-startserver
level: 4
stepnum: 12
pre: |

  Start the MongoDB server with the :option:`--config <mongod --config>` option, specifying the
  path to the configuration file created during this procedure. If the
  MongoDB server is currently running, make the appropriate preparations to
  stop the server.

  ``Linux MongoDB Servers``

  On Linux, you must specify the ``KRB5_KTNAME`` environmental variable,
  specifying the path to the keytab file for the MongoDB server.

  .. code-block:: shell

     env KRB5_KTNAME <path-to-keytab> mongod --config <path-to-config-file>


  ``Microsoft Windows MongoDB Servers``

  On :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)`, you must start the MongoDB server as
  the service principal account as configured earlier in the procedure:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongod.exe --config <path-to-config-file>

---
title: Connect to the MongoDB server.
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-localhost
level: 4
stepnum: 13
pre: |

  Connect to the MongoDB server, authenticating as a user whose direct or
  transitive group membership corresponds to a MongoDB role on the ``admin``
  database with :authrole:`userAdmin`, :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`,
  or a custom role with equivalent privileges.

  Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to authenticate to the MongoDB
  server, set the following options:

  - :option:`--host <mongo --host>` with the hostname of the MongoDB server
  - :option:`--port <mongo --port>` with the port of the MongoDB server
  - :option:`--username <mongo --username>` to the user's ``userPrincipalName``
  - :option:`--password <mongo --password>` to the user's password (or omit to have the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell prompt for the password)
  - :option:`--authenticationMechanism <mongo --authenticationMechanism>` to ``"GSSAPI"``
  - :option:`--authenticationDatabase <mongo --authenticationDatabase>` to ``"$external"``

  .. example::

     Previously in this procedure, you configured the
     ``dn:CN=dba,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com`` role on the ``admin`` database with
     the required permissions. This role corresponds to an :abbr:`AD (Active
     Directory)` group. Based on the configured :ref:`AD users
     <kerb-auth-ldap-authz-userObj>`, you can authenticate as the user
     ``sam@dba.example.com`` and receive the required permissions.

     .. code-block:: shell

        mongo --username sam@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM --password  --authenticationMechanisms="GSSAPI" --authenticationDatabase "$external" --host <hostname> --port <port>

     If you do not specify the password to the :option:`-p <mongo
     --password>` command-line option, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
     prompts for the password.

  :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)` MongoDB deployments must use
  :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>` instead of :binary:`~bin.mongo`.

  Given the configured :ref:`Active Directory users
  <kerb-auth-ldap-authz-userObj>`, the user authenticates successfully and
  receives the appropriate permissions.

  .. note::

     If you want to authenticate as an existing non-``$external`` user, set
     :option:`--authenticationMechanism <mongo --authenticationMechanism>` to a SCRAM authentication mechanism (e.g. ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or ``SCRAM-SHA-256``). This requires
     that the MongoDB server's :setting:`setParameter`
     :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms` includes ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and/or ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` as appropriate.

title: Create roles for mapping returned :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` groups.
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-rolecreation
level: 4
stepnum: 14
pre: |

  For each group on the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` server you wish to use
  for MongoDB authorization, you must create a matching role on the MongoDB
  server's ``admin`` database.

  .. example::

     The following operation creates a role named after the :abbr:`AD (Active
     Directory)` group DN ``CN=PrimaryApplication,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com``,
     assigning roles and privileges appropriate to that group:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.getSiblingDB("admin").createRole(
           {
             role: "CN=PrimaryApplication,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com",
             privileges: [],
             roles: [
               { role: "readWrite", db: "PrimaryApplication" }
             ]
           }
        )

     Given the configured {{GROUP}}, MongoDB grants a user authenticating
     as either ``sam@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM`` or ``alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM`` the
     :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``PrimaryApplication`` database.

  .. note::

     To manage roles on the ``admin`` database, you must be authenticated as a
     user with :authrole:`userAdmin` on ``admin``,
     :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`, or a custom role on with equivalent
     privileges.

title: Transition existing users from ``$external`` to the Active Directory server.
ref: security-kerberos-activedirectory-authauthz-transitionusers
level: 4
stepnum: 15
optional: true
pre: |

  If upgrading an existing installation with :ref:`users <users>` configured
  on the ``$external`` database, you must meet the following requirements
  for each user to ensure access after configuring MongoDB for
  Kerberos authentication and :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` authorization:

  - User has a corresponding user object on the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)`
    server.

  - User has membership in the appropriate groups on the :abbr:`AD (Active
    Directory)` server.

  - MongoDB contains the roles on the ``admin`` database named for the user's
    :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` groups, such that the authorized user
    retains its privileges.

  .. example::

     The following user exists on the ``$external`` database:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          user : "joe@ANALYTICS.EXAMPLE.COM",
          roles: [
            { role : "read", db : "web_analytics" },
            { role : "read", db : "PrimaryApplication" }
          ]
        }

     Assuming the user belongs to the :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` group
     ``CN=marketing,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com``, the following operation
     creates a matching role with the appropriate privileges:

     .. code-block:: javascript

       db.getSiblingDB("admin").createRole(
          {
            role: "CN=marketing,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com",
            privileges: [],
            roles: [
              { role: "read", db: "web_analytics" }
              { role: "read", db: "PrimaryApplication" }
            ]
          }
       )

     Based on the configured :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`,
     MongoDB authorizes any user who has direct or transitive membership in the
     ``CN=marketing,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com`` group to perform
     :authrole:`read` operations on the ``web_analytics`` and
     ``PrimaryApplication`` databases.

  .. important::

     When configuring a role for a corresponding :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)`
     group, remember that *all* users with membership in that group can
     receive the assigned roles and privileges. Consider applying the
     `principle of least privilege
     <https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege>`_
     when configuring MongoDB roles, :abbr:`AD (Active Directory)` groups,
     or group membership.

  If you want to continue allowing users on non-``$external`` databases to
  access MongoDB, you must include SCRAM authentication mechanism (e.g. ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and/or ``SCRAM-SHA-256``) in the
  :setting:`setParameter` :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms` configuration
  option.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     setParameter:
       authenticationMechanisms: "GSSAPI,SCRAM-SHA-1,SCRAM-SHA-256"

  Alternatively, transition non-``$external`` users to :abbr:`AD (Active
  Directory)` by following the above procedure.
