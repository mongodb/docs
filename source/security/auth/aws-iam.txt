Overview
--------

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate a user to MongoDB.
You can use this mechanism only when authenticating to MongoDB Atlas.

To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas for AWS IAM authentication, see
:atlas:`Set Up Authentication with AWS IAM </security/aws-iam-authentication/>` in
the Atlas documentation.

.. note:: AWS SDK Testing

   ``MONGODB-AWS`` is tested with versions 2.30.31 and 1.12.782 of the AWS SDK.

Code Placeholders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

- ``<awsKeyId>``: Your AWS access key ID
- ``<atlasUri>``: The network address of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``<awsSecretKey>``: Your AWS secret access key
- ``<awsSessionToken>``: Your AWS session token
- ``<hostname>``: The hostname of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``<port>``: The port of your MongoDB Atlas deployment

To use the code examples on this page, replace these placeholders with your own values.

Specify MONGODB-AWS Authentication
----------------------------------

To instruct the driver to use this authentication mechanism, you can specify
``MONGODB-AWS`` either as a parameter in the connection string or by using
the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method.

This section describes how to specify this authentication mechanism and the various ways to
provide your AWS IAM credentials.

.. _java-mongodb-aws-sdk:

Use AWS SDK for Java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   This method of providing ``MONGODB-AWS`` credentials is available
   only in the {+driver-short+} v4.8 and later.

You can specify your credentials by using v1 or v2 of the AWS SDK for Java, which
offers the following features:

- Multiple options for obtaining credentials
- Credential caching which helps your application avoid rate limiting
- Credential provider management for use with the `Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html>`__.

To use the AWS SDK for Java for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you must
perform the following actions:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the SDK as a dependency to your project
#. Supply your credentials by using one of the methods in the credential
   provider chain

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :end-before: end mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add
it as a parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyConnectionString
   :end-before: end mechOnlyConnectionString

To add the AWS SDK as a dependency to your project, see the following
AWS documentation for the version you need:

- For the **AWS SDK for Java v2**, see the `Setting Up <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/setup.html>`__
  guide.
- For the **AWS SDK for Java v1**, see the `Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`__
  guide.

.. note::

   For the AWS SDK for Java v2, the Java driver tests using the
   ``software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.18.9`` dependency.

   For the AWS SDK for Java v1, the Java driver tests using the
   ``com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.12.337`` dependency.

To supply your credentials, see the following AWS documentation for the
version you need:

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v2** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultCredentialsProvider <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/DefaultCredentialsProvider.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Use the default credential provider chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain>`__
  section.

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v1** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Using the Default Credential Provider Chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default>`__
  section.

.. note::

   If you include both v1 and v2 of the AWS SDK for Java in your project,
   you must use the v2 methods to supply your credentials.

.. _java-mongodb-aws-env-variables:

Use Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide your AWS IAM credentials by instructing the driver to
use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and by setting the
appropriate environment variables.

To use the environment variables to supply your credentials, you must perform
the following actions:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the appropriate environment variables

You can specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``
or in the connection string.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method and add the
``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :end-before: end mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add it as a
parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyConnectionString
   :end-before: end mechOnlyConnectionString

You can also set environment variables to enable the following types of
authentication:

- Programmatic access keys
- Web identity provider
- ECS container credentials
- EC2 container credentials

The following example shows how you can set your **programmatic access keys**
in environment variables by using ``bash`` or a similar shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>

Omit the line containing ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` if you don't need an AWS
session token for that role.

You can use an OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible **web identity provider** to authenticate
to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or other services.

.. important::

   Your project must include v1 or v2 of the AWS SDK as a dependency to authenticate 
   using a web identity provider.

To use a web identity provider, create a file that contains your
OIDC token. Next, use ``bash`` or a similar shell to set an environment variable
to the absolute path to this file, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=<absolute path to file containing your OIDC token>

To authenticate by using **ECS container credentials**, set the ECS
endpoint relative URI in an environment variable by using ``bash`` or
a similar shell as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<your ECS endpoint>

To authenticate by using **EC2 container credentials**, make sure none of the
environment variables mentioned in this section are set. The driver obtains the
credentials from the default IPv4 EC2 instance metadata endpoint instead
of from environment variables.

.. _java-mongodb-aws-mongoclient-configuration:

Use a MongoCredential Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can supply your AWS IAM credentials to a ``MongoClient`` by using a
``MongoCredential`` instance. To construct the ``MongoCredential`` instance
for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication,  use the ``createAwsCredential()``
factory method.

You can supply only programmatic access keys to the
``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` method. If you must supply ECS
or EC2 container credentials, use the instructions in the
:ref:`<java-mongodb-aws-env-variables>` or :ref:`<java-mongodb-aws-sdk>`
sections.

To use the ``MongoCredential`` for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you
must perform the following actions:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Supply the credentials

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mongoCredential
   :end-before: end mongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

If you must specify an AWS session token, pass it to the
`withMechanismProperty() <{+core-api+}/MongoCredential.html#withMechanismProperty(java.lang.String,T)>`__
method as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mongoCredentialSessionTokenCredential
   :end-before: end mongoCredentialSessionTokenCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

To refresh your credentials, you can declare a ``Supplier`` lambda expression
that returns new credentials as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start refreshCredentials
   :end-before: end refreshCredentials
   :emphasize-lines: 1-5,9

.. note::

   If you must provide AWS IAM credentials in a connection string, see
   v4.7 or earlier of the {+driver-short+} documentation.
