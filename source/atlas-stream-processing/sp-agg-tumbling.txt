Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` stage specifies a 
:ref:`tumbling window <tumbling-windows>` for aggregation of data.
{+atlas-sp+} windows are stateful, can be recovered if interrupted, 
and have mechanisms for processing late-arriving data. You must apply 
all other aggregation queries to your streaming data within this 
window stage.

.. pipeline:: $tumblingWindow

   A ``$tumblingWindow`` pipeline stage has the following prototype 
   form:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "$tumblingWindow": {
          "interval": { 
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "pipeline" : [ 
            <aggregation-stage-array> 
          ],
          "offset": {
            "offsetFromUtc": <int>, 
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "idleTimeout": {
            "size": <int>,
            "unit": "<unit-of-time>"
          },
          "allowedLateness": {
            size: <int>, 
            unit: "<unit-of-time>" 
          }
        }  
      }

.. _atlas-sp-agg-tumbling-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The ``$tumblingWindow`` stage takes a document with the following 
fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``interval``
     - document 
     - Required
     - Document specifying the interval of a 
       :ref:`hopping window <hopping-windows>` as a combination of
       a size and a unit of time where: 
       
       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` must be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       For example, a ``size`` of ``20`` and a ``unit`` of ``second``
       sets each window to remain open for 20 seconds.

   * - ``pipeline`` 
     - array
     - Required 
     - Nested aggregation pipeline evaluated against the messages
       within the window.

   * - ``offset``
     - document
     - Optional
     - Document specifying a time offset for window boundaries relative 
       to UTC. The document is a combination of the size field 
       ``offsetFromUtc`` and a unit of time where:
       
       - The value of ``offsetFromUtc`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` must be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
       
       For example, an ``offsetFromUtc`` of ``8`` and a ``unit`` of 
       ``hour`` generates boundaries that are shifted eight hours
       ahead of UTC. If you do not specify an offset, the window 
       boundaries align with UTC.

   * - ``idleTimeout`` 
     - document     
     - Optional 
     - Document specifying how long to wait before closing windows if 
       ``$source`` is idle. Define this setting as a combination of a
       ``size`` and a ``unit`` of time where:  

       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer. 
       - The value of ``unit`` can be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       If you set ``idleTimeout``, {+atlas-sp+} closes open windows only
       if ``$source`` is idle for longer than the greater of either the 
       remaining window time or ``idleTimeout`` time. The idle timer 
       starts as soon as ``$source`` goes idle. 
       
       For example, consider a 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm window and
       ``idleTimeout`` time of 2 hours. If the last event is at 12:02 pm 
       after which ``$source`` goes idle, the remaining window time is
       58 minutes. {+atlas-sp+} closes the window after 2 hours of
       idleness at 2:02 pm, which is longer than the remaining window
       time and the ``idleTimeout`` time. If the ``idleTimeout`` time is
       set to only 10 minutes, {+atlas-sp+} closes the window after 58
       minutes of idleness at 1:00 pm, which is longer than
       ``idleTimeout`` time and the remaining window time.

   * - ``allowedLateness``
     - document 
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies how long to keep 
       :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` generated from the
       source open to accept late-arriving data after processing
       documents for window end time. If omitted, defaults to 3
       seconds.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-tumbling-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

{+atlas-sp+} supports only one :ref:`window <atlas-sp-windows>` stage 
per pipeline.

When you apply the :pipeline:`$group` stage to your window stage,
a single :manual:`group key </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`
has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM.

Support for certain aggregation stages might be limited or unavailable
within windows. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-sp-aggregation-support`.

In the event of a service interruption, you can resume the internal
pipeline of a window from its state at the point of interruption. To
learn more, see :ref:`Checkpoints <atlas-sp-checkpointing>`.
