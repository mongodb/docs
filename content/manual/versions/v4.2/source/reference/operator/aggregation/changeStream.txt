.. pipeline:: $changeStream

   Returns a :ref:`Change Stream <changeStreams>` cursor on a collection, a database,
   or an entire cluster. Must be used as the first stage in an aggregation pipeline.

   The :pipeline:`$changeStream` stage has the following syntax:
   
   .. code-block:: text
   
      {
        $changeStream: {
          allChangesForCluster: <boolean>,
          fullDocument: <string>,
          resumeAfter: <int>
          startAfter: <document>
          startAtOperationTime: <timestamp>
        }
      }
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
   
      * - Parameter
        - Description

      * - ``allChangesForCluster``
        - Optional: Sets whether the change stream should include all changes
          in the cluster. May only be opened on the ``admin`` database.

      * - ``fullDocument``
        - Optional: Specifies whether change notifications include a copy of the
          full document when modified by ``update`` operations.

          * ``default``: Change notifications do not include the full document
            for ``update`` operations.

          * ``updateLookup``: Change notifications includes a copy of the
            document modified by the change.  This document is the current 
            majority-committed document or ``null`` if it no longer exists.
            
          In the case of partial updates, the change notification also
          provides a description of the change.  

      * - ``resumeAfter``
        - Specifies a resume token as the logical starting point for 
          the change stream. Cannot be used with ``startAfter`` or
          ``startAtOperationTime`` fields.

      * - ``startAfter``
        - Specifies a resume token as the logical starting point for
          the change stream. Cannot be used with ``resumeAfter`` or
          ``startAtOperationTime`` fields.

      * - ``startAtOperationTime``
        - Specifies a time as the logical starting point for the change stream.
          Cannot be used with ``resumeAfter`` or ``startAfter`` fields.


Examples
--------

To create a change stream cursor using the aggregation stage, run 
the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var cur = db.names.aggregate( [
      { $changeStream: {} }
   ] )
   cur.next()

When the change stream detects a change, the ``next()`` method returns a change
event notification.  For example:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": {
         _data: "8262E2EE54000000022B022C0100296E5A100448E5E3DD01364019AE8FE8C6859527E046645F6964006462E2EE54C8756C0D5CF6F0720004"
      },
      "operationType": "insert",
      "clusterTime": Timestamp({ t: 1659039316, i: 2 }),
      "fullDocument": { 
         "_id": ObjectId("62e2ee54c8756c0d5cf6f072"), 
         "name": "Walker Percy" 
      },
      "ns": { 
         "db": "test", 
         "coll": "names" 
      },
      "documentKey": { _id: ObjectId("62e2ee54c8756c0d5cf6f072") }
   }
