To create each chart, you will populate the chart's
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` with fields from your
schema. Encoding channels represent the information passed to
|charts| which allows |charts-short| to create the visualization.
For more information on encoding channels and the different types of
channels available, refer to the
:ref:`encoding channels section <encoding-channels>` of the
documentation.
