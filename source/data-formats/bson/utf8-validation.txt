Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to enable or disable the {+driver-short+}'s
**UTF-8** validation feature. UTF-8 is a character encoding specification
that ensures compatibility and consistent presentation across most operating
systems, applications, and language character sets.

If you *enable* validation, the driver throws an error when it attempts to
convert data that contains invalid UTF-8 characters. The validation adds
processing overhead since it needs to check the data.

If you *disable* validation, your application avoids the validation processing
overhead, but cannot guarantee consistent presentation of invalid UTF-8 data.

By default, the driver enables UTF-8 validation on data from MongoDB. 
It checks incoming documents for any characters that are not encoded in a 
valid UTF-8 format when it parses data sent from MongoDB to your application.

.. note::

   This version of the {+driver-short+} automatically substitutes invalid
   `lone surrogates <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_code_points_and_grapheme_clusters>`__
   with the `replacement character <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toWellFormed>`__ 
   before validation when you send data to MongoDB. Therefore, the validation
   only throws an error when the setting is enabled and the driver
   receives invalid UTF-8 document data from MongoDB.

Read the sections below to learn how to set UTF-8 validation using the
{+driver-short+}.

Specify the UTF-8 Validation Setting
------------------------------------

You can specify whether the driver performs UTF-8 validation by
defining the ``enableUtf8Validation`` setting in the options parameter
when you create a client, reference a database or collection, or call a
CRUD operation. If you omit the setting, the driver enables UTF-8 validation.

See the following for code examples that demonstrate how to disable UTF-8
validation on the client, database, collection, or CRUD operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // disable UTF-8 validation on the client
   new MongoClient('<connection uri>', { enableUtf8Validation: false });

   // disable UTF-8 validation on the database
   client.db('<database name>', { enableUtf8Validation: false });

   // disable UTF-8 validation on the collection
   db.collection('<collection name>', { enableUtf8Validation: false });

   // disable UTF-8 validation on a specific operation call
   await myColl.findOne({ title: 'Cam Jansen'}, { enableUtf8Validation: false });

If your application reads invalid UTF-8 from MongoDB while the
``enableUtf8Validation`` option is enabled, it throws a ``BSONError`` that
contains the following message:

.. code-block::

   Invalid UTF-8 string in BSON document

.. _nodejs-utf-8-validation-scope:

Set the Validation Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``enableUtf8Validation`` setting automatically applies to the scope of the
object instance on which you included it, and any other objects created by
calls on that instance.

For example, if you include the option on the call to instantiate a database
object, any collection instance you construct from that object inherits
the setting. Any operations you call on that collection instance also
inherit the setting.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const database = client.db('books', { enableUtf8Validation: false });

   // The collection inherits the UTF-8 validation disabled setting from the database
   const myColl = database.collection('mystery');

   // CRUD operation runs with UTF-8 validation disabled
   await myColl.findOne({ title: 'Encyclopedia Brown' });

You can override the setting at any level of scope by including it when
constructing the object instance or when calling an operation.

For example, if you disable validation on the collection object, you can
override the setting in individual CRUD operation calls on that
collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const collection = database.collection('mystery', { enableUtf8Validation: false });

   // CRUD operation runs with UTF-8 validation enabled
   await myColl.findOne({ title: 'Trixie Belden' }, { enableUtf8Validation: true });

   // CRUD operation runs with UTF-8 validation disabled
   await myColl.findOne({ title: 'Enola Holmes' });
