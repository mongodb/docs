      To install the front-end package on RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, or
      SLES run:
    language: sh
    code: |
      rpm -ivh mongodb-mms-brs-X.X-X_X.x86_64.rpm

      To install the front-end package on Ubuntu run:
    language: sh

title: Configure the front-end software package.
stepnum: 2
ref:  backup-install-frontend-configure
action:
  - pre: |
      Open the application configuration file at
      ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`` and fill in all of the
      required configuration. All of the MongoDB connections default to
      localhost. If you are not running the MMS and Backup databases on this
      server, change these configuration values to the correct host.
  - post: |
      The backup database configuration setting (called ``backupdb``) should
      point to the Backup database. All other database connections in the
      front-end config file are for the MMS database and should point to the
      MMS database.

ref:  backup-install-frontend-start
action:
  - pre: |
      To start the front-end package run:
    language: sh
    code: |
      service mongodb-mms start
  - pre: |
      If everything worked the following displays:
    language: sh
    code: |
      Start MMS server
         Instance 0 starting...                                  [  OK  ]
      Start Backup HTTP Server
         Instance 0 starting...                                  [  OK  ]
      Start Backup Alert Process                                 [  OK  ]

  You should now be able to view MMS by going to the configured central URL
  in a web browser. The default port of MMS is ``8080``.
  
  If you run into any problems, the log files are at
  ``/opt/mongodb/mms/logs``.
