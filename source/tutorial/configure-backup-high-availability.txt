Overview
--------

The :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` maintains copies of the data
from your backed up :program:`mongod` instances and creates snapshots
used for restoring data. The file system that the Backup Daemon uses
must have sufficient disk space and write capacity to store the backed
up instances.

For replica sets, the local copy is equivalent to an additional
secondary replica set member. For sharded clusters the daemon maintains
a local copy of each shard as well as a copy of the
:term:`config database`.

To configure high availability

- scale your deployment horizontally by using multiple :ref:`backup
  daemons <backup-daemon>`,

- provide :manual:`failover </core/replica-set-high-availability>` for
  your |application| Database and Backup Database by deploying
  :term:`replica sets <replica set>` for the dedicated MongoDB processes
  that host the databases, and

- configure additional backup daemons to serve as dedicated restore
  daemons that focus on restore jobs exclusively.

Multiple Backup Daemons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To increase your storage and to scale horizontally, you can run multiple
instances of the :term:`Backup Daemon`. Increase the available storage
for the :term:`head databases <head database>` to provide scalability.
This does not increase the available space for snapshot storage.

With multiple daemons, you can choose which Backup Daemon, Sync Store,
Oplog Store, Snapshot Store, and Assignment Labels to bind to a specific
group. If you do not choose specific daemons and stores, |mms| uses all
available backup components for each group.

For a tutorial on how to assign Backup Jobs to Backup Daemons,
see :doc:`/tutorial/assign-snapshot-stores-to-data-center`.

Multiple Backup Daemons allow for **manual** failover should one daemon
become unavailable. You can instruct |mms| to transfer the daemon's
backup responsibilities to another Backup Daemon. |mms| reconstructs the
data on the new daemon's server and binds the associated replica sets or
shards to the new daemon. To learn how this process works, see
:doc:`/tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon`.

|mms| reconstructs the data using a snapshot and the oplog from the
:ref:`backup-database`.

The Backup Daemon is installed with |onprem| package but must be
specifically activated to run. Select the procedure specific to your
platform on the :doc:`/installation` section.

Replica Sets for Application and Backup Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy :term:`replica sets <replica set>` rather than standalones for
the :doc:`dedicated MongoDB processes
</tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` that host the
|application| Database and Backup Database. Replica sets provide
:manual:`automatic failover </core/replica-set-high-availability>`
should the :term:`primary` become unavailable.

When deploying a replica set with members in multiple facilities, ensure
that a single facility has enough votes to elect a :term:`primary` if
needed. Choose the facility that hosts the core application systems.
Place a majority of voting members and all the members that can become
primary in this facility. Otherwise, network partitions could prevent
the set from being able to form a majority.

   - For details on how replica sets elect primaries, see
     :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`.

   - To deploy a replica set, see :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set
     </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`.

Dedicated Restore Daemons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To decrease restore times or if you have multiple backup jobs per
daemon, add dedicated restore daemons. To configure dedicated restore
daemons, adjust the settings per backup daemon on the :guilabel:`Daemon`
:ref:`configuration <daemons-interface>` page.

To move jobs from a lost Backup server to another Backup server, see
:doc:`/tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon`.
