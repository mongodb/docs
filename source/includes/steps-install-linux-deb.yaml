   Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded ``.deb`` package,
   then run the following command to install the {+dbtools-short+} using
   the ``apt`` package manager:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo apt install ./{+dbtools-pkg+}-*-{+release+}.deb

   .. note::

      Be sure to include the leading ``./`` in the command above,
      which instructs ``apt`` to look for this file in the local    
      directory instead of searching remote repositories.
