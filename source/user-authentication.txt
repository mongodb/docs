User authentication
===================

If you want to use Laravel's native Auth functionality, register this included
service provider:

.. code-block:: php

   MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\PasswordResetServiceProvider::class,

This service provider will slightly modify the internal ``DatabaseReminderRepository``
to add support for MongoDB based password reminders.

If you don't use password reminders, you don't have to register this service
provider and everything else should work just fine.
