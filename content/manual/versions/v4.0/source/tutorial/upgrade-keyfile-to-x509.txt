To upgrade clusters that are currently using :ref:`keyfile authentication
<internal-auth-keyfile>` to x.509 authentication, use the following
rolling upgrade processes.

Clusters Currently Using TLS/SSL
--------------------------------

For clusters using TLS/SSL and keyfile authentication, to upgrade to x.509
cluster authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`TLS/SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to TLS/SSL Certificate and key PEM file>  --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file> --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   With this setting, each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode`
   to ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example,

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With this setting, each node uses its x.509 certificate, specified
   with the :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509`` to only use the
   x.509 certificate for authentication. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate x.509
   settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster uses
   x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

Clusters Currently Not Using TLS/SSL
------------------------------------

For clusters using keyfile authentication but not TLS/SSL, to upgrade to
x.509 authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--sslMode <mongod --sslMode>` set to ``allowSSL``, the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`TLS/SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode allowSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to TLS/SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file> --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   The :option:`--sslMode allowSSL <mongod --sslMode>` setting allows the
   node to accept both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming connections. Its
   outgoing connections do not use TLS/SSL.

   The :option:`--clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile <mongod --clusterAuthMode>`
   setting allows each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`sslMode`
   to ``preferSSL`` and the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to
   ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "preferSSL", clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``preferSSL``, the node accepts
   both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming connections, and its outgoing
   connections use TLS/SSL.

   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendX509``, each node
   uses its x.509 certificate, specified with the
   :option:`--sslClusterFile <mongod --sslClusterFile>` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`sslMode` to ``requireSSL`` and the
   :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "requireSSL", clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``requireSSL``, the node only uses
   TLS/SSLs connections.

   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``x509``, the node only
   uses the x.509 certificate for authentication.

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate TLS/SSL and
   x.509 settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster
   uses x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode <mongod --clusterAuthMode>` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

.. [#update-mode-alternative] As an alternative to using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command, you can also
   restart the nodes with the appropriate TLS/SSL and x509 options and
   values.
