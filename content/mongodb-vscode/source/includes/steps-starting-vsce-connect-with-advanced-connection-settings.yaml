  .. important::

     |vsce| **does not** support the following connection options:

     - CSFLE In-Use Encryption
     - Kerberos Authentication

  The :guilabel:`General` tab contains the following options:

  .. list-table:: 
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Option
       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Connection Type`
       - Type of connection. Select your connection type from the tabs 
         for specific instructions for defining that connection 
         type:
       
         .. tabs:: 

            .. tab:: Standalone
               :tabid: standalone

               For a :manual:`Standalone </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`, 
               specify the following: 

               - :guilabel:`Hostname` of the machine where the 
                 deployment is running. 
         
                 If you are running your deployment locally, this value 
                 is ``localhost``. If you are connecting to an 
                 |service| cluster, you can get your hostname from your 
                 cluster detail view in |service|.

                 If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your 
                 Database Administrator for information.

               - :guilabel:`Port` on which the deployment is running.
                 
                 By default, a standalone deployment operates on port 
                 ``27017``. For more information on the default ports 
                 MongoDB operates on, see :manual:`Default MongoDB Port 
                 </reference/default-mongodb-port/>`.

                 If you are not sure of the port where your deployment 
                 operates, contact your Database Administrator for 
                 information.

               Click :icon-fa4:`plus` to specify additional hostnames 
               and associated ports.

            .. tab:: Replica Set 
               :tabid: replicaset

               For a :manual:`replica set </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`, 
               specify the following: 
               
               - :guilabel:`Hostname` of the machine where the 
                 deployment is running.
         
                 If you are running your deployment locally, this value 
                 is ``localhost``. If you are connecting to an 
                 |service| cluster, you can get your hostname from your 
                 cluster detail view in |service|.

                 If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your 
                 Database Administrator for information.

               - :guilabel:`Port` on which the deployment is running.
                 
                 For information on the default ports MongoDB operates 
                 on, see :manual:`Default MongoDB Port 
                 </reference/default-mongodb-port/>`.

                 If you are not sure of the port where your deployment 
                 operates, contact your Database Administrator for 
                 information.

               - *Optional*. :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` as specified 
                 in the :manual:`replica set configuration </reference/replica-configuration/>`. 

               Click :icon-fa4:`plus` to specify additional hostnames 
               and associated ports.

            .. tab:: SRV Record 
               :tabid: srvrecord 

               For an :manual:`SRV Record </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`, 
               specify the :guilabel:`Hostname`. You do not need to 
               specify a port.

              

               SRV connection strings have a prefix of 
               ``mongodb+srv:``. If you are using an SRV connection 
               string, you do not need to include ``mongodb+srv`` in 
               your :guilabel:`Hostname`.

               For example: 

               If the following is your SRV connection string for 
               your MongoDB deployment:

               .. code-block:: shell
                  :copyable: false

                  mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@gettingstarted-7q2cs.mongodb.net/test

               Then, in |vsce|, you would specify your 
               :guilabel:`Hostname` as:

               .. code-block:: shell
                  :copyable: false

                  gettingstarted-7q2cs.mongodb.net

     * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
       - Authentication to use if the deployment requires 
         authentication. |service| clusters use :guilabel:`Username 
         / Password` authentication.
         
         Select your authentication method for
         specific instructions:

         .. tabs::

           tabs:

             - id: username-pw
               name: Username / Password
               content: |
                 Select :guilabel:`Username / Password` if the
                 deployment uses MongoDB-CR,
                 :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 </core/security-scram/>`, or  
                 :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>` as its
                 authentication mechanism.
                 
                 Provide the :guilabel:`Username`, :guilabel:`Password`,
                 and :manual:`Authentication Database
                 </core/security-users/#user-authentication-database>`
                 to authenticate the user.

             - id: OIDC
               name: OIDC
               content: |
               
                 Select :guilabel:`OIDC` if the deployment uses :manual:`OpenID Connect </core/security-oidc/>` 
                 as its authentication mechanism.
      
                 Provide the following information:

                 .. list-table::
                    :header-rows: 1
                    :widths: 50 50

                    * - Field
                      - Description

                    * - Username
                      - Optional. OpenID Connect username.

                    * - Auth Code Flow Redirect URI
                      - Optional. Specify a URI where the identity provider redirects you after authentication.
                        The URI must match the configuration of the Identity Provider.
                        The default is ``http://localhost:27097/redirect``.

                    * - Consider Target Endpoint Trusted
                      - Optional. Allows connecting to a target endpoint that is not in the 
                        list of endpoints that are considered trusted by default. Only use 
                        this option when connecting to servers that you trust.

                    * - Enable Device Authentication Flow
                      - Optional. When the :guilabel:`Show Device Auth Flow Checkbox`
                        setting is enabled, |vscode-short| can provide you with a URL and code 
                        to finish authentication. 

                 This is a less secure authentication flow that can be used as a 
                 fallback when browser-based authentication is unavailable.

             - id: x509
               name: X.509
               content: |

                 Select :guilabel:`X.509` if the deployment uses
                 :manual:`X.509 </core/security-x.509/>` as its
                 authentication mechanism. If selected, you must
                 provide the  :guilabel:`Username` to authenticate
                 the user.


                 If you are using 
                 :atlas:`Atlas-managed certificates </security-add-mongodb-users/#select-an-authentication-method>`
                 , your username must be prefaced by "CN="
                 per `RFC 2253 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253>`__. 
                 For example, the username "X509User" must be 
                 provided as "CN=X509User".

             - id: ldap
               name: LDAP
               content: |

                 Select :guilabel:`LDAP` if the deployment
                 uses :manual:`LDAP </core/security-ldap-external/>`
                 as its authentication mechanism. If selected, you
                 must provide the :guilabel:`Username` and
                 :guilabel:`Password` to authenticate
                 the user.

             - id: AWS-IAM
               name: AWS IAM
               content: |

                 Select AWS IAM if the deployment uses 
                 `AWS IAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`__ 
                 as its authentication mechanism.

                 .. list-table::
                    :header-rows: 1
                    :widths: 40 20 40

                    * - Field
                      - Necessity
                      - Description

                    * - AWS Access Key Id
                      - Required
                      - Unique identifier associated with your AWS 
                        account.

                    * - AWS Secret Access Key
                      - Optional
                      - Long-term credential associated with the access 
                        key ID.

                    * - AWS Session Token
                      - Optional
                      - A temporary security credential that is 
                        returned by the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

  If you are connecting to your deployment using TLS/SSL or an SSH
  tunnel, refer to the following tabs for specific instructions:
  
  .. tabs::
     
     .. tab:: Connect Using TLS/SSL
        :tabid: ssl

        This option directs |vsce| to connect to your
        MongoDB deployment via TLS/SSL. You can select one of the
        following SSL options:

        .. list-table::
           :header-rows: 1
           :widths: 10 40

           * - Option
             - Description
           
           * - :guilabel:`System CA/Atlas Deployment`
             - Connect to
               `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`_.

           * - :guilabel:`Server Validation`
             - |vsce| validates the identity of the deployment. If
               selected, you must provide:

               .. list-table::
                  :widths: 35 65

                  * - :guilabel:`Certificate Authority`

                    - One or more certificate files from trusted
                      Certificate Authorities to validate the
                      certificate provided by the deployment.

           * - :guilabel:`Server and Client Validation`
             - The deployment performs certificate validation from its
               clients and |vsce| validates the identity of the
               deployment. If selected, you must provide:

               .. list-table::
                  :widths: 35 65

                  * - :guilabel:`Certificate Authority File`

                    - One or more certificate files from trusted
                      Certificate Authorities to validate the
                      certificate provided by the deployment.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Certificate`

                    - A TLS/SSL certificate to present to
                      the deployment to verify the identity of
                      the connecting client. Typical file extensions
                      for the certificate are ``.crt`` or ``.pem``.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Private Key`

                    - A TLS/SSL key file to the deployment to
                      verify the identity of the connecting client.
                      Typical file extensions for the private key are
                      ``.key`` or ``.pem``.

                  * - :guilabel:`Client Key Password`

                    - If the *Client Private Key* is protected with a
                      password/passphrase, you must provide the
                      password/passphrase.

           * - :guilabel:`Unvalidated (Insecure)`
             - Use TLS/SSL without any identity validation.

        .. tip::

           For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
           certificates generated and signed by a single certificate
           authority. You or your organization can generate and
           maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
           certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL vendor.
  
     .. tab:: Connect Using SSH
        :tabid: ssh

        This option directs |vsce| to connect to your
        MongoDB deployment via an SSH tunnel. The tunnel automatically
        starts when you connect to MongoDB and stops when you
        disconnect.

        In the :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel` dropdown, choose either a
        password or an identity file to provide authentication. Once
        you select your identification method, specify the following
        options:

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 10 40

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Hostname`

             - Enter the bastion (jumpbox) hostname. This is the
               unique identifier (Fully Qualified Domain Name, or
               FQDN) for the machine to be accessed.


           * - :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel Port`

             - Provide the port used for the SSH connection. This
               defaults to 22, the standard port for SSH.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Username`

             - The username of the profile to log into on the remote
               system. This will be the user for which you want to
               establish the SSH connection.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Identity File`

             - Select the file from which the identity (private key)
               for SSH public key authentication is read.

               Unix or OS X: If using OpenSSH, identity files are
               found in the :file:`~/.ssh` directory. By default,
               the private key files have one of the following file
               names:

               - ``id_dsa``
               - ``id_ecdsa``
               - ``id_ed25519``
               - ``id_rsa``

               On Windows, the location of the identify files
               depends on your choice of SSH client, such as PuTTY.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Passphrase`

             - If your private key is encrypted, provide the
               passphrase used to decrypt your private key (stored
               in the specified identity file). A passphrase
               provides an extra layer of security for an SSH
               connection.

           * - :guilabel:`SSH Password`
             -  The password used to secure the SSH connection.
                This is required if you are not using an identity file.

        To use an SSH tunnel through a bastion host, the SSH
        configuration on the bastion host must allow TCP port
        forwarding; i.e., the ``AllowTcpForwarding`` directive in
        the :file:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file is set to ``yes``. If
        ``AllowTcpForwarding`` is not set to ``yes``, set to ``yes``
        and restart the SSH daemon (``sudo service sshd restart``).

        Instead of creating the SSH tunnel using |vsce|, you can also 
        create the tunnel manually from the command line:

        .. code-block:: sh

           ssh -L <local_port>:<mongodb_hostname>:<mongodb_port> \
              <user>@<bastion_hostname> -fN

        .. example::

           If you have a deployment running on
           ``hostname-a.com`` on port 27017, and the
           bastion host is ``hostname-b.com`` with user name
           ``ec2-user``, you can build the tunnel via

           .. code-block:: sh

              ssh -L 27000:hostname-a.com:27017 ec2-user@hostname-b.com -fN

           Using this SSH tunnel, you can now connect |vsce| (or
           the :binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell) to
           ``localhost:27000`` to connect to the deployment running on
           ``hostname-a.com``.

        .. note::

           You cannot connect to a :ref:`replica set <replication>` via an SSH
           tunnel. |vsce| cannot establish a connection
           to multiple servers across the same SSH tunnel.

  You can select the :guilabel:`Read Preference`, which specifies how 
  |vsce| directs read operations:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 50

     * - Read Preference Mode
       - Description
       
     * - :guilabel:`Primary`
       - Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set 
         primary.

     * - :guilabel:`Primary Preferred`
       - In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it 
         is unavailable, operations read from secondary members.

     * - :guilabel:`Secondary`
       - All operations read from the secondary members of the replica 
         set.

     * - :guilabel:`Secondary Preferred`
       - In most situations, operations read from secondary members but 
         if no secondary members are available, operations read from 
         the primary.

     * - :guilabel:`Nearest`
       - Operations read from member of the replica set with the least 
         network latency, irrespective of the member's type.
         
  If omitted, defaults to :guilabel:`Primary`. To learn more about read 
  preferences, see :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`. 

  You can specify additional MongoDB connection behavior with the 
  following options:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 50

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - Replica Set Name
       - (Optional) Name of replica set.

     * - Default Authentication Database
       - (Optional) Authentication database used when authSource is not specified.
         For more information, see :manual:`Authentication Options 
         </reference/connection-string/#authentication-options>`.

     * - URI Options
       - Additional options to customize your connection. You 
         specify these options as key-value pairs, and |vscode-short| 
         automatically adds the key-value pairs to the connection string. 
         For more information, see :manual:`Connection String Options 
         </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`.
