             If ``true``, :dbcommand:`compact` can run on the
             :term:`primary` in a :term:`replica set`. If ``false``,
             :dbcommand:`compact` returns an error when run on a
             primary, because the command blocks all other activity.
             Beginning with version 2.2, :dbcommand:`compact` blocks
             activity only for the database it is compacting.

             Describes the :term:`record size` allocated for each
             document as a factor of the document size for all records
             compacted during the :dbcommand:`compact` operation. The
             ``paddingFactor`` does not affect the padding of subsequent
             record allocations after :dbcommand:`compact` completes.
             For more information, see :ref:`compact-paddingFactor`.

             Sets the padding as an absolute number of bytes for all
