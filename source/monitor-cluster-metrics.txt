       View Metrics for All Atlas Clusters in a Project
       ------------------------------------------------
       
       The :guilabel:`Clusters` view displays all clusters in a 
       |service| :ref:`project <projects>`. |service| displays up to four
       of the following charts for each cluster in the project:
       
       .. list-table::
          :widths: 35 65
          :header-rows: 1
        
          * - Chart
        
            - Data
        
          * - :guilabel:`Operations`
        
            - Displays the aggregated read (:guilabel:`R`) and write 
              (:guilabel:`W`) operations on the cluster. 
        
              For a replica set, the chart shows operations for the
              :term:`primary`. 
        
              For a :term:`sharded cluster`, the chart shows
              the sum of the operations on each primary in the cluster.
        
          * - :guilabel:`Logical Size`
              
              ``M0/M2/M5`` *Clusters Only*
        
            - Displays the sum of total bytes of the documents and index data
              across all databases in the cluster.
        
          * - :guilabel:`Disk Usage`
              
              ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*
        
            - The total bytes of used disk space for the cluster.
        
              For a replica set, the chart shows the disk usage of the
              primary host machine.
        
              For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of disk usage
              on each primary host in the cluster. 
        
          * - :guilabel:`Connections`
        
            - The total number of active connections to the cluster.
        
              For a replica set, the chart shows the number of active 
              connections to the primary.
        
              For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of all 
              active connections to each primary in the cluster.
        
          * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`
              
              ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*
              
            - The sum of read and write input/output operations per second
              (IOPS) for the cluster. 
        
              For a replica set, the chart shows the total IOPS for the
              primary.
        
              For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of IOPS on
              each primary in the cluster.

       that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster to open
       the cluster overview, then click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.
       
       The :guilabel:`Metrics` view has three distinct sections:

       Chart Controls
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       |service| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Metric` 
       view. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under 
       the :guilabel:`Metrics` view:

       Chart Selection
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       |service| displays the available metrics to chart for the
       selected cluster under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` header. 
       Metrics are grouped into two sections:
       
       :guilabel:`MongoDB Metrics`
         Metrics associated with the MongoDB process. For metrics 
         related to database performance, such as 
         :guilabel:`DB Storage`, |service| presents the sum total across
         all databases in the cluster.
       
         If you enable 
         :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts`, 
         |service| replaces the :guilabel:`Opcounters` option with the
         individual components of that chart. 
       
       :guilabel:`Hardware Metrics`
         Metrics associated with the host machines supporting the cluster.
       
         Charts marked with the ``+`` symbol are inactive, 
         while charts marked with the ``-`` symbol are active. Click
         on any chart to toggle the chart state.

       Data Sources
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
       |service| displays each data source that contributes to the 
       metric chart in a table below the chart. The table consists of 
       the following:
 
       .. list-table::
          :widths: 35 65

          * - Column
            - Description
 
          * - :guilabel:`Shard Name`
            - When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``, displays the name
              of each shard in the sharded cluster.
              
              When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``MONGOS`` or ``CONFIGS``,
              displays the name of each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` or
              config server :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process in the
              cluster.
 
              Click on a listed component to open the
              :guilabel:`Metrics` view for that component.
 
          * - :guilabel:`Alerts`
            - Indicates if there are any open alerts for the listed 
              shard or process. Click on the alert icon to open the
              :guilabel:`Alerts` view for that shard or process. For
              more information on responding to open alerts, see
              :doc:`/respond-to-alerts`.
 
          * - :guilabel:`Data Size`
            - Only visible if :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``.
 
              Indicates the logical size of all documents and indexes 
              on the shard.

       View Metrics for a Single MongoDB Process
       -----------------------------------------
 
       To view the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in a 
       |service| cluster, click on that process from the
       cluster view. The |service| process view displays three tabs for
       monitoring metrics for the process:
 
       - The :guilabel:`Status` tab displays the process metrics |service|
         collects from the selected :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or
         :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` process.
 
       - The :guilabel:`Hardware` tab displays hardware metrics for
         the host machine supporting the selected 
         :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
         process.
 
       - The :guilabel:`DB Stats` tab displays the database metrics for the
         selected database.
 
         |service| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but
         adjusts frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on database
         performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
         performance, you can disable collection by clicking 
         :guilabel:`Settings` from the left-hand navigation, 
         then :guilabel:`Project Settings`, and then setting 
         :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to :guilabel:`No`.
 
       The view for each tab has three distinct sections:

          |service| supports :guilabel:`Real Time` metrics for
          ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` processes and replica
          set clusters. For sharded clusters, you can view 
          :guilabel:`Real Time` metrics for each shard replica set.

          You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>`
          |service| user role to access the :guilabel:`Real Time` tab.
 
       To view Real Time metrics for a specific |service| cluster in a 
       :ref:`project <projects>`, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button 
       for that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster
       to open the cluster overview, then click the 
       :guilabel:`Metrics` tab. From the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab,
       click :guilabel:`Real Time` to open the
