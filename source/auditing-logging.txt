{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Auditing and Logging
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

.. _auditing:

Auditing
````````

Available on ``M10+`` {+clusters+}, database auditing lets you track system 
activity for deployments with
multiple users. As an |service| administrator, you can:

- Rely on default auditing settings in |service|. By default, |service|
  performs database authentication auditing in ``M10+`` {+clusters+} to
  record authentication events, including those pertaining to:

  - database users
  - source IP addresses
  - timestamps for successful and failed attempts

- :atlas:`Configure a JSON-formatted audit filter 
  </database-auditing/#configure-a-custom-auditing-filter>` to
  customize MongoDB auditing
  and select the actions, database users, |service| roles, and |ldap| groups
  that you want to audit. If you create a custom audit filter, you can
  skip using the managed {+atlas-ui+} auditing filter builder and configure
  your own tailored filter of event auditing. For a full list of
  events you can configure for auditing, and for a list of examples,
  see :manual:`MongoDB auditing </core/auditing>` and :atlas:`Example Auditing Filters 
  </database-auditing/#example-auditing-filters>`.
  
  You can :manual:`configure manual auditing </core/auditing>` of most of the
  documented :manual:`system event actions </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`
  in |service|. Granular MongoDB database auditing allows you to track
  usage of all DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language),
  and DCL (Data Control Language) commands in detail. See also
  :atlas:`Set up Database Auditing </database-auditing>`.

.. _accessing-audit-logs:

Accessing Audit Logs
````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/cloud-docs/logs.rst

You can review and update your auditing configuration per project. Use
the following {+atlas-cli+} commands:

- :ref:`atlas auditing describe <atlas-auditing-describe>` returns the
  auditing configuration for the specified project.
- :ref:`atlas auditing update <atlas-auditing-update>` updates
  the auditing configuration for the specified project.

You can :ref:`view authentication attempts <access-tracking>` that users make
against your {+cluster+} with the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, or {+atlas-ui+}.
|service| logs both successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts,
including the timestamp of each attempt and which user tried to authenticate.

You can also :ref:`view and filter the activity feed <view-activity-feed>`
for an organization or project with the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+},
or {+atlas-ui+}. The activity feed lists all events at the organization or project level.

To perform a full audit, you can use a combination of audit logs,
:manual:`MongoDB log messages </reference/log-messages/>`, and
:ref:`the project and organization activity feed <view-activity-feed>`.

Recommendations for Auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you :atlas:`set up database auditing </database-auditing>`
when you provision your {+clusters+}. 
Auditing puts additional load on your {+clusters+} and increases costs. 
To optimize costs, you can disable auditing in lower environments for development. 
Certain industries, such as healthcare and financial services, may opt to keep 
auditing enabled in development environments for compliance reasons.

Enabling auditing for all database users, including application
service users, might affect cluster performance. We recommend that you
audit only the actions of users that require auditing.

For staging and production environments, enable auditing for
additional security.

We recommend that you audit the following events at a minimum:

- Failed logon
- Session activity
- Logon and logoff
- Attempts to perform unauthorized functions
- Password change
- Database User Access changes
- DDL & System configuration stored procedures
- Modification of Native audit
- Running a backup or restore operation
- Altering DBMS native audit settings
- Altering security
- Running database start and stop commands

For all of the previous events, you should include in the audit log the following
information at a minimum:

- Session ID
- Client hostname and IP address
- Database server hostname and IP address
- Database user
- Database name
- OS user
- Service/instance name
- Port
- Application
- Query
- SQL command
- Object
- Timestamp
- Error code (if applicable)

Recommendations for Programmatic Access to Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate with tools beyond the built-in integrations, we recommend
that you retrieve logs with the following programmatic tools and feed
the JSON-formatted output to your external tools:

- To continually push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket, use the {+atlas-admin-api+}
  endpoints for :oas-atlas-tag:`Push-Based Log Export <Push-Based-Log-Export>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs and lists of project events,
  use the {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints for :oas-atlas-tag:`Logs <MongoDB-Cloud-Users>`
  and :oas-atlas-tag:`Project and Organization Events <Events>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs, use :ref:`atlas deployment logs <atlas-deployments-logs>`
  command in the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas Deployment Logs </cli/current/command/atlas-deployments-logs/>`.

Examples

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      Update Audit Configuration
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following {+atlas-cli+} command to audit all authentication events
      for known users in your project:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-known-users.rst

      Run the following {+atlas-cli+} command to audit a known user
      via a configuration file:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-config-file.rst

      Describe Audit Configuration
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the :ref:`atlas auditing describe <atlas-auditing-describe>`
      {+atlas-cli+} command to return the auditing configuration for the specified project:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-describe.rst

      Create and Use Audit Filter
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Create an audit filter to only audit the authenticate operations
      that occur against the test database. To learn more,
      see :manual:`Configure Audit Filters </tutorial/configure-audit-filters/>`.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-filter.rst

      To use an audit filter that you created, update the audit configuration
      using the :ref:`atlas auditing update <atlas-auditing-describe>`
      {+atlas-cli+} command:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-filter-use.rst

      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To retrieve the access log, use a command similar to the following.
      This command returns a JSON-formatted list of all authentication
      requests made against the {+clusters+} named ``Cluster0`` for the project
      with the ID ``618d48e05277a606ed2496fe``:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-logs.rst

      Retrieve All Log Events for Organization in a JSON File
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To return all events for the specified organization, use a command
      similar to the following. This command returns a JSON-formatted list
      of events for the organization with the ID ``5dd5a6b6f10fab1d71a58495``:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-logs-org.rst

      Download Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the following {+atlas-cli+} command to download a compressed file that
      contains the MongoDB logs for the specified host in your project.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-download-logs.rst

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform
 
      The following example demonstrates how to enable auditing for
      your deployment. Before you can create resources with Terraform,
      you must:

      - :ref:`Create your paying organization <configure-paying-org>`
        and :ref:`create an API key <atlas-admin-api-access>` for the
        paying organization. Store your public and private keys as
        environment variables by running the following commands in the terminal:

        .. code-block::

           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      - `Install Terraform <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli>`__.

      Enable Auditing and Create an Auditing Filter for the {+Cluster+}
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can :manual:`configure manual auditing </core/auditing>` of most of the
      documented :manual:`system event actions </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`
      by creating audit filters. To learn more about configuring audit filters,
      see :manual:`Configure Audit Filters </tutorial/configure-audit-filters/>`.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-auditing-filter.rst

      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can't retrieve logs with Terraform. Instead, use the following
      {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints:

      - Use :oas-atlas-tag:`Access Tracking Admin API </Access-Tracking>`
        to return access logs for all authentication attempts for the database,
        identified by the cluster's name or hostname.

      - Use :oas-atlas-tag:`Monitoring and Logs APIs </Monitoring-and-Logs>`
        to retrieve a compressed log file with log messages for the specified
        host.
