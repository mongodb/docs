The :guilabel:`Schema` tab provides an overview of the data type
and shape of the fields in a particular collection. Databases
and collections are visible in the left-side navigation.

The overview is based on :ref:`sampling <compass-sampling>`
the documents in the collection. The schema overview may include
additional data about the contents of the fields, such as the
minimum and maximum values of dates and integers, the frequency of
occurrence of particular values, and the cardinality of the data.

MongoDB has a :manual:`flexible schema model
</core/data-modeling-introduction/>`, which means that some fields may
contain different types of data from one document to the next. For
example, a field named ``address`` may contain strings and integers in
some documents, objects in others, or some combination of all three.

In the case of heterogenous fields, the :guilabel:`Schema` tab shows a
breakdown of the various data types contained within the field with the
percentage of each data type represented.

.. example::

   The :guilabel:`Schema` tab shows size information about the
   ``test.restaurants`` collection at the top, including the total
   number of documents in the collection, the average document size,
   and the total disk space occupied by the collection.

   The following fields are shown with details:

   - The ``_id`` field is an
     :manual:`ObjectId </reference/bson-types/index.html#objectid>`.
     Each ObjectId contains a timestamp, so |compass-short| displays the range
     of creation times for the sampled documents.

   - The ``address`` field contains four nested fields. You
     can expand the field panel to see analyses of each of the nested
     fields.

   - The ``borough`` field contains a string indicating the borough in
     which the restaurant is located. The cardinality is low enough
     that |compass-short| can provide a graded bar of the field contents, with
     the most-frequently occurring string on the left.

   - The ``grades`` field contains arrays of strings. The analysis
     shows the minimum, maximum, and average array lengths.

Query Bar
---------

Using the :ref:`query bar <compass-query-bar>` in the :guilabel:`Schema` tab,
you can create a query filter to limit your result set. Click the
:guilabel:`Options` button to specify query options, such as the
particular fields to display and the number of results to return.

.. tip::

   In the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can also use the :ref:`compass-build-query` to
   enter a query into the query bar.

Field Descriptions
------------------

For each field, |compass-short| displays summary information about the data
type or types the field contains and the range of values. Depending
on the data type and the level of cardinality, |compass-short| displays
histograms, graded bars, geographical maps, and sample data to provide
a sense of the shape and scope of the data contained in each field.

Field with a Single Data Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of the data type summary for a field called
``last_login`` which contains data of type ``date``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px
   :alt: Example of a field with a single data type

Field with Multiple Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For fields that contain multiple data types,
|compass-short| displays a percentage breakdown of
the various data types across documents. In the example below,
the chart shows the contents of a field called ``phone_no`` in which
20% of documents are of type ``int32``, and the remaining 80% are of
type ``string``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px
   :alt: Example of percentage breakdown for data types

Missing Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain
a value, the missing values display as ``undefined``. In the example
below, the field ``age`` has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled
documents.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-sparsity.png
   :figwidth: 330px
   :alt: Example of sparcely applied data type

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are
entirely unique strings in a field, |compass-short| shows a random
selection of string values from the specified field. Click
the circular refresh icon to see
a new set of randomly selected values from the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample.png
   :figwidth: 755px
   :alt: Example of string data types

If there are only a few different string values,
|compass-short| shows the strings in a single graded bar which
shows the percentage of the population of the string values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 742px
   :alt: Example of few string data types

If there are multiple string values with some duplicates,
|compass-short| shows a histogram indicating the frequency of
each string found within the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-sample3.png
   :figwidth: 734px
   :alt: Example of string data types as a histogram

.. note::

   Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the
   value of the string.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Numbers are similar to strings in their representation.
Unique numbers are shown in the following manner:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample.png
   :figwidth: 764px
   :alt: Example of number data type

Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their
frequency:

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-sample2.png
   :figwidth: 762px
   :alt: Example of duplicate number data types

Dates and ObjectIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID
data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple
bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the
week and time of day of the timestamp value.

The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp
value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the
timestamp across the range of first to last.

.. figure:: /images/compass/date-sample.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Example of Date data types

Embedded Documents and Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with
a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the
data contained within the sub-document or array.

.. figure:: /images/compass/embedded-document-sample.png
   :figwidth: 662px
   :alt: Example of fields with embedded documents or arrays

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the embedded
documents:

   :figwidth: 748px
   :alt: Expanding the embedded documents

GeoJSON and ``[longitude,latitude]`` Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that contain GeoJSON data or ``[longitude,latitude]`` arrays are
displayed with interactive maps. For more information on interacting
with location data in |compass-short|, see :ref:`compass-analyze-location-data`.

.. END-COMPASS-ONLY

View Charts of Mixed Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a field has mixed types, you can view different charts of each type
by clicking on the ``type`` field. In the example below, the ``age``
field shows the values that are strings:

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-sample.png
   :figwidth: 574px
   :alt: Example of a field with mixed types

Clicking on the ``int32`` type causes the chart to show its numeric
data:

.. _compass-build-query:

Query Builder
-------------

In the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can type the filter manually into
the query bar or generate the filter with the |compass-short| query builder.
The query builder allows you to select data elements from one or more
fields in your schema and construct a query matching the selected
elements.

.. tip::

   You can compose the initial query filter by using the clickable query
   builder and then manually edit the generated filter to your exact
   requirements.

The following procedure describes the steps involved in
building a complex query with the query bar.

.. include:: /includes/shared/steps/create-query-via-builder.rst

.. _compass-analyze-location-data:

Analyze Location Data
---------------------

In the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can use interactive maps to filter
and analyze location data. If your field contains
:manual:`GeoJSON data </reference/geojson/>` or
``[longitude,latitude]`` arrays, the :guilabel:`Schema` tab displays
a map containing the points from the field. The data type
for location fields is ``coordinates``.

.. figure:: /images/compass/location-data-example.png
   :figwidth: 575px
   :alt: Image showing example field with location data

Apply a Location Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply a filter to the map to only analyze a specific
range of points. To define a location filter:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Circle` button at the top-right
   of the map.
   
#. Click and drag on the map to draw a circle containing the area of
   the map you want to analyze.

#. Repeat this process as desired to include additional areas of
   the map in the schema analysis.

.. figure:: /images/compass/location-data-filter.png
   :figwidth: 575px
   :alt: Image showing map with filter circles drawn

The query bar updates as you draw location filters to show
the exact coordinates used in the
:manual:`$geoWithin </reference/operator/query/geoWithin/>` query
applied to the schema analysis.

If you specify multiple location filters, the query becomes
an :manual:`$or </reference/operator/query/or/>` query
with multiple ``$geoWithin`` operators.

Edit a Location Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To move or resize a location filter, click :icon-fa5:`edit` on the
right side of the map. You will enter the filter editing mode, which
looks like this:

.. figure:: /images/compass/location-data-filter-edit.png
   :figwidth: 575px
   :alt: Image showing map filter editing

To move a filter
  Click and drag the square in the center of the circle.

To resize a filter
  Click and drag the square at the edge of the circle.

After modifying your filters, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Delete a Location Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a location filter from the map:

1. Click :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` on the right side of the map.

#. Either click:

   - A location filter to delete that filter.

   - :guilabel:`Clear All` to delete all location filters.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. |query-build-type| replace:: :ref:`compass-build-query`

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the analysis of your schema times out, it might be because the 
collection you are analyzing is very large, causing MongoDB to stop the 
operation  before the analysis is complete. Increase the value of 
``MAX TIME MS`` to allow the operation time to complete.

To increase the value of :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS`:

1. In the query bar, expand :guilabel:`Options`.

   .. figure:: /images/compass/max-time-ms.png
      :alt: The Options button is on the right side of the query bar, 
            next to the Analyze button.

2. Increase the value of :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` to accommodate your collection.
   :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` defaults to 60000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds, but large 
   collections might take tens of seconds to analyze.

Once you have increased the value of :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS`, retry your schema 
analysis by clicking :guilabel:`Analyze`.
