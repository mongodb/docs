"The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on "

"The MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of :ref:`stages <aggregation-"
"pipeline-operator-reference>`. Each stage transforms the documents as "
"they pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce "
"one output document for every input document; e.g., some stages may "
"generate new documents or filter out documents. Pipeline stages can "
"appear multiple times in the pipeline."

"In MongoDB, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command operates on a single "

"The :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator takes advantage of a "

"Starting in MongoDB 3.2, indexes can :ref:`cover <read-operations-"

"If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the data in a "
"collection, use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and "
":pipeline:`$skip` stages to restrict the documents that enter at the "
"beginning of the pipeline. When placed at the beginning of a pipeline, "
":pipeline:`$match` operations use suitable indexes to scan only the "
"matching documents in a collection."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/aggregation-pipeline.txt:123
msgid ""
"Placing a :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage followed by a "
":pipeline:`$sort` stage at the start of the pipeline is logically "
"equivalent to a single query with a sort and can use an index. When "
