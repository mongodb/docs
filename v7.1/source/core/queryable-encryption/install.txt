Overview
--------

Learn about the applications and libraries you must install to use
{+qe+}.

What You Need
-------------

Before you can use {+qe+}, set up the following items
in your development environment:

- (Optional) Download the :ref:`{+shared-library+} <qe-reference-shared-library-download>`. 
  The {+shared-library+} replaces :ref:`mongocryptd <qe-mongocryptd>` and
  does not require spawning a new process.
  
- Install a :ref:`MongoDB Driver Compatible with {+qe+} <qe-driver-compatibility>`.
- Start an
  :atlas:`Atlas Cluster </getting-started?jmp=docs>`
  or a
  :manual:`MongoDB Enterprise instance
  </tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#start-mongod-processes>`

  .. warning::

     You can use {+qe+} only with MongoDB 7.0 and later, which
     may not yet be available in MongoDB Atlas.
  
- Install specific driver dependencies. To see the list of
  dependencies for your driver, select the tab corresponding to the language you
  would like to use to complete this guide:
