{+df+} Costs
---------------------

You incur {+adf+} costs for the following items: 

- Data processed by {+fdi+}\s
- Data returned by {+fdi+}\s

Total Data Processed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that {+adf+} processes 
from your underlying sources, rounded up to the nearest megabyte. 
|service| charges $5.00 per TB of processed data, with a 10 MB minimum
processed data per query. 

You incur "Data Processed" costs for the amount of data that {+adf+} 
processes to return results for your queries in addition to the "Data 
Returned" cost for the amount of data that {+adf+} returns. For 
example, for a 10 GB file, you incur the following "Data Processed" 
cost in addition to the "Data Returned" cost:

- If you have no partitions or if {+adf+} needs to read the entire file 
  to return results for the query, you incur 10 GB of "Data Processed" 
  cost.
- If you have 10 partitions of 1 GB each, {+adf+} targets and reads a 
  single partition. Therefore, you incur 1 GB of "Data Processed" cost.

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |AWS| |s3| to 
reduce the amount of processed data. You can also configure :ref:`query
limits <adf-manage-query-limits>` to limit the amount of data that
{+adf+} processes for your {+fdi+}\s and control costs.

Total Data Returned and Transferred
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned and 
transferred by your {+fdi+}. This total is the sum of all the following 
data transfers:

- The number of bytes returned to the client while reading query results
- The number of bytes transferred between {+df+} query nodes while 
  executing a query
- The number of bytes written by {+df+} during :ref:`adf-out-stage` or 
  :ref:`adf-merge-stage` operations

The cost of data transfer depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges 
for same-region, region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer. 
|aws| charges $0.01 per GB for the number of bytes returned and 
transferred within the same |aws| region and for the number of bytes 
returned to the client.
