   :returns: Boolean.

   :method:`cursor.hasNext()` returns ``true`` if the cursor returned by
   the :method:`db.collection.find()` query can iterate further to
   return more documents. If the client-side cursor batch is empty and the
   server has more data, ``hasNext()`` fetches the next batch from the server.
