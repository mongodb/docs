Sync Data Unidirectionally from a Client Application
----------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define an Asymmetric Object

      Data Ingest and asymmetric objects require Flexible Sync. To define an
      asymmetric object, pass ``ObjectType.asymmetricObject`` to
      ``@RealmModel()``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_ingest.test.snippet.asymmetric-sync-object.dart
         :language: dart
         :emphasize-lines: 1

      For more information on how to define an asymmetric object, refer to 
      :ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <flutter-define-an-asymmetric-object>`.

   .. step:: Connect and Authenticate with an App Services App

      To stream data from the client to your backend App, you must 
      :ref:`connect to an App Services backend <flutter-connect-to-backend>` and
      :ref:`authenticate a user <flutter-authenticate>`.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/app_services_test.snippet.access-app-client.dart
         :language: dart

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/authenticate_users_test.snippet.anonymous-credentials.dart
         :language: dart

   .. step:: Open a Realm

      After you have an authenticated user, open a :ref:`synced realm 
      <flutter-open-synced-realm>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_flexible_sync_realm_test.snippet.open-flexible-sync-realm.dart
         :language: dart

      Unlike bi-directional Sync, Data Ingest does not use a 
      :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription <flutter-flexible-sync-manage-subscriptions>`.
         
      You can't query an asymmetric object or persist it in a local
      realm, so asymmetric objects are incompatible with bi-directional
      Flexible Sync, Partition-Based Sync, and local Realm use.

   .. step:: Create Asymmetric Objects

      Once you have an open Realm, you can create an asymmetric object inside
      a write transaction. Pass your object data to ``realm.ingest``.
            
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_ingest.test.snippet.write-asymmetric-object.dart
         :language: dart 
         
      You can't read asymmetric objects. Once created, they sync to the App 
      Services backend and the linked Atlas database.

      Atlas Device Sync completely manages the lifecycle of this data. 
      It is maintained on the device until Data Ingest synchronization is 
      complete, and then removed from the device.
