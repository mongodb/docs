"MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations to "

" *map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects"
" for each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of "
"the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to "
"make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation "
"operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input "
"documents as well as sort and limit the results."
