Supported Key Management Services
---------------------------------

Client-side field level encryption requires a Key Management Service
(KMS) for accessing a Customer Master Key (CMK). MongoDB automatically
encrypts data encryption keys using the specified CMK during 
:ref:`data encryption key creation <keyvault-createkey-method>`.

Deleting the CMK renders all data encryption keys encrypted with that
CMK as permanently unreadable, which in turn renders all values
encrypted with those data encryption keys as permanently unreadable.

Client-side field level encryption supports the following KMS providers:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services KMS <field-level-encryption-aws-kms>`
- :ref:`Azure Key Vault <field-level-encryption-azure-keyvault>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform KMS <field-level-encryption-gcp-kms>`
- :ref:`Locally Managed Key <field-level-encryption-local-kms>`

.. _field-level-encryption-aws-kms:

Amazon Web Services KMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/csfle-aws-kms-4.2.0-4.2.1-broken.rst

MongoDB client-side encryption supports using the 
`Amazon Web Services Key Management Service 
<https://aws.amazon.com/kms>`__ for encrypting
and decrypting data encryption keys. Specifically, MongoDB securely
transmits the data encryption key to AWS KMS for encrypting or
decrypting using the specified Customer Master Key (CMK). The CMK never
leaves the AWS KMS. 

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports two methods for configuring 
access to an AWS KMS:

- Use the client-side field level encryption :ref:`command-line options 
  <mongo-client-side-field-level-encryption-options>`, or

- Use the :method:`Mongo()` constructor to create a database connection
  with the required AWS :ref:`KMS configuration options
  <ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions>`.

Configuring access to an AWS KMS requires at minimum an AWS Access Key
and its corresponding Secret Key. The IAM User associated to the Access
Key must have at least one policy with the following actions:

- ``kms:Encrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`__ 

- ``kms:Decrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html>`__ 

.. note:: Implement Principle of Least Privilege for KMS Access

   Consider configuring IAM user roles such that MongoDB has only the 
   access to the actions and resources required to function. 

   For example, the following policy JSON scopes the required actions to
   a single CMK:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "kms:Decrypt",
                      "kms:Encrypt"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/12a345b6-cd7e-8f9g-0h1i-jk23l45mn6o7"
              }
          ]
      }

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using AWS
KMS, see :ref:`Manage Data Encryption Keys <manual-manage-dek>` and
select the "Amazon Web Services KMS" tab.

.. _field-level-encryption-azure-keyvault:

Azure Key Vault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB client-side encryption supports using the 
`Azure Key Vault Key Management Service 
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/>`__ for encrypting
and decrypting data encryption keys. Specifically, MongoDB securely
transmits the data encryption key to Azure Key Vault for encrypting or
decrypting using the specified Customer Master Key (CMK). The CMK never
leaves the Azure Key Vault. 

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports specifying Azure Key Vault
as a KMS using the :method:`Mongo()` constructor using the
:ref:`KMS configuration options
<ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions>`.

Configuring access to Azure Key Vault requires at minimum an Azure
Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. The Tenant ID must have the
ability to perform the following actions:

- ``wrap key`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/wrapkey/wrapkey>`__ 

- ``unwrap key`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/unwrapkey/unwrapkey>`__ 

.. note::

   MongoDB does *not* support Azure's client certificate authentication
   (also known as TLS mutual authentication).

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using
Azure Key Vault, see
:ref:`Manage Data Encryption Keys <manual-manage-dek>` and select the
"Azure Key Vault" tab.

.. _field-level-encryption-gcp-kms:

Google Cloud Platform KMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB client-side encryption supports using the 
`Google Cloud KMS <https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/>`__ for encrypting
and decrypting data encryption keys. Specifically, MongoDB securely
transmits the data encryption key to Google Cloud KMS for encrypting or
decrypting using the specified Customer Master Key (CMK). The CMK never
leaves the Google Cloud KMS.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports specifying Google Cloud KMS
as a KMS using the :method:`Mongo()` constructor using the
:ref:`KMS configuration options
<ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions>`.

Configuring access to Google Cloud KMS requires at minimum a Google
Cloud Email and associated Private Key. The Google Cloud Email account
must have the following IAM permissions for the specified Private Key:

- ``cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToEncrypt`` 

- ``cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToDecrypt`` 

These IAM permissions are included in certain
`Google Cloud predefined roles
<https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/permissions-and-roles#predefined>`__
or can be included in a
`Google Cloud custom role
<https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/permissions-and-roles#custom_roles>`__.

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using
Google Cloud KMS, see
:ref:`Manage Data Encryption Keys <manual-manage-dek>` and select the
"Google Cloud KMS" tab.

.. _field-level-encryption-local-kms:

Locally Managed Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` supports specifying a locally managed key
as a KMS using the :method:`Mongo()` constructor. The local key *must*
be a 96-byte long string.

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using a
locally managed key, see
:ref:`Manage Data Encryption Keys <manual-manage-dek>` and select the
"Local Keyfile" tab.

.. _field-level-encryption-keyvault:

Encryption Key Vault
--------------------

The key vault is a collection that stores data encryption keys for use
with client-side field level encryption. Data encryption keys are
encrypted using a Customer Master Key (CMK) managed through a supported
:ref:`Key Management System (KMS) <field-level-encryption-kms>`.

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides helper methods for data
encryption key management:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 60 40

   * - Use Case
     - Helper Methods

   * - Retrieving data encryption keys
     - | :method:`KeyVault.getKey()`
       | :method:`KeyVault.getKeys()`
       | :method:`KeyVault.getKeyByAltName()`

   * - Creating or Modifying data encryption keys
     - | :method:`KeyVault.createKey()`
       | :method:`KeyVault.addKeyAlternateName()`
       | :method:`KeyVault.removeKeyAlternateName()`

   * - Removing data encryption keys
     - :method:`KeyVault.deleteKey()`

       .. important::
          
          Removing a data encryption key renders all fields encrypted
          using that data encryption key as permanently unreadable.


Applications with :authrole:`read` access to the key vault collection
can retrieve data encryption keys by querying the collection. However,
only applications with access to the CMK used to encrypt a data
encryption key can use that key for encryption or decryption.

By default MongoDB stores the key vault collection on the connected
cluster. MongoDB also supports specifying a remote cluster as the key
vault. Applications must have access to both the remote key vault
cluster and the connection cluster to perform client-side field level
encryption operations.

Data encryption keys have the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : UUID("<string>"),
     "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"<encrypted binary data string>"),
   	 "creationDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "updateDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "status" : <int>,
   	 "version" : NumberLong(0),
   	 "masterKey" : {
   	   "provider" : "<string>",
   	   "key" : "<string>",
   	   "region" : "<string>",
   	   "endpoint" : "<string>"
   	 },
   	 "keyAltNames" : [
       "<string>"
     ]
   }

Client-side field level encryption depends on uniqueness of
``keyAltNames`` values. The :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
:method:`KeyVault.createKey()` method creates a :ref:`unique index
<index-type-unique>` on ``keyAltNames`` if one does not exist.
Applications can use the :dbcommand:`listIndexes` command against the
key vault collection to check if the unique index exists. If the unique
index does not exist, applications *must* create it prior to performing
data encryption key management.

For complete documentation on data encryption key management, see
:ref:`Manage Data Encryption Keys <manual-manage-dek>`.
