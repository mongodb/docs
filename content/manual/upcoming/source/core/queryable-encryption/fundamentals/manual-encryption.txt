Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-csfle-manual-enc-overview.rst

{+manual-enc-first+} is available in the following MongoDB products:

- MongoDB Community Server
- MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
- MongoDB Atlas

Use {+manual-enc-title+}
------------------------

.. _qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption-client-enc:

Create a ClientEncryption Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ClientEncryption`` is an abstraction used across drivers and
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` that encapsulates the {+key-vault-long+}
and {+kms-abbr+} operations involved in {+manual-enc+}.

To create a ``ClientEncryption`` instance, specify:

- A ``kmsProviders`` object configured with access to the
  {+kms-abbr+} provider hosting your {+cmk-long+}
- The namespace of your {+key-vault-long+}
- If you use MongoDB Community Server, set the ``bypassQueryAnalysis``
  option to ``True``
- A ``MongoClient`` instance with access to your {+key-vault-long+}

For more ``ClientEncryption`` options, see :ref:`qe-reference-mongo-client`. 

.. _qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption-update-operations:

Encrypt Fields in Read and Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must update read and write operations throughout your application
such that your application encrypts fields before performing
read and write operations.

To encrypt fields, use the ``encrypt`` method of your ``ClientEncryption``
instance. Specify the following:

- The value to be encrypted
- The algorithm used: ``Indexed``, ``Unindexed``, or ``Range``
- The ID of the {+dek-long+}
- The :ref:`contention factor <qe-contention>` (if you are using the 
  ``Indexed`` or ``Range`` algorithm)
- If you are performing a read operation using the ``Indexed`` or 
  ``Range`` algorithm, set the query type defined for your field.
- The ``range`` options :ref:`min, max<qe-field-min-max>` (if you 
  are using the ``Range`` algorithm)

.. note:: Query Types

   The query type only applies to read operations.

   To learn more about query types, see :ref:`qe-query-types`. 

.. _qe-fundamentals-man-enc-algorithm-choice:

Algorithm Choice
````````````````

Use the ``Indexed`` or ``Range`` algorithm if you specify a 
``queryType`` on the field.

``Indexed`` supports equality queries. ``Range`` supports range 
queries. ``Indexed`` and ``Range`` fields require an index on the 
server. The index is created by specifying the ``encryptedFields`` 
option in :method:`db.createCollection()`. 

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/rangePreview-deprecated.rst

.. _qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption-automatic-decryption:

Automatic Decryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To decrypt fields automatically, configure your ``MongoClient`` 
instance as follows:

- Specify a ``kmsProviders`` object
- Specify your {+key-vault-long+}
- If you use MongoDB Community Server, set the ``bypassQueryAnalysis``
  option to ``True``

.. note:: Automatic Decryption in MongoDB Community Server

   Automatic decryption is available in MongoDB Community Server. 
   Automatic encryption requires MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB
   Atlas. 

.. _qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption-server-side-schema:

Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement
----------------------------------------------

:ref:`qe-specify-fields-for-encryption` to enforce 
encryption of specific fields in a collection.

``Indexed`` and ``Range`` fields require an index on the server. The 
index is created by specifying the ``encryptedFields`` option in 
:method:`db.createCollection()`.

If your MongoDB instance enforces the encryption of specific fields, any
client performing {+qe+} with {+manual-enc+} must encrypt those fields
as specified. To learn how to set up server-side {+qe+}
enforcement, see :ref:`qe-fundamentals-encrypt-query`.
