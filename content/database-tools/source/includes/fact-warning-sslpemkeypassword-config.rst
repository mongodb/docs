.. warning::

   On some systems, a password provided directly using the
   :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword` option may be visible to system status
   programs such as ``ps`` that may be invoked by other users. Consider
   using the :option:`--config` option to specify a configuration file
   containing the password instead.
