Hashed indexes maintain entries with hashes of the values of the
indexed field. 

Hashed indexes support :doc:`sharding </sharding>`
using hashed shard keys. :ref:`Hashed based sharding
<sharding-hashed-sharding>` uses a hashed index of a field as the shard
key to partition data across your sharded cluster.

Using a hashed shard key to shard a collection results in a more random
distribution of data. See
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster-hashed-sharding` for more
details.

Hashing Function
----------------

Hashed indexes use a hashing function to compute the hash of the value
of the index field. [#hashvalue]_ The hashing function collapses
embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire value but does
not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes.

.. include:: /includes/tip-applications-do-not-need-to-compute-hashes.rst

.. [#hashvalue]
   Starting in version 4.0, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
   method :method:`convertShardKeyToHashed()`. This method uses the
   same hashing function as the hashed index and can be used to see
   what the hashed value would be for a key.

Create a Hashed Index
---------------------

To create a :ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>`, specify
``hashed`` as the value of the index key, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { _id: "hashed" } )


Considerations
--------------

MongoDB supports ``hashed`` indexes of any single field. The hashing
function collapses embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire
value, but does not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes.

You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields
or specify a unique constraint on a ``hashed`` index; however, you can
create both a ``hashed`` index and an ascending/descending (i.e.
non-hashed) index on the same field: MongoDB will use the scalar index
for range queries.
