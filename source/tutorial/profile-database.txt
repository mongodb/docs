A :manual:`database profiler </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
gathers statistics about writes, cursors, and commands on one running
|mongod| instance.

|mms| can collect and display statistics from any of your |mongod|
instances. The Query Profiler identifies slow queries based on 
:ref:`log data <mongodb-logs>` from your ``mongod`` instances. 
|mms| displays this data on an instance's :guilabel:`Profiler` page. 
To access an instance's metrics, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button 
for that instance.

The :guilabel:`Profiler` displays one aspect, like *Operation Execution
Time*, that could slow database operations over a set time frame. It
displays this data in both a chart and a table that each can filter on
aspect and time frame. The Profiler suggests indexes for your databases
to improve the performance of slow operations.

.. _considerations-profile-database:

Considerations
--------------

.. important:: Please read the following considerations before you enable profiling.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Profile data may include sensitive information including the content of
database queries. Ensure that exposing this data to |mms| is consistent
with your information security practices.

Data Display Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Query Profiler displays up to the limit that it reaches first:

- The most recent 10,000 operations, or
- The most recent 10MB of logs.

Monitoring tries to minimize its effect on the monitored systems.
If polling profile data slows database performance, |mms| throttles how
often it collects data.

|mms| displays no more than 10,000 data points in the :guilabel:`Profiler` charts.

Log data is processed in batches. Data can be delayed up to five minutes from real time.

Time to Propagate Changes to the {+mdbagent+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With profiling enabled, configuration changes made in |mms| can
take up to 2 minutes to propagate to the agent and 1 more minute before
profiling data appears in the |mms| interface.

Rolling Restart of ``mongod`` Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _enable-profiling-through-automation:
.. _enable-profiling-manually:

Enable Profiling
----------------

As of |mms| version 4.4, |mms| always enables profiling. Your
|mongod| instance collects profile data for operations longer than
the :ref:`slow operation threshold <slow-queries>` and
reports them to |mms|. The threshold for slow operations applies to the entire |mongod| instance. |mms| defaults this threshold to 100 ms.

.. _profiler-interface:

Profiler Interface
------------------

The Profiler has two sections to the page that display database profile
information: a chart and a table. Each can display different data.

.. _profiler-chart:

Profiling Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _profiler-chart-set-filter:

Set Chart Filters
`````````````````

Above the chart, select the metric and time period you want to see.

1. Select the metric from the :guilabel:`Display` menu. Accepted
   options are:

   - Operation Execution Time (default)
   - Keys Examined
   - Docs Returned
   - Examined:Returned Ratio
   - Num Yields
   - Response Length

#. Select the time period from the :guilabel:`View Last` menu.
   Accepted options are:

   - 24 hr (default)
   - 12 hr
   - 6 hr
   - 1 hr
   - 15 min

.. _profiler-chart-change-slow-ops-threshold:

Change Slow Operations Threshold
````````````````````````````````

To change the slow operations threshold:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Milliseconds` button to the right of the
   :guilabel:`For Operations Longer Than` label to open the
   :guilabel:`Specify the Threshold for Slow Operations` modal.

#. Change the :guilabel:`Set the Threshold for Slow Operations` to your
   desired number of milliseconds.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` if you want to change the threshold. Click
   :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without changing the
   threshold.

When you change the threshold, you change it for all databases on the
instance.

.. _profiler-table:
.. _profiler-table-set-filter:

Profiling Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Above the table, select the namespace, operation type, and metric you
wish to profile:

1. Click :guilabel:`All Namespaces` to change which combination of
   databases and collections to profile.

#. Click :guilabel:`All Operations` to change which operations you want
   to profile.

#. Click :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time` to change which metric
   you want to profile. Accepted options are:

   - Operation Execution Time (default)
   - Keys Examined
   - Docs Returned
   - Examined:Returned Ratio
   - Num Yields
   - Response Length
